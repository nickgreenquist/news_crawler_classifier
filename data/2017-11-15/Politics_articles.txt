Two U.S. Senate Republicans critical of party's tax plan:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate Republican tax plan that would repeal the Obamacare mandate and give permanent tax cuts only to U.S. corporations drew fire from two Republican lawmakers on Wednesday in what could be a sign of trouble for the sweeping measure.Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he would not support the current Senator proposal, or a separate tax bill being debated in the House of Representatives, because he believes they unfairly benefit corporations over other kinds of enterprises, including small businesses.Senator Susan Collins, one of three Republicans who opposed a Republican Obamacare repeal effort earlier this year, warned that some middle-income taxpayers could see tax cuts wiped out by higher health insurance premiums if the repeal of the Affordable Care Acts mandate goes through.Their views could signal problems for Senate Republicans, who want to pass tax legislation by December but can afford to lose no more than two votes from their ranks because they have only a 52-48 majority in the Senate.Democrats have called the Republican tax plans a giveaway to the rich and corporations.Neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current version, Johnson said in a statement, adding he would still work with his Republican colleagues to produce better legislation.Senate Republicans produced a new plan late on Tuesday that would guarantee permanent tax cuts for corporations but only temporarily lower tax bills for individuals and small businesses, while tying the overall package to an effective repeal of a key part of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law.Exposing the tax-cut initiative to the same political risks that wrecked a mid-2017 anti-Obamacare push by Republicans, Senate tax committee chief Orrin Hatch unveiled an amendment that he defended as helpful to the middle class.Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters that adding the mandate repeal was a mistake.This is going to be difficult and I just dont know why we had to complicate it by bringing up the ACA, she said.Several moderate Republicans including Collins and John McCain have not said if they support the tax plan.The new Republican plan, Hatch said at a committee meeting, would expand the child tax credit and slightly reduce some middle-class tax rates.Taken together, those changes will let us channel even more tax relief to the middle class, he said.But those changes would be temporary, while a deep cut in the corporate tax rate would be permanent under Hatchs plan, which was widely expected to become the main vehicle for Republicans efforts to revamp the tax code before year end.The effort is seen by Republicans as critical to their prospects of retaining power in Washington in the November 2018 congressional elections.So far, Republicans and President Donald Trump have no major legislative victories from 2017 to show voters despite controlling the White House and Congress.The Senate Finance Committee is seen during a markup on the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 15, 2017.REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein They are hoping the tax cut will fix that problem and have made progress in recent days while Trump toured Asian capitals.He returned late on Tuesday and was scheduled to meet with lawmakers on Thursday.The House began debating its tax bill on Wednesday, with a full vote expected on Thursday.The Senate and House tax plans must eventually be reconciled and merged into a final plan that can pass both chambers before it goes to Trump to sign into law.EXCLUDING DEMOCRATS Slideshow (8 Images) By including an effective repeal of Obamacares individual mandate, Senate Republicans likely ended any possibility of gaining support from Democrats.This is not just another garden variety attack on the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.This is repeal of that law, said Senator Ron Wyden, the finance committees top Democrat.He blasted Republicans for setting a double standard by guaranteeing permanent tax cuts only for corporations.The individual mandate clause of Obamacare requires healthy younger people to buy insurance or pay a federal penalty.The aim is to hold down coverage costs for those sick or older.By repealing that penalty, Republicans would raise more than $318 billion over a decade to pay for tax cuts, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan unit of Congress.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office separately estimated last week that repealing the mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027.Trump backed the inclusion of the mandate repeal in the tax bill, as do Republican conservatives in the Senate and House.U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday that while the House tax plan did not repeal the mandate, Republicans in that chamber would likely approve a final measure hammered out with the Senate that included it.Hatchs Senate plan would also expand access to deductions for pass-through businesses and increase the child tax credit to $2,000 from the earlier proposed $1,650.But those benefits would expire at the end of 2025.The changes would still allow the measure to comply with a deficit requirement that must be met if Senate Republicans are to pass the legislation with a simple majority.The Senate tax plan is required to add no more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the federal deficit and national debt.Otherwise, Senate Republicans would need 60 votes.
Sixth woman accuses U.S. Senate candidate Moore of sexual misconduct:::::(Reuters) - A sixth woman came forward on Wednesday with allegations of sexual misconduct against embattled Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, accusing him of groping her while she was in his Alabama law office on legal business in 1991, when he was married.Judge Roy Moore participates in the Mid-Alabama Republican Club's Veterans Day Program in Vestavia Hills, Alabama, U.S., November 11, 2017.REUTERS/Marvin Gentry Unlike the earlier cases that involved teenagers, Tina Johnson was an adult when she visited Moores office with her mother, who had hired Moore in a custody case involving Johnsons 12-year-old son.Johnson told AL.com, an Alabama news website, that Moore grabbed her buttocks as she left.He didnt pinch it, he grabbed it, Johnson, who was 28 at the time, told AL.com.Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegation, and Moores campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Five other women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct or of dating them when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers, prompting a wave of demands from national Republican Party leaders that he drop out of the Dec. 12 special Senate election to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was named U.S. attorney general last spring.Moore, 70, on Wednesday denied the allegations of the first five women to step forward.We are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin and motivation, he said in a statement.Moore also said he believed a message that one of the accusers, Beverly Young Nelson, said he had written in her high school yearbook had been tampered with.Nelson accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s.Nelson displayed the yearbook message at a news conference in New York where she made the allegations on Monday.Moores campaign on Wednesday demanded that Nelson turn over the yearbook to a neutral custodian so a handwriting expert could examine it.Republican leaders in Washington have asked Moore to withdraw from the race and said they are exploring write-in options for the election.The Alabama state partys leadership was meeting on Wednesday night to discuss their stance.U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has spoken to President Donald Trump and others about the situation.Trump appeared at the White House on Wednesday but did not make any mention of Moore.Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot.If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore.Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney.But a new poll on Wednesday, released by the Senate Republicans campaign arm, had Jones surging to a 12-point lead since the allegations surfaced.A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trumps agenda and shift the political outlook for next years congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at wiping out the Republicans 52-48 Senate majority.Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans are working in tandem with news media to discredit him.The Washington Post had first disclosed allegations by four women about their relationships with Moore when they were teenagers, ranging in age from 14 to 18.One of the women said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 and Moore was in his 30s.
U.S. Justice Dept eyes spring to release findings on FBI handling of Clinton email probe:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The internal watchdog at the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday he hopes to complete his review by early spring into whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation erred when it announced it was reopening its investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clintons emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election.FILE PHOTO: A general view of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) building in Washington, U.S. May 9, 2017.REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo We have interviewed dozens of people.We are not at the 100 level yet, but were in the dozens range.Weve reviewed about 1.2 million records in the course of the investigation, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said, in testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives panel.We are aiming to release the report in late winter/early spring, so hopefully in that March-April time period.After a deluge of congressional requests, Horowitzs office earlier this year announced it would review the pre-election decision-making at the FBI.At the heart of the review is whether former FBI Director James Comey improperly made a series of public statements about the status of the bureaus investigation into Clintons use of a private email server for official correspondence while she was Secretary of State.Comey, who was fired in May by U.S. President Donald Trump, had also led an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.The FBI does not typically discuss its investigations publicly.In the case of Clinton, however, Comey decided in July 2016 to hold a press conference and explain why the FBI had declined to refer Clinton for prosecution.He said at the time her actions were careless, but did not rise to criminal behavior.Comey in October 2016 sent Congress a letter saying the FBI needed to re-open its investigation after it uncovered new emails on the computer of former Representative Anthony Weiner, who had been married to one Clintons top aides.Then on Nov. 6, 2016 - two days before the presidential election - Comey said the FBI had not uncovered any new evidence.Comeys various public disclosures stirred a lot of controversy with some questioning whether he had violated the Hatch Act, which bars government employees from interfering with U.S. elections.Republicans have also complained about why former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not recuse herself from the matter after it was revealed she had met with former President Bill Clinton on board a plane while the investigation was still ongoing.The issues have recently prompted a handful of committees in the Republican-led U.S. Congress to open their own reviews into the same set of facts being probed by Horowitzs office.
Republicans press U.S.-Russia uranium deal probe despite no wrongdoing findings:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers are pressing forward with an investigation into the 2010 sale of a Canadian uranium company, which owned 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies, to a Russian government firm, despite five congressional inquiries having found no evidence of wrongdoing.Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes (R-CA) speaks during a presser in Capitol Hill, Washington, U.S., October 24, 2017.REUTERS/Carlos Barria Copies of letters by the heads of two U.S. House of Representatives committees released on Wednesday showed they were seeking documents and other material on the deal from the FBI, the Treasury and State Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.The letters set a deadline of Nov. 30.Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, opened investigations on Oct. 24 into the agreement struck during the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat.The committees have questions ... about the review and approval of the sale of Uranium One - which owned 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies - by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, according to the letters.The committees also want to know if the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering, the letters said.Although Hillary Clinton was not mentioned by name, the letters reflect unsubstantiated allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers, and right-wing media that the 2016 Democratic nominee masterminded the approval of the sale in return for donations to the Clinton Foundation.Five committees in the U.S. House and Senate found no evidence that Clinton was behind the CFIUS approval of the deal, according to congressional records.In Twitter posts, Trump has called for an investigation of the sale, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday he is evaluating whether to appoint a special counsel.Democrats and other critics say the allegations are baseless, and that Trump and his supporters are fanning them to distract attention from Special Counsel Robert Muellers probe into whether there was any collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia.While Clinton was Secretary of State at the time of the sale, her department has only one of nine votes on CFIUS, which is chaired by the Treasury Department and approved the sale unanimously.In addition, the State Department CFIUS seat was occupied not by her, but by Jose Fernandez, then-assistant secretary for economic, energy, and business affairs, who has said Clinton played no role in the decision.The sale also was approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Obama.In a related development, Representative Elijah Cummings, the top oversight committee Democrat, objected on Wednesday to the Republicans refusal to give Democrats access to an unidentified FBI informant whom Republican lawmakers say has new evidence in the case.In a letter to Gowdy, Cummings said Republican lawmaker Ron DeSantis told Fox News on Oct. 22 that he thought the informant could link the approval of the Uranium One sale to millions of dollars that sources connected to Uranium One donated to the Clinton Foundation.
Trump to tap nuclear industry lobbyist for U.S. Energy Dept job:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to nominate Melissa Burnison, a nuclear energy industry lobbyist, to serve as assistant secretary in charge of congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the U.S. Energy Department, the White House said on Wednesday.Burnison is currently director of federal programs for the Nuclear Energy Institute, where she plans, directs and executes legislative strategies for nuclear energy programs and policies on behalf of the nuclear energy industry, the White House said in a statement.Previously, she was a senior adviser at the Energy Department and at the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, where she advanced legislation to expand U.S. energy production and jobs, the statement said.
More worries in Congress over cuts at U.S. State Department:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior U.S. senators asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday to explain questionable management practices at his department that they believe are weakening the countrys diplomatic power, adding to a chorus of concern in Congress.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends as U.S. President Donald Trump holds a bilateral meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi alongside the ASEAN Summit in Manila, Philippines November 13, 2017.REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen delivered a letter to Tillerson asking him to begin consulting with lawmakers on decisions that have an impact on recruiting, retaining and staffing the State Department, removing a hiring freeze and resuming promotions.McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Shaheen is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committees subcommittee on State Department management.While we support reasonable steps to improve the efficiency of the State Department, such efforts must be fully transparent, with the objective of enhancing, not diminishing, American diplomacy, the senators wrote.They said declining morale, recruitment and retention of staff, a lack of experienced leadership and reports that diplomacy is becoming less effective paint a disturbing picture.Many members of Congress, Democrats as well as some of President Donald Trumps fellow Republicans, have rejected Trumps proposal to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent.Tillerson has embraced the plan, and imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agencys operations and deciding how to reorganize them.On Tuesday, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee both blasted the agency for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed organization.The panels top Democrat, Senator Ben Cardin, reiterated his concerns on Wednesday.Our national security is being jeopardized by the employment and career decisions being made at the State Department, he told reporters.It was not immediately clear how lawmakers could press the administration to change its policies, especially because Trumps fellow Republicans, most of whom vote consistently with the president, hold majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.A State Department representative said the department had received the letter and would appropriately respond.Tillerson has said his reorganization plan aimed to increase efficiency and to cut costs, with a target of saving at least 10 percent, or about $5 billion, over the next five years from fiscal-year 2017 levels.Cardin said the impact of disorganization at the State Department was being felt internationally.I could mention almost every place in the world, he said.
House could pass tax reform if Senate adds health mandate repeal: Ryan:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives could vote to pass a tax reform bill that also repeals the Obamacare health insurance mandate if the Senate includes the provision in its final version of the plan, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday.U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks during a news conference after Republican weekly conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 14, 2017.REUTERS/Yuri Gripas In an interview on CNBC television, Ryan said House Republicans had not included such a repeal in its own bill and was waiting to see whether the Senate had the votes to approve a tax package that repeals the mandate, which requires Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.
Trump administration releases rules on disclosing cyber flaws:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration publicly released on Wednesday its rules for deciding whether to disclose cyber security flaws or keep them secret, in an effort to bring more transparency to a process that has long been cloaked in mystery.FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken on March 1, 2017.REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo The move is an attempt by the U.S. government to address criticism that it too often jeopardizes internet security by stockpiling the cyber vulnerabilities it detects in order to preserve its ability to launch its own attacks on computer systems.The revised rules, published on whitehouse.gov, are intended to shed light on the process for how various federal agencies weigh the costs of keeping a flaw secret, said Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator.Speaking at an Aspen Institute event in Washington, Joyce said the rules were the most sophisticated in the world and that they set the United States apart from most other nations.Private companies, he said, are not getting tips from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran about flaws in their technology.Under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. government created an inter-agency review, known as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, to determine what to do with flaws unearthed primarily by intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA).The process is designed to balance law enforcement and U.S. intelligence desires to hack into devices with the need to warn manufacturers so that they can patch holes before criminals and other hackers take advantage of them.The new Trump administration charter on the process explains how it functions and names the agencies involved in the vulnerability reviews.They include intelligence agencies in addition to several civilian departments, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, Energy and State.The NSA is listed as the executive secretariat of the inter-agency group, tasked with coordinating debate over flaws submitted by the various agencies if there is disagreement about whether to disclose them.If disagreements are not reconciled the group will vote on whether to disclose or retain the flaw.The rules also require an annual report, portions of which will be made public, that provides metrics about the amount of flaws discovered, retained and disclosed.Decisions to retain vulnerabilities must be reconsidered every year, according to the charter.The publication of the charter is a major improvement, said Ari Scwhartz, coordinator of the Coalition for Cybersecurity Policy and Law and a former Obama administration cyber official.The Obama administration sought to release a similar document before the end of last year but ran out of time, Schwartz said.Some security experts have long criticized the process as overly secretive and too often erring against disclosure.Joyce said on Wednesday more than 90 percent of flaws are ultimately disclosed, though some critics say they are not shared quickly enough and that the most severe flaws are too often stockpiled.The criticism grew earlier this year when a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry infected computers in at least 150 countries, knocking hospitals offline and disrupting services at factories.The attack was made possible because of a flaw in Microsofts Windows software that the NSA had used to build a hacking tool for its own use.But in a breach U.S. investigators are still working to understand, that tool and others ended up in the hands of a mysterious group called the Shadow Brokers, which then published them online.Suspected North Korean hackers spotted the Windows flaw and repurposed it to unleash the WannaCry attack, according to cyber experts.North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries.Asked about the WannaCry attack, Joyce declined to say whether the Windows flaw detected by the NSA went through the vulnerability review process.

Senate leaders look to work with White House to block Moore:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins a special election in Alabama.Speaking to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell said he had been in contact with President Donald Trump and others about sexual misconduct allegations against Moore.Hes obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate, McConnell said, and weve looked at all the options to try and prevent that from happening.Five women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct stemming from when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers.Moore, now 70, has denied the allegations.Trump returns to Washington on Tuesday evening from a 12-day trip to Asia, and McConnell said he planned to discuss Moores situation with the president.Both are Republicans.McConnell said he had also spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly about Moore.Trump supported Moores opponent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary but threw his support to Moore after Strange was defeated.McConnell said Republicans were still considering having a candidate launch a write-in campaign against Moore for the Dec. 12 special election.Speculation has centered on Strange and the current U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as possibilities.McConnell said later in the day that Sessions, who left the Senate seat to become attorney general, would be a plausible write-in candidate.He fits the mold of somebody who might be able to pull off a write-in, the majority leader said during a forum on the economy.Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney.A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trumps agenda and shift the political outlook for next years congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate.VERY COMPLICATED Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot.Obviously this close to the election, its a very complicated matter, McConnell said earlier.Judge Roy Moore speaks as he participates in the Mid-Alabama Republican Club's Veterans Day Program in Vestavia Hills, Alabama, U.S., November 11, 2017.REUTERS/Marvin Gentry Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans were working in tandem with news media to discredit him.After McConnells remarks, Moore responded by tweeting: The good people of Alabama, not the Washington elite who wallow in the swamp, will decide this election!McConnell urged Moore on Monday to leave the race, while Senator Cory Gardner, who chairs the Republican Partys Senate campaign arm, suggested the Senate should expel Moore should he continue campaigning and win.The Republican National Committee has withdrawn its support for Moore, according to a Federal Election Commission filing on Tuesday, after the partys Senate campaign wing, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, ended a fundraising deal with him on Friday.In Birmingham, Alabama, Jones told reporters his campaign had no plans to directly attack Moore over the allegations in a bid to capitalize on the furor.Slideshow (5 Images) Were going to stay in our lane.Were going to talk about the issues that we continue to talk about, he said.We will bring up his record, his previous record, other people will bring up the issues of the day.And people will have a choice.Jones campaign released a new ad on Tuesday featuring Republican voters who say they are backing the Democrat.Im a Republican, but Roy Moore - no way, one voter says in the ad.The national Democratic Party, however, has yet to invest directly in the race beyond funds to build the state party, and has not changed that stance since the Moore allegations surfaced.Earlier in the day, Sessions said in testimony before Congress that he had no reason to doubt the five women who have accused Moore of misconduct when they were in their teens.The House of Representatives top Republican, Speaker Paul Ryan, said he believed Moores accusers and that Moore should leave the race.If he cares about the values and people he claims to care about, then he should step aside, Ryan told a news conference.On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson became the fifth woman to accuse Moore of misconduct, saying he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s.Moore said on Monday that Nelsons accusations were absolutely false.Moore has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations and accusations.
Roy Moore's lawyer casts doubt on yearbook inscription:::::Story highlights Moore's attorney, Phillip L. Jauregui, specifically focused on pushing back on the accusation from Beverly Young Nelson Jauregui says Nelson falsely claimed that she never spoke to Moore again after the time of her alleged assault Moore denies writing the yearbook inscription Jauregui adds that Moore's lawyers have tasked a handwriting expert with evaluating the yearbook Washington (CNN) Former Judge Roy Moore continues to deny allegations of sexual abuse against him, his attorney Phillip L. Jauregui said at a news conference Wednesday, during which he attempted to cast doubt on the story of one of Moore's accusers.Jauregui specifically focused on pushing back on the accusation from Beverly Young Nelson, 56, who said on Monday that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old.Jauregui took issue with the statements of Nelson and her attorney Gloria Allred, saying Nelson falsely claimed that she never spoke to Moore again after the time of her alleged assault."As it turns out, in 1999, Ms. Nelson filed a divorce action against her then-husband, Mr. Harris," Jauregui said."Guess who that case was before?It was filed in Etowah County, and the judge assigned was Roy S. Moore, circuit judge of Etowah County.There was contact."The nature of the divorce case that the Moore campaign raised is unclear, and Jauregui did not elaborate on how much Moore himself was involved.Nelson said on Monday that Moore wrote an inscription in her yearbook one day in December 1977 that said, "To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.'"She said he signed it "Roy Moore, D.A."Read More
Has Trump weighed in on Roy Moore yet?:::::Since returning to the US from his Asia trip days hours minutes seconds (CNN) President Donald Trump is not known for being shy when it comes to hot-button political questions.But he's been unusually quiet, or circumspect, when it comes the scandal enveloping Alabama Republican Roy Moore's Senate campaign.On Thursday afternoon, November 9, The Washington Post published a report detailing allegations that Moore, the Republican nominee, pursued sexual relationships with teenage women when he was in his early thirties.One of them, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 years old when Moore, then 32, initiated sexual contact with her.Three others told the Post that Moore had sought them out when they were teens.On Monday, another Alabama woman came forward and accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16.Moore has denied it all and has vowed to carry on with his campaign.The special election is slated for December 12.The question now, as the Republican establishment backs away from Moore , is whether Trump will do the same.The White House responded last week by saying, in part, that the President "believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."Read More
Congress told Trump dossier sources not paid:::::Washington (CNN) The ex-British intelligence agent who authored the opposition research dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia did not pay the sources he used to compile the document, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson testified to congressional Russia investigators, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.In nearly seven hours of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Simpson defended the Trump opposition research dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, arguing that nothing from the dossier had been disproven and some of it had been corroborated, the sources said.Republicans on the committee pushed back during the interview that many details in the dossier have not been verified -- they said that it's often difficult, if not impossible, to prove a negative, according to the sources.Simpson added that he is still in regular contact with Steele, who has yet to cooperate with congressional investigators.Simpson's testimony is the latest volley in the swirl of controversy surrounding the Steele dossier, which has been slammed as a "hoax" by the President.Trump and his Republican allies have seized upon the disclosure last month that law firm Perkins Coie paid for the dossier on behalf of its clients, the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, arguing it shows the dossier is a Democratic effort to undermine Trump."Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier.The victim here is the President," Trump tweeted last month.The broad assertion of the dossier findings -- that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election -- is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community.CNN also reported earlier this year that US investigators have corroborated some aspects of the dossier, specifically that some of the communications among foreign nationals mentioned in the memos did actually take place.The FBI also used some information as part of its justification to obtain a surveillance warrant on Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, CNN has reported.But federal investigators have not verified the dossier's most salacious allegations.Several of the Trump associates named in the dossier have disputed allegations made about them in the dossier, including Page and Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen.Cohen has pointed to the allegation in the dossier that he traveled to Prague, Czech Republic, in August 2016 to meet with Russian officials, saying he never made a trip there.No evidence has emerged to support the claim Cohen traveled to Prague in August 2016.The Steele memos also accuse Page of meeting with the president of the Russian state-run oil giant Rosneft.He vehemently denies ever meeting that official, Igor Sechin, though he acknowledged in testimony earlier this month that he met with a different executive from Rosneft.After publishing the dossier, BuzzFeed was sued by Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian CEO who is named in the document.Gubarev denied the claims made about him in the dossier.BuzzFeed redacted Gubarev's name from its published version of the dossier and issued an apology for including it shortly after the lawsuit was filed.California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, argued that the key conclusion from the Steele dossier has been proven, despite the White House's attacks."The reality is that on the most important conclusion of the dossier and Christopher Steele -- that is that the Russians were actively intervening in the election to help Donald Trump -- that conclusion has now been borne out, and Christopher Steele found evidence of that before our own intelligence agencies potentially were aware of that," Schiff said.Republicans were pressing to learn who funded the Steele dossier, and the House Intelligence Committee is still battling with Fusion GPS in court over the firm's bank records.Simpson's testimony before the panel seemed unlikely only a week ago in response to the committee's subpoena, as two other Fusion GPS partners had invoked their constitutional rights not to answer questions from Congress.But Simpson and the committee struck an agreement last week for him to testify voluntarily, so long as he maintained his right not to answer questions that would violate confidentiality agreements with clients.The sources said Simpson was initially hesitant to answer the committee's questions, but he eventually opened up with his responses.Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the committee's Russia probe, said there were still some questions he declined to answer involving specific names."There were things that he was unwilling to answer based on a confidentiality agreement with his client," Conaway said."And because it was on a voluntary basis, we couldn't push the issue."A Fusion GPS spokesperson referred questions about Simpson's testimony to a statement the group's lawyer issued Tuesday evening, saying Simpson is cooperating with the three congressional committees investigating Russian meddling.Joshua Levy, a lawyer for Fusion GPS, said in a statement that "Mr. Simpson and Fusion GPS are proud to have maintained the confidentiality of their clients throughout this past year in the face of false accusations and pressure to violate that obligation.""The White House and its political allies have attempted at every turn to smear Fusion GPS because of its connection to the Steele dossier, whose findings are the subject of multiple investigations into the Trump campaign's collusion with the Russians," Levy said.The court fight is still ongoing, with Fusion GPS, TD Bank and House lawyers appearing in federal court Wednesday afternoon.Judge Richard Leon is weighing whether the court should stop the bank from releasing Fusion GPS' financial information to Congress.Leon encouraged Fusion GPS, TD Bank and the House to unseal more of their case and make it available to the public and set a time for them to argue over the subpoena on November 30.In late October, the House intelligence committee, led by Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican, subpoenaed TD Bank for all financial records related to Fusion GPS.The political intelligence firm balked at the breadth of the request.Two Fusion GPS clients -- the Democratic Party's law firm Perkins Coie and the right-leaning news organization the Washington Free Beacon -- then revealed themselves as funding opposition research on Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.Fusion GPS said it paid Steele $168,000 for his work on the dossier that's become a focal point of questions related to Trump and the investigation into the campaign's collusion with Russia.Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier.The fight over the bank's release of records resurfaced on November 3, when Fusion GPS said the House committee again asked for more than a quarter of the 400 bank records, including information about any law firms, media companies and journalists with which it worked.More specific details about the House's request and its response to the renewed lawsuit are still under seal with the court.UPDATE: This story has been updated with Rep. Schiff's comments.
DOJ probe on Russian trades through Deutsche Bank quiet:::::Washington (CNN) A Justice Department investigation into Deutsche Bank's role in a $10 billion Russian money laundering scheme has gone dormant months after the bank settled with regulators, according to people with direct knowledge of the investigation.DOJ's money laundering division along with the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York have been investigating the German lender over allegations it missed red flags that allowed Russians to launder billions of dollars out of Moscow using an elaborate trading scheme.The bank has paid over $670 million in civil penalties to US and UK regulators this year relating to the Russian trades and disclosed in regulatory filings as recently as last month that it set aside an undisclosed amount to cover a potential settlement with DOJ.It is common for regulators and DOJ to move to settle cases at the same time, which companies often advocate for so they can put the matter behind them.The DOJ investigation has been closely watched by Democrats on Capitol Hill who have tried and failed to get Deutsche Bank to turn over its internal investigation into the Russian trades and a separate internal review into whether bank accounts of President Donald Trump and his family have any ties to Russia.The Deutsche Bank civil settlement has no connection to bank accounts held by the President or Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and White House senior adviser Criminal investigations like the one facing Deutsche Bank can span months or years before resolutions are reached or DOJ determines there is not a case.Prosecutors have not made requests for information or witness testimony in several months leaving some people familiar with the investigation wondering about the status.There have also been no settlement talks between the sides despite the bank indicating it is prepared to pay a fine to settle the investigation.While the investigation appears to have slowed down, it could be revived at any time.Representatives from the US attorney's office in Manhattan and DOJ declined to comment.A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment.Multiple investigations by congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are looking broadly into Russia's possible interference with the US election including money transfers.It is not clear whether Mueller has taken an interest in the Russia trades.It is not clear why the DOJ investigation appears to have slowed, but it comes as senior positions within DOJ have not been filled with permanent appointees and as top agency officials have signaled they are rethinking department policy toward corporate prosecutions.Under the Obama administration, financial institutions paid hundreds of billions of dollars in fines in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis.The DOJ had reversed decades of tradition by requiring banks to plead guilty to criminal charges ranging from market manipulation to sanctions violations.In September, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Heritage Foundation that DOJ is reviewing its stance toward corporate prosecutions."Corporations of course don't go to prison.They do pay a fine.And so the issue is: Can you effectively deter corporate crime by prosecuting corporations or do you in some circumstances need to prosecute individuals?I think you do," according to a transcript posted on C-SPAN He added, "I do anticipate we may in the near future make an announcement about what changes we're going to make to the corporate fraud principles."Democrats have focused on the bank since the election."Deutsche Bank's pattern of involvement in money laundering schemes with primarily Russian participation, its unconventional relationship with the President, and its repeated violations of US banking laws, all raise serious questions about whether the Bank's reported reviews of the trading scheme and Trump's financial ties to Russia were completely thorough," according to a letter sent in May by California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, and four other Democrats.Deutsche Bank has been a key lender to Trump businesses when other major banks have balked.Trump businesses have borrowed over $300 million for a Florida golf course and hotels in Chicago and Washington DC, according to financial disclosures and public filings from 2012 to 2015.Kushner disclosed an unsecured line of credit from the bank ranging between $5 million to $25 million that he shares jointly with his mother since 2015.The White House did not comment.A spokesman for Kushner declined comment.A March letter by the same Democrats asking Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Financial Services Committee's Republican chairman, to subpoena the bank said, "We are concerned about the integrity of this criminal probe and whether senior bank officials will be held accountable given the President's ongoing conflicts of interest with Deutsche Bank."In July, Waters used a procedural move to try to force Hensarling to subpoena the bank but the motion was voted down.Deutsche Bank has declined to provide the Democrats information citing privacy laws.In a June letter, lawyers for the bank wrote, "We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that Deutsche Bank freely may reveal confidential financial information in response to requests from individual Members of Congress."In September, when Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan was asked by CNBC whether the bank has heard from Mueller he said, "We think we said we wouldn't comment any further on that investigation."Asked generally about US inquiries into possible Russian interference and loans extended to the Trump family, Cryan said, "I think we have agreed we wouldn't comment on that matter other than to say if we do receive a request potentially in the form of a subpoena, but there are other forms of formal request by which we're bound, then of course we will cooperate fully with any official investigation."Deutsche Bank disclosed the Russian trading scheme in July 2015 when it said it was conducting an internal investigation into trades through the bank's Moscow desk that passed through New York and London.The bank said it brought the issue to the attention of regulators and law enforcement in the US, Germany, Russia and the UK.In late January, Deutsche Bank paid $630 million to settle civil claims by New York's Department of Financial Services and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority over the alleged conduct that spanned from 2011 until early 2015.In May, it paid $41 million to the Federal Reserve.The New York state regulators alleged in the consent order that they found "serious compliance deficiencies" that "spanned Deutsche Bank's global enterprise.These flaws allowed a corrupt group of bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by conscripting Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to their improper purpose."The regulator added, "Deutsche Bank has represented that it has been unable to identify the actual purpose behind this scheme.It is obvious, though, that the scheme could have facilitated capital flight, tax evasion, or other potentially illegal objectives."The bank said in its October filing that it "continues to cooperate with regulators and law enforcement authorities, including the DOJ, which has its own ongoing investigation into these securities trades."The investigation is one of the last remaining major liabilities hanging over the bank, which has moved under Cryan to resolve open investigations and shift the bank's focus toward growing its business.
Review of FBI's action during election coming next year:::::Washington (CNN) A watchdog review of how the FBI handled its investigation into then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is on track for release next March or April, Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz said Wednesday.The inspector general gave no clues in Wednesday's appearance before the House oversight committee hinting at what the report would conclude.But he said the review is "moving along quite expeditiously."Horowitz opened the probe in mid-January -- prior to President Donald Trump's inauguration -- when James Comey was still FBI director and when questions were still fresh about Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.Horowitz indicated at the time it would be a wide-ranging look at multiple ways the Justice Department and FBI may have impacted the election, including potentially improper disclosures of information and the bureau's decision, days before the election, to release documents on a controversial pardon issued nearly 16 years earlier by Clinton's husband, President Bill Clinton.But no doubt central to the probe will be Comey's multiple announcements about Clinton's emails.In July 2016, he announced he would not recommend charges against Clinton.In late October -- less than two weeks before the election -- he notified Congress that the FBI obtained emails it previously did not have and would re-open the investigation.Read More
Roy Moore's appalling 'yearbook' defense:::::(CNN) Roy Moore faces accusations from five women that he pursued sexual relationships with them -- and in one case engaged in sexual assault -- while they were between 14 and 18 years old and he was in his mid 30s.His latest defense against these serious charges?The inscription from Beverly Young Nelson's 1977 high school yearbook is a fake!Moore attorney Phil Jauregui demanded that Nelson, who earlier this week alleged that Moore tried to push her head into his lap in a parked car when she was 16, release the yearbook so tests could be conducted to see if the inscription -- "To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas'" -- is real or forged."We'll find out: is it genuine, or is it a fraud?"Jauregui said, noting that Moore's campaign had hired a handwriting expert to examine the inscription.So, this is where we are.Moore, facing calls from all sides to step aside for the good of party, is pinning his defense on the idea that -- for some still unknown reason -- Nelson forged his signature on her high school yearbook.Read More
Lawmakers raise State Dept. staffing concerns with Tillerson:::::Washington (CNN) Senators John McCain and Jeanne Shaheen warned Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday that recent staffing decisions at the US State Department could "threaten to undermine the long-term health and effectiveness of American diplomacy."In a letter to Tillerson , the Republican and Democrat lawmakers expressed concerns over a recent halt in the hiring of new foreign service officers -- a move they say will result in a lack of experienced personnel in the future.McCain and Shaheen recommended that Tillerson take the following actions: Last week, the head of an organization representing US diplomats around the world excoriated the State Department's leadership in a letter , saying the agency's senior tiers "are being depleted at a dizzying speed," resulting in "a decapitation of its leadership ranks."Amb.Barbara Stephenson, president of the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), a union for US foreign service personnel, wrote the letter for the December issue of the group's publication."While I do my best, as principal advocate for our institution and as a seasoned American diplomat, to model responsible, civil discourse," she wrote, "there is simply no denying the warning signs that point to mounting threats to our institution -- and to the global leadership that depends on us."Career ambassadors are the most elite US diplomats in the foreign service.Fewer than 60 individuals have attained the rank since it was instituted in 1955.Of the five people who held the rank at the beginning of the administration, three have since retired.In her letter, Stephenson lamented the department's partial hiring freeze, which has slowed the intake of junior foreign service officers."As the shape and extent of the staffing cuts to the Foreign Service at State become clearer," Stephenson wrote, "I believe we must shine a light on these disturbing trends and ask 'why?'and 'to what end?'"Stephenson did not single out Tillerson or President Donald Trump in the letter, but said that "the need to make the case for the Foreign Service with fellow Americans and our elected representatives has taken on a new urgency."The State Department is attributing the recent dip to its ongoing reorganization effort.
Ivanka Trump slams Roy Moore over allegations:::::Story highlights Ivanka Trump spoke out against Roy Moore The Senate candidate has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenage women Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump spoke out for the first time against embattled Alabama Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his early thirties.Her father, President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has largely stayed mum on the issue."There's a special place in hell for people who prey on children," Trump told The Associated Press in an interview otherwise focused on tax reform published Wednesday."I've yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts," the first daughter and presidential adviser said.However, according to the report, Trump did not explicitly call for Moore to drop out of the race.Alabamans head to the polls December 12, and Moore has given no indication he will step aside.Trump, who has been focused on tax reform in recent weeks, has also made women's economic empowerment central to her West Wing portfolio.This is the first time she has spoken out specifically about Moore, as allegations of sexual harassment by powerful men have dominated the news cycle in recent weeks.Read More
Special-interest wins in the tax bill include sparkling wine, jets, the unborn:::::(CNN) On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled the latest version of a GOP tax plan, which includes a proposal to repeal Obamacare's requirement that most people have health care coverage or pay a fine.That's the most notable new provision in the revised tax overhaul, but it is far from the only one.Indeed, this latest plan includes a number of modifications and potential sweeteners for lawmakers and industries.Many of these goodies have been lobbied for over years and narrowly appeal to specific states or interest groups.Others are meant to address fallout from the unveiling of the separate bill being considered by the House of Representatives (the two will eventually have to be reconciled).Some industry groups and business leaders spoke out against what they perceive to be harmful changes to the tax code.Below are some of the more obscure amendments in the latest Senate bill.No tax deductions on sexual harassment settlements This revision comes as Capitol Hill reckons with its own handling of sexual harassment and assault cases.Under the current tax code, many payouts and legal fees resulting from these types of cases can be written off as business expenses.Under the new proposal, "no deduction is allowed for any settlement, payout, or attorney fees related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse if such payments are subject to a nondisclosure agreement."A similar amendment was introduced to the House version of the bill by Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck, who said in a press release that the modification is meant to eliminate "the business expense deduction for hush money associated with sexual assault and sexual harassment cases."Citrus growers can deduct the cost of replanting trees The modifications text has one change that is popular in Florida.Citrus plants lost or damaged due to causes like freezing, natural disaster or disease can be deducted under the new bill.This deduction currently exists for farmers of other plants, but not tree-growers.The Senate bill modification gives the deduction to citrus growers.Rights for the unborn As does the House version of the plan , the Senate proposal includes a definition of an unborn child and stipulates that they are eligible for a college savings account.For the purposes of opening a 529 saving account, the text reads, "an unborn child means a child in utero, and the term child in utero means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb."Currently, even without a change to the tax code, parents can open 529 accounts in their own names before children are born and change the beneficiaries at a later time.There are no tax consequences for changing the beneficiary to another family member, according to the IRS.Anti-abortion-rights groups had praised the similar House provision."A child in the womb is just as human as you or I, yet until now the U.S. tax code has failed to acknowledge the unborn child -- all while granting tax breaks for those seeking an abortion under the pretense of 'health care,'" said Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, in a statement.Abortion rights advocates, however, slammed the both the Senate and House provisions, charging they would result in restricting access to abortion."Asserting an anti-abortion provision under the guise of college affordability is a new low even for this anti-choice GOP," NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement."The sole purpose of this provision is to codify the radical, anti-choice idea that life begins at conception into law and begin the process of banning abortion altogether."Wine and beer The bill makes extensive modifications to the taxation of alcohol.It lowers a tax on barrels of beer brewed or imported.It also changes how aging periods for beer, wine and spirits are deducted.A tax credit on wine production limited to small domestic producers is extended to all wineries, and sparkling wine producers and importers become eligible for the credit as well.Taxes are also lowered on certain kinds of beverages, like mead.Lower taxes on storing and staffing private jets Payments by aircraft owners to companies that manage aircraft are made exempt from certain transportation taxes.Aircraft management companies perform services like storage, maintenance and fueling, and hiring and operating crew.Aircraft hangars will be cheaper to manage with the changes of the bill.For years, aircraft industry leaders have asked lawmakers to eliminate management fee taxes paid by private jet owners Child tax credit expansion The latest revisions increase the child tax credit to $2,000 from $1,650 in the original proposal and $1,000 in current law.The amendment was filed by Sens.Dean Heller of Nevada and Tim Scott of South Carolina."We set out to ensure that tax reform would help hardworking American families, and an increased child tax credit will do just that," Scott said in a statement ."As the child of a single mother, I truly can't overstate how important these dollars will be for parents across the country, be it to help buy school supplies, a new pair of sneakers or just have a night out as a family.I want to thank my colleagues for their important work on this issue."Sens.Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah, both of whom had advocated for an increase, praised the move.The inclusion of the amendment is also a win for first daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka Trump, who had pushed for the expansion of the tax credit as one of her key policy positions.Education expenses are back Stock options for start-ups
DHS inspector general slams air marshal program:::::Washington (CNN) A review of the air marshals program reveals how Transportation Security Administration "money gets wasted basically fighting the last war," its watchdog said Wednesday.Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth told Congress its recent review of the $800 million-per-year program found that TSA doesn't make budget decisions based on its analyses of potential risks."So things that are low-risk, for example, still, notwithstanding the change in the risk environment or the intelligence that they receive with regard to terrorist activity, their budget does not change in accordance with that," Roth said.An unspecified part of the air marshal program could be "discontinued" and its "funds could be put to better use," according to a brief, two-paragraph unclassified statement released publicly last month.The full report remains classified.The TSA did not respond to a request for comment on the report or Roth's comments.Read More
Army chief of staff: Army has made a "significant amount of omissions" in relaying criminal information to firearms database:::::Story highlights Gen. Mark Milley: "There are gaps and failures on our part to report into the FBI" On the percentage of cases upreported: "It's probably in the 10 to 20% of all cases."(CNN) The chief of staff of the Army, Gen. Mark Milley, said Wednesday that the Army had made a "significant amount of omissions" following a review launched in the wake of revelations that Texas church shooter Devin Kelley's military criminal history was not properly relayed by the Air Force to the appropriate databases, which would have prevented Kelley from purchasing a firearm."There are gaps and failures on our part to report into the FBI; not just the FBI but other law enforcement agencies," Milley told reporters at the Pentagon."The data I saw, and again we are drilling into it to make sure it's accurate, we have a significant amount of omissions that concern the secretary and I, and it clearly tells us that we need to tighten up as well," Milley said."It's not just an Air Force problem, this is a problem across all the services where we have gaps in reporting criminal activity of people in service when they're convicted or they get a dishonorable discharge, those sorts of things, and getting that over to the appropriate law enforcement agencies," he added.Milley said that in addition to bad conduct discharges like the one Kelley received, dishonorable discharges, which involve serious crimes and number about 150 cases per year, are required to be reported.Read More
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson comes out against tax bill:::::Story highlights Republicans can only lose two senators and still pass their tax plan in the Senate Johnson cited concerns with the way the Senate's bill treats pass-through entities (CNN) Sen. Ron Johnson announced he is opposed to the tax bill Wednesday, making him the first member of the GOP to formally come out against the party's plan, though the Wisconsin Republican said he was hopeful about being able to support a final version once changes are made.Johnson issued a statement saying the current proposal in both chambers is imbalanced in favor of large corporations but he left open the door to supporting the bills if they are altered."Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions," he said."I do, however, look forward to working with my colleagues to address the disparity so I can support the final version."Johnson also told The Wall Street Journal that he is not able to vote for the bill as it's currently written."If they can pass it without me, let them," Johnson told the WSJ."I'm not going to vote for this tax package."Read More
Steven Mnuchin's wife strikes a pose with a sheet of money:::::Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, looks thrilled that her husband's signature made it onto the dollar bill.Linton and Mnuchin posed with sheets of new $1 bills on Wednesday at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C.The notes are the first to feature Mnuchin's signature, along with that of U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza, and are expected to enter circulation in December.Linton was widely criticized earlier this year when she posted a photo on Instagram that showed her stepping off a government plane.She flaunted her designer wardrobe by tagging the designers she was wearing, then argued with a commenter who criticized her "getaway."The photo kicked off an investigation into Mnuchin's use of government planes.The Treasury Department's inspector general ultimately found no evidence of wrongdoing, but said the Trump administration had cut corners during the approval process for Mnuchin's trips.On Wednesday, social media lit up with jokes about the wealthy couple's photo shoot.Before he joined the Trump team, Mnuchin worked in finance, with stints as a Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood movie producer.Linton is an actress.The couple married over the summer, and they live in a D.C. mansion.Picking out wallpaper for the cognac-swirling room pic.twitter.com/gAqp6wostD Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) November 15, 2017 you cannot parody these folks pic.twitter.com/PfDXB0qXTp southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) November 15, 2017
Moore attorney invokes MSNBC host's 'background' to explain Moore's dating 'process':::::Story highlights Trenton Garmon was a guest on MSNBC Wednesday He fell into a tense exchange with the hosts Washington (CNN) An attorney for Roy Moore on Wednesday compared Moore's dating habits to arranged marriage and suggested that MSNBC host Ali Velshi's "background" would help him understand Moore's "process."Trenton Garmon, Moore's attorney, was a guest on MSNBC Wednesday and fell into a tense exchange with Velshi and his co-host, Stephanie Ruhle.Velshi is of Indian descent but his family moved to Toronto, where they still live, shortly after his birth.Garmon was asked to explain why Moore "would need permission from any of these girls' mothers if they weren't underage" -- one of a series of questions about allegations of sexual abuse of teenage girls made against the Alabama Senate candidate .Last week, Moore had told Fox host Sean Hannity in his defense, "I don't remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother."Garmon began, "Culturally speaking, obviously there's differences, (I) looked up Ali's background there, and wow, that's awesome that you have got such a diverse background, it's really cool to read through that.But point is this, each culture has..." "What does Ali's background have to do with dating a 14-year-old?"Ruhle cut in.Read More
Defending Roy Moore is a fool's errand:::::Story highlights Gloria Borger: Democrats wrong to blindly defend Bill Clinton during Lewinsky saga Republicans who stick by Moore are making the same kind of mistake, she says (CNN) The stories about Roy Moore and his predatory behavior with teenage girls while he was in his 30s are damning: five women, none of whom volunteered to speak out happily, all of whom have kept a dark secret for decades.The trail of people who now recall Moore trolling the mall for young girls.And then, of course, while telling Sean Hannity that the allegations were "completely false and misleading," Moore could only say that he did "not generally" remember dating teenagers when he was in his 30s.Huh?Of course President Donald Trump needs to come out and say Moore should step aside.And sure, the usually opinionated President has no desire to be "Access Hollywood"-ed again but that's started anyway.He's probably the only person who could convince Moore to take early retirement, so how about taking one for the team?In the meantime, at least a dozen Republicans in the Senate want Moore gone yesterday.The leaders want him gone, although what comes next is a conundrum.A write-in candidate?A Jeff Sessions reprise?Let Moore win and unseat him?Whatever.The Senate cannot be a retirement home for dirty young/old men, even when control of the Senate is conceivably at stake.Read More
House Dems introduce articles of impeachment against Trump:::::Washington (CNN) House Democrats introduced articles of impeachment Wednesday against President Donald Trump, though they acknowledged their efforts have no chance of success while Republicans control both houses of Congress.Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, introduced five articles of impeachment that include obstruction of justice for Trump's decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, two emoluments clause violations, undermining the independence of the federal judiciary and undermining the freedom of the press."The time has come to make clear to the American people and to this President that his train of injuries to our Constitution must be brought to an end through impeachment," he said.Cohen, the ranking member on the House judiciary committee's Constitution subcommittee, acknowledged the limitations of his proposal."I don't expect the House judiciary committee, which is operated like a branch of the administration, to take up hearings," he said.Read More
Trump claims 'America is back' post-Asia trip:::::Story highlights The statement is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.He had promised to deliver remarks either Wednesday or Thursday Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, fresh off a five-country swing through Asia, sought Wednesday to cast his first 10 months on the world stage as an unmitigated success, claiming a "great American comeback" that has restored the US' standing in the world.The speech, which came as Trump fumed at press coverage of his trip, framed his accomplishments in terms of correcting the "mistakes" of his predecessors and following through on his promises to voters.But he offered no new announcements on trade or North Korea, two of the top issues he focused on during his trip."I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals.Above all I swore that in every decision, every action I would put the best interest of the American people first.Over the past 10 months traveling the globe and meeting with world leaders, that is exactly what I have done," Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.Trump pointed to his efforts during his first foreign trip to rally Muslim leaders around the fight against radical Islamist terrorism and his urging that NATO allies boost their financial commitments to the alliance.And he highlighted his efforts on this most recent trip to bring back "free and reciprocal trade" and unite the world against the North Korean threat."My fellow citizens, America is back, and the future has never looked brighter," he concluded.Read More
Rubio criticizes Trump's mid-speech water-sipping form:::::Washington (CNN) Sen. Marco Rubio had a chance at payback Wednesday, when President Donald Trump noticeably sipped from a water bottle multiple times during a speech -- a move Trump had mocked Rubio for during the 2016 campaign."Similar, but needs work on his form.Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera.But not bad for his 1st time," Rubio tweeted Wednesday afternoon, linking to a video of Trump stopping mid-speech to look for his water bottle.Similar,but needs work on his form.Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera.But not bad for his 1st time https://t.co/s49JtyRo3S Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 15, 2017 Trump's hits against Rubio's water-drinking technique stemmed from a 2013 speech, years before Trump had even expressed serious presidential aspirations.Rubio was giving the GOP response to former President Barack Obama's State of the Union address and paused in the middle to reach for a water bottle and sneak a sip."Next time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottlewould have much less negative impact," Trump tweeted in 2013.Read More
Inspectors general are in demand during Trump era:::::Washington (CNN) In the Trump era, the sometimes-obscure role of inspector general is taking a turn in the spotlight.From Democrats on Capitol Hill to good-government groups, critics of President Donald Trump and his administration have turned to the federal government's 70-plus inspectors general seeking answers.The requests for IG investigations vary as widely as the headlines: The government's handling of Trump's Washington hotel.The President's firing of former FBI Director James Comey.Cabinet secretaries' use of charter airplanes.The reassignment of an Interior Department scientist to an accounting position.A report last week by the Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general said its investigations into potential employee fraud "have been on the rise because of recent attention from Congress and because of the attention garnered from our investigative successes being publicized in the media."Walter Shaub, a former top ethics official who's now a CNN contributor, said he sees "an increased volume of interest and referrals" to the IGs."I think IGs have always felt they live a bit in a fishbowl," said Shaub, who as director of the Office of Government Ethics was a member of the government's Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency."IGs always get a lot of scrutiny, and those who are not in power in Congress feel they have to turn to the IGs because they don't have the power of a committee chair."Some Democratic members of Congress have been particularly vocal as their requests for information from the administration have gone unanswered."To date my colleagues and I have sent more than 40 letters to the Trump administration asking for information necessary to carry out our oversight responsibilities," Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said Tuesday."To date, we have not received a single substantive response."Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the nonprofit Project On Government Oversight, agreed the inspectors general are in the spotlight more."I'm not sure if there is an increased attention on IGs because of Trump" or because in the wake of a decline of trust in government in general, "an individual is more likely to look at the watchdogs," she said.Wary of wading into politics, spokespeople for several inspector general offices declined to comment or did not respond to questions for this report.Inspectors general rarely speak in public, preferring for their audits and reports to represent their work.In some cases, such as employee misconduct, IGs disclose little or nothing about their conclusions.But several inspectors general will speak publicly on Wednesday morning when they answer questions from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.IGs from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Peace Corps are scheduled to testify.The latter two hold leadership positions on the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.When several of the same inspectors general appeared before the committee in February, their work was praised by both sides of the aisle.Then-Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who has since retired and is now a Fox News contributor, asked the IGs and their staff members who were present to stand."Thank you, thank you, thank you on behalf of all of us who serve here," he told them.Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, said at the February hearing that the importance of the position is underscored by the "many employees who are now going to inspector generals because they're afraid.""So your jobs become very, very, very significant -- even more significant than they've ever been because people see you as the last line of defense," Cummings said.More than 13,000 people work for the more than 70 inspectors general, according to a report from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.Their offices released more than 2,200 reports in the most recent fiscal year, including more than 8,800 recommendations to reduce government waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement.
10 moments to remember from Attorney General Sessions' testimony:::::(CNN) It was a tale of two hearings, and five long hours, Tuesday on Capitol Hill.Attorney General Jeff Sessions was alternately applauded for his work while encouraged to go further (by Republicans) and grilled (by Democrats) during a sworn question-and-answer session with the House judiciary committee.The hearing did include some cajoling from the GOP members, who put on display their desire for a probe into issues related to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and time as secretary of state.But the cross-examination from Democrats was testier, as they pressed Sessions for details on Trump and Russia.Here are 10 exchanges to remember: Opening statements set the tone Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, began the proceeding with a commentary on the Obama Justice Department's shortcomings and an attack on Sessions' predecessor, Loretta Lynch: "Our last DOJ oversight hearing was beyond disappointing.Attorney General Loretta Lynch gave the least fulsome and least transparent testimony that I can recall in my time in Congress.It was plainly a disservice to the American people.Ms. Lynch failed to respond substantively to nearly every question posed by members of this committee."After Goodlatte's opening remarks, the committee's top Democrat, Michigan Rep. John Conyers, took his turn -- swiping back at the current administration: "I would rather spend our time today discussing the upkeep, the criminal justice system, the enforcement of civil rights and the work we must all do to ensure access to the ballot box.Instead, we must spend our time debating the troubles of a wayward administration; how the attorney general conducts himself before Congress; how President Trump undermines the integrity of the justice system and how the department continues to ignore the oversight requests of this committee."Sessions leaves a door open boldface below, was Early on in a very long day of testimony, Sessions rejected claims that he had lied about the Trump campaign and Russia.But the caveat, inboldface below, was notable for the space it left to accommodate future revelations "I would like to address the false charges made about my previous testimony.My answers have not changed.I've always told the truth and I have answered every question as I understood them to the best of my recollection as I will continue to do today."On a potential investigation into Hillary Clinton The following came in response to a question from Conyers, who was trying to clear up Trump's role, or lack thereof, in DOJ decison-making.At stake was whether a probe into Clinton was on the table: "A president cannot improperly influence an investigation.... And I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced.The President speaks his mind.He's bold and direct about what he says, but people elected him.But we do our duty every day based on the law and the facts."Internal discussions about the Mueller probe?Here's an exchange with New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler that could come up again if evidence were to emerge to the contrary: Nadler: "Did you discuss the (George) Papadopoulos question with the FBI?"Sessions: "I have not had any discussions with Mr. Mueller or his team or the FBI concerning any factors with regard to this investigation."Nadler: "Nobody else at the FBI either?"Sessions: "No."Nadler: "And at the Department of Justice?"Sessions: "No."Nadler: "At the White House?"Sessions: "No."Chill with the previous administration's pot policy?Sessions made pretty clear that there's no crackdown coming on states that make marijuana legal for medicinal and/or recreational purposes: "Our policy is the same, really, fundamentally, as the Holder-Lynch policy, which is that the federal law remains in effect and a state can legalize marijuana for its law enforcement purposes, but it still remains illegal with regard to federal purposes."Another qualified denial on the Trump team and Russia Did Sessions relay his conversation with the Russian ambassador to Trump campaign ally and since-fired national security adviser Michael Flynn?"I did meet once in my office with (now former Russian ambassador to the US Sergey) Kislyak and I do not recall and don't believe I communicated any of that information to Mr.Flynn."AG Jeff Sessions says he does not believe he discussed meeting Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak with Michael Flynn https://t.co/rLzIj0iqqi CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 14, 2017 Sessions and the women accusing Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual abuse JUST WATCHED Sessions: No reason to doubt Moore accusers Replay More Videos ...

Jim Jordan got loud.The Ohio Republican wants a second special counsel to focus on Clinton.Sessions didn't seem too hot on the idea: Jordan: "What's it going to take to actually get a special counsel?"Sessions: "It would take a factual basis that meets the standards of the appointment of a special counsel."Jordan: "Is that analysis going on right now?"Sessions: "Well, it's in the manual of the Department of Justice about what's required.We have only had two.... And that's the only thing I can tell you, Mr. Jordan.You can have your idea, but sometimes we have to study what the facts are and to evaluate whether it meets the standard that requires a special counsel."Jordan then brought up the dossier and a series of alleged misdeeds by the Democrats, but Sessions again pushed back: Sessions: "And I would say: 'Looks like' is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel."
Sessions pressed on lack of minorities in his staff:::::Story highlights Sessions acknowledged he lacks a single black senior staff member Lawmakers asked about voter ID laws, criminal justice reform and handling of racially motivated extremist groups Washington (CNN) Members of the Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions on his and his department's handling of race, including the lack of minorities in key Justice Department positions Under questioning from CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond at the House judiciary committee hearing, Sessions acknowledged he lacks a single black senior staff member and there are hardly any black nominees for judgeships or US attorney positions, but said diversity remains an important consideration."I do not have a senior staff member at this time that's an African-American," Sessions said, adding that he recommended African-Americans for positions in his time serving Alabama.Richmond said that per his research, 91% of the administration's judicial nominees were white males and only one US attorney nominee has been African-American."I'm not aware of the numbers," Sessions said."But we should look for quality candidates, and I think diversity is a matter that has significance."Read More
Donald Trump's dry-mouthed victory lap:::::(CNN) Donald Trump got back from Asia on Tuesday night.By Wednesday afternoon, he was taking a victory lap.Trump's speech, which ran for more than 20 minutes, will be remembered primarily for Trump's dry mouth -- and his need for water.The reason for that is not only because Trump had been so critical of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's water-drinking habits during the 2016 campaign .(Karma!)It's also because Trump's speech amounted to a dry recitation of where he had been, who he had seen and how much he was loved during his trip.This was Trump playing his own hype man.He felt like the Asia trip went well and he wasn't getting enough credit for exactly how well it went.So, why not give a speech and force the "fake news" to cover it?From his opening statement onward, it was clear that Trump's lone goal with the speech was to pat himself on the back.Repeatedly.Read More
Analysis: Trump goes after basic democratic norms and Sessions tiptoes:::::Story highlights The independence of the Justice Department is no theoretical question Trump, judging from his Twitter account and other statements, seems bent on using it to punish foes Washington (CNN) One day, President Trump calls the US justice system a "laughingstock."The next day he wants it used to investigate his 2016 election opponent Hillary Clinton.He appears to hold unparalleled disregard for the independence of the US justice system.So, on Tuesday when Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified for five hours before the House judiciary committee, some members asked whether Sessions -- the nation's top law enforcement officer -- could be independent and uphold the rule of law.Sessions sounded less like a man trying to protect the rule of law than one trying to protect his job.The independence of the Justice Department is no theoretical question.Trump, judging from his Twitter account and other statements, seems bent on using it to punish foes.His public pressure on the department and the man who runs it is unprecedented.After previously calling Sessions "beleaguered" and "weak," Trump declared November 3 on Twitter: "Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with crooked Hillary & the Dems."Read More
What Donald Trump's UCLA tweet reveals about him:::::Washington (CNN) Think about this: You've just spent nearly two weeks halfway around the world.You've spent most of the last 24 hours on a plane.Your body clock is somewhere between 12-14 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time.You are 71 years old.What's one of the first things you do -- after you likely sleep a bit -- on your first day back at your desk for work?If you're President Donald Trump, you send out this tweet : "Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump?They were headed for 10 years in jail!"Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump?They were headed for 10 years in jail!Let's leave aside Trump referring to himself in the third person in the tweet -- that deserves a post all its own -- and focus on the psychology behind this tweet in this moment.Trump is someone who likes to be praised.He likes to be adulated at all times -- and tends to respond well to people who say nice things about him.(See "Putin, Vladimir.")He wants to get credit.Always.He seethes when either he doesn't get the credit he thinks he deserves or sees someone else getting credit for something he did.Case in point: Steve Bannon's stock fell in Trump's eyes in the early days of the administration when the White House strategist was cast as the real power behind the throne -- in both a Time magazine cover and in his portrayal on "Saturday Night Live."This, from an April New York Times story , is illuminating on that front: "Mr. Trump remains annoyed by a February cover of Time magazine labeling Mr. Bannon 'The Great Manipulator,' telling one visitor this month, 'That doesn't just happen' -- a favored Trump expression for anger at subordinates who tend to their interests ahead of his."Which brings us back to the UCLA players tweet.The three players -- which include the younger brother of Los Angeles Laker Lonzo Ball -- are accused of shoplifting during a trip to China to play a game.( They reportedly stole sunglasses from a Louis Vutton store .)Trump told the media that he spoke directly to Chinese President Xi Jinping about the case.The three players were released on Tuesday and arrived back in Los Angeles at 6 p.m. PT Tuesday night.Larry Scott, the PAC-12 commissioner -- the conference that includes UCLA -- quickly issued a statement thanking Trump."We want to thank the President, the White House and the US State Department for their efforts towards resolution," said Scott.That "thank you" is apparently not enough for Trump, at least according to his tweet.He wants the actual players -- LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill -- to say "thank you."That the three players are all young black men should also not be lost here.Trump's history on racial issues -- both as president and as a private citizen -- shows some level of intentionality when it comes to using racially coded language and taking advantage of racial animus and stereotypes for his own political gain.The image of an older white man in a position of power demanding thanks from three young black men for saving them will set off a lot of alarm bells for people.And, understandably so, given Trump's previous actions in the wake of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and in the ongoing NFL anthem protests.Even if you take out the racial element, what Trump is asking for is to be thanked (or, more accurately, thanked by the "right" people) for doing his job.Part of being President is trying to get US citizens out of dicey situations in foreign countries.That doesn't mean that Trump's personal appeal to Xi didn't have any effect.In fact, it likely played a major role in the release of the players.But, demanding to be praised by three teenagers for what you did for them isn't exactly presidential.Update: In scripted statements to the press once back in the US, the players did apologize.LiAngelo Ball specifically thanked President Trump and the US government.
Trump takes cautious approach on Roy Moore:::::Washington (CNN) It's been five days since the White House said President Donald Trump believes Alabama Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore should drop out if the allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against him are true.Since then, Moore has faced more allegations and the national Republican Party has cast Moore aside.Trump, however, has remained mum.Behind the scenes, the President and his advisers are closely watching the developments in Alabama's special election, two sources close to the White House and a White House official said.That includes, in particular, the reaction of influential conservative supporters such as Fox News host Sean Hannity.The White House is also mulling scenarios to prevent Moore from being elected, according to the sources.Trump, one source said, believes the allegations of child sexual abuse and sexual assault against Moore are bad for the Republican brand, but has decided to wait and see how the situation shakes out before publicly commenting.That silence is in large part rooted in his own history of facing sexual misconduct allegations, a Republican close to the White House told CNN.In conversations in the West Wing on Wednesday, Trump expressed apprehension about being dragged into the topic of sexual assault or harassment if he weighs in."He's worried about the conversation moving to his past accusers," the Republican familiar with the matter said, noting that the President believes his accusers were unfair and some of Moore's may be, too.Pressed by reporters Saturday while in Vietnam -- before a fifth alleged victim said Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 -- Trump said he had not been following the issue closely and declined to go beyond press secretary Sarah Sanders' earlier statement.The scenarios JUST WATCHED Bannon compares Moore, Trump WaPo stories Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bannon compares Moore, Trump WaPo stories 00:51 But White House officials, coordinating closely with Republicans on Capitol Hill, have been mulling a range of scenarios to thwart Moore's election, which despite the allegations remains a serious possibility in the deep red state.Some White House officials are encouraging an idea floated publicly Wednesday by the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: sending Attorney General Jeff Sessions back to Alabama to run as a write-in candidate for the special election seat prompted by his own departure from the Senate.That option is largely see as unlikely and "far-fetched" inside and around the White House, a person close to the White House and a White House official said.That's both because a write-in campaign could split the Alabama Republican vote and hand Democratic candidate Doug Jones the election and because Sessions appears uninterested in leaving his current post.Some White House officials have also argued that confirming a new attorney general would be an arduous task for the administration.Another source close to the White House said officials are weighing the possibility of pressuring Alabama Gov.Kay Ivey, a Republican, into delaying the special election to give Republicans time to find an alternative candidate, a move Ivey has ruled out The thinking among Trump's advisers, though, has been in part colored by concerns that being too quick to abandon Moore based on allegations could leave the White House dealing with unintended consequences.The President, too, faced allegations of sexual misconduct when a dozen women accused him of sexual harassment or sexual assault in the months before the 2016 election.But a drumbeat is rising among Republicans on Capitol Hill who are urging the President to weigh in.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said, "It would probably be good if he would say something" about Moore, given Trump is the leader of the Republican Party."If you are no-fly list for the mall, you shouldn't be in the United States Senate," he said, referring to reports that Moore had been banned from a local mall because of his pursuit of teenage girls.Ultimatum JUST WATCHED McConnell hints at Roy Moore replacement Replay More Videos ...

North Korea heaps insults on Trump, warns he will 'pay dearly':::::(CNN) US President Donald Trump may claim he would never insult Kim Jong Un , but North Korea clearly thinks differently.A furious commentary published in a state-run newspaper Wednesday said Trump had displayed his "true colors as an old lunatic, mean trickster and human reject" during his recent visit to the Korean Peninsula."The worst crime for which he can never be pardoned is that he dared malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of (North Korea)," the Rodong Sinmun commentary said."Trump, who is no more than an old slave of money, dared point an accusing finger at the sun.He should know that he is just a hideous criminal sentenced to death by the Korean people.He will be forced to pay dearly for his blasphemy any moment."Rodong Sinmun is the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, and the commentary was also published by state news agency KCNA.North Korea has previously boasted of its ability to strike the US with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) if Washington continues what Pyongyang views as acts of aggression against North Korea.JUST WATCHED What it's really like to be inside North Korea Replay More Videos ...

What we know about Trump Jr.'s exchanges with WikiLeaks:::::(CNN) There is a web of connections between the Trump campaign, the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and the public disclosures it injected into the presidential campaign.Federal investigators are examining some of these relationships and whether any of them were part of an effort to coordinate with Russia's election-meddling efforts.On Monday, it was revealed that Donald Trump Jr. exchanged some private messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign.The news was first reported by The Atlantic and later confirmed by Trump Jr., who posted screenshots of the messages.A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Congress has known about these messages for a while and they came up during Trump Jr.'s closed-door testimony in September.The messages show that WikiLeaks reached out fairly often to Trump Jr., who is only known to have replied on two occasions.Trump Jr.'s final response to WikiLeaks was in October 2016, though the WikiLeaks account continued its outreach until July 2017, according to the messages he released.That being said, nothing happens in a vacuum, and while these messages were exchanged, WikiLeaks was busy releasing hacked materials.And all the while, Russian President Vladimir Putin was directing an operation to interfere in the US election, according to the US intelligence community.Here is a timeline with what we know about Trump Jr.'s exchanges with WikiLeaks, the role WikiLeaks played, relevant public statements from the Trump campaign, and much more.July 2015 -- Russian hackers breach DNC systems Hackers working for Russian intelligence services "gained access to" the Democratic National Committee's computer networks as part of the Kremlin's campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential race, according to the US intelligence community assessment that was published after the election.March 2016 -- Another group of Russian hackers breach DNC systems Another group of Russian hackers -- separate from the group that hacked the DNC in 2015 -- breached the DNC's computer systems, according to a US intelligence report published after the election.The US intelligence community says Russian intelligence related stolen materials from the DNC to WikiLeaks for public release.CNN reported this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary.March 19, 2016 -- Russian hackers gain access to Podesta's emails Russian hackers gained access to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account by sending a phishing email.The US intelligence community determined in early 2017 that Russian intelligence later gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from Democratic "political figures," an oblique reference to Podesta.CNN reported this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary.April 26, 2016 -- Papadopoulos learns that Russians have Clinton emails Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has breakfast in London with a professor who says he has just returned from meetings in Moscow with high-level Russian officials who claim to have "dirt" on Hillary Clinton and "thousands" of her emails, according to court filings June 2016 -- Cambridge Analytica CEO emails WikiLeaks Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, started working for Trump over the summer of 2016.Some members of Cambridge Analytica staff were incorporated in the Trump campaign's data operation team.Alexander Nix, the chief executive of data firm Cambridge Analytica, emailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange seeking access to emails from Clinton's private server so he could turn them into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee.There is no evidence that Clinton's deleted emails were ever hacked or that WikiLeaks ever had possession of them.June 9, 2016 -- The Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and Trump's then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended a private meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer and others.The meeting was arranged after Trump Jr. was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.June 15, 2016 -- DNC claims it was hacked by Russian intelligence The DNC and CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm it hired to investigate the breaches, revealed publicly for the first time that its servers were penetrated.CrowdStrike said it "identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network" that were associated with Russian intelligence services.Trump dismissed the notion that Russia was behind the hacks, saying "we believe it was the DNC that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.Too bad the DNC doesn't hack Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails."July 22, 2016 -- WikiLeaks releases about 20,000 hacked DNC emails WikiLeaks posted on its website nearly 20,000 emails that were stolen from the DNC servers.Many of the emails were sent by senior DNC officials.Some of the emails suggested that the DNC favored Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primaries, leading to allegations that the primary was rigged.July 25, 2016 -- Trump says it's a 'joke' that Russia hacked the DNC Trump weighed in on the DNC leaks, saying on Twitter : "The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me."July 26, 2016 -- NYT reports that the US believes Russia hacked the DNC The New York Times published a report that claimed US intelligence agencies told the White House that they were highly confident that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC.This was the first public report suggesting that the US government agreed with the DNC's assessment.July 27, 2016 -- Trump publicly asks Russia to hack Clinton's deleted emails At a news conference , Trump publicly called on the Russian government to hack Clinton's private email server and reveal the deleted emails.Trump's campaign later said his comment was a joke."If it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything," Trump said."But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.Let's see if that happens.That'll be next."August 8, 2016 -- Roger Stone says he was in touch with Assange During a speech in Florida , former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone claimed to be in touch with Assange and predicted upcoming WikiLeaks releases: "I actually have communicated with Assange.I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there's no telling what the October surprise may be."He later clarified that while he was in contact with Assange, it came through an intermediary.August 14-17, 2016 -- Stone exchanges messages with Russian hackers Stone exchanged direct Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0, a self-proclaimed hacker who published stolen materials from the DNC earlier in the summer.(These DNC releases were separate from the DNC emails published by WikiLeaks.)The Twitter messages were about the contents of some of the stolen DNC materials that Guccifer posted online earlier that summer.Stone denies any wrongdoing or collusion.Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election.August 21, 2016 -- Stone predicts upcoming trouble for Podesta Without specifically referencing emails, Stone predicts that Podesta will soon be in hot water."Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel," he tweeted .Stone later claimed that he wasn't talking about the upcoming WikiLeaks releases but was alluding to an expose he was planning on his own.September 9, 2016 -- Stone exchanges more messages with Russian hackers Stone exchanged direct Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0.The emails were about the contents of some publicly released DNC materials.Stone denies any wrongdoing or collusion.September 16, 2016 -- Stone predicts WikiLeaks will release Clinton emails Stone says in a radio interview that WikiLeaks will release new Clinton emails."I expect Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks people to drop a payload of new documents on Hillary on a weekly basis fairly soon.And that, of course, will answer the question of exactly what was erased on that email server."September 21, 2016 -- WikiLeaks and Trump Jr. exchange private messages on Twitter WikiLeaks reached out to Don Jr. just before midnight on September 20, 2016, regarding an anti-Trump website that it said was about to launch.WikiLeaks guessed the password and shared it with Trump Jr., who replied, "Off the record I don't know who that is but I'll ask around.Thanks."September 21, 2016 -- Trump Jr. emails senior campaign officials about WikiLeaks Trump Jr. emailed a group of senior Trump campaign officials notifying them that WikiLeaks had reached out, according to The Atlantic .The email was sent to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign manger Kellyanne Conway, then-campaign CEO Steve Bannon and Brad Parscale, who ran the campaign's data operation.Kushner also forwarded the email to Hope Hicks, the communications aide who is now White House communications director, according to The Atlantic.October 2, 2016 -- Stone alludes to future WikiLeaks releases Stone appeared to predict that WikiLeaks would soon post damaging materials about Clinton.He posted: "Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done.#WikiLeaks."Nothing materialized on the date Stone referred to, but two days later, WikiLeaks started releasing Podesta's emails.October 3, 2016 -- Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks exchange more private messages on Twitter WikiLeaks sent a link about Clinton criticizing Assange to Trump Jr., asking him to share it.Trump Jr. replies: "Already did that earlier today.It's amazing what she can get away with."In a follow-up message, Trump Jr. asks, "What's behind this Wednesday leak I keep hearing about?"WikiLeaks does not respond to his question, which appears to reference Stone's post from the day earlier about upcoming releases.October 5, 2016 -- Stone says "payload coming" from WikiLeaks "Libs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking.Payload coming," Stone tweeted , two days before WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of emailed hacked from Podesta's email account.October 7, 2016 -- US formally blames Russia for DNC hacks The US government broke its silence about the DNC hack.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the entire US intelligence community, announced that the Russian government was behind the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks."The US Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations," the statement said, adding that disclosures on WikiLeaks were consistent with Russian methods.October 7, 2016 -- WikiLeaks begins releasing Podesta emails Shortly after the announcement blaming Russia for the DNC hacks, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of emails stolen from Podesta's Gmail account.WikiLeaks went on to release new Podesta emails on a near-daily basis, creating waves of negative headlines for the Clinton campaign in the closing weeks of the election.Trump regularly cited the latest Podesta releases during campaign rallies in October and November.The US government later said Russia was responsible for the hacks.October 10, 2016 -- Trump says "I love WikiLeaks" At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump expressed his admiration for the anti-secrecy website that was publishing dirt on his Democratic opponent, saying "This just came out.WikiLeaks!I love WikiLeaks."October 11, 2016 -- Trump encourages people to read WikiLeaks Trump tweets about WikiLeaks: "I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks.She is unfit to run."October 11, 2016 -- Trump Jr. speaks at dinner for Russia-friendly organization Trump Jr. flew to France and spoke at a dinner hosted by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, according to the Wall Street Journal .The paper reported that Trump Jr. was paid for the speaking engagement.The think tank was founded by Fabien Baussart.He and his wife, Randa Kassis, hosted the event Trump Jr. attended in Paris.She leads a Moscow-endorsed Syrian opposition group and has met with many senior Russian officials.In December 2016, the think tank nominated Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.October 12, 2016 -- WikiLeaks asks Trump Jr. to tweet about their latest releases WikiLeaks sent a message to Trump Jr., which said: "Hey Donald, great to see your dad talking about our publications.Strongly suggest your dad tweet this link if he mentions us," the message said, along with an obscure domain that likely hosted an archive of the latest WikiLeaks releases.The website is now offline.Trump Jr. did not reply to the message.October 12, 2016 -- Trump says WikiLeaks isn't getting enough coverage Trump tweets : "Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks.So dishonest!Rigged system!"October 14, 2016 -- Trump Jr. tweets the link that WikiLeaks gave him Trump Jr. tweeted out the link that WikiLeaks had sent to him two days earlier via private message.His tweet said : "For those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @wikileaks emails are right here" October 14, 2016 -- Pence denies coordination between Trump campaign and WikiLeaks Then-Governor Mike Pence, Trump's running mate at the time, gave an interview on Fox News and denied that the Trump campaign was coordinating with WikiLeaks."WikiLeaks, some have suggested on the left all this bad stuff about Hillary, nothing bad about Trump, that your campaign is in cahoots with WikiLeaks," said the Fox News host.Pence replied, "Nothing could be further from the truth.I think all of us have, you know, have had concerns about WikiLeaks over the years and it's just a reality of American life today, and of life in the wider world."Responding to reports about Trump Jr.'s messages, a Pence spokesman said Monday that he was "never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks."October 21, 2016 -- WikiLeaks asks Trump Jr. to leak his father's tax returns WikiLeaks asks Don Jr. to leak some of Trump's tax returns to their organization so that they could be released on a friendly platform, according to the private messages released by Trump Jr. WikiLeaks also said that doing this would help discredit people accusing WikiLeaks of being "pro-Trump" and "pro-Russia" source.Trump Jr. does not reply.November 8, 2016 -- WikiLeaks tells Trump Jr. that Trump should not concede if he loses WikiLeaks tells Don Jr. that Trump should contest the election and claim that it was rigged if he does not win.This messaging is consistent with the Russian government's posturing around the time of the election, according t o the report released by the US intelligence community in January 2017.The report said: "Before the election, Russian diplomats had publicly denounced the US electoral process and were prepared to publicly call into question the validity of the results.Pro-Kremlin bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign, #DemocracyRIP, on election night in anticipation of Secretary Clinton's victory, judging from their social media activity."November 10, 2016 -- Hicks denies any campaign contacts with foreign entities A Russian diplomat says that some Russians were in touch with Trump's associates during the campaign.In response, Hope Hicks, then a spokeswoman for the Trump transition, issued a blanket denial: "We are not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with any foreign entities before yesterday, when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders," she told the New York Times .She also told the AP : "It never happened.There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign."December 18, 2016 -- Conway denies campaign contacts with Russians Kellyanne Conway denies any contact between the Trump campaign and Russia in an interview with CBS News' John Dickerson DICKERSON: All right.We are not going to get any insight into the president-elect's thinking here, but let me try this.Did anyone involved in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election?CONWAY: Absolutely not.And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night.Those conversations never happened.I hear people saying it like it's a fact on television.That is just not only inaccurate and false, but it's dangerous.July 11, 2017 -- WikiLeaks tells Trump Jr. to release his own emails WikiLeaks sent more private messages to Trump Jr., shortly after news broke that he attended a meeting with Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016.WikiLeaks encouraged Trump Jr. to release all his emails about the meeting.He did not reply to these direct messages, though he did soon release the full email chain that showed he was told that the Russian lawyer who would attend the meeting might have damaging information about Clinton.Assange acknowledged personally writing these messages to Trump Jr., publicly tweeting at the time , "Contacted Trump Jr this morning on why he should publish his emails."UPDATE: This story has been updated with information about July 11, 2017.
What Don Jr.'s conversations with WikiLeaks prove:::::Washington (CNN) On Monday night, the Atlantic's Julia Ioffe reported that Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the President and a senior adviser to his campaign, had exchanged direct messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks during the course of the 2016 race.Trump Jr. quickly released his DM exchanges, which amounted to a number of notes sent from WikiLeaks to Trump Jr. and three responses sent from Trump Jr. to WikiLeaks."Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak," he tweeted."How ironic!"Trump Jr.'s obvious attempt to minimize this news -- nothing to see here folks!!!-- is a bit of a tell.You don't react -- or overreact -- this way to something that is truly a nothingburger.So what does this new reporting prove?It proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was direct communication between WikiLeaks and a senior member of Donald Trump's political inner circle.That matters -- for two reasons.First, because by the time WikiLeaks was communicating with Don Jr. -- late September and early October 2016 -- he, and anyone else paying even the smallest amount of attention to the campaign, knew that US intelligence officials were convinced that Russia was responsible for the hacks of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that were being posted on the WikiLeaks website.JUST WATCHED Lewandowski: Trump Jr. can do what he wants Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lewandowski: Trump Jr. can do what he wants 02:09 The second reason the communication matters is because it had long been denied by the Trump campaign -- at the highest levels.In an October 14 interview on Fox News, then-vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was asked this: "WikiLeaks, some have suggested on the left, all this bad stuff about Hillary, nothing bad about Trump, that your campaign is in cahoots with WikiLeaks."Pence replied: "Nothing could be further from the truth.I think all of us have, you know, have had concerns about WikiLeaks over the years and it's just a reality of American life today, and of life in the wider world."(On Monday, in the wake of the news about Don Jr.'s contact with WikiLeaks, a Pence spokeswoman said that the vice president was "never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks.")Communication is now proven.And, by my view, coordination -- between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks -- is proven too, at least to some extent.On October 12, WikiLeaks messaged Don Jr. this: "Hey Donald, great to see your dad talking about our publications.Strongly suggest your dad tweet this link if he mentions us" with a link to an archive of its work.Fifteen minutes later -- 15 minutes!!!-- Donald Trump tweeted this from his account : "Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks.So dishonest!Rigged system!"JUST WATCHED Trump was for leaks before he was president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump was for leaks before he was president 01:00 If that isn't coordination, I am not sure what is.I suppose you could say it was mere coincidence that Trump tweeted about WikiLeaks 15 minutes after the organization asked his eldest son for him to do just that.But, that would be one hell of a coincidence given the timing of the tweets and the fact that we know from the Atlantic's reporting that Don Jr. let the senior staff of the campaign know that WikiLeaks had made contact back on September 21.Now, communication and coordination isn't collusion.Collusion, according to Merriam-Webster, is a "secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose."The second part of that definition is the key -- "for an illegal or deceitful purpose."WikiLeaks had begun publishing hacked DNC emails for several moths before Donald Trump Jr. responded to their direct messages to him.Simply being in communication with WikiLeaks in the fall of 2016 -- and even taking direction about a suggested tweet from them (Trump Jr. tweeted a link to the WikiLeaks archive on October 14) isn't illegal.What these latest revelations do show is that there is even more smoke in an already very smoky situation.Huge amounts of smoke don't always equal fire.But, they require further investigation into whether or not fire is present.Which is what special counsel Robert Mueller is in the process of doing.
Donald Trump Jr. releases exchanges with WikiLeaks:::::Washington (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. has released exchanges he had with the WikiLeaks Twitter account via direct messages during the 2016 presidential campaign.Trump Jr. tweeted the exchange shortly after The Atlantic first reported on the correspondence, writing: "Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.How ironic!"Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.How ironic!1/3 pic.twitter.com/SiwTqWtykA According to the released messages, WikiLeaks reached out to President Donald Trump's adult son just before midnight on September 20, 2016, regarding a PAC-funded, anti-Trump website.On October 7, 2016, the intelligence community publicly announced that US intelligence officials have assessed "with high confidence" that Russian intelligence hacked the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and then subsequently provided internal materials obtained through the hacks to WikiLeaks so they could be publicly released.A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Congress has had the documents for a while, and Trump Jr. was briefly asked about the exchanges during a closed-door interview he had with the Senate judiciary committee in September 2017.Although the messages are predominantly one-sided, according to The Atlantic, they were turned over to congressional investigators by Trump Jr.'s lawyers.Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement provided to the Atlantic, "Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum."Trump Jr. responded to two of the messages initiated by WikiLeaks, the one sent on September 21, 2016, and then again on October 3, 2016.In the October 3 exchange, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent a message to Trump Jr. that said: "Hiya, it'd be great if you guys could comment on/push this story," and proceeded to link to a quote from Hillary Clinton suggesting a drone strike against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, according to the messages shared by Trump Jr. "Already did that earlier today," Trump Jr. wrote back."It's amazing what she can get away with."Trump Jr. then proceeded to inquire about a "Wednesday leak.""What's behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?"he wrote, according to The Atlantic.This communication came days before the official intelligence community assessment that it thought Russia was behind the DNC hacks and that it was disseminating information through WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.Also on October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta's emails.The news comes amid several investigations into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia.Trump Jr. faced scrutiny after it was revealed he agreed to meet with a Russian attorney who was promising "dirt" on Clinton.That meeting, in June 2016 at Trump Tower, included Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort.
The Note: Trump has to show his cards on whether he backs Roy Moore:::::The TAKE with Rick Klein Interested in The Note?Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest It's time for President Donald Trump to choose.In the intraparty war over Roy Moore, does Trump try to push him out of the race aligning himself (again) with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell?Or does he stay just enough removed from the Alabama Senate race to be one of the last Republicans standing, giving Steve Bannon's candidate a sliver of a chance to bounce back?The answer could have lasting implications for governance and the midterm elections and maybe the future of the Republican Party.The insider vs. outsider war has already been playing out even in Alabama, of course, where Trump and McConnell couldn't stop Moore in the primary race.The stakes are even higher now in a defining political episode that's coinciding with the major cultural moment around powerful men and sexual misbehavior.As Trump returns to work in Washington today, the official White House line remains that Moore should step aside "if these allegations are true."Most leadership Republicans have now abandoned qualifiers in favor of outright calling for his exit.Notably, Moore's latest fundraising appeal evokes Trump sliming his critics in the media: "It's the same playbook they used in their failed attempt to keep Donald Trump out of the White House."Moore goes on to attack McConnell and other Republicans he calls "vicious thugs."It's not at all clear that Trump's urging would force Moore from the race.Moore won the primary in part with voters who felt like Trump was duped into supporting Sen. Luther Strange.But as battle lines are drawn for 2018, the president's language matters.The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks The last time Senate Republicans voted on scrapping key parts of the Affordable Care Act it didn't go so well for them.But Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said on Fox News Tuesday he thinks Senate Republicans now have the votes to repeal the so-called "individual mandate, " the rule that requires Americans to have health insurance, one of the key pillars of the current law.Republicans' plan, it seems, is to lump that repeal provision into the Senate tax reform package.When publicly confronted with those rumors, Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch first tried to dodge, but then copped to the idea.Tacking on the partial Obamacare repeal is a major gamble.It could help Republicans get the cost of their pricey tax cut legislation down a bit, but also add some potential political pitfalls.The Senate is looking to score wins with two top priorities in one swoop, but tying health care to tax reform could alienate key allies and put the Senate bill in peril."RED ALERT," Sen Al Franken tweeted at the news, "Senate GOP just added provision to their tax plan that would gut ACA & kick 13M people off insurance."Repealing the mandate alone would not "kick" people off insurance, but it would result in 13 million more Americans without health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The research office says millions of Americans who buy their own coverage would be priced out of the market and unable to afford plans.As a consolation, the Senate could also include the bipartisan bill from the health care committee that was designed to help stabilize prices in those individual insurance marketplaces.But remember, that bill was written after the president vowed to stop paying the federal cost-reduction subsidies.Repealing the mandate would bring a different level of chaos to those markets.The House bill does not include a repeal of the mandate at this point though a growing chorus now want it included.The chamber has passed that before, but is unlikely to add it before voting this week.The TIP with Katherine Faulders and Alexander Mallin The Republican National Committee is cutting off its relationship with Roy Moore's campaign, terminating their joint fundraising agreement with him as well as a coordinated field program that consisted of about a dozen canvassers in Alabama.The report first surfaced in POLITICO, the details of which were confirmed by two RNC officials to ABC News.The RNC has also updated its FEC filing online.The move follows the National Republican Senate Committee's announcement Friday that it was withdrawing from its own fundraising agreement with Moore, a move that put the RNC under increasing pressure through the weekend to follow suit.WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY: The Senate Finance Committee continues its markup of the Senate tax bill.The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus holds a news conference to urge the passage of the bipartisan DREAM Act before the end of the year on Capitol Hill.Advocates for Opioid Recovery and the Collaborative for Effective Prescription Opioid Policies hold a briefing on the national opioid emergency and need for medication assisted treatment.On ABC News' "Powerhouse Politics" podcast with Rick Klein and Mary Bruce, Rep.

Roy Moore addresses church crowd in Alabama amidst sexual assault scandal:::::At the God Save America Revival Conference at Walker Springs Road Baptist Church in Jackson, Alabama on Tuesday night, embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore addressed a loyal crowd and made little mention of his sexual assault scandal.Obviously Ive made a few people mad.Im the only one who can unite Democrats and Republicans because I seem to be opposed by both, said Moore.Theyve spent over $30 million to try to take me out, they've done everything they could, and now theyre together to try to keep me from going to Washington.Moore was met by applause when he walked into the church, with his wife Kayla at his side.He spoke following almost an hour of preaching and songs from a youth choir.Today you find out that people would rather hear criticisms of a person than look at what he's done for 20 to 30 to 40 years, said Moore.Moores speech to the congregation focused on religious liberties, with Moore at the center of a battle over God in America -- a battle he said he plans to bring to Washington if it is Gods will.I want to speak the truth, I want to take the truth about God to our Capitol, said Moore.Now I'm running for -- Senate of the United States -- what do you think I'm going to do?Why do you think they're giving me this trouble?Why do you think I'm being harassed by the media and by people pushing forth allegations in the last 28 days of this election, last 30 days it began?asked Moore.After 40 something years of fighting this battle I'm now facing allegations and that's all the press want to talk about, but I want to talk about the issues, I want to talk about where this country is going and if we don't come back to God, we're not going anywhere.While Moore has vowed not to drop out of the Senate race, Republican leaders are debating how to proceed with a candidate they no longer support on the ballot.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell floated the idea of Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- who remains popular in Alabama -- returning to his Senate seat.Were in discussion now about how to salvage his seat, if possible, and it appears as if the only option would be a write in, McConnell said at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event on Tuesday evening.The Alabamian who would fit that standard is the attorney general, who is totally well known and extremely popular in Alabama.And obviously it would be a big move for him and for the president, but I think the president is winding his way back the United States and Im confident this is an issue theyre discussing in great detail.The Associated Press If Moore was elected, McConnell said the Senate could take action to remove him from office.It would be a rather unusual beginning, said McConnell.Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement today that the Senate should vote to expel Moore if he wins the race in Alabama.I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office.If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate, Gardner said in a statement.Fox News host Sean Hannity, whose early defense of Moore led him to lose sponsors, changed course on his show Tuesday said Moore has 24 hours to face the allegations.For me, the judge has 24 hours.You must immediately and fully come up with a satisfactory explanation for your inconsistencies that I just showed, said Hannity on his show.You must remove any doubt.If you can't do this, then Judge Moore needs to get out of this race.This country has way too many issues and problems.The American people deserve 100% truth and honesty.
Legal experts weigh in on Sessions' call to evaluate Clinton allegations:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed on Monday that he has authorized senior prosecutors at the Justice Department to evaluate whether allegations regarding the Clinton Foundation and the sale of Uranium One need to be investigated by a special counsel.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sessions apparent interest in reexamining Hillary Clinton comes 10 days after President Trump told reporters that the Justice Department should be looking at the Democrats and that a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.Those prosecutors would be tasked with looking into Clinton's role in approving the 2010 acquisition of U.S. uranium stockpiles by a Russian energy company - a complicated deal that has come to be known simply as Uranium One.Uranium One was the name of the Canadian company with large uranium stakes in North America and overseas - including some in the U.S. - that was purchased by the Russian energy giant, Rosatom.In his January confirmation hearings, Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would recuse himself from investigations that involve Hillary Clinton, admitting that with regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question.But in a letter on Monday to Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that Justice Department prosecutors would evaluate certain issues relating to Hillary Clinton and make recommendations to Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether matters merit the appointment of a special counsel.Some legal experts told ABC News that this letter raises ethical concerns.Certainly Sessions involvement with the Trump presidential campaign, which already branded Secretary Clinton a criminal, would raise a question of his impartiality in these circumstances, said Trevor Potter, president of the Campaign Legal Center and a former Republican chair of the Federal Election Commission.Other, less political, officials at the Department of Justice should be making decisions about any Clinton investigations, Potter said.The whole situation is unusual, said a former Department of Justice official, who explained that historically, DOJ has had a strong record of independence, which could erode if there is an appearance that DOJ is acting based on political pressure rather than on an independent assessment of the facts and the law.You have to go back to Nixon to find a similar situation of a president involving himself in prosecutions of political enemies, concluded another former government official.But other legal experts told ABC News that Sessions does not appear to have crossed any legal or ethical lines at this point.Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics professor at Washington University School of Law, said that in Mondays letter, Sessions may be attempting to thread a difficult needle by mollifying certain House Republicans who want the resources of the Department of Justice trained on Clinton Inc. while at the same time remaining vague about which Clinton issues might be examined and what Sessions role would be.Sessions was quite artful in addressing what is a politically fraught situation, Clark added.The investigation into contributions to the Clinton Foundation is not campaign-related, according to Harold Krent, dean of the Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology.Thus, Sessions' possible appointment of a special counsel would not run afoul of his prior recusal declaration, Krent told ABC News.I do not think it will be a big deal if career non-political prosecutors make the recommendation [to appoint a special counsel to investigate Clinton matters] and then Rod Rosenstein makes the final call, said John Lauro, a former federal prosecutor and attorney with the Lauro Law Firm.Lauro said that he does not see any legal or ethical issues, adding that career prosecutors are presumably unaffected by Trumps comments.
Analysis: Sessions gives Trump what he wants - a return to 'Crooked Hillary':::::After months of public and private pressure, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is giving President Donald Trump what hes long demanded, going back to the days of Crooked Hillary and lock her up: an inquiry that could lead to a full-fledged investigation of his vanquished opponent and the Clinton Foundation.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Things may never be the same for Sessions or the Justice Department he leads.The attorney general is erasing longstanding barriers between the president and the administration of justice, and seems close to violating his own pledge to Congress to recuse himself from all matters impacting Hillary Clinton.At a moment where Sessions leadership and credibility is being questioned the president himself has openly pondered firing him, and Democrats are accusing him of lying about his knowledge of Russian contacts with the Trump campaign the attorney general is giving the appearance that hes bowing to the political demands of the president.The announcement of the new inquiry, coming on the eve of high-profile testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, had the immediate impact of subsuming news about Russia including new information about meetings Sessions previously said he had no recollection of.But it also raised deeper concerns about the impartiality of the administration of justice.The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers, mentioned to Sessions that he was once on President Richard Nixons enemies list and said the current conduct by the administration is reminiscent of the Watergate era.President Trump seems to believe that, on a whim, he can bring pressure to bear on his enemies, said Conyers, D-Mich.I cannot overemphasize the danger this perspective poses to this republic.Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, raised a similar concern on Twitter last night: If the AG bends to pressure from President Trump and his allies, and appoints a special counsel to investigate Trumps vanquished rival, it could spell the end of the DOJ as an independent institution.Pressed on whether he has recused himself from any investigation of Clinton, Sessions declined to comment, citing department policy that he said keeps him from confirming or denying the existence of any such investigation.He did, however, say he stands by his January statement that the proper thing for me to do would be for me to recuse myself on matters involving Clinton, given his past involvement in the Trump campaign.Sessions pushed back at the perception that he is doing anything because the president demanded he do it, and said his department would not and will not be used to settle political scores.The Department of Justice can never be used to retaliate politically against opponents.And that would be wrong, he told lawmakers today.A president cannot improperly influence an investigation, and I have not been improperly influenced.But its hard to avoid the perception of presidential influence.Trump has tweeted repeatedly about the need for Sessions and the Justice Department to investigate the Clinton Foundation, Clinton herself, and other Democrats in the Clinton orbit.On Nov. 3, after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a TV interview that she thought the Democratic primaries were imbalanced in Clintons favor, the president tweeted: Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries!Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.Shortly before leaving on his trip to Asia, Trump said he was very frustrated that the Justice Department wasnt investigating Democrats for allegations of questionable dealings and relationships.Asked by ABCs Jonathan Karl if he was considering firing Sessions over such frustrations, Trump replied, I dont know.I'm really not involved with the Justice Department.I'd like to let it run itself.But honestly they should be looking at the Democrats, Trump said.They should be looking at a lot of things, and a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.The president may be a little less disappointed now.Under Sessions direction, the Justice Department is now examining allegations that donations to the Clinton Foundation were related to an Obama administration decision to give a Russian nuclear agency access to uranium in the United States.Prosecutors findings including a potential recommendation for a broader inquiry, led by a special counsel - will be reported to the attorney general or the deputy attorney as appropriate, according to a Justice Department letter sent to key House Republicans.So its possible Sessions recusal from the topic will stand.More broadly, though, the renewed scrutiny of Clinton and the foundation reflects a political score Trump has a stated interest in settling, at a time that he would like far less interest in his own campaigns contacts with Russia.Whataboutism is now dangerously close to becoming U.S. Justice Department policy.
What you need to know about the Uranium One deal:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions has inquired about the need for a special prosecutor to investigate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's role in approving the 2010 acquisition of U.S. uranium stockpiles by a Russian energy company a complicated deal that has come to be known simply as Uranium One.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Uranium One was the name of the Canadian company with large uranium stakes in North America and overseas including some in the U.S. that was purchased by the Russian energy giant, Rosatom, with the blessing of the Obama administration.President Donald Trump and other Clinton detractors say she approved the Russian takeover as part of pay-for-play deal that saw lucrative kick-backs by Uranium One to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of state.Throughout her presidential campaign, Clinton adamantly denied any wrongdoing and said the decisions about the deal were not made at her level.Heres what you need to know: The Deal The Uranium One deal was approved in 2010 under the Obama administration, but it was not approved by the State Department alone.In fact, the Department of Treasury led an interagency group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which considers input from nine members, including representatives the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, Energy and the White House.The committee reviews foreign investments that could pose national security risks.Given the wide ranging input, approval of this sale could not have been Clinton's doing alone.Conditions The conditions of the deal also conflict with any narrative that the sale put the U.S. at risk.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission stipulated that "no uranium produced at either facility [in Wyoming] may be exported."The NRC added that stockpiles cannot leave Canada without the approval of the United States.If exceptions were made, uranium could not be used to make nuclear weapons, pursuant to preexisting nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia.Pay-to-play?The pay-to-play accusations are tricky.While money did flow to the foundation while the decisions were being made, money was also flowing well before Clinton was secretary of state and potentially in a position to influence any decision to approve that deal and also well before Uranium Ones takeover by the Russian firm .For example, the New York Times reported that, from 2009 through 2013, Uranium One's chairman made four donations totaling $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation.Uranium One's predecessor company, UrAsia, also based in Canada, gave lots of money to the Clinton Foundation well before Clinton was secretary of state.In 2006, Canadian mining financier Frank Giustra, who at the time owned UrAsia, gave $31.3 million to the Clinton Foundation.In 2007 UrAsia merged with a South African mining company and became Uranium One.Separately, Bill Clinton spoke at a Moscow conference in June 2010 after the Russian takeover had been announced, but before it had been approved by the committee.He was paid $500,000 by a Russian group with links to the Kremlin, according to financial disclosure documents reviewed by ABC News.Separately, Republicans also want to know if there was an FBI investigation during the Obama administration into the Uranium One deal.Recently the DOJ has cleared an FBI informant to talk to Congress about his undercover efforts to learn more about the Russian nuclear deals in North America.It's unclear what he knows, but the mere existence of this informant has helped fuel speculation there were corrupt dealings involving Clinton.
Congresswoman warns of groping on House floor and other sexual harassment on Capitol Hill:::::Two members of Congress said today that some of their colleagues have engaged in sexual harassment with staffers and others, including exposing their genitals, groping women on the House floor and asking apparently lewd questions such as "are you going to be a good girl?"Interested in Congress?Add Congress as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Congress news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The allegations come as the entertainment industry and others are reeling from dozens of accusations of sexual harassment, assault and rape, propelled by a litany of complaints against director Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein has denied the allegations.The comments came during the House Administration Committee's first hearing to review sexual misconduct policy in the House of Representatives.Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., who revealed in October that she was sexually harassed as a congressional staffer decades ago, said that since she went public with her story, she has been told of two sitting members of Congress who have allegedly engaged in sexual harassment."I have had numerous meetings with phone calls with staffers, both present and former, women and men who have been subjected to this inexcusable and often illegal behavior," she said."In fact, there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, right now, who ... have engaged in sexual harassment."She went on, "These harasser propositions such as, 'are you going to be a good girl.'to perpetrators exposing their genitals, to victims having their private parts grabbed on the House floor.All they ask as staff members is to be able to work in a hostile-free work environment.They want the system fixed, and the perpetrators held accountable."Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., a member of the committee who has served as a Hill staffer, said she was recently alerted to a situation involving another current member of Congress who exposed himself to a female staffer delivering materials to his home."There is a new recognition of this problem and the need for change of culture that looks the other way because of who the offenders are," she said."Whether it's Bill Cosby, Bill O'Reilly, Mark Halperin, Roger Ailes, Kevin Spacey or one of our own, it's time to say no more."Last week the Senate passed a measure requiring harassment training for senators and congressional aides.Shortly after the hearing, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the House will do the same -- requiring anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for members of Congress and staff.Previously, that was left to each member's office.A House-wide policy would require legislation to take effect."Our goal is not only to raise awareness, but also make abundantly clear that harassment in any form has no place in this institution," Ryan said in a statement.On Tuesday, the committee also heard from House administration officials regarding existing procedures to deal with sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.Currently, the Office of Compliance handles sexual harassment charges for legislative branch employees in both the House and Senate.The office has a three-step confidential process that includes counseling and mediation.Speier has proposed mandating harassment training, instituting biannual surveys to address the scope of the problem on Capitol Hill and reforming the "broken" reporting process, which she described as slow and ineffective."Is it any wonder that many staffers never file formal complaints?There is zero accountability and transparency," she said.Barbara Child Wallace, the chair of the Office of Compliance's board of directors, defended the existing process, and told the committee more could be done to raise awareness of the current reporting procedures.
Jeff Sessions authorizes Justice Department to consider investigating Clinton Foundation:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions has authorized senior prosecutors at the Justice Department to evaluate whether allegations regarding the Clinton Foundation and the sale of a uranium company need to be investigated by a special counsel, according to a letter he sent the House Judiciary Committee on Monday night that has since been obtained by ABC News.Interested in Hillary Clinton?Add Hillary Clinton as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hillary Clinton news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sessions is responding to a request to appoint a special counsel sought by Republicans on the committee, the letter reads.The Justice Department has been under pressure from President Donald Trump to investigate the Clinton Foundation and the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian-based company that in 2010 had most of its ownership rights sold to a Russian agency.The U.S. government had to approve the deal because Uranium One produced significant amounts of uranium in the United States.The State Department, which at the time was led by Hillary Clinton, was one of several federal agencies that had to weigh in on the matter.Ultimately, the sale was approved.Republicans are raising questions because around the same time, business associates of Uranium One donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.Sessions had pledged to steer clear of Clinton-related investigations, announcing in March that he would recuse himself "from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way" to Clinton's or Trump's 2016 presidential campaigns.But in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Robert Goodlatte, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd writes, "The attorney general has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters.These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special counsel."Goodlatte had also raised questions about the handling of the Clinton email investigation.Boyd informed Goodlatte that the Department of Justice forwarded a copy of the letter to the department's inspector general, which is investigating former FBI Director James Comey's and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch's handling of the matter.Sessions faces a divided and deeply partisan House Judiciary Committee today.Democrats will be seeking answers from the embattled attorney general about his knowledge of Russia-related contacts by Trump campaign officials.
Trump personally asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to resolve case of UCLA basketball players accused of theft:::::President Donald Trump said he has personally appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help resolve the case of three UCLA men's basketball players who were arrested for alleged shoplifting in China last week and now potentially face lengthy jail time.Interested in China?Add China as an interest to stay up to date on the latest China news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "When I heard about it two days ago, I had a great conversation with President Xi," Trump told reporters on Air Force One shortly after taking off today from Manila, Philippines."What they did was unfortunate.You know, you're talking about very long prison sentences.They do not play games," he said of the Chinese justice system.The Associated Press The three freshmen UCLA basketball players were arrested in China on shoplifting charges last Tuesday.Among the arrested was LiAngelo Ball, younger brother of Los Angeles Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball.Cody Riley and Jalen Hill were also arrested.The men were released on bail early Wednesday morning, but were required to stay in their Hangzhou hotel until the legal process is over, which could take days, weeks or even months, ESPN reported.Xi was "terrific" in response to his request and has indicated he will intervene in the case, Trump said."Hopefully, everything is going to work out, and I know they're very grateful because they were told exactly what happened," he said.Trump, who has branded himself as a tough-on-crime politician, seemed to concede the players' guilt, but said it's a "very, very rough situation with what happened to them."Asked whether he expects the men to be released to the United States soon, Trump said: "I hope so.I hope so."
Trump abruptly concludes Asia tour: 'We've accomplished a lot':::::President Donald Trump today abruptly concluded his nearly two-week maiden tour of East Asia as president, declaring progress on security issues and trade while skipping a final meeting with regional leaders.Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "Weve accomplished a lot.I enjoyed it very much," Trump said, appearing unannounced before cameras in the lobby of a conference center hosting the East Asia Summit."My press I feel so sorry for them.They are exhausted.Would you like to stop in a couple other countries?Because we can do that if you want," he said, motioning to the horde of reporters."Otherwise, we'll go to the plane, and we'll take off, and we'll be landing in Washington in about 22 hours."Trump had extended his itinerary by one day in order to attend the summit plenary session.But with the program running several hours behind schedule, he decided to deliver his remarks over lunch and then bolt."The lunch was great.Everybody was there.They were delayed three hours, as you probably heard.There was a delay for some reason.But we had a lunch, and they let me make my opening my ending remarks at the lunch.So that was really great," he told reporters on Air Force One just after taking off today from Manila.Trump departed just before 3:20 p.m. local time, right on schedule, according to guidance the White House released Monday night.He was due back in Washington late today after a refueling stop in Hawaii.Before leaving, Trump put a positive spin on his visits to five countries, complimenting his hosts and giving special praise to China, where elaborate ceremonies during his stay captured his attention and admiration.He visited Asia with a two-pronged message on free and fair trade and collective security to confront North Korea."I've said very loud and very clear, the U.S. has been taken advantage of.They're very giving, and they don't get in return," Trump said."So we want fair trade, and we want reciprocal trade."He will hold an event later in the week to discuss concrete outcomes of his trip, according to the White House."It's been an incredible 12 days," Trump said."I've enjoyed it immensely.I've made a lot of friends at the highest level."
What all 52 Republican senators say about embattled Alabama candidate Roy Moore:::::A small but growing number of Republican senators are calling for Roy Moore to drop out of the Alabama Senate race, but so far Moore is defiant, insisting he will continue to run.ABC News has reached out to all 52 Republican senators for reaction.Nineteen of them are calling for Moore to withdraw from the race.Five have withheld comment.A majority have qualified their remarks by saying if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside.Not one Republican senator is publicly calling for Moore to stay in the Alabama special election to fill the seat left vacant by now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday he believes the account of the women who have accused Moore of sexual misconduct.The Republican Senate leader's comments mark a change from a few days ago when he said in a statement, "If these allegations are true, he must step aside."Moore, a staunch conservative who gained notoriety as an Alabama Supreme Court judge for putting a monument of the Ten Commandments in a state judiciary building, faces allegations first reported by The Washington Post that he engaged in sexual activity with a 14-year-old when he was 32 and pursued other young women when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was single and in his 30s.Moore has strongly denied the allegations.Because there is no way to remove his name from the ballot, Republicans in the Senate face the dilemma of pulling their support and increasing the chances that a Democrat could take the pivotal seat.Here's how they have responded so far: Calls for Moore to exit the Senate race In addition to McConnell, several senators have clarified their positions on Moores candidacy and are calling for the Alabama candidate to step aside.Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada told ABC News: I believe the women who have come forward.Roy Moore should do what is best for the conservatives of Alabama and step aside."Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina tweeted, "The allegations leveled at Roy Moore are disturbing.I have serious concerns about his prior conduct and fitness for office.He should immediately withdraw from the race."The allegations leveled at Roy Moore are disturbing.I have serious concerns about his prior conduct and fitness for office.He should immediately withdraw from the race.Senator Thom Tillis (@SenThomTillis) November 13, 2017 Sen.

Bob Corker of Tennessee said he thought Roy Moore was a "bridge too far before any of these reports came up.Just due to his previous service and public comments.""Look the people of Alabama are going to decide this, not me," Corker said Tuesday."People up here in Washington making comments that are not positive about him probably just helps him."Corker also suggested in a tweet over the weekend that he had never supported Moore, even before the allegations.Look, I'm sorry, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moore's nomination was a bridge too far.Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 11, 2017 Sen.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa told local reporters Friday: "He should step aside.The trouble is, if he agreed to step aside, his name is still on the ballot.People can still vote for him and he could get elected."Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called for Moore to step aside and said if he does not, the Senate should act to remove him.Young's office provided this statement to ABC News: "After giving Roy Moore ample time to unequivocally deny the disturbing allegations against him, those allegations remain far more persuasive than the denials.Roy Moore should immediately drop out of the race.The appearance of grossly reprehensible behavior disqualifies him from service in the United States Senate.If he does not step aside, we need to act to protect the integrity of the Senate."Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released this statement Monday: "I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office.If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate."Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told reporters on Monday that Moore should "seriously consider" dropping out of the race.Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia told reporters Monday that Moore should step down."The accusations appear more credible than the denial," he said.Sen.

John Cornyn of Texas said in a statement Monday: "I believe the accusations against Roy Moore are disturbing and, if true, disqualifying.The most appropriate course of action, in my view, is to leave the final judgment in the hands of Alabama voters - where it has always belonged - and withdraw my endorsement."Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said on Fox News Monday afternoon, I do think for the conservative movement, for the things that we as conservatives think are important, I think it would be better if someone replaced Judge Moore.He also rescinded his endorsement for Moore on Saturday."Based on the allegations against Roy Moore, his response and what is known, I withdraw support," Cassidy tweeted.Sens.Mike Lee of Utah and Steven Daines of Montana, who were early supporters of Moore, also revoked their endorsements.Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate.Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) November 10, 2017 I am pulling my endorsement and support for Roy Moore for U.S. Senate.Steve Daines (@SteveDaines) November 10, 2017 A spokesman for Sen.

Donald Trump Jr. says he communicated with WikiLeaks during 2016 campaign:::::President Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said Monday that he communicated with representatives from WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign via private message on Twitter.Interested in Donald Trump Jr.?Add Donald Trump Jr. as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump Jr. news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest WikiLeaks made contact with Trump Jr. in late September 2016 and continued communicating with him through the first half of this year, he said.One source told ABC News the conversations were heavy in one direction, with WikiLeaks sending many messages to Trump and Trump responding on a limited basis, often ignoring them.A source close to Trump believes, the person told ABC News, that after WikiLeaks' initial message to him, he sent an email to campaign officials including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner sharing that WikiLeaks made contact, as first reported by The Atlantic.On Monday night, after initial reports of his communications with WikiLeaks surfaced, Trump tweeted what he said were screenshots of the exchanges with WikiLeaks over Twitter's direct message system.Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.How ironic!1/3 pic.twitter.com/SiwTqWtykA Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 14, 2017 Sources confirmed for ABC News that Trump has turned over his correspondence with WikiLeaks to congressional investigators on the House Intelligence and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees as part of the Russia investigations on Capitol Hill and to special counsel Robert Mueller's team.Alan Futerfas, Trump's lawyer, said in a statement to ABC News that his client has cooperated with the various congressional investigations."Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests," Futerfas wrote."Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum."California's Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC News the direct message exchange is "yet another indication of the campaign's willingness at the very highest levels to accept foreign assistance, to accept assistance here with a cutout of the Kremlin that is publishing stolen documents that were obtained by a Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton's campaign.""We just see this web of connections becoming more and more extensive," Schiff said.Vice President Mike Pence's office said he was not aware of Trump Jr.'s communications with WikiLeaks.In October 2016, Pence forcefully denied any coordination between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign."The vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks.He first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight," Pence's press secretary Alyssa Farah said in a statement.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tweeted that he couldn't confirm the communications with Trump.I cannot confirm the alleged DM's from @DonaldJTrumpJr to @WikiLeaks.@WikiLeaks does not keep such records and the Atlantic's presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context.However, even those published by the Atlantic show that: 1/ Julian Assange ??(@JulianAssange) November 13, 2017 WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details.Trump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica.In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications.Thousands of people asked about them.2/ Julian Assange ??(@JulianAssange) November 13, 2017 WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications.3/ Julian Assange ??(@JulianAssange) November 13, 2017

Trump recaps Asia trip, stays mum on Roy Moore Video:::::Transcript for Trump recaps Asia trip, stays mum on Roy Moore I pack my mom and a nod here continuing coverage.President Trump's remarks delivered in the diplomatic room there at the White House he just saw.Fresh off his trip thirteen days abroad.Across Asia we're gonna break panel about what he talked about color bring in my colleague Rick Klein ABC's political director was watching from down in DC break.This was a huge trip for the president a lot of key meetings key conversations.Also big delivery to come back and present that report card to the American people Heidi think he did.I think the report card was the biggest deliverable of the trip this seemed like an attempt to that by the president to recap.Not just the last two weeks but also.The first nine or ten months of his administration and of the greatest hits tore of the world about.His accomplishments there wasn't much that was accomplished on this trip so I think the words actually are important here and the president's casting of it it's almost like an internal have talked.About how this foreign trip but for restaurant.And just in terms of the delivery there as well we can talk a lot about the president.Some people have been saying he seems more presidential he was holding himself back on Twitter a little bit on the triple that that change towards the end.But what do you think about how how he came across in that press conference.Well he came across as thirsty.I think that probably most several part of this will be his his reaching for the water bottle a couple of times reminiscent of the marker rubio moment after a state of the union.A couple of years ago but but short of that not a lot of headlines that were delivered at this again I think it was to sort of more of a recap than anything else.And partially in today's world it's a tweet for everything even tweeted about Marco Rubio is.Statement back in February 2013 saying it was not a good move I want to go already Capitol Hill and our colleague Mary priest senior congressional correspondent.Was watching as well listening to what the president had to say.Very that we were waiting to see the president would answering these questions about Roy Moore you talk a little bit about this on the network's special he ignored questions overseas he ignored questions today.How do we not yet know how the president that the United States feels about this incredibly controversial candidate.I wish we had an answer for that out but like it so often they keys with some of these White House events what's most interesting sometimes as what is not said.Look we know that that from some of the statements that we've seen from the White House from some of his.Top aides that they have said if true if these allegations are true that they would be deeply disturbing that that that Roy Moore would then have to consider perhaps dropping out of the race but it's that if true.Those two words that remain the big question here while many Republicans on Capitol Hill started along that same line in the last.Point 448 hours you've seen a complete turn they are saying now both Mitch McConnell house speaker Paul Ryan that Roy Moore should drop out immediately that the allegations in and of themselves.Are disqualifying but the big question remains does the president agree does he back Republican leaders and if he does well we'll Roy Moore do will he drop out because.That while the sentiment up here on Capitol Hill really is taken a turn against Roy Moore in Alabama it's a very different story.We are teens on the ground there I've heard from many who continue today ardently support him.This presents they'd be a problem for Republicans there in a pickle on this one there's no question this is they heat.Senate seat they don't want to lose it but they also clearly do not.Stand by Roy Moore all or what he's been accused out now the options there are many none of them are particularly great for Republicans you've seen.Mitch McConnell and others suggests the need to get back a write in candidate perhaps even the current attorney general Jeff Sessions might be the right person for that of course this is to fill the seat that he vacated to become.The attorney general but looking got the wreck name recognition he's popular in Alabama he's certainly someone who could.Perhaps come in and work as a write in but again.It doesn't let remarks going anywhere so what do you do then and if Roy Moore does win if he is elected there's the possibility that Republicans up here could move to essentially kicked him out after he's been elected.Even Mitch McConnell it.It's that would be pretty historic and unprecedented potential steps ahead there merry brief plant on Capitol Hill thanks Mary.Also down in DC at Martha Raddatz ABC's chief global affairs anchor rather joins us with watching the president's remarks from the White House and Martha.For all the top hawk the president has run on before he became president.Has talked about since taking office at the White House he did look like he got very confrontational once he actually got down in front of these leaders in Asia.Boy he sure didn't I mean we all think of those those comments.With with China's president saying.You know it's not your fault China sorry about the trade imbalance but it's not your fault we understand.Kind words about Vladimir Putin's saying I believe he means it when he said he didn't interfere with our election heat later said.He supports present from waiters said he.I supports our intelligence agencies but it was hard to forget those prior comments about.Blatter a prudent.This was largely a ceremonial trip you you can't really point to anything substantial.That he did.He did build up relationships he said they've rolled out red carpets everywhere thank you sit with the biggest best red carpet.Anywhere and if those relation relationships do matter they definitely matter but you also wonder whether those foreign leaders looked at Donald Trump and said.This is a president who loves all this pomp he loves all these red carpets we're gonna play to that.So they may have think they and think they had an upper hand there.And again you just go back to what our problems are right now the biggest looming problem.Being North Korea yes that got tougher sanctions we don't know whether those sanctions will do any good.We do know that China could do a lot more to push North Korea they are sending a diplomat over and a couple of days a high ranking.F official.From China to go in to North Korea will CF anything comes of that the president did not name.North Korea a state sponsored terrorism there was some thought that he might do that.That Q is largely symbolic.But it would squeeze North Korea once again and continue to isolate North Korea.Martha Raddatz live there in our Washington DC here out thank you mark.Back now to the White House and that diplomatic room where president trump just deliver it those remarks ABC's.Senior White House correspondent Cynthia Vega was in the room she's now out on the north lawn Cecilia for all the tough talk is be mentioned president.Not coming through with a lot of substantive immaterial.From this trip but they seem to be holding it up as tremendously successful waiting bed that the flag to say that this really really well for them.Yeah I think he called it tremendous strip before he got to the podium today I'm really this is just a chance for the president check.Chat recap his trip I suppose about the filter of reporters who've been covering it because the take away.Of the coverage so far is that as mark was saying is you dissent on that there have been very few tangible deliverables.Out of this trip the expectation I think for many White House observers was that the president would use this speech today.Two as Martha sat at North Korea to the list of state sponsors terror.Countries he did not do that and in a weird way I guess sort of went down a list of countries he visited tick them off the list one by one and and then a lot of reporters at enforcer scratching their heads went down the list of another for a trip he took from Saudi it's Europe so he he really I don't know lab sort of give a little recap they are.I don't you could hear at the end of the of his statement I asked him about Roy Moore that really is the elephant in this room right now in the White House or whether the president.Thinks Roy Moore should drop out of this race and whether the president believes his accusers.The president looked already heard the questions came over.To us as I was asking them.And then waved and walked out so this is not something he wants to talk about right now in any way shape.Perform on the Sicilian being alive for us acts the White House thinks this area.Back over now to Rick Klein and Rick one last question on this trip.I want it to get to you you know for all the things the president talked about before he went over there for all the things he's saying he talked about with foreign leaders has a lot.In there about what he didn't say in front of many of these leaders to calling China to the carpet for.Press freedom to the lack there they are talking about human rights abuses and many of these countries none of that was discussed either in the read out from conversations or in public comments.Yeah this is not confrontational up front on his best behavior and that's one reason he was received as warmly as he was is that there's a lot of fear in the foreign capitals meeting with these leaders.That he would call them out and demand beings in and had a kind of bellicose campaign rhetoric.That was largely thought he was on a lot fest with foreign leaders talking about what a great before he had.With leader after leader.Often it and several times actually the official read out that we heard from the White House was different than we heard from another government.We were told.That but by the American side they did bring up.Human rights with the leader of the Philippines republic at a side it didn't come up just to cite one example so.I think this the president tried to restrain himself the route he also I think that some observers might showed night along the way in thinking that you just talk about things in.And bring a lot of action but clearly the president felt good about this strip and I think that's one reason that he is on on on a torn our an effort now audit to try to hype.What what he was accomplished even it was pretty minimal.To hype and to stay hydrated while he's doing that to we talk about good behavior though and it seem like even his habits were on pretty good behavior while he was overseas.It felt like towards the end of the trip something flipped and all of a sudden we saw trump and full glory on his Twitter account tweeting about everything from Hillary Clinton.You can John Lou two politics back here in the states and sort of a series of tweets.I think he's since we are on that he's been trading with Kim Jong-un saying why would he call insult me by calling the old when I would never call him.Short and fat.But if someone else tweeting kill and that is Roy Moore at Sicilian mentioned the elephant in the room this morning tweeted very strongly saying he is not quitting.At the values he stands for the values that Albanians will vote for.We haven't heard from the president on that yet Rick where are we how is this going to play itself out.Will the president's position is still where it was last week which was that if these allegations are true the expectation on behalf of the White House would be that he kept its out of the race.That's where most Republicans were last Thursday last Friday.This story has shifted significantly since then has more accusers have come out against Roy Moore.And as the the political realities of this of coming to even sharper focus on just in the last.Couple hours we've seen reporting suggesting that internal polling conducted by Republicans suggesting that that Roy Moore would lose badly to the democratic.Candidate and now you've got.Several senators musing openly not just that he to drop out.But that if he were elected president he should be immediately kicked out of the senate.That there should be a very rare mechanism to to disqualify him from office entirely taken out of the senate so if they have picked things up.Quite a bit one person that still defending him of course is the bad and the president's a onetime former for a top eight news now the right part.News agency his reporters have been trying to discredit the allegations he is still publicly on the side of Roy Moore which does lead to be question where's president trot and C going to step in it's not clear that his statement would carry any weight Roy Moore could continue to run.Even if Donald Trump tells me Watson on in and kind of orders and off.But it would matter quite a bit Republican Party this kind of racing with a a fall out of you losing a senate seat.Or or retaining it but having a guy that's so violent they think should be immediately kicked out of the senate.And Rick we had Mitch McConnell weigh in now very publicly talking about the possibility of a write in candidate floating this idea before the election.As even happens now this is on the somebody want to play for you get your take on the back and Mitch McConnell speaking earlier today at the Wall Street Journal conference being asked about Roy Moore here's what he had to say.Roy Moore should withdraw.The women who come forward or completely credible.His campaign news call option.And from Republican point of view it produces.The law.And so I think it's safe to us that if he were to be sworn and he would immediately.Be in a process.Before the senate committee under which.The women would be under will be sworn in he would be ash to.Just girls as well.Would be a rather.Unusual began.And rape as an understatement there are rather than usual beginning that this think Barry real potential problem for the republic into RD have a full plate.Or RD trying to push through some major agenda item to a party very busy trying to do the work.Of doing their work whereas it's gonna end up.Margin could duck it make it.Just that much tighter the Democrat in Alabama line holding that seat at least or 20/20 would be huge blow.Two Republican efforts to retain the senate and retain some kind of control over that body in the coming weeks it should be noted that people like Mitch McConnell.Worked against Roy Moore during the primary sort of president trop actually poll Republican establishment was lined up against them.So that collective weight isn't going to necessarily change Roy Moore is mind.But this is races and other interest impossibility because the name that Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans are talking about as that potential write in candidate.Jeff Sessions the embattled trump attorney general.A we are told that he's happy in his job but the one person and maybe you can make him reconsider that that would be president trump.You would it would need someone with with near universal name ID.Respect inside the Republican Party to pull off a feat like this presumably have to resign as attorney general before involved in politics that you're giving something pretty big up.With the prospect of potentially winning that seat holding for Republicans so that remains one of the wild cards out there but also in none of the scenarios that that the Republicans are outlining now.Often including justice while buying more from out all the Republican batter none of the corporate particularly pretty right now Roy Moore name is on the ballot that

took us to five nations.To meet with dozens of foreign leaders.Participate in three formal state visits and attend three key regional summits.It was along his visit to the region by an American president in more than a quarter of a century.Everywhere we went our foreign host greeted the American delegation.Myself included.With incredible.Warm.Hospitality.And most importantly.Respect.And this great respect.Showed very well our country is further evidence that America's renewed confidence and standing in the world.Has never been stronger than it is right now.When we are confident in ourselves our strength our flag our history our values.Other nations are confident in us.And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve.Other countries treat America with the respect.That our country so richly deserves.During our travels this is exactly.Watt the world saw.A strong.Proud and confident.America.Today I want to update the American people in the tremendous success of this trip.And the progress we've made to advance American security and prosperity.Throughout the year.When I came into office our country was faced with a series.Of growing dangers.These threats included.Rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons.Foreign powers challenging America's influence the spread of the murderous terror group ices.And years of unfair trade practices.That had dangerously depleted our manufacturing base.And wiped out millions and millions of middle class jobs.The challenges were inherited.And these products really show what previous mistakes.Were made over many years even decades.By other administrations.Some of these mistakes were born of indifference.And neglect.Others from naive thinking and misguided judgment.In some cases the negative influence of partisan politics and special entrance.Was to blame.But the one common thread behind all of these problems was a failure to protect.And promote the interests of the American people and American workers.Upon my inauguration I pledge that we would rebuild America restore its economic strength.And defend its national security.With this goal in mind.I about that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit.Of shared goals above all.I swore that in every decision with every action.I would put the best interest of the American people forest.Over the past ten months traveling across the globe and meeting with world leaders that is exactly what I have to.Earlier this year in Saudi Arabia I spoke to the leaders of more than fifty Arab and Muslim nations.About our strategy to defeat terrorists by stripping them of financing territory and ideological support.And I urged the leaders to drive out.The terrorists and extremists from there societies.Since that time we have dealt Tyson's one crushing defeat after an out there.In Israel I reaffirm the unbreakable bond.Between America and the Jewish state and I met with leaders of the Palestinian Authority.And initiated an effort to facility lasting peace between the Israelis.And the Palestinians.In Brussels I urge to our NATO allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance.And set the stage for significant increases.In member contributions.Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in.Because of that initiative.NATO believe me is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.In Warsaw I declare to the world America's resolve to preserve and protect western civilization.And the values we hold so dear.In Rome Sicily hombre.And Paris are strengthened our friendships with key allies to promote our shared interest of security.And prosperity.In September at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.I urge that the nations of the world join.In confronting rogue regimes that threaten humanity.And laid out a model for international cooperation grounded in respect.For sovereignty.And the responsibilities.That come with it.On each trip I have work to advance American interests and leadership in the world.And to each of these places I have carried our vision for a better.A vision for something stronger.And sovereign so important software and independent nations rooted in there histories.Confident in their destinies.And cooperating together to advance their security prosperity.And the noble cause of peace.It was this same vision that I carry agent two weeks ago.And it was this same commitment to you the American people that was always at the forefront of my mind in my thinking.Alec ship was defined by three core goals.First.To unite the world against the nuclear menace posed by the North Korean regime.A threat that has increased steadily through many administrations.And now requires.Urgent action.Second to strengthen America's alliances and economic partnerships and he free and open Indo Pacific.Made up of thriving independent nations respectful.Of other countries and their own citizens.And safe from foreign domination.And economic servitude.And there it.To finally after many years insists horn fair.And reciprocal.Trade.Fair.And reciprocal.Train so important.These two words fairness and reciprocity.Aren't open invitation to every country that seeks to do business with the United States.And they are a firm warning to every country that sheets.Breaks the rules and engages in economic aggression.Like they've been doing in the past especially.In the recent past.That is why we have almost.An 800.Billion dollar a year trade deficit.With other nations unacceptable.We are going to start whittling that down and as fast as possible.With these girls it was my profound honor.To travel on this journey.As your represented.I explained to all of the world leaders.And across Asia.How well the United States is due.Economic growth has been all over 3%.The last two quarters and is going higher.Unemployment.Is at its lowest level in seventeen years.Stock.Market has gained trillions of dollars in value.Since my election and has reached record highs.We are massively increasing our military budget.Two historic levels.The house has just passed a nearly 700 billion dollar defense package and it could not come.At a better time for our nation.Once again our country is optimistic.About the future.Confident in our values and proud of our history.Andy role in the world.I want to thank you reaches of this country for the part you have plane in making this great American comeback possible.In Asia our message was clear.And well received.America is here to compete.To do business and to defend our values and our security.We began our trip in Hawaii.To pay our respects.To brave American service members at Pearl Harbor.And the United States Pacific Command.The guardian of our security and freedom the pro us the Indo Pacific region.As our country prepared to observe veterans day.We remembered the incredible sacrifices in Paris.Of all of the veterans who services preserve.Our liberty and a way up life.That is very special.We also thanked military families for their support.For our brave servicemen and women.From Hawaii we traveled to Japan.A crucial US ally and partner in the region.Upon landing in Japan my First Act was to thank the American service members.And Japanese self defense forces.Who personified.The strength.Of our enduring alliance.Prime minister hobby.And I.Agree on our absolute determination to remain united.To achieve the goal of dean knew her I North Korea.Shortly following our visit.Japan announced additional sanctions.135.North Korean entities and individuals.Japan.And also committed to shouldering.More of the burden of our common defense by reimbursing costs borne by American taxpayers.As well as by making deep investments.In Japan's own military.This will include purchases of US advanced capabilities.From jet fighters.Two missile defense.System is worth many many billions of dollars and jobs for the American work.Prime minister and I also discussed ways we can deepen our trade relationship.Based on the core principles of fairness.And reciprocity.I am pleased that since January of this year.Japanese companies have announced investments in the United States worth more than eight.Billion dollars 171000.Jobs.That on the border that's okay.Liked it.Japanese manufacturers Toyota and Mazda.Announced that they will be opening a new plant in the United States will create 4000 jobs we also signed agreements between our nations to enhance infrastructure.Development increased access affordable energy and advance our foreign policy goals to economic investment.From Japan we traveled to another two yep American ally in Asia.The Republic of Korea.My official state visit to South Korea was the first by an American president in 25 years.Speaking before the national assembly of the Republic of Korea.I spoke the truth about the evil crimes of the North Korean regime.And I made clear that we will not allow this twisted dictatorship.To hold the world hostage to nuclear blackmail.I called on every nation including China and Russia to unite and isolating the North Korean regime.Cutting off all ties of trade and commerce until it stops its dangers of occupation on and this it is.The whole key to what we're doing on DE.No color eyes nation we have to.North Korea we have ended the failed strategy.Of strategic patience and as a results.We have already seen important progress including tough new sanctions from the UN counts.We have a Security Council that has been with us and just about with a us from the beginning.South Korea agreed to harmonize sanctions and joined the United States in sanctioning additional rogue actors.Whoo it's fun and funds have.Helped north period.And North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs it's unacceptable to us the United States welcomed the decision.A president voluntary move the paella.Restrictions.On missiles to combat the North Korean threat.And together we reaffirmed our commitment to a campaign of maximum.Pressure.Like Japan South Korea is increasing its defense contributions.During our meetings president and acknowledged his desire for equitable color sharing through the united states military forces stationed in South Korea.And I visited soldiers at camp conferees.A brand new joint American South Korean base paid for almost entirely by the South Korean government.At that pace I discussed with the United States and South Korean military leaders both military options and readiness to respond to North Korean provocation.Or offensive actions.During our visit president mourn and I also discussed.And direction.We are currently renegotiating.The disasters US Korea trade agreements signed under the previous administration.It has been a disaster for the United States.Last week 42 South Korean companies announced their intent to invest in projects worth more than seventeen billion dollars in the United States.And 24 companies announced plans to purchase 58 billion dollars in American goods and services.From South Korea.Malulani and I traveled to China where as in Japan and South Korea.We were greatly honored by the splendor of our reception.Our trip included differs official dinner.Held for a foreign leader.In the forbidden city since the founding of the modern China where we enjoyed a very productive.Evening hosted by president she.And his wonderful wife bottom Hong.During our visit president she pledged to faithfully implement united nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea.And to use his great economic influence over the regime.To achieve our common call of a president she recognizes.That a nuclear North Korea.Is a grave threat to China and we agreed that we would not accept a so called freeze for freeze agreement.Like those that have consistently failed.In the past.We made that time is running out and we made it clear.And all options remain on the table.I also had a very candid conversation with president she about the need to reduce our staggering trade deficit with China.And for our trading relationship.To be conducted on a truly fair.An equitable basis.We can no longer tolerate unfair trading practices.That steal American jobs wealth and intellectual property.The days of the United States being taken advantage of our all.In China we also announced 250 billion dollars worth in trade investment deals.That will create jobs in the United States.From China I flew to the city of Da Nang in Vietnam.To attend the leaders meeting for APEC.Asia Pacific Economic.Cooperation.There.I spoke to a major gathering of business leaders where are reminded the world of America's historic role in the Pacific.As a force for freedom and for peace.Standing that this proud history I offered our vision for robust trading relationships.In which Indo Pacific nations can all prosper and grow together.I announced that the United States is ready to make bilateral trade deals with any nation in the region.That wants to be our partner in fair and reciprocal trend.We will never again turn a blind eye to trading abuses to cheating.Economic aggression or anything else from countries that profess a belief and open thread but do not follow the rules or live by its principals themselves.No international trading organization can function if members are allowed to exploit the openness of others for unfair economic gains.Trade abuses harm the United States' and its workers.But no more.No more.We will take every trade action necessary to achieve the fair and reciprocal treatment.That the United States has offered to the rest of the world for decades.My message.Has resonate.The 21 APEC leaders for the first time matter recognize the importance of fair and reciprocal train.Recognize the need to address unfair trade practices and acknowledged that the WTO.Is in strong need of reform.These leaders also noted that countries must do a better job following the rules to which they agree.I'd

also met with president Juan.And prime minister four oak do discuss the growing friendship between.Our countries.Our Vietnamese partners are taking new actions to enforce sanctions on North Korea.In addition we committed to expand trade and investment between our countries and we pledged to address.The imbalances.I am particularly pleased that the United States and Vietnam recently announced twelve billion dollars in commercial agreements.Which will include.Ten billion dollars in US content.Finally I visited the Philippines where I met with numerous world leaders at the US ASEAN and East Asia summits.At ASEAN the association of south east.Asian nations we made it clear that no one owns the ocean.Freedom of navigation and overflight are critical to the security and prosperity of all nations.I also met.With the prime ministers of India Australia and Japan to discuss our shared commitment to a free and.Open end of this ethnic.During our visit president do art.Of the Philippines thanked the American people and our armed forces for supporting the recent liberation.Of borrowing.From crisis we pledged to strengthen and deepen our longstanding alliance.At the East Asia Summit.The United States negotiated and signed for important leaders statements on the use of chemical weapons money laundering poverty alleviation.And countering terrorist propaganda and finance.And crucially at both summits and throughout the trip.We asked all nations to support our campaign of maximum pressure for North Korean denuclearization.And they are responding.By cutting trade with North Korea restricting financial ties to the regime and expelling North Korean diplomats and workers.Over the last two weeks we have made historic strides in re asserting American leadership restoring American security.And reawakening.American.Confidence.Everywhere we went.I reaffirm our vision for cooperation between route independent sovereign countries and I made clear that the United States will be a reliable friend.A strong partner and the powerful advocate for its own citizens.The momentum from our trip will launch yes on our continued after.To accomplish the three core objectives I outline.To unite the world against North Korean nuclear threat to promote a free an open Indo Pacific region.And to advance fare and reciprocal economic relations with our trading partners and allies in the

there is no task too great.No dream too large no goal beyond our reach.My fellow citizens America is back.And the future has never looked brighter.Thank you god bless you and god bless the United States of America thank you very much thank you thank you all.I used to present their leaving the diplomatic room refusing to answer questions about Roy Moore that embattled Republican senate candidate down Alabama's been.Faced and allegations of sexual misconduct dating from your teenagers when he was in his thirties.Republican.Support for him on Capitol Hill has collapsed right now the president.Not wanting to weigh in on that with the president to do is give report on his thirteen day visit.To Asia saying the world saw a strong proud and confident America.On that trip he laid out the three goals that he had been in a country by country report unite in the world against North Korea.Strengthening economic alliances and getting fair and reciprocal trail and bring in.Our chief global affairs anchor Martha Raddatz for more on this right now remarkable a couple of ways.Well Martha number one a real broadside against his predecessors they're saying that all of this predecessors.Had made mistakes nigh eve thinking misguided judgment neglect.A failure to protect and promote.American interest president also laid out those goals not a lot of concrete.Evidence of actual lose steps to achieve those goals.Yeah a lot of tough words they're George in the trip had a lot of dazzle he said he was working on relationships.We can Allred called that he had kind words about Vladimir put me at kind words about.China but there was really nothing substantial.Done so we heard a lot of tough words we heard about this confidence but it made me think of the latest ABC Washington Post poll 60%.Of those polls do not trust Donald Trump to act responsibly.With North Korea 53%.Say American leadership.Has gotten weaker.Under president trump and we still have that looming problem of North Korea.President trump was handed that problem if we don't already we will have the North Korea capable of putting a nuclear weapon.On an Intercontinental ballistic missile but that remains a huge problem and a huge threat that is yet to be so.Although the rhetoric on North Korea over the last several weeks Martha has been toned down and that.It it seems to have been toned down.And North Korea hasn't launched a missile or had any tests in well over a month and that's something everyone is looking at they're not sure.Why that happened but the president on this trip specifically did toned down its rhetoric except for that one tweak.Where it called Kim Jung on short fast.Yeah after he was called old I can just not a cure arthritis thanks very much when it at a Capitol Hill right now our chief congressional correspondent Mary Bruce there.On Capitol Hill you heard the president he did hear the president talk about Roy Moore there even though he's said he was gonna address this when he got back in the United States perhaps we'll hear from them.On another front but as I said.As the president refusing is refusing to speak out right now Republicans on Capitol Hill completely abandoned Roy Moore.Get short and it's pretty remarkable to think that right now we still don't know Weydert the president stands exactly in his absence we have seen a weighing of Republican leaders coming out now saying that they believed that Roy Moore should drop out of the race that the allegations in and of themselves.Are disqualifying Bolton does the president agree with that that still remains to be the big question and it's worth a reminder that the president taking a position on this if he does agree with Republican leaders.He's not without risk because right now it does not look like Roy Moore is going anywhere he has been define it would he agree wouldn't comply.With the president working to call for him to drop out just a short while ago George Roy Moore tweeted and I quote.Me will not quit.There were more says he's staying in no matter what the election is set.4 December 12 some new polls now coming out showing for the first time that perhaps a Democrat Doug Jones is leading in that race a long way to go there.There we much more tonight on world news with David near you can also get the latest news any time I download BBC news that I'll see

Jeff Sessions in House Judiciary Committee hearing: 'I don't recall' Video:::::Transcript for Jeff Sessions in House Judiciary Committee hearing: 'I don't recall' different yesterday a house judiciary committee grilled attorney general Jeff sessions on what he knew about the current white house's resident about his dealings with Russia."The Washington post" noted there was a theme to these proceedings.Take a look.I don't recall.I don't recall.I don't recall.You don't recall.I don't recall.I do not recall.I don't recall.The gentleman keeps say he does not recall.I don't recall.I don't recall.I don't recall.I don't recall him saying that.I can't imagine your memory would fail you so much.They all seem to have amnesia when it comes to Russia.It's like her piece.It's like a virus they have.How long do you think the committee is going to accept the memory loss.I think they can accept it for a long time.It's a legal term of art.If you say I don't recall or I don't remember you can't be prosecuted for personal because you didn't knowingly lie.That's why he's using it.During the whole hearing yesterday Jeffrey asserted session previously criticized Hillary Clinton for her lack of recall during an FBI interview and said intentionally forgetting -- session said intentionally forgetting might be criminal.He said do you believe the intentional failure to remember can constitute a criminal act?Sessions responded if it's an act to deceive yeah.It's very difficult to prove that.Akeem and I went to school together.He's very smart.Campaigns are chaotic animals in nature.The trump campaign was next level.Four different campaign managers.Highly unusual.I never heard anyone having more than that.It was deeply chaotic.I have been in rooms during strategy meetings where there were so many people in the room.Is there a realm of memory he didn't know George papadopoulos who was described as a coffee boy, yes it's possible.What's unusual is the content of Russia.He remembers he said he can't talk about that.As a lawyer when someone doesn't recall the first time you can almost forgive it.Don't you've say as my client you messed up once.Now you've need to think about everything.You can refresh someone's recollection.At the very least isn't this bad memory a disqualifying feature of someone in that position.The attorney general.Not necessarily.I always forget to let the audience clap.I'm sorry.The one thing I'll say they were bad about paper trails on this campaign trail which is also unusual.You know never put anything in writing.Now we have these messages between wikileaks and don Jr.If there is a smoking gun -- Don Jr. -- Steve Cohen also tried to figure out his opposition to marijuana.Sessions has been crazy on this.Last year sessions said U.S.Leaders should send a message good people don't smoke marijuana.I know a lot of good people.Here's what's wonderful, when representative Steve Cohen said to him how about this man and this man.Ex presidents just various people.Medical marijuana.Who in their lifetime said I smoked -- I didn't inhale.Do you think they're bad people?Are you saying they're bad people?He kind of sad -- Then honey I'm a real bad person.The problem with this argument too is as conservatives we're supposed to be for limited government.The idea of this over reach on marijuana is outdate.The argument you can tax it and the economic benefits from marijuana and the legalization of it I don't understand why we're not having this conversation.Doesn't marijuana hurt your memory.Maybe he was stoned the whole time.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Senate committee considers president's power to launch nuclear weapons Video:::::Transcript for Senate committee considers president's power to launch nuclear weapons Processed meats the president has the sole authority in of that war.Whether we are responding to a nuclear attack or not.Once that order is given and verified there's no way to revoke it to be clear.I would not support changes that would reduce our deterrence of adversaries.Or reassurance.Of our allies.But I would like to explore as their predecessors and ousted 41 years ago.The realities of this system.US nuclear forces operate under strict civilian control.Only the president of the United States can order the employment of US nuclear weapons.And the president's ability to exercise that authority and direction.Is insured by people processes and capabilities.That comprise the nuclear command and control system.This is a system controlled by human means nothing happens automatically.The nuclear decision process includes assessment review and consultation.Between the president and key civilian and military leaders.Followed by transmission and implementation of any presidential decision by the forces themselves.All activity surrounding nuclear weapons are characterized by layers of safeguards tests and reviews.Finally I think it's important to remember that the united states military doesn't blindly follow or worse.A presidential order to employ US nuclear weapons must be legal.The basic legal principles of military necessity distinction and proportionality.Applied nuclear weapons just as they do to every other weapon.This system is not a button that the president can accident in Leno against in on the desk.And immediately cause missiles to fly as some people in the public I think are a fear it would be.It requires the president to work with military aides who are attending him Manila who have possession of the materials that he needs an a requires.Personnel at all levels as strong man all the way down to the missile silo.To.Carry out and ordered the president by himself cannot press a button and cause missiles to fly.He can only given authenticated order which others would follow and then cause missiles fly.I don't think that the assurances that I've received today.Will be satisfying.I want to the American people I think they can still realize that Donald Trump.Can launch nuclear codes just as easily as he can uses Twitter account.Without the check and balance that the United States congress.Would be seeking and constitutionally responsible to exercise.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
As national party abandons Moore, Bannon and Alabama GOP dig in:::::As the charges of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore continue to plague his campaign and have driven most national Republicans to call for him to leave the race, the embattled candidate is still receiving support from two critical sources: Steve Bannon and Alabama Republicans.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Moore has maintained that the allegations against him, which first came to light in a report by The Washington Post, are not true, and has begun to mount a legal defense against news outlets he claims have published false allegations against him.I know a lot of good men, a lot of good women.But from who I know in Roy Moore, I know no better man, said Trenton Garmon, a lawyer representing Moore, told MSNBC today.Garmon also added that he believes Moores denials of any sexual misconduct, and alluded to evidence that he said could exonerate Moore of any wrongdoing.He did not provide any evidence to support his claims but indicated he would present his defense in court.In the same MSNBC interview, while Garmon stated a relationship between a 32-year-old man and a 14-year-old would be wrong, he also suggested that relationships with young women are acceptable in other cultures around the world.Top Republicans from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to House Speaker Paul Ryan have joined the growing chorus of national party leaders demanding that Moore drop out of the race, with McConnell suggesting last night at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should be considered for a potential write-in candidacy.Despite the outcry, Bannon, who supported Moore over Trumps favored primary candidate, Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., has publicly defended Moore since the accusations were published in the Washington Post last week.The Daily Beast reported Tuesday night that Bannon has been revisiting his support for Moore, but three sources close to him denied this account to ABC News.Every time I talk to him, its when are we saving Judge Moore?None of this is true, said one source close to Bannon.Brynn Anderson/AP, FILE Another source close to the conservative firebrand and Breitbart founder added: Hes still with him.Moore has been campaigning for the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and managed to win the party nomination against Strange, who was endorsed by many Republicans in Washington, D.C., including the president.Bannon has been on the record defending Moore since the story broke and has supporters on the ground in Alabama campaigning for Moore.News reports of Bannons reservations toward Moore surfaced on Tuesday while he was in Japan for a speaking event."The Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump, is the same Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore," Bannon said at a speech in Manchester last week.Bannon declined to comment today.Alabama Republicans thus far have stood staunchly behind Moore, and the state party chairwoman released a statement earlier this week discouraging any talk of a write-in challenge to Moore."It would be a serious error for any current elected GOP official or candidate to publicly endorse another partys candidate, an independent, a third party or a write in candidate in a general election as well.I have heard of no Alabama GOP elected official or candidate that is even considering this option, Alabama GOP Chairwoman Terry Lathan said in a statement.Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks also defended Moore, telling ABC News on Tuesday, I believe that the Democrats will do great damage to our country.In another show of local support for Moore, the Shelby County Republican Party passed a resolution of support for his candidacy last night and urged other Republicans in the state to unite around Moore to defeat his Democratic rival Doug Jones."Roy Moore has been a consistent proponent of the positions of the Alabama Republican Party, including conservative fiscal policy, pro-life and traditional family values, less government regulations and interference -- with an emphasis on personal freedoms, the resolution read in part.Moore himself has remained defiant in the face of the accusations against him, and shows no signs that he is leaving the race anytime soon, announcing on Twitter today, We will not quit.
Moore campaign remains defiant amid sexual misconduct allegations:::::The attorney representing embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore defended him Wednesday against the sexual misconduct allegations that have driven many in the GOP to call on Moore to drop out of the race.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest In a press conference outside the Alabama Republican Party headquarters in Birmingham this afternoon, Moore's attorney Phillip Jauregui and Moore's campaign chairman Bill Armistead stood by the candidate and challenged the story of one of Moore's accusers, Beverly Young Nelson."In the cases where it's true, it's horrible for the person making the accusations," Jauregui said, "When the allegations are made and it's not true, it's also horrible for who the allegations are directed against."Among the challenges to Nelson's story presented by Jauregui was the assertion that the handwriting in the yearbook she held up at a press conference earlier this week with her attorney Gloria Allred does not match other samples of Moore's handwriting.Jauregui said that Moore's legal team has sent a letter to Allred demanding the original yearbook be released so that a "neutral custodian" can examine the handwriting.Jauregui also said that in 1999, when Moore was a circuit court judge in Alabama, his signature appears on documents relating to Nelson's divorce from her husband at the time, Ervine Lee Harris.Moore's signature does appear on documents obtained by ABC News related to Nelson's divorce proceedings from 1999.In the press conference in which she detailed the alleged misconduct by Moore, Nelson did not say Moore signed an order relating to her divorce.Neither Jauregui nor Armistead took questions from the media during the press conference.In a statement released Wednesday in response, Allred said she would release the original yearbook on the condition that the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Select Committee on Ethics hold hearings regarding the allegations against Moore and again said Nelson is willing to testify under oath regarding Moore's misconduct."The time has come for Roy Moore to announce whether he is willing to be examined under oath concerning his conduct with regard to the five accusers before the Senate committees," she said.Allred also urged the committees to "subpoena Roy Moore to testify under oath about his denials of the accusations made against him."Moore has remained defiant in the face of growing pressure from top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have called for him to step aside and have suggested a write-in challenger should enter the race.On Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, Moore said the allegations were nothing more than an attempt to keep him out of the Senate by the Republicans and Democrats who did not support President Donald Trump.
Trump says he was focused on 'fair and reciprocal trade' in Asia:::::President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was focused on "fair and reciprocal" trade in Asia."Trade abuses harm the United States and its workers, but no more," he said at the White House."My message has resonated.The 21 [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] leaders, for the first time ever, recognized the importance of fair of reciprocal trade, recognized the need to address unfair trade practices, and acknowledged that the [World Trade Organization] is in strong need of reform," Trump said.The remarks came a day after the president returned from a nearly two-week trip to Asia, where he visited Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.Earlier in the week, Trump stressed the business deals he said American companies had inked during the trip, but was cryptic about whether the visit had produced any concrete bilateral agreements."We've made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know, in addition to about $300 billion in sales to various companies, including China that was $250 billion and going up very substantially from that," he said Monday in Manila.On the way home, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that much of the progress he had made during the trip was interpersonal."I think we made a lot of progress, just in terms of relationship," he said.
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson will oppose current GOP tax bill:::::Republican Sen. Ron Johnson will oppose the Senate tax plan as written, his office confirmed Wednesday.The lawmaker from Wisconsin is the first GOP senator to explicitly say he will not back the tax proposal.Johnson told The Wall Street Journal that the bill benefits corporations more than other businesses."If they can pass it without me, let them," he told the newspaper, which first reported his opposition."I'm not going to vote for this tax package."Johnson's opposition adds uncertainty to the GOP goal of chopping tax rates on businesses and individuals by the end of the year.Other Republican senators have raised concerns about budget deficits fueled by tax cuts, though none other than Johnson have publicly opposed the bill, yet.Johnson could end up voting for the Senate bill, as it still may change before the full Senate votes.He initially opposed one version of the Senate's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act this summer, before eventually voting for it.Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats in the Senate.If all Democrats and independents oppose it, the GOP can only lose two votes and still pass the plan with the simple majority needed under special budget rules.GOP senators hope to pass their bill as soon as the week after Thanksgiving.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, released a revised version of the bill Tuesday night.Among the biggest changes, it would make most individual rate cuts expire after 2025, while the corporate tax rate would get reduced permanently.It also would effectively repeal the Obamacare individual mandate.The move gives senators more room to comply with budget rules, but it could lead to an estimated 13 million more people uninsured and increase average health-care premiums, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.In the Journal interview, Johnson expressed concerns about the treatment of pass-through businesses, which pay individual income tax rates.The Senate bill would give those businesses tax breaks, while the House plan cuts the rate they pay to 25 percent.In a statement released later Wednesday, Johnson said that "neither the House nor the Senate bill provide fair treatment" for pass-through businesses, "so I do not support either in their current versions.""I do, however, look forward to working with my colleagues to address the disparity so I can support the final version," he said.Johnson also told the newspaper that he has felt shut out of the process of making the bill, calling it "offensive."Programming note: Johnson will appear on CNBC's "Squawk Box" at 7:30 a.m.ET on Thursday.
Voters disapprove of Republican tax reform plan, Quinnipiac poll says:::::The Republican tax plan appears to have a public opinion problem.Most American voters 52 percent disapprove of the GOP proposals to overhaul the tax system, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday.Only 25 percent of respondents approve of the Republican effort.The GOP says its push to chop taxes on businesses and individuals by year-end is designed to trim the burden on middle-class taxpayers while boosting job creation and wage growth.Voters largely have not bought into the message, the Quinnipiac poll found.Sixty-one percent of voters said the plan would mainly help the wealthy.Twenty-four percent responded that it would primarily benefit the middle class, while only 6 percent said the same about low-income people.The proposals favor the rich at the expense of the middle class, 59 percent of respondents said.Only 33 percent disagreed with that statement.Only 36 percent of respondents said the GOP effort will lead to more jobs and better economic growth.A majority, 52 percent, disagreed.Thirty-six percent of voters said the proposals would not have much of an effect on their taxes.Thirty-five percent said the plan would increase what they pay, while 16 percent said it would reduce their tax burden.Poor public approval of the plan could give more fodder to Democratic arguments that Republican tax bills would not do enough to help the middle class.House and Senate Republicans have crafted separate, but largely overlapping, bills that would chop corporate taxes and tweak the individual tax system.The House aims to pass its plan Thursday, while the Senate wants to approve its bill during the week after Thanksgiving.If the chambers pass their own bills, they will have to reconcile them.Lawmakers would create a unified plan to approve and send to President Donald Trump's desk.Major analyses so far have estimated that versions of the bills would cut the tax burden on most Americans.However, millions of middle-income people could end up seeing a tax increase, due to changes to provisions like state and local tax deductions.Both bills would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.On the individual side, the plans get rid of the personal exemption, nearly double the standard deduction, either narrow or repeal the estate tax and reduce the tax burden on pass-through businesses.Under the latest Senate proposal, most individual rate cuts would expire, while corporate reductions would be permanent.The bill would also effectively repeal the Obamacare individual mandate, a politically contentious measure that would lead to an estimated 13 million more people uninsured by 2027.The bills treat some deductions differently.The House plan curbs the mortgage interest deduction and keeps a deduction for state and local property taxes.The Senate bill does not change the cap on the mortgage interest deduction and scraps all state and local deductions.The nationwide Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,577 voters from Nov. 7 to Nov. 13.It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Most Americans want Obamacare mandate ended until they hear effects:::::Most Americans favor ending Obamacare's requirement that people have health coverage but a majority opposes the idea after learning how it would affect people and insurance prices, a new poll has found.The same poll found that relatively few Americans consider a tax reform bill a priority despite the strong ongoing push by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to pass such legislation.Ranking much higher as priorities for the public are reauthorization of funding for the government's Children's Health Insurance Program, hurricane recovery funding, stabilizing Obamacare marketplaces and addressing a prescription painkiller epidemic.The Kaiser Family Foundation poll comes as the Senate is considering a tax reform bill that would kill the Obamacare individual mandate.The mandate imposes a financial penalty on Americans who lack health insurance coverage of some kind and who don't qualify for an exemption from the rule.Repealing the individual mandate would free up almost $340 billion in federal funds that Republicans want applied to tax cuts.Fifty-five percent of respondents to the poll supported at least initially eliminating the mandate as part of a tax-reform bill, according to Kaiser, a leading health policy research group.Forty-two percent initially opposed the idea.But the numbers abruptly switched when respondents were "presented with facts and arguments about who is impacted and potential consequences of its repeal," Kaiser said.About one-third of the supporters of the mandate's repeal or 20 percent of the public overall switch to opposing repeal once they hear what could happen.Sixty-two percent of respondents opposed repeal of the mandate after hearing that most Americans automatically satisfy the rule because they already have health coverage through a job, or from Medicare, Medicaid or another public program.Sixty percent oppose repeal after hearing it would lead individual insurance plan prices to be 10 percent higher than they otherwise would be if the rule remained in place.And 59 percent said they opposed repeal after being told that it would lead to 13 million more people being without health insurance over the next decade than are currently projected.The same percentage opposed repeal when told that no one is penalized for not having insurance coverage if the cost of coverage takes up too much of their income.It is not clear that the idea of repealing the mandate will survive in the Senate, or in the entire Congress if Senate Republicans manage to pass a bill containing that provision.GOP leaders in the Senate failed repeatedly earlier this year to pass Obamacare replacement bills that would have ended the mandate.The bills died because a handful of Republican senators worried about the effects of the bills on the number of people with coverage and on insurance premiums.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that over the next 10 years 13 million more people would become uninsured and premiums would rise by 10 percent if the mandate were eliminated.CBO also has estimated repeal would reduce the federal deficit by $339 billion.The savings would come from reduced spending on subsidies that lower premium costs for most Obamacare customers.Just 28 percent of Americans told the Kaiser poll that they viewed tax reform as a top priority for Congress and President Donald Trump.That is much less than the number 62 percent who said the same thing about reauthorizing funding for CHIP, the health coverage program for kids.Congress let CHIP's funding authorization lapse at the end of September, and so far has not approved new money for the program.Sixty-one percent of respondents viewed hurricane recovery funding as a top priority for Congress and the White House.And 48 percent said stabilizing Obamacare marketplaces was a top priority.Just 29 percent of people said that repealing Obamacare was a top priority.The Kaiser poll was conducted in the past week and questioned 1,201 adults on the telephone.The margin of error for the poll is 3 percentage points.
CFPB director Richard Cordray to step down at the end of November:::::Richard Cordray, the embattled head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said Wednesday he will step down before the end of the month.Cordray had been under fire from congressional Republicans almost from the time he took over the bureau, which emanated from the Dodd-Frank reforms following the financial crisis.He announced the resignation in an email to employees."As I have said many times, but feel just as much today as I ever have, it has been a joy of my life to have the opportunity to serve our country as the first director of the Consumer Bureau by working alongside all of you here," he wrote.His departure was not unexpected.Sources earlier this month told CNBC that President Donald Trump was ready to sack Cordray but was afraid of turning him into a Democratic hero.The White House's reaction to Cordray's departure was reserved."The administration will announce an acting director and the president's choice to replace Mr. Cordray at the appropriate time," Raj Shah, deputy press secretary, said in a statement.In addition to the political fire in Washington, Cordray has long been speculated as a potential candidate for Ohio governor.He made no mention of his plans in the email.The CFPB has been a sore spot among GOP leaders who view the bureau as the poster child for postcrisis regulatory overreach.On the other hand, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) praised Cordray for "standing up to abusive financial institutions.""Richard Cordray is a true champion for American consumers.Under his outstanding leadership, the Consumer Bureau has made the financial marketplace stronger and fairer for hardworking Americans across the country," Waters said in a statement.Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair said Cordray's biggest accomplishments will be i reshaping mortgage lending standards, stronger enforcement and a greater watchdog presence over big Wall Street banks."None of that consumer focus was really present in our bank regulatory system prior to the CFPB's creation," Bair said on CNBC's "Power Lunch."The full text of Cordray's message to employees: Dear Colleagues, I wanted to share with each of you directly what I have told the senior leadership in the past few days, which is that I expect to step down from my position here before the end of the month.As I have said many times, but feel just as much today as I ever have, it has been a joy of my life to have the opportunity to serve our country as the first director of the Consumer Bureau by working alongside all of you here.Together we have made a real and lasting difference that has improved people's lives, notably: $12 billion in relief recovered for nearly 30 million consumers; stronger safeguards against irresponsible mortgage practices that caused the financial crisis and hurt millions of Americans; giving people a voice by handling over 1.3 million complaints that led to problems getting fixed for vast numbers of individuals, and creating new ways to bring financial education to the public so that people can take more control over their economic lives.None of this could have happened without all of us being dedicated to pull together in supporting and protecting people and making every consumer count.I will always be immensely proud of you and what you have done.At the same time, there is always more work that lies ahead.That would be true at any point, of course, and one thing I have tried to reinforce this year is that the Consumer Bureau is far more than its director.I am confident that you will continue to move forward, nurture this institution we have built together, and maintain its essential value to the American public.And I trust that new leadership will see that value also and work to preserve it perhaps in different ways than before, but desiring, as I have done, to serve in ways that benefit and strengthen our economy and our country.My gratitude and appreciation for what you mean to me and to our nation is deep and lasting, and I will be taking the opportunity to make that clear to you in person over the days ahead.Thank you!RC With reporting by CNBC's Michelle Fox.
Senate bill boosts taxes on stock sales:::::Heads up, investors: A provision in the Senate's tax plan would take away your ability to pick and choose which stock shares you unload when you go to sell.If the move is included in final legislation, investors would pay an estimated $2.7 billion more in taxes over a decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation."It's a good move as far as tax reform goes because it simplifies taxes, but it will leave investors with fewer choices when they sell stock, and they'll pay more in taxes," said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.Under current law, investors with taxable brokerage accounts have a couple of choices when putting in a sell order for stock shares: They can tell their broker to sell the oldest shares first (the first-in-first-out or FIFO method) or direct the sale of shares that were purchased on a particular date (specific identification method).For holdings in a taxable mutual fund, investors get a third choice that could be retained under the Senate bill: using the average costs of the shares.
Gary Cohn looks for assurances from CEOs on tax plan, gets crickets:::::Gary Cohn looks for assurances from CEOs on tax plan, gets crickets 8 Hours Ago | 01:09 The White House searched for assurance this week that its tax plan would boost business investment, but didn't exactly get what it was looking for.Appearing Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council conference in Washington, chief Trump administration economic advisor Gary Cohn watched with dismay when attendees were asked whether the reform bill would cause them to spend more on growth.Only a few responded."Why aren't the other hands up?"Cohn asked, according to multiple press accounts.The moment provided a reminder for a fundamental issue the proposal faces: What if Congress agrees to cut taxes for business and lets companies return overseas profits at a one-time reduced tax rate, but corporate America doesn't respond?One of the overriding issues with the plodding post-Great Recession recovery has been the lack of business investment.The administration is hoping that lower tax rates coupled with a path to bring back home the $2.5 trillion or so of overseas cash would generate the kind of investment that would boost growth to 3 percent or 4 percent a year.However, multiple indicators show that tax changes alone won't do the trick.For one thing, the last time the government tried repatriation, in 2004, companies spent the bigger share of the money on share buybacks and dividends.Some of the biggest beneficiaries, in fact, actually cut staff then.Second, companies already have indicated that much of the benefits they get from tax cuts won't go directly to growth-related activities.A Bank of America Merrill Lynch corporate risk management survey over the summer found that 65 percent of companies would first use their savings to pay down the $6 trillion corporate debt tab for U.S. companies.Share repurchases were next at 46 percent while mergers and acquisitions ranked third at 42 percent.Capital expenditures were all the way down at fourth at just 35 percent.(The numbers don't add up to 100 percent because BofAML told companies to check all uses that apply.)Of course, there was some good news for the tax bill this week.Some of the political roadblocks that were standing in the way seemed to fade.In fact, Goldman Sachs said it now gives an 80 percent chance that a bill will be passed by early 2018, up from 65 percent previously.That would give President Donald Trump a legislative victory and possibly add more fuel to the stock market rally, which has been flagging lately."The tax reform debate is moving forward faster than we or most other observers expected," Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a note to clients.Hatzius said the key is that cost estimates for the bill have been reduced below the $1.5 trillion threshold legislators had set for passage.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.WATCH: House Speaker Paul Ryan gives his latest assessment of the tax bill.
If corporate tax reform fails, US companies will bolt from America, House Speaker Paul Ryan says:::::U.S. companies won't tolerate failure on corporate tax reform, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday."We've already seen a rash of inversions," the Wisconsin Republican said on CNBC, referring to the practice of U.S. companies merging with foreign firms in lower tax countries, and then redomiciling there."[If] we don't get this done, those companies sitting back and waiting for us to fix this tax code are going to leave," he predicted on "Squawk Box."Ryan's comments came as the House and Senate work on separate tax overhaul plans in hopes of passing a bill for President Donald Trump to sign by year-end.In a CNBC interview last week, top Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn also warned about inversions.The director of the National Economic Council, who used to be the No.2 executive at Goldman Sachs, said, "Look, a year ago, I was on the other side of this equation.I was advising companies how to get out of the burdensome U.S. tax system.We were talking about inversions; we were talking about moving companies out of the United States."In light of his current role in the administration, Cohn said he does not regret his efforts at Goldman."I didn't feel guilty because boards have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.That's what they're supposed to do.So, you know what?We're going to make America competitive.We're going to make it compelling for people to build their companies in America."In Wednesday's CNBC interview, Ryan made the case for how to create a more attractive business environment in America.He cited three main corporate tax changes, including cutting the federal rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; allowing immediate "full expensing" of capital expenditures; and switching to a "territorial system" that would not subject American companies to U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.The current "worldwide system" in the U.S., which requires companies to pay U.S. taxes on earnings wherever they are generated, penalizes American companies that want to bring foreign income back home, Ryan said."They basically don't as a result.That's why we have $3 trillion in cash parked overseas in the first place," Ryan said."Unlocking that brings that money home.But unlocking that also puts us on a better level playing field."In addition to a move to a "territorial system," the House approach proposes a one-time "tax holiday" rate of 12 percent on cash returns and 5 percent on non-cash repatriated from overseas."When you combine 'full expensing,' which will be effective immediately, with a rate cut, with repatriation, it says the incentive is to invest in America," Ryan said."Getting from the last of the country pile, meaning the highest industrial world tax rate, to one of the best tax rates, we really are convinced that that's going to give us faster economic growth and higher wage growth."
The Senate GOP bill would double the child tax credit, which pleases two skeptical senators:::::Tweaks to the Senate tax plan include a change that will help to ease the concerns of two Republican senators.Under the revisions released Tuesday night, the child tax credit would double from $1,000 per child.The previous Senate plan called for raising the credit to $1,650.Sens.Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, pushed for a $2,000 per child credit, saying it would provide more relief to middle-income taxpayers.They cheered the move after the amended bill's release.In a tweet, Rubio called the change "good news for working families" and added, "we are making progress."Lee tweeted that he was "thrilled" about the revision and said it could give "unprecedented tax relief for working moms and dads."President Donald Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka, has also pushed for a larger child tax credit.Senate Republicans, who hold 52 of 100 seats, need every vote they can get to pass their tax plan.They can only lose two votes and still approve a tax bill with the majority needed under special budget rules.The Senate Finance Committee aims to approve the bill this week.Republicans want the full Senate to pass it during the week after Thanksgiving.The House GOP hopes to pass its version on Thursday.Major analyses of versions of the Senate plan have estimated that most Americans would have a lower tax burden if it passed.However, millions are expected to see tax increases under the bill, due to the elimination of provisions like state and local tax deductions.Under the revised Senate bill, individual tax cuts would also expire after 2025.A corporate tax reduction would be permanent.Read more about the revised Senate tax plan here.
Trump appears to tweet condolences to the wrong shooting victims:::::President Donald Trump tweeted condolences after a gunman killed four people and wounded at least 10, including children, in Rancho Tehama, California.The only problem was that Trump's tweet Tuesday night, hours after the latest rampage, was addressed to Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were gunned down more than a week earlier, on Nov. 5.In his Tuesday tweet, Trump made no mention of California, or Rancho Tehama, or the elementary school that was targeted by the gunman.
Obamacare enrollment at 1.48 million, up more than 46 percent over last year's pace:::::Enrollments on the federal Obamacare marketplace were 46 percent higher in the first two weeks of November from the same period last year, officials said Wednesday.A total of 1,478,250 people signed up on HealthCare.gov since Nov. 1, the start of open enrollment in individual health insurance plans, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Last year, 1,008,218 people signed up in the first two weeks.CMS also reported that the number of people applying for coverage and visiting HealthCare.gov was sharply higher than in the same period last year.The brisk pace of sign-ups and customer interest comes despite fears by Obamacare advocates that enrollment would significantly decreasebecause of hostile actions by the Trump administration.Among other things, the administration has slashed budgets for Affordable Care Act outreach and advertising and ordered federal health officials not to participate in state events that encourage enrollment.Advocates also are concerned that sign-ups will be tamped down by the fact that the enrollment season on the federal exchange is only about half the length of last season.The new enrollment tally comes a day after Senate Republican leaders said they will seek repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have some form of health insurance coverage during the year or pay a tax penalty.A leading Obamacare advocacy group, Get America Covered, on Wednesday said that the average daily rate of enrollments on HealthCare.gov is 60 percent higher than it was last year.That statistic takes into account the fact that the 11 day reporting period by CMS this year is one day shorter than the enrollment snapshop released for the first two weeks last year.This year, an average of 134,386 people per day are signing up, compared to 84,018 people per day last year, according to Get America Covered, which is run by two former Obama administration health officials.The group said that the widespread availability of "zero dollar" Obamacare plans is likely boosting enrollment so far this year.Most people who buy coverage on an Obamacare exchange qualify for federal subsidies that reduce their premiums, and more people than ever are able to buy a plan that will personally cost them nothing in premiums this season because of that financial assistance.The enrollment snapshot released by CMS on Wednesday details sign-ups on HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange that sells individidual plans in the 39 states that do not operate their own Obamacare marketplaces.Not all state-based marketplaces have released their own tallies.But California, the biggest state-run exchange, earlier reported that enrollments on the first day of sign-ups were 25 percent higher than last year.While the Covered California has not provided further updates, a leading seller of Obamacare coverage in the Los Angeles area, LA Care Health Plan, told CNBC on Wednesday its enrollment this sign-up season is 40 percent higher than last season.About 7,000 of those customers are new enrollees, with roughly 3,500 existing customers, according to the company.Maryland said its enrollment pace was double last year's in the first week; Washington state reported 53 percent higher enrollment in the first eight days; and Rhode Island saw five times the number of enrollees in the first week from last year.CMS said 876,788 people selected an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov from Nov. 5 through last Saturday.Of those people, 208,397 were new customers, and 668,391 were returning customers.Cumulatively, 345,719 new customers have selected plans on HealthCare.gov since enrollment began Nov. 1.And 1,232,531 customers have renewed coverage on that exchange.The number of consumers on applications for coverage submitted to HealthCare.gov was 2.92 million in the first two weeks, or about 42 percent higher than the number of consumers on applications during the first two weeks of last year's enrollment period.The number of unique users on the federal website was 5.8 million in the first two weeks of this season, or 28 percent higher than the number of users last year.Open enrollment on HealthCare.gov ends Dec. 15.The sign-up season is longer, and ends on various days, on most state-run exchanges.People who do not have insurance coverage during 2018 are subject to a tax penalty that is the higher of $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income.However, many uninsured people can avoid the penalty if they qualify for a wide range of exemptions.
Orrin Hatch changes Senate Republican tax reform plan:::::Changes to the Senate GOP's tax plan include a proposal to reduce many taxes on individuals only temporarily but permanently chop the corporate rate.The tweaks by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on Tuesday largely move to make the bill comply with Senate budget rules.Even before the revisions were finalized, the panel's ranking member Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., slammed the plan for disproportionately helping businesses and wealthy taxpayers.He contended this week that the GOP abandoned middle-class tax relief for "a massive handout to multinational corporations."Hatch's changes that were unveiled Tuesday night aim to decrease the burden on middle-class taxpayers and win over two skeptical GOP senators by proposing to increase the child tax credit to $2,000 from $1,000 per child.A previous version of the plan called for a $1,650 credit.Major analyses so far have estimated that versions of the Senate bill would cut the tax burden on most Americans.However, millions of middle-income people could end up seeing a tax increase, due to the plan's elimination of provisions like state and local tax deductions.Here are the notable changes in Hatch's revision: The amended bill would slightly cut individual tax rates for multiple brackets and set seven rates: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 38.5 percent.Those changes, as well as the near doubling of the standard deduction, would expire after 2025.The reduced corporate tax rate, down to 20 percent from 35 percent, would be permanent.The child tax credit would rise from $1,000 to $2,000.It would start to phase out at $500,000 in household income.The change would also sunset after 2025.As expected, the plan would effectively repeal the Obamacare individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty.Senators say doing so will save more than $300 billion to give Republicans more budget flexibility.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that it will lead to 13 million more people uninsured by 2027 and increase average Obamacare premiums.The Senate plan would expand proposed tax breaks for pass-through businesses.Those would also expire after 2025.It also gets rid of a provision that would have taxed company stock options when they vest.Silicon Valley had opposed that measure, saying it would suffocate entrepreneurial efforts.The Senate is marking up, or debating and amending, its tax bill this week.Senate Republicans hope to pass the plan during the week after Thanksgiving.The House aims to approve its separate tax bill on Thursday.The chambers would then have to hash out a joint plan.
Paul Ryan: If Roy Moore stands by his values, he has to bow out, 'it's just that simple.':::::House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Roy Moore should bow out of Alabama's Senate race after sexual misconduct allegations."The guy should step aside," Ryan told CNBC's "Squawk Box.""These allegations are absolutely credible allegations, so the guy should step aside.If he cares about the people and values he claims to care about, then in faithfulness to those people and those values he should step aside.It's just that simple."The Wisconsin Republican made similar comments earlier this week.Moore, the 70-year-old GOP nominee for a special Senate race in Alabama, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter when she was 14 and Moore was 32.Three other women said Moore pursued them when they were 16 to 18.Their accounts were published last week by The Washington Post.Another woman alleged earlier this week that Moore tried to force her to engage in oral sex four decades ago.Moore has denied any wrongdoing, calling allegations "completely false and misleading."He has threatened to sue the Post.Other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called on Moore to withdraw from the Dec. 12 special election immediately.Moore, who was backed in the primary by former Trump aide Steve Bannon, defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, who was supported by the president and McConnell.
Senate GOP tax tweak removes stock option plan hated by Silicon Valley:::::A revised tax plan released by the Senate drops a provision that would have taxed company stock options when they vest, letting Silicon Valley breath a sigh of relief.The measure would have potentially made it harder for some companies in the Valley to compete, according to executives in the industry.They typically compensate employees with the promise of being able to cash out on the company's stock in the future.The Senate GOP's previous tax bill would have been "the end of equity compensation in startups as we know it," Fred Wilson, managing partner at venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, wrote in a blog post Monday.Currently, company stock options are taxed when employees exercise them.The Senate's plan would have taxed those shares before they realized their potential gain.As a result, employees may owe taxes on something they only have the rights to and don't actually own.CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
Paul Ryan: Senate will have to take lead on scrapping Obamacare individual mandate in the tax bill:::::House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday put the burden on the Senate to scrap Obamacare's individual mandate as part of a tax reform bill.In an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box," Ryan suggested that his members could get behind eliminating the provision.However, he said the House will not do so in the bill it hopes to pass Thursday.Instead, it will wait to address it in a conference committee with the Senate, he said.In a revised bill released Tuesday night, the Senate added an effective repeal of the law requiring most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.Senators say it will save more than $300 billion to use toward making tax cuts compliant with Senate budget rules.Ryan did not outright say the House would back such a measure, but he noted that his members have voted to repeal the mandate in the past."We've had the House votes to do that.We passed our repeal of the individual mandate back in May," the Wisconsin Republican said."But we never had the votes in the Senate.So what we didn't want to do is make tax reform harder than it already is.""But it really is whether or not the Senate has the votes for this or not.So, we're seeing what the Senate can do.If the Senate can get it through committee, if they can get it through the floor, then we'll meet them in conference and we'll assess at that time," Ryan added.
Senate leaders look to work with White House to block Roy Moore:::::U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins a special election in Alabama.Speaking to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell said he had been in contact with President Donald Trump and others about sexual misconduct allegations against Moore."He's obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate," McConnell said, "and we've looked at all the options to try and prevent that from happening."Five women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct stemming from when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers.Moore, now 70, has denied the allegations.Trump returns to Washington on Tuesday evening from a 12-day trip to Asia, and McConnell said he planned to discuss Moore's situation with the president.Both are Republicans.McConnell said he had also spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly about Moore.Trump supported Moore's opponent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary but threw his support to Moore after Strange was defeated.McConnell said Republicans were still considering having a candidate launch a write-in campaign against Moore for the Dec. 12 special election.Speculation has centered on Strange and the current U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as possibilities.McConnell said later in the day that Sessions, who left the Senate seat to become attorney general, would be a plausible write-in candidate."He fits the mold of somebody who might be able to pull off a write-in," the majority leader said during a forum on the economy.
Trump wants to make India the core of his Asia strategy  but he needs to know a few things first:::::Trump's frequent use of the term "Indo-Pacific" as a replacement for "Asia-Pacific" the more widely used label in diplomatic and business circles revealed the level of importance Washington places on New Delhi.During a speech in Vietnam, the U.S. leader highlighted his desire for a "truly free and open Indo-Pacific," repeating the term after Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson used it in earlier remarks.The label's usage underscores "India's geographic connection to the Asia-Pacific as a cornerstone of the Trump administration's strategic thinking," Alyssa Ayres, senior South Asia fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a note this week.The "free and open" part of Trump's statement also adds an ideological aspect to regional security and was widely seen as a reference to Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.New Delhi, which isn't one of America's treaty allies but nonetheless enjoys a robust bilateral relationship based on shared democratic values, has a significant role to play in that."Like it or not, or hide it or not, the term Indo-Pacific now seems to be a means of including India in the military calculations of U.S. strategy in the Pacific," Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at think tank Observer Research Foundation, said in a recent note.
Insurers, doctors and hospitals oppose repeal of Obamacare individual mandate:::::"As providers of healthcare and coverage to hundreds of millions of Americans, we are committed to assuring everyone has access to a range of high quality, affordable coverage options so they can access the care they need, regardless of pre-existing conditions," said the letter from the health industry groups."To achieve this critical goal, we are urging you to maintain the individual mandate unless and until Congress can enact a package of reforms to adequately assure a balanced risk pool and prevent extraordinary premium increases."The letter was sent by America's Insurance Health Plans, the BlueCross Blue Shield Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals.Shortly before the letter was released, Senate Republican leaders announced that their new tax reform bill would seek repeal of the individual mandate.Repealing the mandate would give the Republicans almost $340 billion in budget savings that could then be applied to tax cuts.The savings would result from the government having to subsidize fewer Obamacare customers' premium payments.Under the Affordable Care Act, low and middle-income Obamacare customers qualify for federal tax credits that reduce their monthly premiums.Republicans had called for repeal of the mandate as part of prior bills this year that sought to gut major parts of Obamacare and replace them with other provisions.Those bills all failed to pass after a handful of Republican senators, concerned about potential losses of health insurance coverage by millions of people, refused to vote for them.The bills were broadly unpopular among the American public.Last week, a sweeping series of victories in Virginia state elections by Democrats was credited in part to the issue of health care, with voters more in favor of retaining the Affordable Care Act than opposed to it.The Protect Our Care Campaign, an Obamacare-defense group, cited those results Tuesday as it criticized the Senate bill."It was exactly one week ago today that voters across the country sent a clear message rejecting the Republicans' partisan health care repeal agenda, and yet here we are again," said Brad Woodhouse, director of the Protect Our Care Campaign."After repeatedly failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, of which their legislation was the least-popular bill in three decades, Republicans are apparently trying once again to jam a partisan repeal down the throats of the American people to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and corporations."Make no mistake, repealing the individual mandate is tantamount to repealing the Affordable Care Act, and as such it would be wise for those few Republicans in the House and Senate who said 'no' to previous efforts at repeal to say 'hell no' to this one," Woodhouse said.
GOP calls grow louder for Alabama Senate candidate Moore to step aside:::::Sen. Toomey: It would be best for Roy Moore to step aside 7:27 PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 | 00:41 Add U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and House Speaker Paul Ryan to the growing list of Republicans calling for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to abandon his bid for Sessions' former seat.Sessions on Tuesday told a House committee he had "no reason to doubt" the accounts of women who have accused Moore of groping or pursuing romantic relationships with them when they were teens.Sessions also hinted that the Justice Department might look into allegations against the besieged Republican Alabama Senate candidate."We will evaluate every case as to whether or not it should be investigated," Sessions told members of the House Judiciary Committee.Also Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan added his voice to the effort to persuade Moore to drop out of the race."These allegations are credible," Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters on Tuesday."If he cares about the values and people he claims to care about then he should step aside."Later Tuesday, Politico, citing a senior Republican Party official, reported that the Republican National Committee would back off its support for Moore and withdraw from a joint fundraising agreement it has with the Senate candidate.Politico also said the RNC would cancel field operations in support of Moore it had planned for Dec. 12, the day of the election.Sessions' and Ryan's comments added to a growing chorus of Republicans who have called on Moore to step aside in his bid to fill the seat Sessions vacated earlier this year when he became attorney general in President Donald Trump's administration.Sessions had held the seat since 1997.Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who chairs the Senate GOP's campaign organization, has said that, if Moore is elected, senators should expel him "because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements" of the Senate.Such an expulsion would require a two-thirds majority, which means 19 Republicans would need to join the 46 Democratic and two independent senators to successfully block Moore from being seated.As of Tuesday, some 15 GOP senators, along with other several other prominent party members, have said that Moore should withdraw from the race, saying, in effect, that the series of allegations are more credible than Moore's repeated, vehement denials.Other GOP senators have said Moore should step aside "if the allegations are true."Six have not commented on the allegations.On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson detailed new allegations against Moore in an emotional appearance in New York.When she was 16, Nelson said, Moore offered to drive her home from an after-school job at a restaurant where he was a regular customer.Instead, she said, he parked behind the restaurant, locked the door to keep her inside, and attempted to force her to perform oral sex on him.Moore denied the accusations."I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false.I never did what she said I did.I don't even know the woman," he said.Moore is showing no sign of quitting the race and has denied multiple allegations.His campaign sent out fundraising emails emphasizing his stance as a maverick battling establishment politicians.In one email sent Tuesday, Moore referred to Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell, R-Ky., and GOP Sens.John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as "the forces of evil who are attempting to rip and tear apart me and my campaign with their filthy lies and disgusting attacks."
Senate's GOP tax reform bill seeks repeal of Obamacare individual mandate:::::Senate Finance Committee to include repeal of individual mandate in tax bill 4:37 PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 | 01:02 The proposed Republican tax reform bill will include repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate requiring most Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a tax penalty, GOP leaders said Tuesday.The decision means that Republicans, yet again in 2017, will attempt to gut a key element of the Affordable Care Act.So far, such efforts have failed because not enough Republican senators have backed the idea of repealing the mandate, which would lead to an estimated 13 million more people lacking health insurance."We're optimistic that inserting individual mandate repeal would be helpful," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. on Tuesday afternoon after a lunch meeting with the Republican conference.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said, "I'm pleased the Senate Finance Committee has accepted my proposal to repeal the Obamacare individual mandate in the tax legislation.""Repealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the IRS for not being able to afford insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place," Cotton said."I urge the House to include the mandate repeal in their tax legislation."Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., said, "We're going to repeal the tax on poor Americans."Cornyn said the majority of people who pay the individual mandate tax penalty for not having insurance have lower incomes.Sen. John Thune, R-SD, told the Washington Post that there are 50 Republican senators willing to support the mandate-repealing tax reform bill.That would be enough to pass it, with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence.Thune also said the deal agreed upon is to pass that bill alongside another bill, known as Alexander-Murray, which would restore key federal subsidy reimbursements to Obamacare insurers cut off last month by President Donald Trump.
House GOP moving full speed to get tax reform done by year-end:::::Paul Ryan: Tax bill differences to be resolved in conference 11:08 AM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 | 01:03 House Republicans will vote on their tax reform bill on Thursday, aiming to take the most concrete step yet toward overhauling the American tax system.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., confirmed the plan to reporters on Tuesday.GOP leaders believe they can pass the bill this week, despite lingering resistance from some Republicans.President Donald Trump plans to go to Capitol Hill on Thursday to make the case for tax cuts before the vote.The GOP aims to pass a plan to chop tax rates for businesses and individuals by the end of the year to fulfill a key campaign promise.Lawmakers argue that changing the tax code will spark economic growth and boost job creation and wages.This week, the Senate is marking up, or debating and amending, its version.The chamber wants to approve the bill after Thanksgiving.House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday described the current plans as a "work in progress."He said he expects the two chambers to pass separate legislation before going to a conference committee to craft a joint plan.In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, McCarthy contended that the House and Senate can quickly reconcile the differences and get a final bill to Trump's desk by the end of the year."I do not think it will take long until we come back with that final version," the California Republican said.
Sessions: I 'now recall' proposed Trump-Putin meeting after reading news reports:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday that he only recalled a meeting with Trump campaign advisers, during which the prospect of a face-to-face Trump-Putin meeting was raised, after he read news reports about the event."I had no recollection of this until I saw these news reports," Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee, in reference to meetings of the campaign's national security team, attended by campaign advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page.Sessions also said the Trump campaign was too chaotic for him to remember everything that happened.Papadopoulos and Page have said they discussed their contacts with Russian officials at campaign meetings.Papadopoulos said he raised the prospect of a trip by then-candidate Donald Trump to Russia at a March 2016 meeting where Sessions was present.Page has said he told Sessions in person about a speech he was giving in Russia in the summer of 2016.But in October, Sessions told a Senate committee that he was "not aware" that anyone associated with the campaign had communicated with Russian officials.Late last month federal investigators revealed that Papadopolous secretly pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to lying to FBI agents about when he met with Russian nationals to get "dirt" on Hillary Clinton.Page, a former national security adviser to the Trump campaign, testified earlier this month behind closed doors that he had mentioned his upcoming speech to Sessions last summer.Sessions said he did not recall the brief interaction, which Page said took place at the Capitol Hill Club, a private Republican social club in Washington.From Sessions' prepared testimony:
AT&T may seek White House, DOJ communications on Time Warner deal:::::AT&T will seek access to communications between the White House and Justice Department about the Time Warner deal if the government sues to block the $85 billion takeover, Bloomberg reports, citing sources.The two companies declined to comment on the report.Representatives from both the White House and Department of Justice denied they had communicated about the deal."No one from the White House instructed me as to this or any other transaction within the Antitrust Division's authority," Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement relayed to CNBC by the White House."The President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter," Raj Shah, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a separate statement.AT&T announced the takeover last fall, but the deal has yet to close.Last week, reports alleged that in order for the Justice Department to approve the sale, CNN would have to be sold.Critics have said the White House weighed in against the deal, noting that President Donald Trump has often tweeted his criticism of CNN as a purveyor of fake news.The Justice Department has pushed back on the allegation it would require the sale of CNN.A government official familiar with the discussions told CNBC that in order for the deal to go through, the Justice Department has suggested AT&T sell its subsidiary DirecTV or Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting unit, which owns CNN.AT&T CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson also said in a statement last week the company has "no intention" of selling CNN.Read the full Bloomberg story here.CNBC's Jeff Cox and Tae Kim contributed to this report.
UCLA players depart China after Trump asked for Xi's help:::::UCLA players depart China after Trump asked for Xi's help 3:00 PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 | 00:34 Three UCLA basketball players detained in China on suspicion of shoplifting were headed back to the United States on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had sought the help of Chinese President Xi Jinping in the case.Staff for Delta Air Lines confirmed that the players had boarded a Delta flight from Shanghai to Los Angeles."What they did was unfortunate," Trump told reporters earlier in Manila.He said the trio, who have been held since last week, could have faced long prison sentences, and described Xi's response as "terrific.""They're working on it right now," Trump said.Trump had raised the issue with Xi during a dinner held during the U.S. leader's Nov. 8 to 10 state visit to Beijing.Trump was in the Philippines capital for a summit of Asian leaders.Asked about the trio and Trump's discussing the issue with Xi, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing: "Until now, I have not received any update, so I am unable to provide any further information."
Sessions facing Congress amid new Russia probe details:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions returns to Capitol Hill on Tuesday amid growing evidence of contacts between Russians and associates of President Donald Trump.And he will be bracing for an onslaught of lawmakers' questions about how much he knew of that outreach during last year's White House campaign.The appearance before the House Judiciary Committee follows a guilty plea from one Trump campaign aide who served on a foreign policy advisory council that Sessions chaired, as well as statements from another adviser who said he'd advised the then-GOP Alabama senator about an upcoming trip to Russia.Those details complicate Sessions' effort to downplay knowledge of the campaign's foreign contacts.Democratic lawmakers already contend the attorney general has not been forthcoming with them and have signaled that questions about the new revelations are likely to dominate what could otherwise have been a routine oversight hearing."These facts appear to contradict your sworn testimony on several occasions," Democrats from the committee said in a letter to Sessions last week.Republicans, for their part, may press Sessions on the Justice Department's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices as well as an Obama-era uranium deal that has invited GOP scrutiny.Sessions, an early Trump backer who led the foreign policy council during the campaign, has been shadowed for months by questions about his own communications with Russians and by contacts of others in the Trump orbit.That issue has been at the forefront of each of his congressional hearings even as Sessions has labored to promote the Justice Department's work and priorities, and Tuesday's appearance is unlikely to be an exception.At his January confirmation hearing, Sessions told Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., that "I did not have communications" with the Russians during the campaign and said he was "unaware" of contacts between others in the campaign and Russia.Yet he recused himself in March from overseeing the Justice Department's investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin after acknowledging two previously undisclosed encounters with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.He struck a similar note before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, when he denied knowledge of communications between Russians and Trump campaign officials."I did not and I'm not aware of anyone else that did, and I don't believe it happened," Sessions said under questioning, again from Franken.But that narrative has been challenged by a pair of recent events, most notably a guilty plea from George Papadopoulos, who last month admitted in court to lying to the FBI about his own foreign contacts.He was part of the foreign policy council that Sessions chaired, and the two are among the men in a March 2016 photograph that Trump posted on social media.Charging documents in that case indicate that Papadopoulos told the council "that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump" and Russian President Vladimir Putin.One of the attendees at that meeting, J.D.Gordon, recalled that Sessions quickly "shut him down and said, 'We're not going to do that.'"Gordon has also said that Papadopoulos went around him and Sessions and that they did not know he had continued to try to arrange such a meeting.Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee advised Sessions in a letter last week that they intended to press him on what they said were "inconsistencies" between the attorney general's past statements and the new revelations."If, as recent reports suggest, you rejected Mr. Papadopoulos's suggestion that President Trump meet with Vladimir Putin at that March 31 meeting a fact you appear to have remembered only after Mr. Papadopoulos's account was made public it seems likely that you were 'aware' of communications between the Russian government and surrogates of the Trump campaign," the letter states.Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment Monday.Adding to the questions for Sessions was the release by the House Intelligence Committee last week of a transcript of a private interview with Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the campaign who acknowledged that he had contact with a high-level Russian official while on a trip to Russia last year.Page told the panel he had informed some members of the Trump campaign about the trip, including Sessions.He said he mentioned in passing to Sessions that he was preparing to visit Russia and Sessions "had no reaction whatsoever."
Speaker Ryan says Moore should 'step aside':::::House Speaker Paul Ryan says Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore "should step aside."Ryan says allegations against Moore "are credible."Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ryan joined the growing chorus of Washington Republicans calling on Moore to quit the race after two women stepped forward describing how Moore groped them when they teenagers decades ago.Moore has called the reports false.Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been struggling to find a way to force Moore out.His name remains on the ballot for the Dec. 12 special election against Doug Jones.
There may be a new special counsel to look into Clinton Foundation:::::In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, which is holding an oversight hearing Tuesday, the Justice Department said Sessions had directed senior federal prosecutors to "evaluate certain issues" recently raised by Republican lawmakers.The prosecutors will report to Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and recommend whether any new investigations should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require additional resources and whether it might be necessary to appoint a special counsel to oversee a probe, according to a letter sent to Rep. Robert Goodlatte of Virginia, the Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman.The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd did not say what specific steps might be taken by the Justice Department to address the lawmakers' concerns, or whether any of the matters Republicans have seized might on already be under investigation.Any appointment of a new special counsel, particularly in response to calls from members of Congress, is likely to lead to Democratic complaints about an undue political influence on the department's decision-making.But Boyd said in the letter that the department "will never evaluate any matter except on the facts and the law."Sessions said at his January confirmation hearing that he would recuse himself from any investigations involving Democrat Hillary Clinton given his role as a vocal campaign surrogate to President Donald Trump.
Donald Trump Jr. was privately communicating with WikiLeaks during the election:::::President Donald Trump's oldest son on Monday released a series of previously private messages he received from WikiLeaks and his responses.Donald Trump Jr.'s release of the messages on Twitter comes after The Atlantic first reported them.In the exchanges, WikiLeaks asks Trump Jr. to push its leaks and to release his father's tax returns to the site.The documents released by Trump Jr. show him responding three times, at one point agreeing to "ask around" about a political action committee that WikiLeaks had mentioned.He also asked the site about a rumor about an upcoming leak.The messages released by Trump Jr. began in September 2016 and run through July.WikiLeaks released stolen e-mail messages from top Democrats during the campaign.Democrats swiftly reacted to the Atlantic's report, saying Trump Jr. should provide more information.Democratic congressman Adam Schiff said the report "demonstrates once again a willingness by the highest levels of the Trump campaign to accept foreign assistance."Vice President Mike Pence's spokeswoman said he was unaware of Trump Jr.'s contacts with WikiLeaks when he issued a denial that the Trump campaign was in cahoots with the hacking group.Pence's press secretary, Alyssa Farah, said the vice president "was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks.He first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight."Pence was asked about the campaign's coordination with WikiLeaks in October 2016.He said, "Nothing could be further from the truth."CNBC contributed to this report.

GOP Senate campaign chair calls on senators to expel Moore if he wins special election:::::Woman accuses Roy Moore of trying to rape her when she was a teenager 4:27 PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 | 07:42 The chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., on Monday called on his fellow senators to expel Alabama Republican Roy Moore, if Moore wins a special election next month."I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office," Gardner said in a statement."If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate."Gardner's statement was issued moments after a woman alleged Monday that Moore tried to rape her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s.Beverly Young Nelson said Moore groped her and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him, after offering her a ride home from the restaurant where she worked.

Marco Rubio which Trump had mocked.
Alabama GOP Threatens Retaliation For Disloyalty to Moore:::::In this September 25, 2017 file photo, former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at a rally in Fairhope, Ala.

Who Is Roy Moores Challenger Doug Jones?:::::Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a rally to campaign for Democrat Doug Jones in the race to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' former Senate seat on Oct. 3, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. With allegations of sexual assault and misconduct piling up against Republican candidate Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate campaign has transformed into a tighter race and given Democrats hope.As many call for Moore to step down and Republicans scramble to find a write-in candidate to replace him, Democratic candidate Doug Jones, previously trailing in the polls, now seems to stand a chance.Jones leads Moore 46 percent to 42 percent among Alabama voters, according to a new poll by JMC Analytics.Another poll, however, which was also conducted after the sexual assault allegations against Moore, showed that he still held a four-point lead over Jones."We applaud the courage of these women, Jones said of the allegations against his opponent in a statement Monday."Roy Moore will be held accountable by the people of Alabama for his actions."Moore has called the claims against him "absolutely false."Trump Jr.Admits to Correspondence With WikiLeaks Donald Trump, Jr. admits corresponding

Tuesday, Jones said that his campaign strategy hasn't changed in light of the allegations because the issues are still the same."Our campaign has been about the people of this state," he told reporters."Its never been about me.Its not about Roy Moore.It hasnt been about any other candidate.Its about the people of this state and what they consider to be their important, kitchen table issues."Many Democrats have been quiet about the Moore scandal in keeping with Jones' strategy of avoiding polarizing the race between party lines in the conservative state.If Jones wins the Alabama Senate seat on Dec. 12, he would put Democrats closer to controlling the Senate in 2018.Jones, 63, has never run for public office.Born into a working class Alabama family of steelworkers and miners, he attended Fairfield High School during the time of Alabama's public school desegregation and went on to study government and law.Here are the other things to know about the Democratic candidate.Roy Moore Accuser Shares Alleged Sexual Assault Incident Beverly Young Nelson alleges that Roy Moore sexually assaulted her in a car when she was 16 years old.(Published Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017) He was named U.S. Attorney by Bill Clinton After law school, Jones worked as staff counsel to the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee and then as assistant U.S. attorney in Birmingham.Jones was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama by former President Bill Clinton in 1997 and he was confirmed by a Republican-majority Senate.He held the position for four years before returning to private law practice.He has prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members and other extremists In his time as U.S. attorney, Jones won a conviction in 2002 for former KKK member Bobby Frank Cherry, who murdered four African-American girls in a 1963 Alabama church bombing.The bombing was a turning point in the civil rights movement.Jones previously convicted another former Klansman, Thomas Blanton, whose case was dormant for nearly 25 years, for his role in the bombing.He also spearheaded the prosecution against Eric Rudolph, who bombed a womens health care center in Birmingham in 1998.According to Joness campaign website, civil rights issues are a priority in his campaign.Moore Calls Latest Accusation 'Absolutely False' Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore says the latest sexual misconduct accusation against him is "absolutely false."On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson Moore said Moore assaulted her in the late 1970s, when she was a 16-year-old waitress.(Published Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017) "Sadly, the pattern of violence as a response to hope has reasserted itself," Jones wrote in a September op-ed in Huffington Post."We saw it in the Charleston church massacre in 2015.We saw it on display in Charlottesville this past August.We've seen it in the attacks on mosques and synagogues, and against the LGBT community.We see it in the hostility toward the Latino community.We cannot sweep this violence under the rug.We must address the forces that lead to it and prosecute those who perpetrate such acts.The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute awarded Jones the 15th Anniversary Civil Rights Distinguished Service Award for his work in civil rights, according to the Public Justice Center, a legal aid office that advocates for racial equality.Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for him Last month, before the sexual assault and misconduct claims against Roy Moore came to light, the former vice president traveled to Alabama to campaign for Jones."I can count on two hands the people I've campaigned for that have as much integrity, as much courage," Biden said of Jones, Business Insider reported.He also said that Jones prosecution of the KKK members helped remove 40 years of stain and pain from the state of Alabama.Former vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine also expressed his support for Jones, asking for donations to the campaign in a recent tweet.Duterte

supports the Paris climate agreement and that the impact of fossil fuel use on the planet is clear.But as the son of a steelworker and the grandson of a coal miner, Jones has "enormous sympathy with the families in our state that have seen their incomes decline or their jobs vanish as coal prices have dropped," he said, adding that America needs to step up its job retraining and health care for these workers.He opposes efforts to repeal "Obamacare" Jones said on his website that while the Affordable Care Act "needs improvement," he is "disturbed about repeated efforts to repeal the bill or weaken it, leaving as many as 32 million more Americans without insurance, driving up rates for others and likely leading to the closure of more rural health care facilities vital in many regions of Alabama."Jones has said he wants to lower health care premiums and out-of-pocket costs.Trump Talks Trade and Addresses Russia Meddling on Asia Trip President Donald Trump winds down his first official

Beyond Virginia: How Americas Big Counties Are Reshaping Politics:::::Karina Smith holds her 2-year-old son Kyler as she fills out her ballot at the polling place at Washington Mill Elementary School Nov. 7, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia.At first glance, Virginia, with its rapid suburban population growth and deepening blue tint, may seem like the exception rather than the rule.But the pattern is one thats been replicated across the country, NBC News reported.An NBC News analysis of voting and demographic trends in each of the lower 48 states shows that, since 2000, Democrats have improved upon their presidential election margins in the lions share of the most vote-rich and populous counties in America even as their share of the vote in the remainder of each state was stagnant, decreased or at best grew at a far slower pace.The data seem to show two important trends since 2000.One, Barack Obamas candidacy and presidency blew open the partisan voting divide between the most urban counties in states and the rest of their population.The 2008 election seemed to be a watershed in the split.Two, the changes that followed 2008 were not just about the minority vote in urban centers.In 2016, without the first black president on the top of the ticket, the gaps between these counties and the rest of the states widened more.
Tax Bill Thrown Into Uncertainty as First G.O.P. Senator Comes Out Against It:::::Im still working with folks to see if theres some way to be assured as it relates to the deficit issue that were not going to create harm, Mr. Corker said.Theres other senators who themselves want to ensure that were doing something to strengthen our country relative to the deficits.He added, Im not a yes, Im not a no.With the House expected to pass its tax legislation, the fate of the overhaul fell into the hands of Republican senators, who grappled with the dangerous political prospects of passing a bill that critics said could undermine the health care system and favored companies over the middle class.The Senate has played the spoiler before: The House passed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act in May, only to see it fail in the Senate twice.Republican and Democratic senators clashed on Wednesday over changes the Republicans had made to their ambitious tax legislation late Tuesday night, including adding a provision to repeal the Affordable Care Acts requirement that most people have health coverage or pay a penalty.Republicans also made the tax cuts for individuals temporary, to comply with Senate procedural rules requiring that the tax plan not add to the deficit after a decade.Senate Republicans, eager for a major legislative achievement after the Affordable Care Act debacle, have generally been enthusiastic about the tax overhaul.But given the partys slim 52-to-48 majority in the Senate, the reluctance of even a handful of Republican senators has left open the possibility that the tax bill will be further changed or face failure.Beyond Mr. Johnson, the support of several other Republican senators was not assured, including the three who killed the partys effort to repeal the health law this summer: Ms. Collins, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.I want to see the whole package before I make a decision, Mr. McCain said.On Wednesday, Ms. Collins expressed concern that middle-income consumers could see their tax cut erased by an increase in health insurance premiums caused by the repeal of the requirement that most people have insurance, known as the individual mandate.Other Republican senators, such as Mr. Corker and Jeff Flake of Arizona, are concerned about the national debt, which topped $20 trillion even before consideration of a tax plan that could add an additional $1.5 trillion over a decade.As the Senate Finance Committee continued its formal drafting of the bill, Democrats attacked Republicans for inserting the repeal of the individual mandate and for imposing a 2025 expiration date for individual tax cuts, even as they would make the corporate tax cut permanent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This bill seems to get worse by the hour, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.This is not just another garden variety attack on the Affordable Care Act; this is repeal of that law.Repealing the health laws individual mandate would allow Republicans to save more than $300 billion over 10 years, giving them more room to cut taxes.According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would also lead to a reduction of 13 million in the number of people with health coverage, and average health insurance premiums on the individual market would rise by about 10 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, played down the move to make the individual tax cuts temporary, not mentioning that change in an opening statement during markup of the bill on Wednesday in which he defended his partys right to undo the mandate.He later suggested that Republicans would be unlikely to resist if Democrats wanted to make those cuts permanent.Mr. Hatch and Mr. Wyden raised their voices and spoke over each other as they clashed over the injection of health care into the tax debate, with Mr. Hatch at one point demanding that his leadership of the committee be respected.Let me be in control of this committee, not you, Mr. Hatch said.Another Senate panel, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, voted on Wednesday to approve legislation that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling an opening long sought by Republicans but ardently opposed by Democrats and environmentalists.That legislation is to be merged with the tax bill, which Republicans are planning to pass using special procedures that protect against a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.Under that strategy, the drilling measure would share the protection from a filibuster.Allowing drilling in the wildlife refuge, known as ANWR, is a cherished goal of the energy committees chairwoman, Ms. Murkowski.Given her vote this summer against repealing the Affordable Care Act, Ms. Murkowski is once again a closely watched figure as the Senate plunges back into a debate over health care.But this time, with the prospect of opening the wildlife refuge to drilling, Ms. Murkowski has a major reason to vote yes.My whole focus this week, youre going to be shocked to know, has been ANWR, she told reporters on Wednesday, brushing aside a question about the individual mandate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the House, the biggest threat comes from Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, who have fought to preserve the deduction for state and local taxes.The House bill allows the deduction of up to $10,000 in property taxes, but that provision has not been enough to win over a number of House Republicans.If all House members vote and every Democrat opposes the bill, Republican leaders can afford to lose no more than 22 of their members for it to pass.At least five Republicans from New York and three from New Jersey have come out against the House bill.Republican leaders could also lose votes from at least a few of their members from California, another high-tax state.Its conceivable they could come up with some last-minute numbers that dont look so bad, said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California.But I did not go to my constituents and ask them to vote for me in order to increase their tax load, and the bill dramatically increases the tax load on a big chunk of my constituency.
Senate Plans to End Obamacare Mandate in Revised Tax Proposal:::::If the bill were to become law, and Congress did not seek to make those provisions permanent, tax bills would rise for vast parts of the country in 2026.The mandate repeal would save more than $300 billion over a decade but result in 13 million fewer Americans being covered by health insurance by the end of that period, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Republicans said on Tuesday that they would use the savings which stem from reduced government spending to subsidize health coverage to pay for an expansion of the middle-class tax cuts that lawmakers had proposed.Middle-class measures in the revised tax plan released late Tuesday include expanding the child tax credit to $2,000 a child, up from $1,650 in the original version of the Senate plan, and three reductions in marginal tax rates.One rate would fall to 22 percent from 22.5 percent; another to 24 percent from 25 percent; and another to 32 percent from 32.5 percent.On the House side, members of the Rules Committee met Tuesday evening, one day earlier than scheduled, to pave the way for a floor vote on Thursday.Democrats said the mandate repeal would underwrite tax cuts for the rich at the expense of people who buy insurance on the individual market.The people this is going to hit are middle-class people that ostensibly this whole bill was supposed to be about helping, said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a member of the Finance Committee.Average health insurance premiums in the individual market would increase by about 10 percent, but insurance markets would remain stable in almost all parts of the country, the budget office found.Advertisement Continue reading the main story President Trump has urged his fellow Republicans to repeal the mandate in their tax bill, and in recent days, the idea has gained steam in the Senate Republican conference as lawmakers try to come up with a plan that can receive at least 50 votes.Were optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful, said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.Photo But the move risks reviving the contentious debate over health care that Republicans found themselves mired in for much of the year.Previous efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act have failed, leaving Republicans with little legislative success to show for their congressional majority.This is turning a tax bill into a health care bill, with our colleagues getting an hours worth of notice, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.In a letter on Tuesday, groups representing doctors, hospitals and insurers urged congressional leaders to keep the individual mandate in place.The groups, which included the American Medical Association and Americas Health Insurance Plans, wrote that eliminating the individual mandate by itself likely will result in a significant increase in premiums, which would in turn substantially increase the number of uninsured Americans.On Tuesday, Republicans were laser-focused on speeding ahead with the tax rewrite and showed no desire to slow down that effort.House Republican leaders plan to hold a vote on their bill on Thursday and expressed confidence that it would pass the House.Senate Republicans, who unveiled their tax proposal last week, are planning to vote on their own version the week after Thanksgiving.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their odds of a tax package being signed into law to 80 percent, from 65 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We feel very good where we are, said Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker and Republican of Wisconsin.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership who also serves on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that the tax plan, with the mandate repeal as part of it, could pass the Senate.But not all senators were as sanguine about its passage and Republicans will need to carefully calibrate votes, given that they hold a narrow 52-seat majority in the Senate.I personally think that it complicates tax reform, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.In tandem with repealing the individual mandate as part of the tax bill, Mr. Thune said that Republicans were committed to advancing a bipartisan measure to stabilize health insurance markets developed by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.That measure, whose fate has been uncertain, would include two years of funding for subsidies to insurers known as cost-sharing reduction payments that Mr. Trump decided to cut off last month.But Ms. Murray rejected any suggestion that the mandate repeal could be paired with her legislation.That is the exact opposite of what we should be doing, she said.Americans have stood up and spoken loudly for the last year saying they do not want the markets destabilized, and their provision in the tax bill that they are talking about will really destabilize the marketplaces.Mr. Trump had urged lawmakers to end the individual mandate, including in a Twitter post on Monday.Several conservative senators, like Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, and Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, had also called for its repeal as part of the tax overhaul.Lobbyists seeking changes to the bill were mostly preparing to shift their efforts to the Senate.The National Association of Realtors flew in 60 of its members from around the country to raise concerns with House members over several provisions in the House bill that the group says will hurt home buyers and erode incentives for homeownership.The mood they found in their meetings, said Jamie Gregory, the groups deputy chief lobbyist, was resignation that this bill is going to pass the House.But, he added: Theres a long way to go.Theres still the Senate, theres still a conference committee, theres still a chance to make this better.
Jeff Sessions Denies Lying to Congress on Contacts With Russia:::::In October, Mr.Sessions testified that he knew of nobody in the Trump campaign who had contacts with Russians.And I dont believe it happened, he said then.Court documents in the special counsel investigation have since shown that Mr.Sessions led a round-table last year in which a campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, discussed his Russian ties and suggested setting up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.Mr.Sessions said he now remembered the round-table discussion and that Mr. Papadopoulos attended, but, he said, I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said.Mr.Sessions seemed more certain about his own response to Mr. Papadopoulos: I pushed back against his suggestion.He offered an impassioned defense of his previous testimony, saying he did not intentionally mislead anyone about fleeting and forgotten meetings.Youre accusing me of lying about that?he said.I would say thats not fair, colleagues.I dont think it is right to accuse me of doing something wrong, he added.Democrats criticized Mr.Sessions for what they said was repeatedly making inaccurate statements.During his confirmation hearings in January, Mr.Sessions told the Senate that he had not had any contact with Russians.He has since acknowledged meeting privately with the Russian ambassador.Mr.Sessions said again on Tuesday that he believed the question was asked in the context of Russian election interference, and he answered in that spirit.Congressional Republicans, who have consistently been his most important allies, came to Mr. Sessionss defense.You didnt do anything wrong, Representative Ron DeSantis of Florida said.When it appeared earlier this year that Mr. Trump was about to fire him, his former Senate colleagues formed a human shield, saying they would not confirm a replacement.Mr.Sessions has fallen from favor at the White House, where Mr. Trump blames him for Mr. Muellers investigation.The president believes that if Mr.Sessions had not recused himself from the Russia investigation, there would have been no need for a special counsel.White House officials believe Mr. Sessionss poor performances before Congress have only made things worse.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Even as Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he is not supposed to involve himself in Justice Department decision making, he has called for prosecutors to investigate Hillary Clinton and members of the Obama administration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr.Sessions appeared to have received the message.In a Nov. 13 letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department said it would examine allegations that donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced a 2010 decision to allow a Russian agency to buy a Canadian company that owned access to uranium in the United States.Mr.Sessions sidestepped questions about whether the presidents comments were appropriate.I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced.The president speaks his mind.Hes a bold and direct about what he says, Mr.Sessions said.We do our duty every day based on the law and the facts.The letter regarding the uranium deal gave a boost to conservatives who have been calling for a special counsel to investigate Mrs. Clinton.But Mr.Sessions did not entirely endorse the idea.When Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said it looked like there was already enough evidence to investigate, Mr.Sessions responded: Looks like is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel.Several Republicans also urged Mr.Sessions to crack down on leaks of classified information by government employees, arguing that they are a scandal unto themselves.Mr.Sessions said the Justice Department had increased the number of leak investigations to 27, up from nine, since he became attorney general.We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks.I think it has reached epidemic proportions, Mr.Sessions said.It cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure it does not continue.Democrats repeatedly questioned Mr. Sessionss independence and honesty.I dont want to hear in a few days or a few weeks that your answers, Mr. Attorney General, have changed, said Representative Luis V. Gutirrez of Illinois.Mr.Sessions testified a day after the Atlantic magazine revealed that Donald J. Trump Jr., the presidents eldest son, had exchanged private messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks during the campaign.WikiLeaks published a trove of embarrassing Democratic emails that had been stolen by Russian hackers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Twitter conversations undercut statements made last year by Vice President Mike Pence, who was Indianas governor at the time.Asked during an appearance on the Fox & Friends program on Fox News whether the Trump campaign was in cahoots with WikiLeaks, Mr. Pence categorically denied it.Nothing could be further from the truth, he said.I think all of us have, you know, had concerns about WikiLeaks over the years.A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence circulated a press statement saying he had not been aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks until the reports about it surfaced on Monday.Mr.Sessions also waded into the controversy over the man running for his former Senate seat from Alabama.The candidate, Roy S. Moore, faces accusations from five women that he made sexual or romantic advances on them when they were teenagers.I have no reason to doubt these young women, Mr.Sessions said.Mr. Moore has denied the allegations.His remarks are more bad news for Mr. Moore, who has all but been abandoned by Washington Republicans.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has declared: I believe the women.And the leader of the Senate Republican campaign arm, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, said that the Senate should vote to expel Mr. Moore if he wins.
Trumps Tremendous Success Abroad Is Overstated:::::Under NATO guidelines, member states agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product to the organizations defense efforts, but few nations actually do so.The secretary general of the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said in July that five countries contributed at least 2 percent of their G.D.P.He said he expected Romania to reach the benchmark this year, and Latvia and Lithuania to next year.While it is conceivable that Mr. Trump ushered along the process, efforts to address the disparity predated his complaints.Members that were not meeting that bar of 2 percent pledged in September 2014 largely because of Russian actions that were continuing to do so over the next decade.He overstated the overall American trade deficit.Mr. Trump said that during his Asia trip, he gave a firm warning to every country that cheats, breaks the rules and engages in economic aggression, which, he said, is why we have almost an $800 billion a year trade deficit with other nations.That figure is accurate when examining only the trade balance in goods, about $750 billion last year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Trade in services, however, reduced the overall deficit to $505 billion.The total trade deficit has actually increased under Mr. Trumps watch to $405 billion during the first nine months of 2017, compared with $370 billion during the first nine months of 2016.He noted economic growth trends that predate his presidency.Mr. Trump ticked off several accurate economic metrics: The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in nearly 17 years, the economy grew at over 3 percent in the last two quarters, and the stock market has been soaring.What he omits, however, is that those trends began under the Obama administration.Almost all of the decline in the unemployment rate happened under Mr. Obamas watch.It peaked at 10 percent in 2009, dropped to 4.8 percent by the time Mr. Trump took office and continued to decline to 4.1 percent in October.Similarly, G.D.P.growth in the last two quarters 3 percent and 3.1 percent is certainly healthy but on par with numbers posted in the last three years.He said Japan will make arms purchases worth many billions, but Japan disputes that.Mr. Trump played up Japans commitment to its own defense capabilities and suggested that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose name he mispronounced, had agreed to purchases of U.S. advanced capabilities, from jet fighters to missile defense.It is possible that Japan agreed to the arms sale, but if Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe did strike a deal, it would be in a very preliminary stage in a process that could take years.The Pentagons Defense Security Cooperation Agency has yet to notify Congress of any intended sale, which must happen before negotiations can begin.Japanese officials have also pushed back at the notion.In a report in The Japan Times last week, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said that Tokyo was following its existing defense procurement plan that was approved more than three years before Mr. Trump took office.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He claimed $250 billion in deals with China, a figure that includes nonbinding agreements.The Commerce Departments breakdown of the $250 billion package includes several deals that are not guaranteed to proceed.For example, an $8 billion natural gas project and $83 billion in shale development projects were both agreed to in nonbinding memorandums of understanding.The breakdown also lists a $38 billion agreement for Boeing to supply China with 300 aircraft, which is in line with its 20-year forecast, and $2.2 billion in sales from General Motors to Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, a large automaker in China that has a joint venture with G.M.
Director of American Counterterrorism Center to Step Down:::::Photo WASHINGTON The director of the National Counterterrorism Center will step down next month, the Trump administration said on Wednesday.The director, Nicholas J. Rasmussen, is one of the few individuals in the American government who has served continuously in counterterrorism jobs since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Mr. Rasmussen, 52, had served three years as the countrys top counterterrorism official.He had previously worked to combat extremism while at jobs at the White House and at the counterterrorism center, where he served as deputy director from 2012 until taking over as director in December 2014.Nick is deeply committed to the counterterrorism mission and has skillfully guided the nation through an evolving and complex terrorism threat environment, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement on Wednesday announcing the departure.His deep understanding of the intelligence needed to support senior decision makers has been invaluable.Friends and associates said Mr. Rasmussen told colleagues that he decided to remain in the job for about another year after the Trump administration had asked him to stay.Mr. Rasmussen has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, and 27 years in government overall, and he has not decided what to do next, colleagues said.Russell Travers, the deputy director of the counterterrorism center, will serve as acting director upon Mr. Rasmussens departure in late December and until President Trump nominates a successor, Mr. Coats said.

Trump Declares America First Policy a Success After Asia Trip:::::Announced with little notice and delivered midafternoon from the Diplomatic Room of the White House, the presidents speech was designed to be what his critics have never offered him: a sweeping and positive assessment of his own performance as the nations commander in chief and top diplomat.By recounting his travels and detailing the just completed Asia trip, Mr. Trump sought to make the case that the United States was once again playing a leading role in the world.My fellow citizens, America is back, and the future has never looked brighter, he said.Critics say Mr. Trump has abandoned the United States status as a global superpower by retreating from trade agreements and backing out of the Paris climate accord.The presidents political rivals accuse him of straining relationships with allies in NATO and elsewhere while embracing despots, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.He is so easily played by foreign leaders, so transparently susceptible to flattery, said Eliot A. Cohen, one of Mr. Trumps harshest critics and a former adviser to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.It clearly has undermined the reputation of the United States, the credibility of the United States.Before delivering the speech, Mr. Trump appeared to be annoyed by criticism of his foreign policy, saying on Twitter that the failing @nytimes hates the fact that I have developed a great relationship with World leaders like Xi Jinping, President of China.He added that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing.The U.S. is being respected again.Watch Trade!The tweet raised anticipation that Mr. Trump planned a big announcement on trade.Instead, asserted on Wednesday that everywhere we went, he and the American delegation was met with incredible warmth, hospitality and, most importantly, respect from world leaders of other nations.Casting the Asia trip as the culmination of a year of accomplishments, Mr. Trump noted his efforts in the spring, during a trip to Saudi Arabia, to rally Arab and Muslim nations to fight financing of terrorism.He boasted that his tough talk with NATO allies has led those longtime partners to increase their commitments to the common defense of the alliance.And he revisited his call made during a speech in Warsaw for a defense of Western civilization.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.To each of these places, I have carried our vision for a better a vision for something stronger and sovereign so important sovereign and independent nations, rooted in their histories, confident in their destinies, and cooperating together to advance their security, prosperity and the noble cause of peace, Mr. Trump said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In talking about his foreign policy achievements, Mr. Trump has often bragged about the personal relationships he has forged with his counterparts in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.In Wednesdays speech, Mr. Trump hoped to highlight what his advisers said were three successes from his just-concluded trip to South Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines: attempts to unite opposition to North Koreas nuclear ambitions; to strengthen economic alliances; and to insist on fair trade.John D. Negroponte, who served as deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump should get credit, both for developing relationships with his counterparts and for effectively delivering a tough message toward North Korea.I thought he handled that very well, with friend and adversary alike, Mr. Negroponte, who also served as the director of national intelligence, said after the speech.Critics of Mr. Trumps foreign policy have hammered the president for his use of childish names for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.They say Mr. Trump has deepened the possibility of a nuclear crisis, not reduced tensions.And some say Mr. Trumps retreat from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement has robbed the United States of influence in the region.In fact, Mr. Trump ended his Asia trip without appearing to conclude any of the one-on-one trade deals with individual nations that he often has said would be the hallmark of his administration.The big question mark remains: Does he have an economic strategy toward the East Asian region?Mr. Negroponte said.You withdraw from the TPP and say America First.I notice no one is getting in line to make unilateral deals.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his remarks, Mr. Trump mentioned the World Trade Organization and asserted that the 21 leaders he met with during summit meetings in Asia recognized the need to address unfair trade practices, and acknowledged that the W.T.O.is in strong need of reform.In fact, many of the other leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting endorsed the World Trade Organization and made progress on finalizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement without the participation of the United States.Mr. Trump did make a point of saying that no one owns the ocean, a reference to the long-running and tense dispute in East Asia about Chinas efforts to control access to the South China Sea.Freedom of navigation and overflight are critical to the security and prosperity of all nations, he said.But Mr. Trump did not single out China for criticism, continuing a pattern of soft-pedaling on a dispute that could annoy United States allies.Despite that, Mr. Trump hoped his speech would galvanize public opinion behind the idea that his leadership on foreign policy was restoring a new sense of optimism about the United States around the world.A president is entitled to proclaim a sunny day while everyone else is huddling under their umbrellas, said Philip Zelikow, who served as a diplomat and foreign policy adviser in several Republican administrations.
House G.O.P. Tax Writers Take Aim at College Tuition Benefits:::::In addition to campus employees, many doctoral students would see huge tax increases, since the tuition that universities waive for them in exchange for working on campus as researchers and teaching assistants would be deemed taxable income.At expensive research universities like Stanford and Harvard, the new tax bills could swamp graduate-student stipends.And if students take out more loans to pay their new taxes, they would face another surprise: Under the House bill, interest paid on student loans a deduction that more than 12 million people used in 2015 would no longer be tax deductible.These benefits ensure the brightest and best in the country can continue to afford an education, said Steven M. Bloom, director of governmental relations for the American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 college and university presidents across the country.Congress is sending a clear message that theyd rather use that money for corporate tax breaks.Photo The Senate bill being drafted this week leaves out most of the higher-education provisions in the House bill.The Senate bill also retains other smaller tax credits and benefits that the House sought to repeal, such as a nontaxable annual grant of up to $5,250 that employers can offer their employees.All told, the Houses Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would reduce tax benefits and savings for college students by $65 billion over the next decade, according to an estimate by the education council.House Republicans defend the higher education provisions as contributing to the tax bills larger economic goals.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is focused on providing tax relief and increasing take-home pay for Americans of all walks of life including people working to pay off tuition and other education costs, a House Ways and Means spokeswoman said in a statement.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By increasing household income, the bill overall would provide more Americans with more opportunities of their choosing, including continuing education, said a spokesman for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.But students and advocates say the higher-education provisions actually undermine what is supposed to be the central aim of the tax overhaul: to bolster the middle class.Even some Republicans who praise the tax bill are uneasy about some of the higher education provisions.Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, wrote the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady of Texas, that tax-free assistance in higher education is essential.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We can make an even bigger impact by taking this opportunity through tax reform to confront the impending student debt crisis and to address access to higher education, he wrote.More than 145,000 graduate students are attending college for free, according to an estimate by the education council.For these students, who are often living on minimum-wage stipends, working long hours, studying and attending classes, repealing the tuition tax break could have dire financial consequences.For Dacen Waters, 26, who is in his fourth year of pursuing a doctorate in physics at Carnegie Mellon University, the House bill would impose about a $7,000 tax increase.Photo In Mr. Waterss program, the Mellon College of Science grants students an annual stipend of $29,400 and a $43,000 tuition waiver.Under the current proposal, their taxable income would rise to $61,000 from $19,000.That would effectively cut students net stipend by nearly $10,000 a year.I already feel like Im less of a student and more of an employee, said Mr.Waters, who says that his day mostly consists of research.And that includes living paycheck to paycheck.If I had to absorb this, I definitely wouldnt be able to continue pursuing a degree.He said such an increase would force him out of school, and possibly out of a career.Its pretty unheard-of to do anything in physics and not have a doctoral degree, Mr.Waters said.According to the education council, more than 60 percent of the students who would be affected are in science, technology, engineering or mathematics research fields that have drawn the praise of Republicans, including President Trump, in recent months.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Association of American Universities, which represents 60 research universities, including Carnegie Mellon, said the tax plan threatened the viability of their doctoral programs.The universities award nearly one-half of all American doctoral degrees and 55 percent of those in the sciences and engineering.Its president, Mary Sue Coleman, said the tax proposals will have dire consequences for Americans who rely on research universities for undergraduate and graduate education.If approved, the tax plan could take effect Jan. 1, a fast-approaching deadline for the thousands of families who would face unanticipated tuition bills.If I had to pay it, it would have been a killer, said Mr. Vautour.When he started at Boston College as a cook in 1994, he was making $10.65 an hour, and full-time tuition was about $25,000.His salary has doubled after 18 years and so has the colleges tuition, which now stands at $52,500.His children rounded out their financial aid with scholarships and small federal loans, and Mr. Vautour paid only about $3,000 per year for other expenses.A survey by College and University Professional Association of Human Resources found that of 300 schools that had employees receiving the tuition benefit, 50 percent earned $50,000 or less and 78 percent earned $75,000 or

The F.B.I.s Dangerous Crackdown on Black Identity Extremists:::::Photo An F.B.I.report leaked in October and scrutinized during an oversight hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday warns of an emergent domestic terror threat sweeping the nation and threatening the lives of law enforcement officers: the Black Identity Extremist (B.I.E.)movement.This designation, just recently invented by the F.B.I., is as frightening and dangerous as the bureaus infamous Cointelpro program of the 1960s and 70s, under which J. Edgar Hoover set out to disrupt and destroy virtually any group with the word black in its name.Today, entirely nonviolent black activists face violations of their civil liberties and even violence if theyre deemed part of B.I.E.The 12-page report, prepared by the F.B.I.Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August, and later made public by foreignpolicy.org, both announces the existence of the Black Identity Extremist movement and deems it a violent threat, asserting that black activists grievances about racialized police violence and inequities in the criminal justice system have spurred retaliatory violence against law enforcement officers.It links incidents of violence by a handful of individual citizens like Michael Johnson, who shot 11 Dallas police officers in July 2016, to B.I.E.ideology and predicts that perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement.This is fiction.Daryl Johnson, a former Department of Homeland Security intelligence agent, when asked by Foreign Policy in October why the F.B.I.would create the term B.I.E., said, I have no idea and Im at a loss.Michael German, a former F.B.I.agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justices liberty and national security program, said the Black Identity Extremists label simply represents an F.B.I.effort to define a movement where none exists.Basically, its black people who scare them, he said.Could you name an African-American organization that has committed violence against police officers?Representative Karen Bass asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Tuesdays hearing.Can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?Its no surprise that he could not.Mr.Sessions, who confessed that he had not read the report, said he would need to confirm and would reply in writing at a later time.The F.B.I.itself admits in the report, that, even by its own definition, B.I.E.violence has been rare over the past 20 years.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.The Black Identity Extremist designation erroneously presumes a broad and disparate group of organizations with concerns about the criminal justice system represent a movement with a unifying ideology.This reflects ignorance or denial of the reality on the ground: There are dozens if not hundreds of groups with primarily black members that take issue with racial injustice but have distinct areas of focus, mandates, missions and memberships, and which are just as likely to conflict with one another as they are to overlap.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond that, the F.B.I.s suggestion that people with extreme black identities may attack law enforcement officers has practical and potentially deadly consequences for those who are swept up under the newly created label.Although its unclear what actions the F.B.I.will take as a result of the report, the conclusions pave the way for it to gather data on, monitor and deploy informants to keep tabs on individuals and groups it believes to be B.I.E.s.This could chill and criminalize a wide array of nonviolent activism in ways that have terrifying echoes its infamous Cointelpro program, which investigated and intimidated black civil rights groups and leaders, including Marcus Garvey and the Rev.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Under this program, F.B.I.agents concocted a false internal narrative connecting Dr. King to foreign enemies, allowing agents to justify threatening to publicize his private life and encouraging him to commit suicide.This is a reminder that while the Black Identity Extremist designation is new, the strategy of using a vague definition to justify broad law enforcement action is not.The reports labored efforts to link what it calls the violent anti-white rhetoric of todays black organizations to B.I.E.violence that peaked in the 1960s and 1970s suggests a plan to use similar tactics to the monitor, disrupt and divide approach that it used against civil rights activists.
Under Trump, Banking Watchdog Trades Its Bite for a Tamer Stance:::::Advertisement Under Trump, Banking Watchdog Trades Its Bite for a Tamer Stance Image Joseph Otting, a former bank executive, at a Senate committee hearing in July on his nomination to be comptroller of the currency.Credit Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance, DPA, via Associated Press After the financial crisis in 2008, the Obama administration turned one of the banking industrys friendliest regulators into one of its toughest.But that agency is now starting to look like its old self and becoming a vital player in the Trump administrations campaign to roll back regulations.The regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the nations biggest banks, has made it easier for Wall Street to offer high-interest, payday-style loans.It has softened a policy for punishing banks suspected of discriminatory lending.And it has clashed with another federal regulator that pushed to give consumers greater power to sue financial institutions.The shift, detailed in government memos and interviews with current and former regulators, is unfolding without congressional action or a rule-making process.It is happening instead through directives issued at the stroke of a pen by the agencys interim leader, Keith A. Noreika, who like the nominee to fill the post going forward has deep connections to the industry.Even in his few months on the job, Mr. Noreika has made the new direction clear.At a meeting with staff members over the summer, he declared that the agency was returning to what he called its natural state, according to one of those who attended.The shift could help revive some of the policies and practices that arose on the agencys watch amid the financial crisis and banking scandals of a decade ago and that led congressional investigators to accuse it of systemic failures.The recent changes under Mr. Noreika are part of a concerted effort by the Trump administration to unwind Obama-era rules and install a set of regulators who come from the financial industry itself.President Trumps nominee for the position now occupied by Mr. Noreika, Joseph Otting, who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week, is a former chief executive at OneWest Bank.The bank, where Mr. Otting worked with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, attracted the scrutiny of regulators for its aggressive foreclosure practices.Mr. Trump, who has called the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul passed in 2010, a disaster, nominated a former banking industry lawyer and private-equity executive to fill the top regulatory job at the Federal Reserve.The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission is also a former industry lawyer .Congress is pursuing its own unwinding of Dodd-Frank.In the latest effort, a group of senators that included Republicans and Democrats proposed legislation on Monday that would lessen the scrutiny of big regional banks.Some senators, including Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, oppose the legislation.They have also expressed concerns about Mr. Noreikas decisions and have voted against Mr. Ottings nomination in the Senate Banking Committee.Image Changes in regulatory policy under the Trump administration could ease the way for any plans by Wells Fargo to merge or expand and may speed the vetting of bonus payments to its executives.Credit Devin Yalkin for The New York Times It is unclear whether Mr. Otting will fully embrace the interim leader's policies, but the approach of both men contrasts sharply with that of Thomas J. Curry, an Obama appointee, who instituted measures intended to bolster the agencys regulatory power.Mr. Curry, a longtime regulator, helped push through stricter capital requirements for banks and extracted a number of large fines from Wall Street institutions.By removing Mr. Curry, the Trump administration pleased banking lobbyists and lawyers who felt that the agency had treated them unfairly on his watch.It shows a clear path toward a less confrontational approach, said Douglas Landy, a partner specializing in financial institutions at the law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.The new tack, he said, meant more working it out together instead of slamming each other.Before the crisis, some banks shopped around for the friendliest possible regulator, often landing at the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was later merged with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under Dodd-Frank.With Mr. Curry in charge, the agency sought to avoid what is known as regulatory arbitrage, deciding that it would typically decline license applications from banks trying to escape state regulatory enforcement actions, according to current and former regulators.Yet under the Trump administration, the agency recently granted a license to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, a big Japanese bank that was fined $250 million by New York States financial regulator in a sanctions-violation case in 2013, and reached a $315 million settlement when accused separately of misleading regulators.In a letter to Mr. Noreikas office, the New York regulator complained that the agency had granted the application without input about the banks state regulatory problems.Before Mr. Noreika joined the agency, that bank was one of his clients.In a statement, an agency spokesman clarified that Mr. Noreika observed a self-imposed recusal in this matter.The spokesman added that the agency had sufficient information to determine that the applicant met the standards for conversion and that it had placed the bank under substantively identical enforcement orders to one still in effect in New York.The softer approach is spilling into the ratings that banks receive from the agency, a crucial measure of their compliance with federal rules.Last month, the agency revised its procedures for downgrading a banks Community Reinvestment Act rating, a four-tiered evaluation of whether a bank discriminates against borrowers and how well it meets the credit needs of low-income neighborhoods in areas it serves.The agency had previously downgraded some banks two levels at a time, but a footnote in a new manual says the policy is not to lower a banks rating by more than one rating level.The new policy also suggested that downgrades could be avoided altogether, emphasizing that the agency must fully consider the corrective actions taken by a bank.If the bank has fixed its behavior, the manual said, the ratings of the bank should not be lowered solely based on the existence of the practice.For banks, a high rating is not just a point of pride: A low one can scuttle merger plans.The comptrollers office has subtly changed that calculus.This month, the agency issued another manual stating that a low Community Reinvestment Act rating should not inherently block a banks plans to merge or expand.A low rating, the manual said, is not a bar to approval of an application.Image Keith A. Noreika, acting comptroller of the currency, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in June.Credit Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg Wells Fargo, which was downgraded two levels by the agency in Mr. Currys final weeks, would benefit from the shift.Its executives are also poised to gain personally from another new effort: The agency is working to accelerate the vetting of bonuses to departing Wells Fargo executives, according to people briefed on the matter.Wells Fargo was subject to scrutiny of the extra compensation because of a scandal involving the opening of millions of fraudulent accounts.The effort could allow executives to get their payouts sooner, but the agency cannot act alone.The payments must also be approved by another bank oversight agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or F.D.I.C.In a speech on Tuesday, the F.D.I.C.chairman, without naming the comptrollers office, warned about a rolling back of regulations under the new administration.The danger is that changes to regulations could cross the line into substantial weakening of requirements, said the chairman, Martin J. Gruenberg, a holdover from the Obama administration.The comptrollers offices approach also diverges from that of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Less than an hour after the consumer bureau unveiled the final version of rules to rein in the payday-lending industry , which charges triple-digit annual interest rates on short-term loans, the banking regulator effectively took the opposite route.It rescinded guidelines, adopted under Mr. Curry, that made it tougher for banks to offer similar loans tied to checking accounts.The consumer bureaus rules still stand.In the years since the agency issued the guidance, it has become clear to me that it has become difficult for banks to serve consumers need for short-term, small-dollar credit, Mr. Noreika said at the time.It was not the first collision between the comptrollers office and the consumer bureau, which has been led by Richard Cordray, an Obama administration holdover who said on Wednesday that he would leave this month.In July, soon after the consumer bureau adopted a rule that would let consumers band together in class-action lawsuits against financial institutions, Mr. Noreika asked Mr. Cordray to delay the rules publication, arguing that members of his staff needed more time to evaluate whether it threatened the safety and soundness of banks.Mr. Noreikas request echoed some of his former clients concerns.He joined the agency from the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, where he represented banks now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Once Mr. Otting takes over, Mr. Noreika may return to the private sector.Because the Trump administration appointed him as a short-term special government employee, he might soon be able to represent clients before the agency, avoiding the tougher restrictions that appointees confirmed by the Senate face.He did not, for example, need to sign the ethics pledge that requires Senate-confirmed appointees to refrain from lobbying their former agencies for five years.An agency spokesman said that for one year, Mr. Noreika would not communicate with or appear before agency staff members with the intent of influencing them on behalf of anyone seeking official action.Mr. Noreika has adopted the ethos and messaging of Mr. Trumps administration.He keeps a red Make America Great Again hat in his office, according to two visitors.A hat with the same slogan has been seen in a room at the F.D.I.C.that he keeps as a board member, a room that is otherwise empty.David Enrich and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.The All-New DealBook Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
If Bernie Bernstein Existed, Hed Be a Terrible Journalist:::::It should be noted that many people hear the heavily accented voice saying Lenny Bernstein, which is the name of a health reporter at the paper.The caller is not him.We get it, a lot of people distrust the media and suspect the worst out of reporters.But heres what the call got wrong.Most American journalists dont pay for interviews Kris Coratti, a Washington Post spokeswoman, said the publication has a policy that specifically prohibits paying sources.(So does New York Times policy.)The Society of Professional Journalists admonishes checkbook journalism as undermining credibility and corrupting the motives of sources.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Grown-up journalists dont pay for news, said Chris Roberts, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Alabama.People are willing to say things for money that may or may not be true.It helps us to understand the motives more clearly when that is one less reason to tell things that are not true.The practice is more common outside the United States.More than half of journalists in the United Kingdom said it was O.K.to pay for sources in special occasions, compared to 5 percent of American journalists, according to a study published last year by the University of Oxford.In the U.S., paying for sources is usually limited to tabloid newspapers or gossip sites like TMZ.And as a Washington Post reporter noted, $7,000 is a lot of money for a newsroom.We will not be fully investigating these claims That would be a very silly thing for a reporter to say.It would be like a plumber saying we will not fully fix the leak in your pipe.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A journalist worried about his or her reputation would only want to put verified or supported claims in a story carrying their names, said Andrew Seaman, the ethics chair for the Society of Professional Journalists.An ethical reporter would also be unlikely to phrase their request the way the robocall did.Asking for someone willing to make damaging remarks would be brazenly partisan in a way most mainstream reporters try to avoid.Journalists wouldnt normally ask such leading questions, Mr.Seaman said.Theyre after the truth, whether that leads to a scandal or exoneration.Bernie Bernstein?Theres also the matter of the name itself.It seems intended to play into anti-Semitic sentiment.Discrediting media The call appeared designed to stoke distrust in the news media, feeding peoples worst fears of salacious, unethical and overtly partisan reporting.It came at a time when the news has not been flattering for Mr. Moore, especially a Washington Post report in which a woman said he made sexual advances on her when she was 14.Five women have now accused him of sexual misconduct, and a growing number of Republicans have dropped their support or called on him to leave the race.Mr. Roberts, who was a reporter and editor for The Birmingham News between 1989 and 1998, said the robocall fit into some peoples skepticism of the national media.Alabamians, and many from the South, seem to be tired of outsiders coming in and pointing out their flaws, and this goes back for decades, Mr. Roberts said.
Goldman Sachss China Deal Prompts Questions About Countrys U.S. Investment:::::The commission, which is charged by Congress with monitoring the security implications of trade with China, released a more than 600-page report Wednesday criticizing activities by Chinese entities in the United States.The deal has also raised eyebrows among some lawmakers critical of Chinas purchases.Business leaders, such as Goldman Sachs, should continue to try and bring foreign investment and economic expansion into the country, said Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina.Mr. Pittenger has proposed legislation that would broaden the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the agency, known as Cfius, that scrutinizes foreign purchases of American assets.We need a strong Cfius review process to ensure that were not inadvertently strengthening the Chinese military and jeopardizing our national security in the process, Mr. Pittenger said.Photo China Investment Corporation has long invested in the United States, and a Goldman Sachs spokesman emphasized that the fund would focus on nonsensitive industries that are not subject to Cfius review.The $5 billion deal was among a package of more $250 billion in business pacts that the Trump administration announced last week during Mr. Trumps visit with President Xi Jinping of China.Most of the deals lacked details or represented already existing business.Still, they showed how important China has become to many companies in the United States.The billions of dollars in deals signed between private U.S. businesses and Chinese entities last week carry the promise of thousands of new jobs for hardworking Americans, said Raj Shah, the deputy press secretary for the White House.Each of them will go through all applicable review processes.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Since 2000, Chinese companies have announced $136.5 billion in investments in the United States, with $26.4 billion of that coming in just the first three quarters of 2017, according to tracking by the Rhodium Group, a research firm.Much of that funding has flowed into manufacturing including of automobiles, medical devices and industrial machinery in the Midwest and southern United States.That makes Chinese money a complicated subject.Wilbur L. Ross, the commerce secretary, and Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China, included the Goldman Sachs-C.I.C.deal in the hastily arranged package of China agreements last week in part to show the Trump Administration was helping American businesses make money there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But some top advisers within the administration were unhappy about the Goldman deal, seeing it as a jarring contradiction to the White Houses efforts to take a tougher stance toward China, according to two trade advisers, who asked to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to comment on the White Houses behalf.Those deals came just one day after Rep. Pittenger and lawmakers in Washington proposed the expansion of reviews that the United States carries out on foreign investments.Several companies protested that proposed legislation as too restrictive.In a letter to Mr. Pittengers office, IBM whose China partnerships have faced scrutiny before said the bill would bring licensing, joint development and other transactions under government regulation, and that a change to Cfius would limit the ability of American firms to do business abroad while empowering foreign competitors to capture global markets.Goldman Sachs said in a statement that the fund is designed to enhance commercial linkages and promote market access for U.S. firms in China and will seek to improve the balance of the U.S.-China trade relationship.Carolyn Bartholomew, the chairwoman of the congressional commission on China, was more skeptical.I think its important to remember that what this is about is making money for Goldman Sachs, she said.Any other way theyre characterizing it is just icing on the cake.
Trump Offers Condolences, for the Wrong Mass Shooting:::::Photo President Trump appeared to offer his condolences for the wrong mass shooting on Tuesday in a late-night Twitter post, which was later deleted.May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post at 11:34 p.m., soon after arriving back in the United States from his 12-day trip through Asia.That attack occurred more than a week ago, on Nov. 5, when a gunman opened fire at a church, killing 26 and wounding 20 others.Another mass shooting took place early Tuesday, as a gunman in California opened fire at an elementary school and other locations, killing at least four people and injuring several others before he was fatally shot by the police.It was not immediately clear whether the error was caused by a sloppy cut-and-paste job by a jet-lagged president or some other issue.A spokesman for the White House did not respond to emails seeking an explanation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Tuesdays tweet was very similar to a Twitter post by Mr. Trump on the day of the Texas shooting.Critics on Twitter pointed out that the F.B.I.and law enforcement were in fact needed in California.Tuesdays shooting in Northern California was the 17th mass shooting this month, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.
Richard Cordrays Exit From Consumer Bureau Gives Trump an Opening:::::The agency has gotten a lot done, said Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a liberal advocacy group.The mission of the bureau and the work it has done is incredibly popular, across party lines, with the public.Mr. Cordrays critics were quick to cheer his departure.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called the bureau a rogue agency that is long overdue for new leadership.Mr. Cordray has been a whipping boy on Capitol Hill for years Congress called him to testify nearly 30 times but in recent months he also came under attack from other federal agencies.In one case, the Justice Department sided with a mortgage lender that questioned the agencys constitutionality.The acting director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a major banking regulator, publicly undermined several of the bureaus actions and traded heated letters with Mr. Cordray.But President Trump, who ran on a populist platform that harnessed Americans anger toward Wall Street, largely stayed out of the fray.On Twitter, his favorite venting ground, he has not commented on or criticized the consumer bureau or its director.Mr. Cordrays five-year term was scheduled to end in July 2018.He was widely expected to step down early to run for governor in Ohio, his home state.Together we have made a real and lasting difference, Mr. Cordray wrote in an email to the agencys employees.I am confident that you will continue to move forward, nurture this institution we have built together, and maintain its essential value to the American public.And I trust that new leadership will see that value also and work to preserve it.Mr. Cordray did not discuss his future plans in his email.A bureau spokesman declined to comment.In the months since Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Cordray unleashed a fusillade of regulations with mixed success.The agency adopted a new rule in July that would have allowed consumers to band together in class actions against financial institutions.Last month, Congress overturned the rule, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-50 tie in the Senate.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Other rules, including new protections on prepaid debit cards, withstood challenges.The agency recently imposed restrictions that will sharply curtail the payday lending market.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By installing his own director, Mr. Trump will be able to reshape the agency to look more like other financial regulators, many of which are now run by former industry executives.He picked Randal K. Quarles, a former private equity executive and banking industry lawyer to fill one of the top jobs at the Federal Reserve, and Steven Mnuchin, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, heads the Treasury Department.One of the names being floated for the consumer bureaus leadership post is Todd J. Zywicki, a conservative law professor at George Mason University, according to two people familiar with the White Houses discussions.They requested anonymity because the discussions are not public.Democrats pledged to fight any nominee they perceive to be too cozy with the financial industry.The White House has said it wants to stand up for the middle class, said Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.If thats true, the president must nominate a successor who will put working people ahead of Wall Street.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who picked Mr. Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio, to be the agencys enforcement director before Mr. Obama appointed him to bureau director.On Wednesday, she praised Mr. Cordray for holding banks accountable and forcing companies to return money to the people they cheated.But with Mr. Cordrays departure, some of his actions will be in jeopardy.The C.F.P.B.s rule-making agenda will grind to a halt and its enforcement profile will dramatically diminish, said Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading.A new director could abandon some rules still under development, like restrictions on debt collection, and settle or drop lawsuits that the bureau is pursuing.One high-profile example is the case it brought this year against Navient, the nations largest servicer of student loans.The agency claims that Navient misled millions of borrowers and illegally drove up their loan repayment costs.Navient, which is fighting the case, has denied any wrongdoing.Mr. Cordray struck a sanguine tone when asked this summer, in an interview with The New York Times, about his legacy.I think its impossible not to care about how those transitions will go, he said.But you also have to recognize that there are some things that are within your control, and some things that are not.Pausing, he added: Serenity, prayer whatever is your way of coping.
Hidden in the Senate Tax Bill: Surprise Gifts for Breweries and Start-Ups:::::And the Senate amendment, released on Tuesday by Senator Orrin Hatch, who heads the finance committee, included a scattering of carve-outs for interest groups large and small.Among those who stand to benefit are tech companies, who successfully pushed for changes to the treatment of stock options, which are heavily used by start-ups to compensate workers and investors.The Senate amendment introduced on Tuesday removed a provision in the original bill that would have taxed employee stock options upon vesting, instead of when theyre exercised or cashed-in.Tech companies including Uber and Airbnb signed a letter arguing the provision was unfair to start-ups and their workers, since stock options are essentially paper wealth, not real money, and should not be taxed until they are exercised.Not only did the industry successfully lobby for the provision to be removed from both the House and Senate bills, it also won a proactive victory in the Senate bill, which now includes language sought by the industry giving more flexibility for exercising stock options, allowing employees seven years to pay tax obligations instead of having to pay taxes on the fair-market value of the shares at the time they were exercised.That was a nice addition, said Evan Engstrom, the executive director of a start-up advocacy group called Engine, which drafted and circulated the letter signed by Uber, Airbnb and more than 600 tech companies opposing the original stock option language.Mr. Engstrom said he thought the lobbying had an impact, despite the compressed time frame for moving the bill.It didnt foreclose the possibility of lobbying all together, he said.He added, though, It was a bit of a scramble, because we didnt really have a lot of visibility.Smaller trade groups have been particularly strained by the rapid pace, lobbyists working on the issue said.Such groups have fewer experts to quickly analyze complex legislative language, fewer lobbyists to try to change provisions that negatively impact their members and smaller budgets for flying in members to plead their cases directly.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The speed issues really make it tough to educate and mobilize our membership about the nuance on this, when there are a lot of high-profile issues being talked about in the media, said Ian McTiernan, manager of federal relations for the American Institute of Architects, which has told House and Senate Republicans that their bills contain three provisions that would disproportionately hurt the 90,000 architects represented by the association, according to a letter it sent to members of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday.It singled out provisions rolling back tax credits for rehabilitating historic structures and making energy efficient improvements to commercial buildings, and the explicit exclusion of architectural firms from tax breaks extended to other small pass-through corporations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lobbyists for more influential interest groups say that their bandwidth is being stretched by other issues gaining legislative traction at the same time as tax reform.For instance, several of the groups trying to protect a valuable mortgage-related tax break including the National Association of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Association also have an interest in legislation passed by the House on Tuesday to overhaul a federal flood insurance program.The groups that have had the most success shaping the legislation started long before the bills were unveiled this month.For instance, the Retail Industry Leaders Association had convened a team of tax experts from the giant retail companies in its membership to help kill a proposed tax on imports earlier this year, and it deployed a similar approach to shaping an excise tax provision in the House bill introduced this month.As soon as the association staff members got their hands on the bill, they sent it to the tax experts to assess the potential impacts on their companies, which include Target and Walmart.Some member companies raised specific questions and concerns about the excise tax provision, which called for a 20 percent tax on payments to foreign affiliates, according to Brian Dodge, an official at the association.All of our companies have these experts, and they were able to go through it pretty quickly to evaluate the good, the bad and the indifferent, Mr.Dodge said.So it wasnt left to staff here to try to guess how our members might be affected.The associations lobbyists relayed those concerns to the House Ways and Means Committee, and also helped connect executives from member companies with key lawmakers.Some of those concerns were assuaged in an amendment passed last week that clarified who would be impacted by the excise tax and also created a credit for foreign taxes paid by affected companies.The compressed time frame is not the only reason that powerful industry groups have been less able to shape the debate than in 1986, the last time Congress overhauled the tax code.Since then, well-financed ideological advocacy groups have become bigger players in legislative debates, including a raft of conservative groups that have lobbied hard to eliminate many industry specific carve outs.Still, some business groups have won changes in the bills.The Senate amendment included apparent victories for the Brewers Association, including a temporary reduction in the excise taxes levied on beer.The CRAFT beverage modernization provision, introduced by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, would lower the tax rate on beer produced in the United States, particularly for small breweries.The amendment will lower the tax on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed and lower it to $3.50 per barrel for small brewers on the first 60,000 barrels produced domestically.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some citrus growers also gained a tax break for the costs of replanting after disasters.Flooding

Why Were Still Fighting Over the Health Care Mandate:::::To its supporters, the mandate is the linchpin of a comprehensive regulatory framework intended to improve the national health care market and, in particular, to increase the number of people with health insurance.More than anything else, the goal of Obamacare was to expand the ranks of the insured, and supporters see the mandate as one of the keys to that goal.In the 1990s, states that attempted to guarantee health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions saw their individual insurance markets collapse when those rules were implemented without coverage mandates (in part because not enough healthy customers signed up).The mandate makes those rules possible.The C.B.O.currently estimates that eliminating the requirement would decrease coverage by 13 million over the next decade.The mandate, in this view, is a benevolent technocratic necessity, born of economic models and real-world experience.When the outcome is so obviously positive, concerns about government power are irrelevant.But to many of Obamacares critics, those concerns are of the highest importance.In this view, the mandate is a form of unacceptable government overreach, a violation of the individual right to avoid engaging in commerce.It is an attempt to compel behavior not as a result of making a choice, like driving, but as a matter of being alive.It is also likely to be less effective than most supporters currently believe, thanks in part to the C.B.O.s assumption that the mandate drives sign-ups for Medicaid, which generally has no premiums.On this point, the C.B.O.may soon agree.Recent reports indicate it is in the process of reassessing its coverage model and that the revision will find that repealing the mandate would have smaller effects on coverage.Finally, for those who oppose Obamacare which is to say, most Republicans the mandate is also useful as a political cudgel, a widely disliked signature provision of a law they oppose for a multitude of reasons.It does not hurt that the C.B.O.currently estimates that repealing it would reduce the deficit by $338 billion over a decade, as a result of reduced coverage, savings that could be used to help offset the effects of tax reductions.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.To critics, then, the mandate is bad politics, an ineffective policy and a violation, regardless of what the Supreme Court has said, of our nations founding code.To defenders, it is a practical and necessary exercise of regulatory authority in service of an unalloyed public good.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You can see these views throughout the history of the provision, which is less a consistent partisan battleground and more of a back and forth between those who view the provision as a practical necessity and those who view it as a political loser.The provision was proposed by conservative policy experts at the Heritage Foundation and found traction in the 1990s as part of a health care bill endorsed by a group of Republican senators.When Massachusetts Republican governor, Mitt Romney, backed the mandate as part of a 2006 health care overhaul, political advisers warned him away, but he was reportedly convinced by an economic model showing that without the mandate, the plan would cover a third of the people at two-thirds of the cost.On the campaign trail in 2008, Hillary Clinton supported the mandate, while Barack Obama was opposed.As president, however, he supported it, convinced in part by an economic model showing it would result in more coverage.Once passed into law, the provision was then challenged by Republicans, who had come to universally oppose the idea as an unconstitutional requirement to engage in commerce.The Supreme Court agreed but decided it was legal anyway, as a tax.When the health law went online, Mr. Obama expanded exemptions to the mandate using dubious legal authority in response to a popular outcry about its effect.Part of the reason the fight over the mandate is so persistent is that the two prevailing views are largely incompatible.The mandate pits pragmatism versus principle, results versus process, expertise versus ideals.With an all-or-nothing provision like the mandate, there is no easy way to split the difference.And what opponents have discovered is that the practical arguments have tended to win even, as we saw in this summers failed health care efforts, in a Republican-controlled Congress.By including a repeal of the mandate in tax legislation, however, Republicans now appear to be transitioning to a more practical argument themselves.After the Senate bill was released on Tuesday, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, explained its inclusion: Repeal would raise revenue, help offset the effects of tax reductions elsewhere in the bill and make it easier for Republicans to make a lower corporate tax permanent.It helped, he added, that it was unpopular and that every Republican senator supported repeal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What todays Republicans have learned from years of arguments over the mandate is that it is a means to an end, a vehicle for achieving partisan policy goals rather than a matter to be disputed on principle.As a critic of Obamacare, I tend to side with those who oppose the mandate.But I also recognize that its proponents have a point when they argue that it is the fulcrum of a complex coverage scheme and that eliminating only one component of the health care act could be a recipe for even greater dysfunction in the laws insurance exchanges than exists now.And while Republicans may well be right that the C.B.O.s current estimate overstates the impact of the mandate on health coverage, what that means is that the budget savings are less substantial as well.For Republicans, repealing the mandate would be a partial victory.For if they succeed hardly a certainty, given the partys internal divisions the argument over the requirement would still persist, because Obamacares pre-existing conditions regulations would still be on the books, creating the potential for the same sort of individual market problems observed in the states.So it would end the mandate, yes, but not the debate around it.Even in its absence, well never really be able to escape.
Trump Returns and Attacks a Favorite Foe: CNN:::::WASHINGTON President Trump got an early start on his first day back from his Asia trip, criticizing his longtime foe CNN before 6 a.m. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he had been forced to watch CNN while in the Philippines and was reminded how bad, and FAKE, it is.Loser!During Mr. Trumps 12-day trip to Asia, it was disclosed that CNN is a central component of a dispute between the administration and AT&T, which is seeking approval to buy Time Warner.Accounts of the negotiations vary; in one, the Justice Department urged AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of cable channels including CNN, or to sell DirecTV, the satellite television provider.While it is normal for the Justice Department to be involved in antitrust issues, the fate of CNN in this particular case raises questions about whether the president is trying to influence the outcome, given his very public opinion of the news network.During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said his administration would not let such a deal go through.Shortly before criticizing CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Trump promoted an upcoming report about his Asia trip on Fox News Channel, a network much more to his liking.
This Tax Bill Is Now a Health Care Bill:::::Photo This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter.You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.Republican leaders in the Senate somehow needed to find an extra few hundred billion dollars.They needed to find that money because they want to cut taxes on the wealthy and cut them deeply.By the time the Senate leaders had finished coming up with all of their top-end tax cuts last week, their bill was projected to cost more than the House had previously committed to spending.So how could the Senate solve its shortfall?One option would have been to cut taxes a little less for the wealthy.That is not the option the Senate leaders chose.Instead, they said yesterday that they would be getting rid of the individual mandate the federal rule, in the Affordable Care Act, that requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine.The politics of scrapping the mandate have long been tempting.Many people dont like being required to buy anything.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But health economists believe the mandate to be important.Without it, more people will choose to risk not having insurance.Others wont even realize they are eligible for Medicaid or federally subsidized insurance plans, because they wont be nudged to look for a plan.
Roy Moore Reminds Me of My Rabbi:::::One morning several years after my conversion had been completed, a friend emailed with a short news item that my rabbi whose name was still on my holiday card list had been arrested.In an instant, all of the strangest moments of my conversion experience made sense.I was one of only four women to come forward and tell their stories, and because of my public role as a writer, I became his most well-known victim.I drove from my home in New Jersey with my toddler and newborn to speak at his sentencing hearing in 2015 in Washington, where he was sent to more than six years in prison.Its hard to describe the depth of my feeling of betrayal.As a convert, I wasnt just another student of Rabbi Freundel.My faith and practice my Judaism was shaped by his words, deeds and thought.For those of us victimized by trusted religious leaders, every day is a struggle to disentangle our negative associations of beautiful rituals from the ugly abusers who taught us about their meaning.An Orthodox Jew, Rabbi Freundel was fixated on the minutiae of Jewish law.He drilled his converts in the proper blessings to say over a banana or a pretzel, and the order in which they should be recited should we happen to eat both at the same meal.This kind of knowledge was the bedrock of my conversion experience.But how could I continue to make myself care about such details when it became clear that the man who taught them to me valued knowing the blessing for a specific food group over behaving like a decent human being?Despite having grown up as a Jew (my father was Jewish, but according to Orthodox law only the children of Jewish mothers are Jewish), there were many aspects of observant Jewish life that were new to me until the year I spent converting.The foundation of so much of my religious practice is inextricably tied to that period of my life, and thus, to Rabbi Freundel.I have not been to services in years because the tunes sung on Shabbat remind me so much of him.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Every public victim of a famous sexual predator must endure uncomfortable conversations with strangers and, thanks to the internet, never knowing if the person youve just met already knows your story.But when you accuse a religious figure, theres a whole other kind of discomfort, one that comes from the friends, family members and other religious leaders who consider speaking out about a religious crime as airing dirty laundry for the entire world to see.While Rabbi Freundel had few defenders in the Jewish community after his fall, there were plenty of people fellow rabbis included who very quickly made light of him, made him into a punch line, in the process minimizing his crime.Others thought his prison sentence was overkill after all, we hadnt been physically assaulted.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A significant number of friends, relatives and religious leaders have never once mentioned the case to me, despite my role as its most public victim.Orthodox Jews already face an uphill battle in the modern world, they say, and drawing attention to these sordid stories makes that hill that much steeper.These people also prefer not acknowledging what happened to me and so many other women because its more comfortable to pretend it never happened.I too once felt that way.I preferred not to see the abuses in the community I had voluntarily joined as an adult because witnessing my communitys willful blindness to those abuses could send me over the edge.Being the victim of a sexual crime stripped me of that luxury.In a strange way, having the crime committed against me captured on tape was a blessing: Prosecutors noted that Rabbi Freundel could clearly be seen setting up the camera and taking it down.Nobody could attach the qualifier if true to my charges.The evidence unearthed by the police was irrefutable.For Roy Moores accusers, who say they were preyed upon 40 years ago when they were 14 to 18 years old, hard evidence like this does not exist, and so they face the pain not only of coming forward, but also of being disbelieved and disparaged.Mr. Moore says he doesnt even know Beverly Young Nelson, who accused him on Monday of assaulting her when she was 16, never mind the fact that it appears he signed her yearbook.In the meantime, Mr. Moores wife has posted a letter signed by 50 pastors, written during the primary season.(Though some of those pastors are saying that they do not, in fact, support Mr.Moore.)We are ready to join the fight and send a bold message to Washington: dishonesty, fear of man and immorality are an affront to our convictions and our Savior and we wont put up with it any longer, the letter says.We urge you to join us at the polls to cast your vote for Roy Moore.For these believers, losing Mr. Moore means losing an outspoken voice for traditional Christian values.He rose to prominence in the evangelical world for giving up his bench as a judge not once, but twice, for placing his religious beliefs ahead of his judicial duties.Last month The Washington Post reported on a poem Mr. Moore recited at a rally at a Baptist Church: You think that Gods not angry that this land is a moral slum?How much longer will it be before his judgment comes?His defenders argue that not voting for Mr. Moore, and therefore losing a Republican Senate seat and possibly control of the Senate, could lead to worse outcomes for Christians than simply holding their noses and electing him to office.They could not be more mistaken.The damage that will be done to the Republican brand and those Christians who watch their religious leaders stand by Mr. Moore will be irreversible.If he wins, the Republicans may have a reliably conservative vote in the Senate, but one thing is guaranteed: Religious leaders who defend him risk their flock being infected with the same disenchantment I was after the arrest of my rabbi.Religious leaders often fret that such creeping faithlessness puts society at risk more than any political ideology.As a prominent evangelical put it in a 2006 Washington Times column: Our peace and happiness as well as our prosperity depend not on any political party or any great leader, but rather upon our return as a nation to faith in Almighty God.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a lovely message, but one thats too often discredited by its messengers.The man who wrote that column?Roy Moore.
How to Fix the Republican Tax Plan:::::Photo Back when congressional Republicans were rolling out one unpopular health care bill after another, it was a challenge to come up with constructive advice on how to fix their efforts.Thats because Republicans had set themselves an impossible task with health reform: They were trying to do something sweeping enough to be called repeal, modest enough to keep most of Obamacares beneficiaries on the insurance rolls and also money-saving enough to provide some extra budget room for the eternal dream of tax cuts.No plan could satisfy all three requirements; as they say in Susan Collinss Maine, you cant get there from here.With the tax reform that the House and the Senate are now considering, though, the task of advice-giving is easier.For one thing, this time there is no longstanding repeal promise that the base demands Republicans fulfill; theres just the generic promise to cut taxes that every Republican politician makes.For another, the party has decided not to even try to for deficit-neutrality (taking my advice, so send your angry deficit-hawk missives to my address in, ah, Manitoba), giving themselves $1.5 trillion over 10 years to play with and no inherent requirement to offset any of their cuts.Sadly, despite this simplifying improvidence, the G.O.P.still ended up with a pair of bills that look, once again, like the caricature of Reagan-era Republicanism the party has become: heavy with tax cuts for corporations and the heirs of millionaires, lighter on relief for the middle class, lighter still for the working class, with a complicated slew of provisions and score-gaming expiration dates that have made it hard to discern whether lots of non-rich Americans (including the plans supposed model beneficiary, a family making $60,000 with multiple kids) even get a tax cut at all.But if the initial House and Senate bills were flawed, its also been very easy to see what would make them better.The Republicans seem to be trying, in their none-too-competent and ideologically straitjacketed way, to cut taxes for two major constituencies, employers and middle-class families, while paying for some of these tax cuts by goring well-off professionals in high-tax liberal states.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This would not be a bad way to design a right-of-center tax bill.Theres nothing wrong with going after the other partys constituencies if those constituencies enjoy unearned privileges, which professionals in blue states (this columnist included) emphatically do.Yes, in an ideal world there would be a grand bipartisan tax reform that gores everyones ox, but that world aint this one, and the fact that the Republicans are trying to cut the home-mortgage deduction and the state and local tax deductions is a good thing because those deductions are bad subsidies for the rentier class, benefits that flow overwhelmingly to the affluent, an obvious place for a limited-government egalitarianism to seek reform.
The G.O.P.s 20th-Century Tax Plan:::::Even more perversely, taxpayers can raise this 30 percent threshold by making more capital investments for example by purchasing robots and machinery to replace employees.This is apparently part of an overall scheme to punish workers: the evisceration of the estate tax, the reduction in the corporate rate and the increased tax burdens on education all allocate precious government resources to financial, rather than human, capital.Another pressing goal of tax reform is to reduce the incentives for companies to move their operations overseas.But again, the bill does the opposite.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.The House bill proposes an international tax system that would subject income of high-profit foreign subsidiaries to a 10 percent minimum tax.Senate Republicans have also proposed a minimum tax on foreign earnings, at a 12.5 percent rate on income from intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights.This new international tax system is a compromise between a territorial system, which would exempt foreign income altogether, and a worldwide system, which would tax all income, foreign or domestic, on basis at the same rate.This quasi-territorial approach would create a system unlike any other in the world today, applying different tax rates depending on where the income is earned.Faced with a 20 percent rate at home and a 12.5 percent (or less) effective rate on income earned abroad, companies would still be encouraged to move jobs and profits offshore.The Senate plan attempts to deal with this problem, at least in the case of intangible assets, by also granting a 12.5 percent rate on an American companys domestic intangible income.But as I have argued elsewhere, this plank likely violates our obligations under the World Trade Organization agreements because the amount of income that receives the benefit of the lower rate is directly linked to the amount of income from exports, thereby qualifying as an unlawful export subsidy.The W.T.O.has ruled against several similar measures that Congress has passed, and the issue was thought to have been put to rest when Congress repealed the last such measure in 2004.The legal instability surrounding this part of the Senate plan will significantly reduce a companys ability to rely on it in the future.Accordingly, corporations will continue to locate intellectual property overseas.Other dynamics worsen the shifting problem.Because of the mechanics of the formula for calculating the minimum tax, the tax can be reduced by moving assets overseas.Additionally, because the minimum tax is essentially calculated on a global basis, rather than per country, this further encourages companies to shift investment offshore in order to blend low- or zero-taxed income from tax havens with income from higher-tax foreign countries.So, rather than paying 20 percent or even 12.5 percent on income earned in the United States, companies will move investment offshore to a tax haven until the global foreign tax rate is blended down to the minimum rate, avoiding paying American taxes altogether.In other words, the United States loses out on revenues and investment.In fact, both plans largely maintain pressures for companies to locate corporate residency abroad, despite their claim to reduce taxes on corporate income.After all, a company that moves its residency to a tax haven can often achieve zero taxation, rather than being taxed at the American minimum rate, however low.Both plans have safeguards against this by increasing the tax burden on certain inbound investments, but these can be avoided by selling through independent distributors rather than related parties, among other strategies.And even then, business lobbying has already caused the House to scale back on its original proposal a dynamic that does not bode well for the Senates counterpart measure.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rather than revising the definition of corporate residency to account for factors such as the location of a companys headquarters or shareholders, the House and Senate plans retain the place of incorporation as the sole determinant of corporate residency, a notoriously artificial definition that has become disconnected from economic reality.They also largely subscribe to the fiction that one can identify a specific geographic locale where income is produced.Instead of modernizing the taxation of business income, Republicans have doubled down on outdated concepts like corporate residence and origin of income that have become meaningless in a global and digital economy, while also attempting to preserve dying industries.The result is a dizzyingly complex system that will interfere with market forces.Other countries have increasingly relied on consumption taxes as pro-growth alternatives to traditional business income taxes.The United States, however, remains wedded by politics and ideology to an inefficient, easily manipulated and antiquated tax policy.Rather than driving the United States to be a competitive force in the 21st century, the Republicans plans hold the United States back in the last one.
Could a Democrat Actually Win a Senate Seat in Alabama? Precedents Are Few, but Telling:::::Advertisement Could a Democrat Actually Win a Senate Seat in Alabama?Precedents Are Few, but Telling The Roy Moore race tests the limits of what might be the most Republican state in the country.Image Controversy swirls around Roy Moore, but recent polls still show a tight race.Credit Brynn Anderson/Associated Press A Democratic victory in an Alabama Senate race would rank as one of the most improbable, astonishing outcomes in the last few years of improbable, astonishing political events.So, yes, this could happen.The Roy Moore-Doug Jones contest can be seen as a mad experiment to test the limits of Republican strength in Alabama, perhaps the toughest for Democrats in the country.It might be reasonable to say that if Democrats cant win it here and now, they just cant win it as long as the country remains so divided by race, religion and education.Mr. Moore, the Republican, was an electorally weak nominee even before allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls led Republican leaders to call for him to leave the race.Hes running at a moment when the presidents approval rating is in the 30s and when the state Republican Party remains bruised from the resignation of Robert Bentley as governor last spring because of a sex scandal.Perhaps most concerning for Republican hopes, this is a special election.Mr. Moore will be the only reason for Republican voters to show up and vote.A Republican defeat in Alabama would jeopardize the partys Senate majority in the midterms in 2018.Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the chamber, but in 2018 they have only two good opportunities, in Arizona and Nevada, and must defend 10 seats in states that voted for Donald J. Trump.A Democratic victory in Alabama would hand the party that third, tough-to-find state even before the beginning of the cycle.It is probably far too soon to get a good sense of where the race will end up, especially since it is not clear whether a write-in candidate will enter the race.Recent polls have not been of the highest quality, but they suggest a tight race.Theres a simple reason Mr. Moore is still very competitive: Alabama is just that conservative.Alabama voted for Mr. Trump by 28 percentage points in 2016, but even this doesnt do justice to the Republican strength there.The state is deeply polarized by race.Hillary Clinton probably didnt win even 15 percent of white Alabama voters last year.Black voters represent a quarter of the electorate, and made up around two-thirds of Mrs. Clintons 34 percent statewide vote share.Democrats can hope for higher black turnout, but theyve struggled to mobilize black voters without Barack Obama on the ballot in recent elections.Its tough enough to carry a state where your partys presidential candidate lost by 28 points.Its about one-third harder if youve already maximized your vote share among a quarter of the electorate.In part for that reason, Alabamas election results are among the most stable in the country.Since 1984, Alabama has swung less between presidential elections than any other state, moving an average of just 4.8 points from the prior presidential result.Alabama also has the third-lowest average share of third-party votes in the country in presidential elections since 1980, which may be a rough measure of the strength of partisan allegiances.A reason that Alabama might be tougher still for Democrats is that its staunchly conservative white voters are particularly tough to persuade.White evangelical Christians represent about half of Alabamas electorate, according to exit polls, and more than 90 percent of them probably supported Mr. Trump.Theres no way to be sure that its harder to persuade a white evangelical Christian in the racially polarized South than a less religious, white voter in the North.But almost all of the states that have elected senators against the grain of a states partisan lean in the last decade or so look nothing like Alabama.Those states like Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Alaska and West Virginia are among the whitest in the country.All have below-average levels of evangelical Christians, and several have a recent track record of voting for the other party in statewide contests.These same white, Northern, less religious states always top the list of the highest tallies for third-party candidates, and usually have above-average swings in presidential elections as well.Its not easy to come up with recent favorable precedents for Democratic victories in the Deep South.Perhaps the best involves David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who managed to lose the governors race by 12 points in 2015.Mr. Obama lost Louisiana by 17 points in 2012.Mr. Vitter was dogged by a prostitution scandal from nearly a decade earlier.Another promising precedent for Democrats happens to be Mr. Moore himself.He won by only four points in his 2012 campaign for Alabama chief justice, and that was without the sexual harassment allegations that have shaken his current Senate campaign.It was the worst performance by an Alabama Republican running for statewide office since 2008.Black voters represented a larger share of the election in both of these contests than they have in the post-Obama era, so one might assume that Democrats would fare a couple of points worse with todays turnout patterns.Even so, Democrats fared well even though neither Mr. Vitter nor Mr. Moore in 2012 was as weak as Mr. Moore is today.Now, national political conditions are plainly more favorable for the Democrats.And this is a special election, when surprising results are a little more common.But Republicans can take hope because neither of these precedents was a federal election.That makes a big difference.Historically, the relationship between governors election results and presidential vote choice is quite weak relative to federal elections and presidential vote choice.Democrats also ran more moderate candidates in those races.John Bel Edwards, now governor of Louisiana, ran against Mr. Vitter as a pro-gun, anti-abortion Democrat.Mr. Moores 2012 opponent, the circuit court judge Bob Vance, consistently characterized himself as a moderate without taking positions on hot-button issues.Mr. Jones, on the other hand, lists his support for Planned Parenthood on his website, and doesnt support a ban on abortions after 20 weeks the sort of issue that might play a prominent role in the final month of the campaign.Whether Mr. Moore will have the resources necessary to appeal to Alabamas deep conservatism is an open question.Even if he does, its possible that the allegations against him are just bad enough to ensure defeat.But if Mr. Moore does have the money and the opening to make the case that Mr. Jones is too liberal, I wouldnt count him out.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday

Senators Warner and Corker Speak With The Times on Withering Bipartisanship:::::And then there are Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner, two Southern senators who, largely by accident, have broken the partisan mold in Mr. Trumps Washington.Mr. Trumps fiercest Republican critic As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Corker was already one of the most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill.During his two terms in Washington, the conservative lawmaker had earned a reputation for being willing to negotiate with Democrats.Then he decided not to seek re-election.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.In the weeks since, Mr. Corker has emerged as one of Mr. Trumps chief Republican critics, often joining Democrats in critiquing the president and his partys acquiescence.I dont know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country, Mr. Corker said in one interview last month.In one tweet, the senator compared the White House to a day care minding an unqualified president; he also has warned that Mr. Trump is isolating the United States from its allies around the world.Mr. Trump replied in kind, referring to Mr. Corker as Liddle Bob in a string of counterpunches.Mr. Corker appears poised to make the most of his elevated platform and freedom from political considerations.On Tuesday, he joined with Democrats to hold a rare Foreign Relations hearing that focused on the presidents authority over the United States nuclear weapons stock.The hearing raised questions about who should be allowed to wage nuclear war at a time that tensions with North Korea have dominated foreign policy.He has been one of the most aggressive Republican critics of Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate nominee in Alabama who is accused of making sexual or romantic advances toward five teenage girls.Look, Im sorry, Mr. Corker wrote on Twitter, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moores nomination was a bridge too far.And Mr. Corker, who has repeatedly raised concerns about adding to the nations budget deficit, is also expected to be a key vote on the Republicans tax plan.Without his support, the bill would be on life support.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A key to the Russia investigations Mr. Warner, on the other hand, has avoided engaging directly with the president.But as the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he has helped steer an investigation into Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign helped them do so.The committee post has made Mr. Warner, a moderate former governor of Virginia with otherwise little national exposure, one of the most important Democrats in Congress.But with Republicans in control of the committee, and its agenda, the post also has required him to carefully cultivate a relationship with the Republican chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina.So far, it has appeared to work.While Democrats and Republicans who are working on a parallel investigation in the House Intelligence Committee have exchanged partisan fire and given up hope for a bipartisan finding, Mr. Warner and Mr. Burr have pushed ahead, even against intense pressure from Mr. Trump to end their work.Whether the Senate committee will hold together to issue joint conclusions about the Russian interference campaign and the Trump campaigns role, if any depends on whether bipartisanship will prevail.
Republicans May Use Cuts in Entitlement Programs to Reduce Deficit:::::You cannot get the national debt under control, you cannot get that deficit under control, if you dont do both grow the economy, cut spending, said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.The Republican tax plan, he said grows the economy.Weve got a lot of work to do in cutting spending.Photo Democrats said the tax bill was opening the door to the kind of entitlement cuts that Republicans have long wanted to pursue.This is a nasty, two-step strategy that has long been the holy grail for hard-right Republicans, said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.If this bill passes, you can bet the Republicans will immediately sharpen the knives for middle-class benefits.The Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday that a law passed in 2010 would necessitate cuts to Medicare of as much as $25 billion next year.The pay-as-you-go law requires that legislation that adds to the federal deficit be paid for with spending cuts or other offsets.If that does not happen, automatic cuts to programs like Medicare kick in.The Medicare cuts, which are capped at 4 percent of the programs annual spending, could reach almost a half trillion dollars over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The cuts can be averted through bipartisan legislation, though it is unclear whether Republicans would go along with such workarounds.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said previous Republican tax cut efforts had paved the way for sweeping spending cut proposals after the red ink reared its head.After President George W. Bush signed tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, his administration sought to overhaul Social Security and Medicare in hopes of cutting costs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I cant believe how quickly the deficit hawks in the Republican Party flew away after they saw the $1.5 trillion, Mr. Wyden said of the lost revenues that Republicans have approved in their tax plan.Were sure that they will start making their way back when we see the deficits.Fiscal conservatives in the House and the Senate have long wanted to rein in spending on such programs but have had to temper those desires this year now that President Trump, who promised as a candidate not to touch entitlement programs, is in office.But Mr. Trump showed some flexibility on the matter this year when he supported a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would have cut Medicaid funding.And in recent weeks, Republican leaders have quietly started to indicate that if they succeed in passing tax cuts, they will, in fact, look to overhaul government welfare programs.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said this month that tax overhaul alone wont get us back to a balanced budget.He said that House Republicans would soon turn toward welfare reform and tackling the entitlements.Some Republican senators have also expressed interest in turning to spending cuts afterward.Yes, we waste an enormous amount of money in the federal budget, said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho.He said that government personnel should be cut along with Medicare and Social Security.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Top White House officials have also suggested that the administration is willing to get on board with entitlement changes.In an interview with CNBC last week, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, said that the president was focused on taxes, deregulation and infrastructure and that changes to safety net programs would follow.I think when he gets done with those, I think welfare is going to come up, Mr. Cohn said.If Republicans pass their tax bill and their optimistic projections about economic growth do not come to pass, they will face pressure to address the deficit and cut spending.Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that he was concerned about the effect of the tax bill on deficits and that it added to the urgency to scale back programs like Medicare.Tax reform is looking like it will make our long-term debt more problematic, and the long-term driver of our debt is increases in entitlement spending, said Mr. Strain, who argued that it was a better use of resources to cut corporate taxes than to increase funding for entitlements.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If Republicans decide to try to circumvent the pay-as-you-go rule, it could be taken as a sign that they are not serious about deficit reduction.For Democrats, it could be enticing to show the public the consequences of Republican-driven tax cuts, but it would be difficult for them to essentially support cuts to a government program that provides health insurance for the elderly.At the end of the day, it is somewhat akin to the debt limit that no one actually wants to let it happen, said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who noted that spending would eventually have to be addressed if Republicans used the deficit to finance tax cuts.For now, Republicans are playing down the likelihood that Medicare cuts will come to pass.No such thing is going to be triggered automatically, said Senator Patrick J.

Pentagon Approves Gender-Reassignment Surgery for Service Member:::::Photo WASHINGTON The Pentagon approved a gender-reassignment surgery for an active-duty military member, defense officials said on Tuesday, four months after President Trump abruptly announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military.The surgery is the latest setback to Mr. Trumps effort to put a ban in place.Two weeks ago, a federal judge temporarily blocked the ban, ruling that the justification for it was suspect and most likely unconstitutional.Even before the ruling, officials at the Defense Department had been slow-walking Mr. Trumps orders, telling transgender members of the military that they could continue to serve openly while the Pentagon decided how to handle the ban.Photo In announcing the ban in July, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that United States forces could not afford the tremendous medical costs and disruption of transgender service members.He said he had consulted with generals and military experts, but Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, was given only a days notice of the decision.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The RAND Corporation, in a 2016 study, found that allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military would have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs for the Pentagon.It estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an increase of 0.04 to 0.13 percent in spending.Citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness in the United States.
China Could Sell Trump the Brooklyn Bridge:::::And, finally, were going through a change in the climate of technology and work: Machines are acquiring all five senses, and with big data and artificial intelligence, every company can now analyze, optimize, prophesize, customize, digitize and automatize more and more jobs, products and services.And those companies that dont will wither.So hows China responding?To deal with the change in the climate, its massively investing in clean power and electric vehicles because its own people wont be able to breathe otherwise and because it knows that in a world that will add another one billion people by around 2030, clean power and transportation and energy efficiency will be the next great global industry, or nobody anywhere will breathe.In response to a more interdependent world, China is deepening its trade ties to all the fast-growing Asian markets around it through its One Belt, One Road project and its Asian Development Bank, while tightly controlling its own market.I call it globalization for me but not for you.Because while China hails globalization, it imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars (while America imposes only 2.5 percent) and 50-50 joint ventures and technology transfers for big companies that want to gain access to Chinas giant market.But China gets away with it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In technology, China has embarked on a plan called Made in China 2025 thats plowing government funds and research into commercializing 10 strategic industries while creating regulations and swiping intellectual property from abroad to make them all grow faster.These industries include electric vehicles, new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, biopharmacy, quantum computing, 5G mobile communications, and robotics.And Trump?On the change in the climate, hes promoting coal over clean energy, like wind and solar, and has appointed climate-change deniers to all of his key environmental posts.While China is run by engineers, Trump doesnt even have a science adviser.Hes refused to fill the White House Office of Science and Technology, which, as Newsweek reported, has been without a boss for the longest stretch since its establishment in 1976.On globalization, Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, which would have put him at the helm of a 12-nation Pacific trading bloc (without China), built on U.S. interests and values, and would have eliminated as many as 18,000 tariffs on U.S. exports to countries that, together with the U.S., control 40 percent of global G.D.P.And then he went to China and praised Beijing for beating us at our own game!Well, Donald, when you unilaterally disarm, that tends to happen.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By the way, the 11 other TPP nations are now trying to create their own free-trade zone without the U.S.So after decades of America trying to push all their markets open, theyre going to open without us.Nice going, Mr. President, China thanks you, because these countries will be much more vulnerable to Chinese economic pressure with our presence diminished.On the change of the climate of technology, Trump is pushing a tax bill that is based on no analysis of emerging technologies and how we might reform our tax laws to incentivize more investment in them.Actually, the bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric cars; shrink the tax credits vital for enabling wind projects; and impose a tax on the endowments of our wealthiest colleges i.e., our science and engineering treasures endowments that colleges use to fund research and extend scholarships for the neediest students.This will be wounding to one of Americas gems, its institutions of higher education, Drew Faust, the president of Harvard, said to me.And its basically being done to cut taxes for the wealthy.Moreover, at a time when Chinas roads and rails increasingly look like the Jetsons and ours increasingly look like the Flintstones, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials complained in a Nov. 9 letter to House leaders that their draft tax bill in order to raise more money for corporate tax cuts makes significant changes to some of the federally supported financing mechanisms used for transportation specifically the proposed termination of tax-exempt private activity bonds (PABs), which serve as an important infrastructure financing tool that attracts private sector investment to large transportation projects across the country.So the Chinese are focused on the giant winds of change, and Trump is betting on his gut and a grab bag of tax cuts based on no take on the world, other than dubious trickle-down economics.No surprise.When you dont know where youre going any tax cut will get you there, any replacement for Obamacare will get you there, any wall will get you there, any trade concession will get you there.Personally, I am not persuaded Chinas top-down industrial policy will make China great in the end; it has created huge domestic debt challenges related to its state-owned industries and real estate bubbles.In fact, Im certain our economic system is better than theirs in theory.But China, with its ability to focus, is getting 90 percent out of its inferior system, and it has brought China a long way fast.And we, with too little focus, are getting 50 percent out of our superior system.If that persists, it will impact the balance of power.Now you know why the Chinese were so happy to throw a bash for Trump in Beijing.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Doesnt Recall:::::To his credit, Mr.Sessions did not take the bait.Looks like is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel, he said.But, in a letter on Monday, his department told the committee that it was weighing such a move.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Whether or not the department appoints a special counsel, the pressure to do so is clear, from both Republicans in Congress and Mr. Trump, who has threatened Mr. Sessionss job if he fails to prosecute Mrs. Clinton.Thats whats so alarming: the push for the Justice Department to undertake a politically motivated investigation of a presidents political opponent, and purely as revenge for an actual investigation already underway.Meanwhile, Mr.Sessions spent most of Tuesdays hearing as he has all the others hes sat through this year by not recalling things that one would think most people would.At his confirmation hearing in January, he testified that hed had no contact with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.Turns out he met at least twice with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.Last month, Mr.Sessions appeared before the Senate again and was asked if any Trump campaign surrogates had had communications with the Russians.I did not, and Im not aware of anyone else that did, and I dont believe it happened, he said.Wrong again: Mr.Sessions spoke with at least two members of the Trump campaign, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, about their traveling to Russia, where, Mr. Papadopoulos said, he would to meet government officials.The conversation with Mr. Papadopoulos was during a March 2016 meeting of the campaigns foreign-policy committee, according to Mr. Papadopouloss guilty plea last month for lying to the F.B.I.about his Russia connections.On Tuesday, Mr.Sessions said he had no recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports.His explanation for his poor memory was that he couldnt be expected to remember every detail from 2016, since the campaign was a form of chaos every day, from Day 1.No argument there.When Democrats pressed Mr.Sessions on his chronic unreliability, he defended his honor.My answers have not changed.Ive always told the truth, he said.Hes right if you redefine the words changed, always and truth.As Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington said to Mr.Sessions on Tuesday, With all due respect, its difficult to take your assurances under oath.Heres a related question going forward: What else are you forgetting, Mr. Attorney General?
GOP tax plan in trouble after Republican senator says he wont back it:::::The Republican effort to overhaul the tax code suffered serious setbacks Wednesday after a conservative senator unexpectedly said he opposed the Senate plan and a GOP moderate raised major concerns about it.The announcements cast doubt whether Republicans would be able to quickly pass what would be their first significant legislative achievement under President Trump.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he opposed both the Senate and House versions of the tax legislation because they benefited corporations at the expense of other, typically smaller companies.Earlier in the day, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Republicans had erred when they changed their tax bill this week to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate, which requires every American to have health insurance or pay a fine.This bill is a mixture of some very good provisions and some provisions I consider to be big mistakes, said Collins, one of three Republicans who joined with Democrats this summer to vote down a Senate effort to scrap much of the health-care law.Without Johnson and Collins, Republicans would need every other member of their caucus to vote for the plan far from a guaranteed outcome.And neither senators concern can be easily addressed without changes that could drive other Republicans to oppose the bill.Adding additional tax breaks for smaller businesses could appease Johnson, but it could force the GOP to raise taxes elsewhere.Leaving the Affordable Care Act alone could make the measure more attractive to Collins and other moderates.But it would run against the wishes of many conservatives and Trump and create other challenges in making the bill comply with Senate rules allowing passage with fewer than 60 votes.Senate Republicans released their tax proposal on Nov. 9, but face some hurdles to reconcile the differences among the Senate, the House and President Trump in order to sign a bill into law.(Jenny Starrs,Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post) The opposition to the $1.5 trillion tax-cut bill threatened what had been growing momentum for the tax overhaul.The House is expected to pass its own tax overhaul Thursday.And the Senate Finance Committee hopes to do the same this week, with the full Senate voting after Thanksgiving.Senate leaders made last-minute changes to their bill Tuesday to solve several problems, including that it would run afoul of Senate rules known as reconciliation that allow legislation to pass with only a simple majority if it doesnt raise the deficit after a decade.Changes made Tuesday included removing the individual mandate, which would save the government $300 billion over the next decade as it paid out less in insurance subsidies for low- and middle-income Americans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The change would also, according to the CBO, result in 13 million more Americans going without coverage.Senate leaders also changed their bill to make tax cuts for corporations permanent, but let individual tax cuts sunset at the end of 2025.The expiration would also affect small businesses whose owners use tax law to pay some of their income at the individual rate, a change Johnson said would unfairly penalize small businesses.Allowing those tax deductions to expire would increase taxes these companies pay by around $45 billion per year in 2026 and 2027, according to a forecast put out by the Joint Committee on Taxation.House Republicans version of the tax legislation contains more generous, and permanent, tax cuts for these businesses, but Johnson said neither was sufficient in its current form.These businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind, Johnson said in a statement.Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions.The companies Johnson is referring to are often small businesses, but they can also be companies such as hedge funds, law firms, real estate companies and other large companies.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) said Nov. 14 that he was "optimistic" about adding the individual mandate repeal to the tax bill.(The Washington Post) President Trump called the Wisconsin Republican on Wednesday evening to discuss the concerns.It was not immediately clear whether Trump assuaged any of Johnsons complaints, but the senator said earlier Wednesday that he held out hope of voting for the bill if it was fixed.Several other critical Senate Republicans who might have reservations about the bill have not said how they will vote.They include Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has previously expressed concern about the tax bills potential impact on the deficit and said he would not support a bill whose provisions had an expiration date.Corker said Wednesday he was still reviewing the bill.Another potential holdout, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), repeatedly declined to say whether he would vote for a tax bill that includes the proposed change to the Affordable Care Act.McCain, who voted against a previous attempt to repeal the ACA, said he wanted to review the tax bill as a whole.The GOP unrest comes as Senate Democrats exploded over the late-night changes that Republicans made to the bill, saying the new GOP plans would further punish the middle class.Why do people think this is a swamp?Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said.This is Swamp 101.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meeting with lawmakers, said the bill would make business cuts permanent because companies needed long-term assurances of their tax rates for planning purposes.He also shrugged off concerns that the public would balk at a bill that would provide only temporary tax cuts to individuals.Mnuchin, echoing other Republicans, predicted the individual tax cuts would eventually be extended or made permanent.I dont think its an optics issue, Mnuchin said.I think people understand that well fix the personal side.The House, meanwhile, cruised toward passage of their own version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which differs significantly from the Senate version.The House legislation does not touch the ACA, and only a small portion of the individual tax code would phase out.The bill, however, appears to violate Senate budget rules because it would add to the deficit after a decade.If different House and Senate bills pass, they will have to be reconciled in a way that ultimately complies with Senate rules.Still, House Republicans seemed largely ready to pass the bill and notch a legislative win.As of Wednesday evening, fewer than a dozen GOP members had come out against the bill most of them from the high-tax states of New York, New Jersey and California, where the bills partial elimination of a tax deduction for state and local taxes is controversial.But other members from those states, including Reps. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), John Katko (R-N.Y.), Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.), said in recent days they are supporting or leaning toward supporting the bill.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)said the vote count was looking real good in an interview.I think most people know how important it is to cut taxes and get the economy moving again, and this bill does that, he said.Trump is expected to visit Capitol Hill on Thursday morning and deliver a pep talk to House Republicans moments before they go to the House floor to advance the legislation.Scalise said a conference committee would likely be needed to bridge differences with the Senate.The Senate version of the bill, for instance, eliminates the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT.We have a lot of good members who are for this bill only because we addressed and fixed the SALT problem, Scalise said.No knock on their bill, but its not something they had to focus on, and it will have to be in a final product.In the upper chamber, the debate over the Republican bill grew heated Wednesday in the Senate Finance Committee.Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), typically one of the chambers most collegial members, bristled at attacks from Democrats.At one point, Hatch said he was sick of Democrats pursuing ways to add government spending while simultaneously lecturing Republicans about adding to the debt.Ive had enough of that to last me the rest of my life, he said.[Analysis: GOP gives permanent tax cuts to corporations, but not people] Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of the Finance Committee and the GOP Senate leadership, raised the possibility that Republicans could hold a vote once the bill comes to the Senate floor to waive the budget rules and allow the individual cuts to be permanent.That would require 60 votes, forcing Democrats to decide whether to hold firm in opposition or vote to ensure middle-class tax cuts are kept for the long term.All we need is a few Dems to help us, Thune said.Republican leaders worry that more GOP lawmakers could join Johnson and Collins in raising major objections to the bill.Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said Wednesday that he would support the tax bill as currently designed, but that it was unclear if the changes to the ACA would be allowed to remain.Thats yet to be determined, whether that will be in the final bill, he said.Alexander said he favored passing the tax-cut bill with the provision that repeals the individual mandate and then hold a vote on a separate, bipartisan measure that he has worked on with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).That provision would resume funding of federal subsidies to help people afford health insurance after the Trump administration halted those payments in October.Democratic support, however, remains elusive.Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a key moderate broker, said he has been in touch with White House aides in recent days about supporting the plan, but I dont see it improving.Between the debt and the insensitivity of this doing whatever they can to make sure that people at the top of the food chain are getting the tax breaks and the people who benefit the most are the people who need it the least it makes no sense, Manchin said.Ed OKeefe contributed to this report.
Senate Republicans look to Trump to restore order amid Alabama upheaval:::::President Trump takes a drink of water as he speaks about his trip to Asia on Wednesday.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Senate Republicans turned to President Trump on Wednesday in hopes he would join their urgent attempt to force GOP nominee Roy Moore out of the Senate race in Alabama following allegations of sexual misconduct but Trump did not oblige.Instead, back in Washington after a 12-day Asia trip, Trump was silent on Moore, who has been accused by two women of initiating unwanted sexual encounters when Moore was in his 30s and they were 14 and 16.Moore has denied the allegations.His daughter Ivanka Trump, however, voiced confidence in Moores accusers and said theres a special place in hell for people who prey on children in comments to the Associated Press.She did not call for Moore to step aside.In Alabama, Moore showed no signs he was preparing to bow out.His campaign sought to discredit one of his previous accusers at a hastily announced afternoon news conference where officials took no questions.On Twitter, Moore sought to align himself with Donald Trump, charging that the same forces that tried to defeat him as a presidential candidate in 2016 are now trying to beat Moore with lies and smears.Attorney for Senate candidate Roy Moore, Phillip L. Jauregui, left, and Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead, right, speak at a press conference, Wednesday in Birmingham, Ala. (Brynn Anderson/AP) Moore said in a statement issued Wednesday night: Are we at a stage in American politics in which false allegations can overcome a public record of 40 years, stampede the media and politicians to condemn an innocent man, and potentially impact the outcome of an election of national importance?His Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, told reporters in Alabama that the statements made by the women up in Etowah County have much more credibility than the denials, whether by Roy Moore himself or by his handlers.After days of forcefully repudiating Moore and urging him to withdraw to no avail, Senate Republican leaders increasingly see Trump as pivotal to restoring some order to a race that has spiraled quickly out of their control.Republicans are now at risk of either losing a seat to Democrats that has long been in GOP hands or being saddled with a deeply controversial figure in their ranks.I think hes in a position to exercise a good amount of influence on the race down there, Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the third-ranking Republican senator, said in reference to Trump.Thune added that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is of a mind that the president could be influential.McConnell and Trump spoke by phone on Wednesday.[Even as Hannity and Limbaugh waver on Roy Moore, Breitbart and Bannon hold on] Trump did not respond to questions from reporters about Moore after touting his Asia trip at the White House Wednesday afternoon.The president sidestepped questions about Moore during his travels.Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at a church revival Tuesday in Jackson, Ala. (Brynn Anderson/AP) After The Washington Post reported on the first accusations last Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president believes that if the allegations are true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside.The White House consented to the Republican National Committee pulling out of a joint fundraising committee with Moores campaign and, according to one administration official, discussions about Moores campaign have been ongoing among White House officials since Trump returned from Asia.But there is consensus among senior White House aides that the president is in a bind.If he publicly calls on him to withdraw and Moore demurs or, worse for Trump, wins the race nevertheless the president could suffer another embarrassment in Alabama.Yet continued silence from Trump may not be tenable.There are no good options, said one White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.A person close to former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon said that the Brietbart chief believes Moores denials and still supports him.But Bannons circle has also made clear that this support hinges on a continued belief that Moore is innocent of any inappropriate relationships with teenagers and could change in the future.Inside the West Wing, presidential advisers believe that every time McConnell calls on Moore to withdraw, he may be motivating voters in Alabama to, as one official put it, raise a collective middle finger to Washington.Trumps advisers worry that condemnations from the president could only exacerbate the dynamic.There is another risk for Trump.If he were to say that he believes the womens accusations, as McConnell and others have done, it would raise comparisons to the sexual harassment accusations that he has faced and denied.[@PKCapitol: Senator Doug Jones?It could happen.]This week, Republican senators have been asked about the allegations against Trump, creating discomfort and redirection efforts.Were talking about a situation in Alabama, McConnell said Tuesday when asked if he believes the women who have accused Trump.And Id be happy to address that.Still, some Republican senators feel that Trump could be helpful in persuading key GOP officials in Alabama to turn on Moore.Many local leaders have defended him in sharp contrast to the response in Washington.Hes the head of the party, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).Yeah, itd probably be good if hed say something.On social media, Moore seemed to be lobbying Trump by comparing his situation to what the president faced last year.The Republicans and Democrats who did everything they could to stop Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton are the very same people who are now trying to take us down with lies and smears, he wrote on Twitter.At a news conference in Birmingham, Ala., where members of the state GOP were meeting to discuss the race, Moore campaign attorney Phillip Jauregui raised questions about the validity of accusations that Beverly Young Nelson made against Moore this week.Nelson, now 56, accused Moore 70, of sexually assaulting her and bruising her neck in the late 1970s when she was 16 years old.She showed a copy of her high school yearbook that she said Moore signed on Dec. 22, 1977, with the inscription, To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas.It was signed, Love, Roy Moore D.A.Pending a review of the yearbook, Jauregui said it was possible that the signature had been copied by a forger.He called for Nelson and her attorney to send the yearbook to a neutral custodian so a handwriting expert could inspect it.[Analysis: Roy Moores defense attorney offers bizarre defense] Moore, according to Jauregui, had never signed D.A.after his name, but had an assistant with those initials who would write them in Moores documents.On his radio show Wednesday, conservative host Sean Hannity who had said Tuesday he would call for Moore to quit the race unless he proved the allegations wrong within 24 hours said the candidate had been smart to ask for a forensics test.Hes now basically throwing it in the hands of science, Hannity said.It is too late to remove Moores name from the ballot in the Dec. 12 special election.But if the state Republican Party were to disqualify him, they could prevent any votes for him from being certified.There have been no signs so far that party officials are willing to do that.Senate Republican leaders have singled out Attorney General Jeff Sessions as someone who could wage a competitive write-in campaign.But Sessions has shown no public interest in the prospect, and people in his orbit have batted down the idea.GOP leaders in Washington are increasingly concerned about the limited options before them.The National Republican Senatorial Committee conducted a poll this week showing support weakening, with Moore trailing Jones by 51 percent to 39 percent, according to findings shared by a Republican familiar with the survey.The survey was conducted Nov. 12-13 among 500 registered voters reached by live interviews on landline and cellphones.The Post reported last week that Leigh Corfman alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.Moore has denied the accusation.In addition, several other women interviewed by The Post in recent weeks said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and young women and he was in his early 30s, episodes they said they found flattering at the time but troubling as they got older.None of the three women said Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.Anne Gearan, Michael Scherer and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
In Roy Moores Senate race, anonymous threats, deceptive texts, alternative facts:::::A minister in south Alabama gets a phone call from a man who says he is a Washington Post reporter offering cash for dirt about Senate candidate Roy Moore.A man who told an Alabama newspaper about Moores alleged approaches to teenage girls when he was in his 30s receives texts falsely telling him he is being sued for defamation.On Twitter and Facebook, in texts and in phone calls, Alabamians say they are on the receiving end of a muddy river of threats, dirty tricks and angry attacks, all aimed at undermining allegations that Moore, the Republican candidate in next months special election to fill a U.S. Senate seat, made sexual advances on teenagers decades ago.After Blake Usry told AL.com, an Alabama news site, that he knew girls Moore tried to flirt with, Usry received threatening phone calls and Facebook messages, as well as texts informing him that he had been sued for defamation.One text falsely claimed that northern Alabamas U.S. attorney, Jay Town, has verified defamation cases against Usry and others who were quoted in news articles.I just thought, here they go, trying to intimidate me, said Usry, who lives in Gadsden, where Moore lived and worked.It could be a religious zealot, some right-wing nut, someone from Roy Moores campaign, I dont know.It doesnt intimidate me, but its caused me misery all day long.The claim that the U.S. attorney was moving against those who spoke out about Moore is patently absurd, Town said.My office has not received, nor would we have the legal basis to pursue, any such defamation cases.Under federal law, defamation is a civil matter, not a crime.In todays politics of disbelief, every burst of news is fodder for an avalanche of pushback and disinformation.In the Moore case, that reaction has come in the form of organized campaigns by Moores supporters defending their candidate and grass-roots expressions from individuals who believe that any report in the news media may be politically motivated.People down here are pushing back against The Washington Post, the moderate liberal Republicans and the Washington establishment that thinks were all stupid, said Dean Young, a Republican political consultant in Alabama who called himself Judge Moores number one adviser.Theyre pushing back every way we can.Lawyers representing Moore and his campaign have sent letters to news organizations, including AL.com and The Post, warning that they are preparing to file suit against the outlets for making false reports.Young said he doesnt know who is responsible for messages from fake Post reporters, but he suggested that it might be the newspaper itself: Who says you all arent paying someone to do that?Go pay more people to say stuff.Its a waste of money because people here know Judge Moore and we know he does believe in a Christian God, so that fake stuff doesnt work with us.Campaigns and their supporters have always defended themselves against allegations of wrongdoing, but the range and effect of tactics used to push back against damaging news articles has metastasized in this era of polarized politics and social media.Responding to controversy with alternative narratives, conspiracy theories and attacks on the messengers is as American as the half-century of anguished debate over who really killed John F. Kennedy or the midnight mullings over what really happened in the skies over Area 51.Skepticism morphs into disbelief, and those who are inclined to mistrust authority latch onto notions that may seem fantastic.This long-standing tradition is hypermagnified by the speed and ease of Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, where any user can post alternative facts in the same format as verified reporting.The latest struggle over what to believe follows The Posts investigation, published last week, in which four women said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers.The youngest of the women, Leigh Corfman, said Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 and he was 32.A fifth woman came forward this week, saying Moore sexually assaulted her in the 1970s when she was 16.An Alabama pastor named Al Moore no relation to the candidate received a voice mail Tuesday from Bernie Bernstein, who identified himself as a Post reporter and said he was looking for women between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000.The voice mail, which showed up on caller ID as a private number, concluded with a phony email address purportedly at The Post.Al Moore said he could tell right away that the call was fake.He let a local TV station know about the call because its important that we let the public know how ugly this thing has gotten.Al Moore said he hasnt decided whether to believe the allegations against Roy Moore.Im a pastor and Im conservative, and so is Roy Moore, but Im not dumb, Al Moore said.Im on the fence until we know more.But the thing that bothered me is that someone is so adamant to bury this guy out there, that they would even attempt to do this.The caller referred to himself as Bernie but later gave his email address as Al Bernstein.(Al Moore tried to respond to the email address, but his message bounced back as undeliverable.)There are no Post reporters or editors named Bernie Bernstein or Al Bernstein.The Posts executive editor, Martin Baron, said the call was bogus.The response to our meticulously reported story about Roy Moore has been a stunning level of deceit, deception and dirty tricks, Baron said.The Moore campaign and others have lied about our motives and lied about our methods.And at least one individual were still not sure who has also pretended to be a Post journalist so as to falsely portray our journalistic practices.A Moore campaign spokesman, John Rogers, did not respond to questions about the various threats.He told WKRG, an Alabama TV station, that he had not heard about any robo-calls.Roy Moores wife, Kayla, complained in a Facebook post Wednesday that the Washington Post is calling and harassing anyone that has had any contact with me, my husband, and other family members.She referred to a real Post reporter who was reporting an article about Kayla Moore and had sent requests for information to possible sources.The Washington Post is working on a profile of Kayla Moore, not unlike other stories weve done about spouses of high-profile candidates, Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti said.As part of that reporting, The Post has reached out to many people by phone, email and through social media.Coratti called the reporters message a straightforward, respectful request for an interview.On social media, veterans of past attacks on news reporting have rallied around Moore.Mike Cernovich, a prominent critic of what he calls the fake news media, tweeted that sexual harassment is the new race card and many GOP men will be falsely accused.Someone is lying on Roy Moore, a user tweeted under the name Marion Talley, claiming that Corfman was older than she has said she was at the time of her encounter with Moore.Talley declared defending Moore to be a matter of loyalty, akin to sticking with Donald Trump after the release last fall of an Access Hollywood tape in which he boasts of grabbing women by their genitals.When they played the infamous pussy tape, I didnt quit Trump.Not when HE was accused, the Talley account tweeted.No one should quit Roy Moore.This is the same thing by the same people.Much of the pushback from the right has focused on trying to discredit The Posts reporting about Moore.Breitbart quoted its chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, calling reports about Moore a weaponized hit organized by the news media and the Republican establishment.Breitbart published an article quoting Corfmans mother saying that a Post reporter had persuaded her daughter to tell her story as if that ordinary aspect of news reporting were somehow improper.Gateway Pundit, a right-wing site, spread a story from a Twitter account, @umpire43, that said, A family friend in Alabama just told my wife that a [Washington Post] reporter named Beth offer her $1,000 to accuse Roy Moore.The Post, like many other news organizations, has a strict policy against paying sources for information.The @umpire43 account, which has since been deleted, had 18,000 followers and operated under the name Doug Lewis #MAGA.The account has a history of spreading misinformation, such as its claim last fall that Huma Abedin, vice chair of Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, was about to be indicted.That never happened.The accounts operator offered often-shifting strands of autobiography, claiming at various points to have been a Navy veteran, an associate of former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, an owner of a polling firm, and a baseball umpire.In a report by the Daily Beast, several of the employers that Doug Lewis claimed to have worked for had no record of such a person.A spokesman for Twitter would not comment on @umpire43 but said we carefully review all reported possible violations of the Twitter rules and take action as appropriate.The text messages that threatened Usry with a defamation lawsuit came from a phone number that was created on Tuesday, used to send seven texts, and was then shut down Wednesday after inquiries from a Post reporter, according to Bandwidth.com, a North Carolina company that generates temporary phone numbers for apps such as Burner.David Morken, Bandwidths chief executive who served on President Trumps transition team for the Federal Communications Commission, said he was unaware of the texts.He said the number the texts were sent from appeared to be one of his companys 52 million phone numbers.After The Post provided Bandwidth with the number used in the Alabama case, Morken said his company determined that the texts were unwanted and harassing, and shut down the phone number.He said Bandwidths privacy policy prevented him from identifying who had set up the account.Aaron C. Davis, Herman Wong and Alice Crites contributed to this report.
Gun-control rivals team up on bill to fix background-check database:::::After a gunman killed at least 26 people at a Texas church, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)on Nov. 7 said theres an opportunity for us here to work on a bipartisan basis on legislation to improve the enforcement of background checks.(The Washington Post) After a gunman killed at least 26 people at a Texas church, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)on Nov. 7 said theres an opportunity for us here to work on a bipartisan basis on legislation to improve the enforcement of background checks.(The Washington Post) Senators usually on opposite sides of the gun-control debate are teaming up on bipartisan legislation to improve the national background-check system by increasing how often states and federal agencies report offenses that would legally prohibit individuals from buying a firearm.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.)are the main forces behind the legislation, which was Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) also played a role in crafting.The trio is expecting to pull more Republican support for their measure before formally releasing it.Their bill is narrow in its focus, reiterating and reinforcing the requirement that federal agencies report all infractions into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and creating financial incentives for states to do so as well.The definiciencies of the NICS database have come into sharp focus since it was revealed that a 2014 domestic violence conviction should have prevented the shooter in this months fatal attack on a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., from buying a firearm.But the Air Force never reported the conviction to the background check system.The problem isnt confined to the military: the NICS database is missing millions of such records, according to an estimate by the National Rifle Association, citing a 2013 report from the National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics that found at least 25% of felony convictions ...are not available.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) is part of a bipartisan team writing legislation to improve reporting infractions to the national criminal background check system.(Kristoffer Tripplaar/For The Washington Post) What our bill does is it attempts to fix that both at the federal level and provide additional incentives to the local states, Cornyn said Wednesday.It may be as simple as just getting them to do what theyre already required to do.[FBI database for gun buyers missing millions of records] Federal agencies are required to report various felonies, indictments and other crimes including domestic assaults into the federal database, but Congress has no power to compel states to do the same.The Murphy-Cornyn legislation would offer direct financial incentives, as well as favorable future access to other federal assistance programs, to states that report infractions into the system.Cornyn offered to work with Murphy on the measure last week, after Murphy complained on the Senate floor about Congresss inaction in the wake of mass shootings, stressing that lawmakers must at least be able to fix the background check system to reflect existing law.Murphy has been one of Congresss most vocal advocates for expanding background checks and other gun-control measures since he joined the Senate just a few weeks after a shooter killed 26 teachers and schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary School in his home state.Cornyn, on the other hand, is considered a reliable ally of the NRA.Their partnership suggests a broad coalition could form around the bill.But Congress has had difficulty joining forces around gun-control legislation, even when lawmakers in both parties believe regulation is needed.Last month, in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 58 concertgoers in Las Vegas, Republican and Democratic lawmakers called for a restriction on bump stocks the attachment that can turn a semiautomatic weapon into a nearly automatic firearm.But the effort to consider a bill has faltered and an opening Judiciary Committee hearing on the matter has been delayed until December.The Senates appetite for addressing Cornyn, Murphy and Blumenthals bill may be somewhat better, as the NRA has long been clamoring for the federal government to do a better job of enforcing existing gun laws before they discuss expanding them.But the forthcoming bills authors do not appear to want to take any chances that their efforts run aground: Blumenthal said the senators are trying to expedite the measure to the Senate floor, instead of putting it through the Judiciary Committee.They are not the only senators to propose gun legislation in the wake of the Sutherland Springs shooting.Sens.Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) responded to the event with a bill requiring the military to report domestic violence misdemeanors to the NICS database, even if they are classified under a general assault category in the military; Blumenthal said Wednesday that he is also working on a bill directing a rewrite the Uniform Code of Military Justice so that domestic violence cases are catalogued as separate from other assaults, and reported to the NICS database as such.Several senators have also called for the military to conduct a thorough review of its reporting policies.On Wednesday, Flake, Heinrich and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) also called on the Defense Department to publicize statistics about the number of unreported domestic violence cases that have gone unreported to the NICS database since 2007.To date, the military has reported only one domestic violence offense into the system.Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
Shepard Smiths long history of infuriating Fox News viewers:::::Longtime Fox News anchor Shepard Smith often says the opposite of the network's commentators while on air.From Uranium One to the Russia investigation, here are three times Smith has gone against the grain.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Shepard Smith did it again.On his show Tuesday, the Fox News anchor spent five minutes systematically dismantling conservative conspiracy theories surrounding a uranium deal involving former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.While several other outlets, including The Washington Post Fact Checker, have already debunked claims about the deal, some Republicans are calling for another special investigation into the matter.In particular, Smith took aim at President Trump's claim that the deal was a scandal that funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.That statement is inaccurate in a number of ways, Smith said.First, the Clinton State Department had no power to veto or approve that transaction.It could do neither.Here's how it does work ...However, the segment didn't sit well with much of Fox's conservative audience, many of whom called for Smith to be FIRED for his biased reporting!!!!"and moved to CNN for his lack of objectivity.It was hardly the first time Smith has gone against the grain of the network and, to the chagrin of many Fox viewers, it likely won't be the last.The network is known for several outspoken conservative personalities, such as Sean Hannity and formerly Bill O'Reilly, who have been at the forefront of pushing certain right-leaning viewpoints as well as exploring far-right conspiracy theories, such as the Obama birther movement.It's no secret that Trump watches the network, which usually covers him favorably.Fox viewers, in turn, have a more favorable view of the president than the rest of the country.On the other hand, Smith, 53, who has been at Fox for more than two decades, maintains that his job as a news anchor not a commentator is to observe and deliver the facts and let viewers decide for themselves.In an interview with the HuffPost last October, Smith denied that there was a war going on in the Fox studios between the news and opinion sides.Everybodys got a job to do.[Sean] Hannity is trying to get conservatives elected.And he wants you to listen to him and believe what he believes, Smith told the news site.And Im disseminating facts.Its really apples and teaspoons.What we do is so different.Hes an entertaining guy who has an audience that he serves, and I deliver the news.Smiths persistent fact-mongering has made him persona non grata among some parts of the Fox News faithful, The Post's Paul Farhi wrote in March, with Fox fans taking to social media to demand Smiths firing.Here are five other times Smith has upset Fox viewers with his delivery of the news or on-air fact-checking.That time he wasn't afraid to use the 'L' word when describing Trump and the Russia investigation In covering Trump's falsehoods those from his campaign and his administration many media outlets and fact-checkers have hesitated to use the word lie, since that implies an intent to deceive.In July, though, Smith let loose on his show when reporting that a Russian lawyer had met with more people than the White House had previously acknowledged.We've been told a variety of stories, Fox News' Chris Wallace said to Smith.And who knows if we've gotten to the end of the story?Smith's lengthy outburst as he responded to Wallace indicated his frustration at the administration: Were still not clean on this, Chris.If theres nothing there and thats what they tell us, they tell us theres nothing to this and nothing came of it, theres a nothingburger, it wasnt even memorable, didnt write it down, didnt tell you about it, because it wasnt anything so I didnt even remember it with a Russian interpreter in the room at Trump Tower?If all of that, why all these lies?Why is it lie after lie after lie?If you clean, come on clean, you know?My grandmother used to say when first we practice to Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling.And there are still people who are out there who believe were making it up.And one day theyre gonna realize were not and look around and go, 'Where are we, and why are we getting told all these lies?'Wallace, rendered speechless, could only stare at the camera and shake his head after Smith finished.That time he said Fox News had no knowledge of Trumps wiretapping claims In March, Trump claimed, without evidence, that former president Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower, which served as his campaign headquarters.The series of tweets accused Obama of tampering with the very sacred election process.Legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, in a March 14 appearance on Fox and Friends, said hed spoken to three intelligence sources who claimed Obama went outside the chain of command to spy on Trump, and used Britains Government Communications Headquarters to ensure that there were no American fingerprints on this.Enter Smith, who said on his show that Napolitanos claims couldnt be confirmed by Fox News or pretty much anyone else.Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitanos commentary, Smith said.Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-president of the United States was surveilled at any time, in any way.Full stop.He opened that same newscast saying that Trump didnt have to make unfounded claims at all: Of course, the president could learn firsthand whether the building in which he [lived] was wiretapped.All hed have to do is ask the intelligence services.They work for him.As The Post's Farhi reported, it was a rare bit of record-correcting for Fox but no coincidence that the correcting came from Smith, whose off-message comments about Trump have made him an apostate to the conservative Fox News orthodoxy.That time he took on climate change deniers In August 2015, Smith and Lisa Kennedy Montgomery were taking aim at a pseudoscientific study sponsored by Coca-Cola that said sugary drinks may not be a big cause of Americas obesity epidemic.Thats when Smith said that cherry-picking studies was the same thing climate change deniers had been doing.Well this reminds me of two things.The article in the New York Times this weekend pointed out, it reminds you of exactly what the tobacco industry did back in the day, and more recently it also reminds you of what the climate deniers, the climate change deniers are doing as well.That time he told the New York Times that Barack Obama is a U.S. citizen Unlike commentators at the Fox network, Smith declined to get on the Obama birther bandwagon, instead declaring very publicly that the president of the United States was, in fact, a citizen.The Obama birther argument animated some in conservative circles, including a man named Trump who would one day be president.Trump began to raise questions about Obamas qualifications for office in 2011, and he demanded to see the presidents long-form birth certificate and claimed he sent investigators to Hawaii.For many, the debate ended when the president provided his birth certificate.Trump only conceded that Obama was a natural-born citizen in 2016.But Smith had questioned the birther movement for years.In a 2009 interview with the New York Times, Smith said he was trying to counter an ideological base that believes the president is illegitimate and the country hijacked.An unreasonable comment to me is beginning with a statement that is contrary to fact and moving on from that premise: Barack Obama is not a citizen; he is a Muslim looking to take down the nation, he told the Times.When you begin with that premise, you are out of bounds.That time Smith called out 'Joe the Plumber' for saying Obama would mean 'the death of Israel' In what feels like another lifetime, a younger Smith covering the 2008 presidential election had Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher better known as Joe the Plumber as a call-in guest on his show.Wurzelbacher said he agreed with others that a vote for Obama would be a vote for the death of Israel.For several minutes, Smith pushed Joe the Plumber to provide concrete examples of Obama's record or associations that would back up his claim.Wurzelbacher couldn't.I honestly want people to go out and find their own reasons, he said.Go out and get informed.That's the biggest message I got for people.After he hung up, Smith added a fact-check.I just want to make this 100 percent perfectly clear: Barack Obama has said repeatedly that Israel will always be a friend to the United States no matter what happens once he becomes president of the United States.His words, Smith said.He shook his head as he prepared to cut to a commercial break.The rest of it man.It just gets frightening sometimes.Read more: Shepard Smith, the Fox News anchorman who drives the Fox News faithful crazy Fox News

Trump, who labeled Rubio a choke artist for needing water during speech, needs water during speech:::::President Trump once criticized Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for awkwardly sipping from a water bottle in 2013 but the president just had a water bottle moment of his own.(The Washington Post) A few years back, Sen. Marco Rubio got a little parched and needed to awkwardly swig from a bottle of water during his Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address.For this, Donald Trump relentlessly ridiculed Rubio spotlighting the incident at least eight times.On Wednesday, President Trump met karma.While speaking at the White House about his trip to Asia, Trump bent down behind the podium briefly before reemerging and explaining that there was no water down there.They don't have water, Trump said.That's okay.Eventually, someone produced a bottle of water, which Trump gladly accepted and drank from.Then he did it again a couple minutes later.This is something that would be unacceptable to the Old Donald Trump a sign of a weak constitution.In February 2016, Trump gesticulated while imitating Rubio: I need water.Help me.I need water.Help.He then added: This is on live television.This total choke artist....He later tossed the bottle over his shoulder as the crowd roared.Apparently, Trump believes people who need water during speeches are choke artists.In other words, by extension ... And then there are the tweets: Next time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottlewould have much less negative impact.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2013 Via @theblaze: "Donald Trump on how Rubio should have drank his water" http://t.co/tm8tzTUO Donald J.

Why it is so hard for Stephen Bannon to dump Roy Moore:::::Breitbart News Chairman Stephen K. Bannon spoke at a rally for U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Sept. 25 in Fairhope, Ala. (Brynn Anderson/AP) Withdrawing support for Senate candidate Roy Moore would seem to be one of the easiest moves in politics right now.Republican Sens.Ted Cruz (Tex.), John Cornyn (Tex.), Mike Lee (Utah), Bill Cassidy (La.)and Steve Daines (Mont.)all did it.The National Republican Senatorial Committee did it.Even Sean Hannity said on Tuesday night that he would do it, unless the Alabama Republican could, within 24 hours, come up with a satisfactory explanation to refute allegations that decades ago he sexually assaulted a teenage girl, initiated sexual touching with another and pursued relationships with three more.Yet Breitbart News Chairman Stephen K. Bannon has yet to dump Moore.The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday that Bannon is privately wavering, but Breitbart's coverage on Wednesday remained staunchly pro-Moore.Stubbornness alone can't explain Bannon's position.The former White House chief strategist staked his reputation as an anti-establishment kingmaker on Moore's candidacy.Abandoning Moore would be a reputation-shrinking concession.Bannon stapled himself to Moore's leg so that he could claim credit for Moore's primary victory, even though Moore's victory had little to do with Bannon, said Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who heads the conservative news site Daily Wire.Now Bannon is stuck.He's taken credit for Moore, so now he owns him.A Bannon spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Republican senators on Nov. 14 continued to urge Senate candidate Roy Moore to end his campaign in Alabama amid allegations of sexual misconduct.(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Shapiro added that Bannon's effort to discredit Moore's accusers is a quixotic attempt to demonstrate that he is more powerful than Mitch McConnell and take leadership of the nonexistent Trumpism Without Trump movement.Shapiro's final point is critical to understanding Bannon's intractability.Yes, Bannon wants to stick it to McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and the GOP establishment.That's a given.But Moore represents an opportunity for Bannon to flex his muscle within the anti-establishment faction of conservatism.President Trump initially backed Sen. Luther Strange over Moore in the Senate race.Hannity, Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin endorsed Rep. Mo Brooks.This was the race and the candidate where Steve differentiated himself from everybody, said Kurt Bardella, president of Endeavor Strategies and a former Breitbart spokesman.Were Moore to win a Senate seat, Bannon could claim to be more influential than other anti-establishment figures even Trump.Those are serious bragging rights.Plus, Bannon probably doesn't stand to benefit by renouncing Moore at this point.Citing a person close to Bannon, the Daily Beast reported that Bannon has said if he were to become convinced that Moore is guilty of sexual misconduct, he would put [Moore] in a grave myself.But what if Bannon were to abandon Moore, and the former Alabama chief justice were to win anyway?In that scenario, Bannon's perceived sway would still take a hit.The result would suggest that Bannon lacked the power to stop Moore and cast doubt on the extent to which his endorsement mattered in the first place.That is the Catch-22 for Steve, Bardella said.He probably believes and this isn't off-base that Roy is going to win.There's really nothing for Steve to gain by walking away from Moore.I think that's what he's wrestling with.
Bipartisan group of lawmakers push for more protection for harassment victims on Capitol Hill:::::Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and several other lawmakers say Congress must improve its handling of sexual misconduct allegations on Capitol Hill.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and several other lawmakers say Congress must improve its handling of sexual misconduct allegations on Capitol Hill.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Wednesday proposed a sweeping expansion of workplace protections in Congress a direct response to the recent groundswell of claims about unwanted sexual advances, inappropriate comments and other misconduct on Capitol Hill.The bill comes a day after a public hearing in which female lawmakers described sexual harassment as a pervasive problem and suggested current members of Congress have engaged in misconduct.The measure, the Member and Employee Training and Oversight On Congress Act, or ME TOO Congress Act, aims to make the complaint-filing process less cumbersome for legislative employees.It would also make public the names of employing congressional offices that paid out settlements in harassment or discrimination cases.Employees no longer would be bound by confidentiality requirements or required to go through mediation.The legislation would also require members of Congress to pay for harassment claim settlements out of their own budgets rather than the current source a special fund in the U.S. Treasury.[How Congress plays by different rules on sexual harassment and misconduct] For all intents and purposes, a staffer in the Capitol is powerless and gagged ...Today, we are going to end all of that, said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), co-sponsor of the House legislation and an outspoken critic of the current system.Speier has publicly described being forcibly kissed by a chief of staff when she was a congressional employee.The bill aims to restore some of the worker protections that Congress exempted for itself more than two decades ago through the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, which imposed a range of civil rights, labor and worker-safety laws on Capitol Hill for the first time.Under the current process, claimants are bound by strict confidentiality requirements and must undergo mediation to try to resolve the claim out of court or an administrative hearing.Worker protections do not apply to interns and fellows, and legislative employees do not have the same whistleblower protection as federal-agency employees do.The effect, some lawmakers and advocates say, is a system in which victims are silenced and it is difficult to hold perpetrators accountable.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has said the House will adopt a policy change to make anti-harassment training mandatory for all members and staff.Last week, Senate for the first time in its history required members and their aides to receive anti-harassment training.Its unclear how much support there will be for the legislation, which was introduced by Speier, along with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Reps. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), Ann Kuster (D-N.H.) and Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine).But in recent weeks, Congress has come under pressure to improve working conditions on the Hill.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) on Nov. 15 said there is a serious sexual harassment problem in Congress.Gillibrand is among several lawmakers introducing a bill to revise procedures for reporting harassment in Congress.(Reuters) In examining it [the current system], you come away understanding that the system is set up to protect the perpetrator, not the victim, said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.).So thats an old-boys-club set of rules.That needs to be completely done away with and a whole new system set up.Other lawmakers said recent claims about misconduct have forced a new conversation about harassment.I think theres some awareness that what has been common practice for some period of time may not in the light of day be acceptable to the broader public, said Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.).Rep. Linda T. Snchez (D-Calif.), said the attitude toward sexual harassment and assault claims is shifting in Congress to take it more seriously than ever before, but that there has not yet been a clear change among her colleagues about how to fix the problem.I cant say that anything has changed overnight, said Snchez.I think certainly among the men that Ive spoken to, theyve always known that it exists, but I dont think that they had an idea of how widespread it is across industries.So I think peoples attitudes are changing.And Im hopeful that the process for reporting this and dealing with this effectively improves because of it.More than 1,500 former congressional employees have signed a letter urging Congress to require anti-harassment training and to overhaul the reporting process, which advocates say is stacked against the victim and designed to protect the institution.Congress should never play by its own set of rules.As elected officials, we should be held to the highest standards not to the lowest, Gillibrand said.The Washington Post is examining workplace violations on Capitol Hill and the process for reporting them.To contact a reporter, please email michelle.lee@washpost.com, elise.viebeck@washpost.com or kimberly.kindy@washpost.com.Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.
Lawmakers speak out about sexual assault in Congress:::::Fact Check: Did Obama 'never get to land' in the Philippines, as Trump says?
Sen. Doug Jones? It could happen.:::::Democrat Doug Jones, seen here in a file photo, stood little chance of winning the Alabama Senate race before allegations of sexual misconduct against his opponent, Roy Moore, surfaced over the past week.(Brynn Anderson/AP) Senate Republicans have been agonizing over the possible scenarios of dealing with Roy Moore.They are hoping the Alabama Republican will voluntarily withdraw his controversial candidacy.If Moore refuses, GOP leaders are threatening expulsion hearings once he gets to the Senate.One scenario is not receiving enough contemplation: Sen. Doug Jones.It is becoming increasingly plausible that the former U.S. attorney will overcome steep odds and become the first Democrat elected to the Senate by Alabama voters in 25 years.Its still too early to say that Jones is the front-runner, but what had been a fairly comfortable lead for Moore has been upended since last weeks Washington Post report about allegations the former judge pursued teenage girls when he was a 30-something local prosecutor, as well as a second accusation of inappropriate sexual contact.It may take until after Thanksgiving for polling to truly capture the state of the race, but much of the national media focus over the last week has been on Moores very staunch defenders and their invocations of odd religious comparisons to explain away the accusations.This has helped create an assumption that there is a backlash in Alabama against the national media, boosting the Republican nominee.Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32 Republican senators on Nov. 14 continued to urge Senate candidate Roy Moore to end his campaign in Alabama amid allegations of sexual misconduct.(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) So have most voters in Alabama been racing to defend Moore?Maybe theyre not, said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a 31-year veteran of the Senate and his states elder political statesman.Shelby suggested Tuesday that there were likely many voters that are just as concerned with Moores alleged behavior as there are staunch defenders of the former judge.But Shelby said Republicans who believe the allegations are, for now, staying quiet.In this regard, Shelby fears there is a silent majority opposed to Moore that will show up at the polls and soundly defeat him.The next three weeks are sure to be filled with more whipsaw moments, possibly new allegations and continued GOP efforts to get Moore to withdraw from the race.But the one certainty is that, as long as Moore stays in the race, the contest is going to continue to be a referendum on his behavior and the allegations against him and not a referendum on the states traditional conservative posture and the leftward lurch of Democrats at the national level.In essence, the more this campaign takes on the tone of a gubernatorial race, the better Joness chances are of winning.Those contests, in the Deep South and other conservative-leaning states, have often been at least a little more favorable for Democrats than Senate races.Thats because the issue set is not so focused on national party platforms and more about the individual candidates and local issues.That is what happened in Louisianas governors race two years ago, when Democrat John Bel Edwards faced off against then-Sen. David Vitter (R).That contest focused on Vitters personal behavior from decade-old allegations of connections to prostitute rings in Washington and New Orleans Vitter had given only a vague apology for this in 2007 but never fully explained the situation to his constituents.Many expected Vitter to overcome that controversy because the state is so conservative Republican Mitt Romney won it by 17 percentage points in 2012, and President Trump won by 20 percentage points last year.But in November 2015, Louisiana voters rejected Vitter and handed Edwards an easy victory despite the states normal deeply Republican voting patterns.Soon after, his political career in ruins, Vitter announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate in 2016.Roy Moores refusal to exit Alabama Senate race reflects diminished power of Washington Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), aware of the potential loss, said Tuesday that Moores campaign was collapsing.While some have theorized that McConnell is willing to lose the seat rather than deal with the political tumult Moore could cause in the Senate, under an almost-certain ethics investigation the GOP leader is always most obsessed with winning and keeping the majority.Thats why he went from having his allies and advisers whispering about the idea of Attorney General Jeff Sessions returning to Alabama to run a write-in campaign for the seat, to openly endorsing the idea at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday.The Alabamian who would fit that standard would be the attorney general, McConnell said.But that step which Sessions has declined to comment on still requires Moore to voluntarily ask to withdraw from the campaign, at which point state officials would no longer count any of his votes.It would also probably require Moore to voluntarily and publicly endorse Sessions, telling his voters that they should write-in their former senator.As of now, Moore has shown no such willingness and is instead digging in.The question is whether he can ever refocus the race on Democratic values Jones supports abortion rights and some restrictions on gun rights or if the race continues to center on a debate over his own behavior.Alabama is even a touch more conservative than Louisiana, having favored Romney by 22 percentage points and Trump by more than 25 percentage points.But circumstances like Moores, when a candidates personal behavior is under fire, can throw races up in the air and also make turnout projections useless.In 2012, after Republicans nominated Todd Akin, the conservative congressman from Missouri said during his Senate campaign that women rarely became pregnant from a legitimate rape in explaining his antiabortion stance in all circumstances.Akin also refused to abandon the race, in part believing the states conservative tilt would bring him home to victory even after all the GOP committees had abandoned him.Romney went on to win Missouri by more than 10 percentage points but Akin lost to Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) by more than 15 percentage points.One key reason was a huge drop-off of almost 150,000 ballots from those who voted for the two major party candidates in the presidential race and in the Senate race.Some of those votes, in the Senate contest, went to a third-party candidate who was on the ballot, and some just did not vote in the race.On Dec. 12, as of now, there are just two names on the ballot: Moore vs. Jones.If Shelbys fears prove true, a lot of Republican voters will simply stay home and allow Jones to score a victory.Read more from Paul Kanes archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
Trump claims his Asia trip forged new unity against North Korea:::::President Trump speaks about his trip to Asia in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House on Nov. 15.(Evan Vucci/AP) President Trump said he and Asian leaders have a new resolve to confront North Korea and its rogue nuclear weapons program, claiming credit Wednesday for projecting a stronger and more confident United States unafraid to insist on sovereignty and respect.Time is running out on dealing with North Korea, Trump said at the White House.With China, North Koreas most important ally, Trump said he reaffirmed that all options are on the table.Trump spoke on his first full day back in Washington after a 12-day, five-nation trip to Asia.His remarks represented a sort of victory lap, as he ticked off what he described as his successes on the trip and took aim at what he called the failures and naivete of predecessors in protecting U.S. jobs, trade and security.Americas renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now, Trump said.When we are confident in ourselves, our strength, our flag, our history, our values other nations are confident in us, he continued.And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve, other countries treat America with the respect that our country so richly deserves.Trump said that in Beijing, he insisted to President Xi Jinping that we need to reduce our staggering trade deficit with China.Trump had come under criticism for saying that he did not blame China for the deficit or for taking advantage of market openings that he said past administrations had left.[North Korea says Trump should be sentenced to death for insulting Kim] In his remarks Wednesday, Trump gave a retrospective of what he called his forceful approach to U.S. foreign policy.Insisting on sovereignty and respect has led to stronger relationships, great NATO defense commitments, and U.S. arms sales and spending, Trump asserted.America is back, he said.He claimed progress against the Islamic State and other accomplishments but did not go into detail about his approach to difficult foreign policy problems such as the ongoing war in Syria, the spread of Iranian influence or Russian territorial and other ambitions.He did not mention his decision last month to withdraw the presidential endorsement for the international nuclear deal with Iran or his planned withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Both decisions have put U.S. allies on edge and led some to question American commitments overseas.Trump made no mention of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he met on the margins of a regional conference in Vietnam.The two leaders released a joint statement, after months of staff work, confirming their commitment to defeat the Islamic State in Syria and supporting a U.N.-backed political settlement between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian opposition fighters who have been trying to oust him for years.The Putin meeting became controversial when Trump, in subsequent comments to reporters, said that he believed Putin was sincere in again telling him that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.Trump did not respond to shouted questions Wednesday about whether GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama should withdraw after allegations of sexual misconduct.He paused during the speech at one point to take a long drink of water, a moment that recalled his mockery last year of GOP primary rival Marco Rubio for gulping water during a televised address.Trump has chafed at criticism that he did not notch any major accomplishments during the nearly two-week trip that spanned Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.The rising threat from North Korea was the main security issue for his discussions, and Trump claimed credit for greater unity in applying sanctions aimed at persuading Pyongyang to back off threats against the United States and its allies.I called on every nation, including China and Russia, to unite in isolating the North Korean regime cutting off all ties of trade and commerce until it stops its dangerous provocation, Trump said.On Wednesday, an editorial in a North Korea state-run newspaper called Trump a coward who deserved the death penalty.The worst crime for which he can never be pardoned is that he dared [to] malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership, the editorial in Rodong Sinmun said.He should know that he is just a hideous criminal sentenced to death by the Korean people.[Trump strikes North Korean regime in Seoul speech] Trump pointed Wednesday to a major speech he delivered in Seoul, in which he denounced Pyongyang as a cruel dictatorship.America does not seek conflict or confrontation.But we will never run from it, Trump said in his address to the South Korean National Assembly.History is filled with discarded regimes that have foolishly tested Americas resolve.Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer.In response, North Koreas state-run Korean Central News Agency called Trump a lunatic old man who was lost to sense.Days later, Trump tweeted, Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me old, when I would NEVER call him short and fat?But the American president also suggested that he and Kim might be friends someday.I try so hard to be his friend, Trump tweeted.Maybe someday that will happen!

The Republican tax plan is deeply unpopular  and unimportant to many Americans:::::President Trump holds an example of what a new tax form may look like during a meeting on tax policy, Nov. 2, in Washington.(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) While President Trump was on an extended trip through Asia, Republicans on Capitol Hill were pushing forward on his top legislative priority: overhauling the nations tax code to reduce the burden on corporations and some American households.On Tuesday, the Senate proposal was expanded to include a repeal of the individual mandate thats part of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare).The effect was to create a sort of policy Frankenstein (actually, a policy Frankensteins monster) that combines two of the partys biggest priorities.Its an iffy move, given the deep unpopularity of the health-care proposals the Republicans were proposing.But, then, two new polls show the Republican tax proposal isnt that popular, either, even before health-care reform was jammed inside of it.The Kaiser Family Foundation asked Americans what Congress and the president should focus on.Whats important to address, the survey asked: Tax reform?Reauthorizing the childrens health insurance program (CHIP)?Funding the recovery from this years hurricanes?More than 6-in-10 Americans said CHIP reauthorization and hurricane recovery should be a top priority.Only 28 percent said reforming the tax code should be.Nearly as many Americans (24 percent) said tax reform shouldnt happen at all as said it should be a top priority (28 percent).It was mostly Republicans who said it should be a top priority; Republicans were about as likely to say tax reform was a top priority as they were to say repealing Obamacare or hurricane recovery were.Kaiser Family Foundation also asked about repealing the individual mandate.A majority supported the idea ...until they learned what a repeal would mean.When they were informed repeal would increase premiums for those who buy their own insurance, 60 percent opposed the idea.Quinnipiac University asked Americans about the Republican proposal more specifically as well as a host of questions about the economy.More than half of Americans think the economy is doing well (responding it was excellent or good), with Republicans more likely to offer a positive rating.Interestingly, Democrats were much more likely to say their own economic situation was excellent or good than they were to say the national economy was in the same position.Republicans had the same opinion of each.Americans still generally credit the good economy to former president Barack Obama, but thats been shifting over the course of the year.Theres a partisan split on this, but just over a third of Republicans credit Obama and just under a third of Democrats credit Trump.Asked about the tax plan, though, the numbers for Trump were bleak.While a third of Americans approved of his handling of taxes, only a quarter approved of the Republican proposal.That includes only 60 percent of Republicans.Why?Well, Americans generally think the proposal will either not affect them much or increase their taxes.Even a majority of Republicans dont think theyll get a tax cut.Instead, most Americans think the positive effects will be felt by the wealthy.That benefit to the wealthy, most Americans believe, will come at the expense of the middle class.Even a quarter of Republicans think their partys tax proposal will benefit the wealthy at the expense of middle-income Americans.Thats not necessarily inaccurate.An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found nearly a third of middle-class Americans would see a tax increase by 2027, while corporations would enjoy a permanent tax cut.The Republican argument is cutting corporate taxes will spur new job creation and economic growth.Only 36 percent of Americans think thats true, according to Quinnipiac.Poll numbers like that are enough to make a guy want to take a trip to Asia.

The Trump presidency, seen through the images he highlights on Twitter:::::Trumps new header image.(@realdonaldtrump) On Tuesday, President Trump updated his Twitter account to feature a new header image.For those unaware, the header image on a Twitter account is precisely what it sounds like: A photo that is displayed the width of the page at the top of each of the users tweets.The new header image, pictured above, shows Trump adjusting a microphone as he stands at a lectern in front of a gigantic American flag.The foreground is partly obscured by people holding up cellphone cameras; Trump has an unusual expression on his face.It is, in short, a weird image.But it is perfectly in keeping with Trumps other Twitter background images for two reasons.First, because it shows all or part of the American flag.Second, because it shows Trump.Since hes been president, Trumps Twitter page has featured 53 different images.Of those photos, 44 have shown Trump and 33 have shown the flag.Nine others have shown members of the military or police, and nine more have shown images from Trumps foreign travel.That said, the images are not all displayed on his page for the same length of time.Some last less than a day; others last a month or longer.Below, using the Internet Archive and updates from @TrumpsAlert, weve created an image showing what Trumps Twitter image looked like on each day of his presidency.Click this or any of the following images to see a larger version.He started slowly.Over the first four months of his presidency, Trump had only four header images.That includes an image of members of his Cabinet, which was up for more than a month and a half, into May.In May, the account (almost certainly managed by social media director Dan Scavino) began diversifying what was displayed.There were two versions of the now-infamous Rose Garden celebration after the House passed its Obamacare overhaul bill, and two versions of a photo of a large group of people giving a thumbs-up in the Oval Office.During his first foreign trip in May, the header image was changed to photos from his time overseas.For most of June, the photo was of Air Force One parked outside an airplane hanger in Florida an image taken during a campaign rally held in February.In July and August, Trumps account began displaying a generic American flag image for weeks at a time.There were also two days on which two different photos were shown, including July 25.That day, Trumps account first showed a tightly cropped picture of Trumps controversial speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia.Later that day about 20 minutes later the image was switched to one that made the crowd look bigger.During August, he spent a decent chunk of time on vacation at his private golf club in Bedminster, N.J. One of the header photos showed him there.Since September, the account has shown a wide range of images, despite most of October being taken up with another generic flag image.After Trump spoke at the United Nations, the header photo was again switched from one showing him speaking to one of him addressing a larger crowd.In early November, the image was switched to a photo of the Manhattan skyline after a terrorist attack in the city killed eight people.The presidency of Trump thats conveyed through his header images is thematic: a patriotic man whos busy traveling the world, holding meetings and, frequently, parked in front of a microphone.His newest header photo is the 18th to feature him speaking into or standing behind a mic.Microphones are pictured slightly more often than members of Congress or his Cabinet.That seems somehow fitting as well.

Before Texas shootings, Democratic lawmakers proposed bills to keep guns away from domestic abusers:::::Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), accompanied by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), pauses during a news conference on Capitol Hill on May 16, 2012, to push for the unrestricted reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.(J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press) Days before a gunman entered a small Texas church this month and fatally shot more than two dozen worshipers, Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) quietly reintroduced a bill aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of people involved in domestic violence cases.The bill would provide grants to state and local authorities to help enforce federal laws that prohibit people who have been convicted of domestic abuse or who have restraining orders against them from buying and possessing guns.Moore doesnt think the Domestic Violence Gun Homicide Prevention Act is particularly controversial, yet when she first introduced the measure in 2015, it went nowhere.Its a gun bill, Moore said, with a tinge of exasperation in her voice, when asked why the legislation had stalled.But after it was revealed that the Air Force had failed to report Devin P. Kelleys court-martial for domestic violence to the national database used in background checks for gun purchases, some members of Congress, including some Republicans, seem to at least agree with the objective of Moores bill.Last week, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the majority whip, said he would introduce legislation to incentivize federal agencies to do a better job of complying with reporting criminal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).And Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) joined with Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) to introduce a bill that would require the military to report domestic violence convictions to the NICS.Sens.Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Nov. 7 said they will introduce a bill that would aim to ensure that people convicted of domestic violence not be allowed to purchase firearms.(Reuters) Eric Harris, a spokesman for Moore, welcomed the attention and hopes it might boost the congresswomans bill, which was reintroduced five days before Kelley killed 26 people Nov. 4 during Sunday morning services at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex.Kelley, who killed himself after fleeing the scene, had been court-martialed and served time for abusing his wife and toddler stepson.[After Texas church massacre, tiny town urns to prayer to begin healing process] We hope that this seemingly newfound Republican concern on the role guns play in domestic violence situations will encourage them to support our bill, Harris said.The sentiments appear to exist across the aisle, however sentiments alone are meaningless without action to follow.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) has introduced a companion bill in the Senate, along with a separate measure that would restrict people under temporary restraining orders from buying and possessing guns.Current federal law applies only to those under permanent restraining orders.Moore was moved to introduce her bill after the 2012 killing of Zina Daniel, a suburban Milwaukee woman who was shot by her estranged husband at the spa where she worked.Six other women also were shot, two fatally, during the rampage.Daniels daughter, who also worked at the spa, escaped through a back door.Daniel had taken out a restraining order against her husband, who bought the gun he used in the shootings from an online arms dealer.He committed suicide at the scene.More than 55 percent of homicides of women in the country are committed by intimate partners, according to a report this year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Firearms are used in many of those killings.Moore, 66, who in her 20s was repeatedly beaten and threatened with a gun by a boyfriend, said her bill would provide state and local authorities with money to set up reporting systems and seize the firearms of people involved in domestic violence cases.Its not a do-all, save-all, but we thought if this would result in any reduction in the number of women who are killed every day, it would be great, she said.Were offering grants for jurisdictions that really want to be proactive about reducing that kind of violence in their communities.[Analysis: Why does it take a mass shooting to focus our attention on domestic violence] In addition to a Senate companion to Moores bill, Blumenthal introduced a bill that would extend federal law to cover individuals under temporary restraining orders.His legislation is named for Lori Jackson, a Connecticut woman who was shot to death in 2014 by her estranged husband, who also seriously wounded Jacksons mother.The narrowly-crafted legislation I introduced in Loris name would close the loophole that allows domestic abusers under temporary restraining orders to legally obtain weapons, Blumenthal said in a statement before the shooting, adding that continued congressional complicity in this matter is unacceptable.Blumenthal said that the tragic shooting in Texas has drawn national attention to the well-documented and deadly link between domestic violence and guns and that he was hopeful that this will create a renewed commitment to ensuring that domestic abusers are kept away from deadly firearms regardless of whether theyre convicted in military or civilian court.There is no guarantee that the new attention to the link between mass shootings and domestic violence will benefit Moores and Blumenthals bills.On the same day that Cornyn and other senators called for strengthening reporting requirements to make it harder for domestic abusers to buy guns, House Democrats were unable to force a vote on a measure that would have set up a bipartisan committee to address gun violence.
The brave new world of political conspiracy-theory illustrations:::::Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.)presented Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a shocking visual during a House hearing on Tuesday: a flowchart showing a complex system of interactions between the administration of President Barack Obama, the Russians and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.The graphic was meant to bolster Gohmerts argument that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III faced too many conflicts of interest to fairly evaluate the legality of a sale of a Canadian company to Russias nuclear-energy agency in 2010 the so-called Uranium One sale.At the heart of Gohmerts argument, though, was that Rosensteins conflict amounted to having prosecuted a Russian nuclear energy official.A grand conspiracy it was not.On his Fox News show that evening, Sean Hannity gave the conspiracy-web visual a try.Considering teaching my entire misinformation and conspiracy course using just this one visual pic.twitter.com/I1CxtMsYdg Brendan Nyhan (@BrendanNyhan) November 15, 2017 Like Gohmert, Hannity seemed more dedicated to the number of boxes on the chart that he could fit on the screen than to actually demonstrating any conspiracy.Also like Gohmert, there are some questionable choices about how the connecting lines are drawn; why, for example, is Clinton not connected directly to her husband, the former president?Theres a reason that both Hannity and Gohmert seized on these flowcharts to make their points.Americans have come to understand patterns of boxes and connecting arrows and lines as iconography meaning conspiracy theory.What Hannity and Gohmert are doing, in short, is implying a conspiracy by using the visual language associated with conspiracy theories.Joseph Uscinski is an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami and the co-author of American Conspiracy Theories.He spoke with The Washington Post by phone on Wednesday about the emergence of conspiracy-web visualizations in politics.The trend is that politicians are using it in a sort of brazen way, in a way that you wouldnt expect, Uscinski said.Normally you dont want to be labeled a conspiracy theorist, so putting up one of these charts that is clearly designed to be called a conspiracy theory just seems strange.Its one of those visual aids that you might prefer to avoid.So howd we get to this point?Uscinski noted that conspiracy theories are common among members of the political party thats out of power.Under Republican George W. Bush, there were theories about 9/11 and Halliburton.Under Democrat Obama, the theories were about his religion and his place of birth.It was in this era that Glenn Beck flourished on Fox News, sketching conspiracy theories on blackboards in chalk.Under President Trump, the left has seized on rumors of Russian collusion.Uscinski noted TheRohrabacherConspiracy.com, a website targeting Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) thats paid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.The fact that they would sponsor a website with the word conspiracy in it also tells you something: that they would have no problem engaging in conspiracy theorizing at this point, Uscinski said.But neither Gohmert nor Hannity is a member of the political opposition; quite the opposite.Trump, Uscinski said, changes the calculus.Trump ran against the establishment from the first day of his candidacy.That he was opposed by the powerful elites who preferred an international approach to his America First rhetoric was positioned in conspiratorial terms: They wanted him to lose, the media was making up stories, the elites want open borders, etc.Trump put together a coalition of conspiracy-minded people, Uscinski said, and the only way to hold that coalition together, he argued, was to keep feeding the conspiracies.So, even as president, Trump derides congressional investigations are witch hunts and the news is fake.Powerful people cant use conspiracy theories very well.Theyre tools of the weak to attack the powerful, he said.But what weve seen in this instance is because Trump has built his entire machine on conspiracy theories, thats why we have dueling conspiracy theories.Thats why we have a narrative on the right and a narrative on the left.Had rival Republican Jeb Bush won the presidency, Uscinski argues, Hannity would spend his time doing something else.Mark Fenster, professor of law at the University of Florida and author of Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture, agreed with that assessment.The permission that having a conspiracy-theorist-in-chief offers suggests that this can be much more explicit than it previously was, Fenster says.Its worth noting how the Gohmert-Hannity flowchart images differ from the Rohrabacher website.The latter explicitly embraces the yarn-and-photo aesthetic familiar to people from pop culture.The former seek legitimacy by emulating the complex illustrations that news outlets including The Post have used to show the web of relationships involved in the Russian-meddling story.As Fenster notes, the investigation into Russian meddling itself helps foster a conspiratorial culture.The potential existence of conspiracies themselves give more permission to such diagrams, he said.Its hard not to see the Mueller investigation and every news story that leaks from it and the efforts by bloggers even establishment bloggers and opinion writers to try to explain why it is, for example, [that] the direct messages between Julian Assange and Donald Trump Jr. somehow illuminate something itself becomes conspiratorial.He added, The cast of characters in the potential prosecution members of the Trump campaign is so vast and the connections between them so obscure that were all constructing charts for ourselves.The net effect, Uscinski argued, is that the cost of being called a conspiracy theorist at this point is probably getting closer to zero.So, he figured, I guess they might as well just let it rip.
The campaign to impeach President Trump: A users guide:::::Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.).(Alex Wong/Getty Images) On Wednesday morning, four House Democrats solemnly faced a half-full room of reporters and announced that they would try to impeach the president.Yes, again.The campaign to remove Donald Trump from the White House, elevated by liberal donor Tom Steyers $20 million Vote to Impeach ad buys, remains an off-on distraction in Congress.Supporters of impeachment point out that there were similar long-shot efforts to impeach Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.They argue that all of it helped drive the conversation in a city that preferred not to have one at all.I said three months ago that I would be introducing articles of impeachment, said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), the sponsor of the newest impeachment articles.I dont expect the House Judiciary Committee, which is operated like a branch of the administration, to have hearings.Previous impeachment efforts, despite some initial fanfare, have mostly faded.At a roundtable meeting with reporters last week, Steyer said that the Vote to Impeach campaign did not back any particular effort going through or, more accurately, going nowhere in the House.We are obviously supportive of all those people, and as far as I can tell, they dont have a majority right now, said Steyer.We think this has to be a much broader thing.Democrats are openly suggesting President Trump could be impeached.Here's how it would actually happen.(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Of the three impeachment efforts underway this year, just one has been given a legislative number.They are listed below: HR 438 Main sponsor: Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) Introduced: July 12 The gist: Shermans brief, single article of impeachment argues that the firing of former FBI director James B. Comey violated Trumps oath of office, especially after the president blurted out in an NBC News interview that the main reason for the termination was that the Director would not close or alter the investigation of matters related to the involvement of Russia in the 2016 campaign for President of the United States, according to the resolution.Al Greens Articles of Impeachment Main sponsor: Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.)Introduced: Oct. 17 The gist: Green produced four charges against the president, not related to the Russia investigation but to his conduct in office especially his handling of race relations.One: That he produced a demonstrable record of inciting white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, race-baiting, and racism by demeaning, defaming, disrespecting, and disparaging women and certain minorities.Two: That by refusing to clearly condemn white supremacists, hes been associating the majesty and dignity of the presidency with causes rooted in white supremacy, bigotry, racism, anti-semitism, white nationalism, and neo-nazism.Three: That Trump engag[ed] in perfidy by making the widely reported claim that three to five million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election.Four: That Trumps July speech to police officers amounted to encouraging law enforcement officials to violate the constitutional rights of suspects in their care, custody, and control.Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.)on Oct. 11 announced his intention to introduce a resolution aiming to impeach President Trump.Green said his resolution argues that Trump "has undermined the integrity of his office with impunity."(C-SPAN) Steve Cohens Articles of Impeachment Main sponsor: Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) Introduced: Nov. 15 The gist: Cohen opens the floodgates, with five articles arguing for the president to be removed from office over everything from the handling of 2016 campaign questions to his tweets about the media.One: Trump has obstructed the administration of justice with coverups on the Russia probe.Two: Trumps opaque handling of his finances and real estate holdings left himself open to foreign influence and deprived the American people of the assurance that their highest elected official was working on their behalf with undivided loyalty, and violated Article I, Section 25 of the U.S. Constitution.Three: Trump violated Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, the emoluments clause, by continuing to benefit from business at his properties while president.Four: Trump has sought to undermine the independence of the Federal judiciary and the rule of law by criticizing judges who rule against him and by pardoning infamous Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.Five: Trump has sought to undermine the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.
ACA federal enrollment surges by at least 47 percent this year, CMS says:::::The Affordable Care Acts fifth enrollment season opens with daunting challenges ahead.(HealthCare.gov) Enrollment under the Affordable Care Act in 39 states has surged at least 47 percent compared to the same period last year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Nearly 1.5 million Americans signed up for coverage during the first 11 days of enrollment, CMS said Tuesday, including 876,788 during the second week.That compares to just over 1 million Americans who signed up though HealthCare.gov during the first 12 days of open enrollment in 2016.The portion of new consumers enrolling in ACA plans is slightly down this year, according to the latest federal report.Those Americans accounted for 23 percent of enrollees between Nov. 1 and Nov. 11, as opposed to 24 percent in the early days of 2016.The new report does not include the dozen or so states, and the District of Columbia, that run their own health-care exchanges.But the vast majority of these states have also seen an uptick in sign-ups as well as call center demand.[How rolling back a key element of Obamacare could stymie the broader repeal effort] Health experts said it is too soon to say what is driving the increase in enrollment, and whether it will be sustained over the course of the 45-day enrollment window.The Trump administration has cut the period for sign-ups in half compared to previous years, and some state and health industry officials have expressed concern that this will mean less time for younger, healthier consumers who tend to procrastinate in buying coverage to enroll.And it comes as Senate Republicans are seeking to eliminate the federal mandate that U.S. taxpayers provide proof of health-care coverage as part of a broader tax bill, which the Congressional Budget Office has estimated would reduce the number of insured Americans by about 13 million over a decade.
PM Theresa May: I'll take charge of house building efforts:::::The Prime Minister has vowed to take "personal charge" of Government efforts to increase house building across the UK.It comes as the Chancellor hinted next week's Budget will include new measures to assist first-time buyers, but warned there was "no silver bullet" for solving the housing crisis.In a statement, Theresa May acknowledged there had been failures in housing policy, and that it would "take time" to fix the "broken market"."For decades we simply have not been building enough homes, nor have we been building them quickly enough, and we have seen prices rise," she said."The number of new homes being delivered each year has been increasing since 2010, but there is more we can do."We must get back into the business of building the good quality new homes for people who need them most.""That is why I have made it my mission to build the homes the country needs and take personal charge of the Government's response," the Prime Minister added.Chancellor Philip Hammond is facing growing pressure from some on the Conservative backbenches and from within Cabinet to make a radical offer on housing in his Budget next week.But in an interview he warned solving the crisis would not be straightforward."There is no silver bullet, there isn't a single thing that solves the challenge of affordability in the housing market - we are a crowded island and this is a very complex challenge," Mr Hammond said.However, he went on to hint that there may be some offer to assist first-time buyers."Next week we will start to set out our plan for addressing the housing challenges in this country, making sure that the next generation has the same opportunities as their parents did for home ownership and the accumulation of personal wealth through assets," said the Chancellor.Video: PM pledges two billion pound boost for affordable homes Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, who has suggested the Chancellor should consider borrowing more money to invest in new house-building, will deliver a speech on housing in Bristol later.He is expected to say: "Without affordable, secure, safe housing we risk creating a rootless generation, drifting from one short-term tenancy to the next, never staying long enough to play a role in their community."Mr Javid is also expected to announce debts held by housing associations will be taken off the public balance sheet to "ensure housing associations have a stable investment environment to build more homes".The move follows a provisional decision by the Office for National Statistics to reclassify housing associations as private, not-for-profit landlords, subject to the Government changing regulations that were seen to constitute public sector control.The Government has been determined to reverse an ONS decision in 2015 to classify housing associations as public bodies, which added tens of billions of pounds to the public balance sheet.But Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said the Government's pronouncements would do little to reassure voters."If the Prime Minister wants to help families on ordinary incomes, she should back Labour's plan to build 100,000 new genuinely affordable homes a year, help first-time buyers and give renters new consumer rights including control on rents," he said.
Latest attempts to change key Brexit bill rejected in Commons:::::The latest attempts to change key Brexit legislation have been defeated in the Commons, after Theresa May called on MPs to "come together" on the issue.Labour's bid to make it harder to change employment rights, environmental protection and other EU regulations after Brexit in the form of two amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill was repelled.The Government survived four other votes on day two of the flagship bill's committee stage, during which MPs examine proposed legislation in fine detail.But in a sign of potential trouble brewing, Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned laws safeguarding such rights would be brought to the "lowest possible status" in Parliament once Britain's EU exit takes effect.Video: Grieve: 'We have serious concerns about Brexit bill' He told the Commons that legislation of "considerable importance" would be weakened under the bill, which is designed to convert EU law into UK legislation by the end of March 2019.Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook said secondary legislation could be used to "chip away at rights, entitlements, protections and standards that the public enjoy and wish to retain".Labour wanted to ensure that retained EU law could only be changed through primary legislation, which requires full debates in the chamber.Mr Grieve said: "He's right about that - that is the curiosity of this legislation, that taking laws which we would regard for the most part in this country of being of very considerable importance if you were to speak to them, to raise the issues with the public, are being brought to the lowest possible status on their return here and without there really being an opportunity for obvious reasons for us to revisit this issue domestically in a way which might lead us to enacting fresh legislation."Mr Grieve said later in the debate that he wanted an assurance from the Government that the issue was being looked at, but said Labour's proposed change had "problems of its own".Video: MPs to get vote on Brexit bill.What happens now?He continued: "I put the Government on notice that we are going to have to draw together the issues that we're debating today."And indeed I'm convinced it will be similar issues next week, all of which derive from the same problem, as to the way the Government has approached this and drafted this legislation at the moment, and it must be remedied."Solicitor General Robert Buckland said Brexit would "in no way whatsoever be used to undermine or curtail the rights of workers that have been enshrined both in domestic law and in law by virtue of the EU".More than 400 amendments have been tabled to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, with the first opposition amendments to the flagship legislation defeated on Tuesday.Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mrs May said she was "listening carefully to those who wish to improve the bill".The PM added: "I hope that we can all come together to deliver on the decision that the country took that we should leave the European Union."
Government backs down on Universal Credit wait:::::The Government is to cut the controversial six-week wait for Universal Credit payments in the comings days in a bid to see off a Conservative rebellion.A Government source familiar with the plans told Sky News there would be "some movement [on the wait time] in the early part of next week" after intensive behind-the-scenes discussions with a group of up to two dozen rebel MPs.The source said ministers were working on plans to cut the wait to five weeks or less in a significant concession to backbench MPs.Image: A Sky Data poll found more than three in four people thought the wait was too long And Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke is also said to be looking to do more on advance payments for claimants as the roll-out of Universal Credit is expanded from five to 50 job centres a month.Universal Credit combines six benefits into one single benefit and is designed to simplify the welfare system and to "make work pay".It was the flagship welfare reform of David Cameron's coalition government, but has been plagued with delays since its inception and by criticism over its design.One flaw is the six-week wait time which has been criticised across the political divide amid concerns it is pushing claimants into arrears on rent and council tax, and forcing some to use food banks.:: Charity warns Universal Credit rollout could see food banks struggle this winter Image: There are fears the wait is also forcing people to use food banks A quarter of all claimants are having to wait more than six weeks to receive their payments.The system is designed to mirror the way wages are paid, but a new Sky Data poll found more than three in four respondents thought the six-week wait was too long, with only 8% saying it was about right.The expected reduction in the wait time will be the second major concession within weeks.Last month Mr Gauke announced those calling the Universal Credit helpline would no longer be charged up to 55p a minute.The expected reduction in the wait time comes after a sustained campaign by prominent backbenchers Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston, Johnny Mercer and Stephen McPartland.Three of the rebels had a private meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May last month to outline their concerns.Since then Mr Gauke and Damian Hinds, the ministers responsible for the policy, have been in "constant contact" with MPs as they work up a plan to tweak the system, according to one person familiar with the discussions.Image: Works and Pensions Secretary David Gauke is working on the changes :: Six-week wait for Universal Credit shake-up will cause 'Christmas disaster' Under the proposed changes, ministers could scrap the seven-day waiting time before a new claim can be lodged and shorten the processing time at the end of a four-week assessment to ensure recipients have to wait for a month rather than six weeks to receive their benefit.Mr Gauke may also do more to ensure claimants are offered advance payments in order to tide them over as they wait to be paid.Ms Allen has secured a backbench debate in the House of Commons on Universal Credit on Thursday.She told Sky News: "We know the Government has listened fully to our concerns, so many of us are hopeful we will hear positive news soon."Ahead of the Budget next week, we will be having a backbench debate on this issue.Perhaps there will be an opportunity for an update there."Mr Mercer said he was "confident" that the wait time would be reduced, while Mr McPartland went further by saying he "believes it will be reduced from six to four weeks"."We're keen to see that happen," he said.Mrs May was challenged over the roll-out of Universal Credit at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warning thousands of families are being put through the "trauma" of fearing eviction over Christmas due to the benefit changes.
Labour MP Ivan Lewis investigated after sexual harassment claim:::::Labour MP Ivan Lewis is under formal investigation following an allegation of sexual harassment but has not been suspended from the party.Earlier this month, the Bury South MP denied he had ever made non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances towards women.It followed allegations, reported by BuzzFeed News, that he touched a woman's leg and invited her to his house at a Labour Party event in 2010, when she was 19.A formal complaint about Mr Lewis has now been lodged with the party.A Labour Party spokesperson said: "The Labour Party takes all allegations of sexual harassment extremely seriously and all complaints are investigated in line with our robust procedures."Ivan Lewis is currently under investigation following the receipt of a complaint."BuzzFeed News has since reported further allegations from other women, which Mr Lewis is said to strongly deny.Video: MPs discuss Westminster sexual harassment In a statement to the website on Wednesday, the MP's lawyer said: "Mr Lewis has previously acknowledged that on some occasions his invitations to people he works with to join him for dinner or drinks have made them feel uncomfortable."He apologises if this caused them discomfort and if he underestimated the impact his invitations to drinks or dinner could have."He has always sought to behave with integrity and is genuinely sorry if he got it wrong in some circumstances."He fully supports the rights of women to raise these issues, and stresses his commitment to equality and fairness in the workplace."Mr Lewis was first elected to Parliament in 1997 and served in both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments.The divorced father-of-two, 50, was most recently on Labour's frontbench as shadow Northern Ireland secretary under former Labour leader Ed Miliband.The investigation into Mr Lewis comes amid an ongoing sexual harassment scandal at Westminster, which has prompted cross-party efforts to provide better safeguards for MPs' staff and party officials.The past few weeks have seen an outbreak of allegations against senior figures from across the political parties.
Anna Soubry MP reports threats to police after Daily Telegraph headline:::::A Tory MP has revealed threats against her have been reported to police after she was branded among "Brexit mutineers" on a newspaper's front page.Anna Soubry is one of 15 Conservative backbenchers highlighted as rebels by the Daily Telegraph, as the Government attempts to steer its key Brexit legislation through Parliament.Under the headline "The Brexit mutineers", the newspaper's controversial front page also featured photographs of the MPs.Ms Soubry immediately hit back at "bullying" while Brexit minister Steve Baker expressed his "regret" at "media attempts to divide our party".Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms Soubry raised a point of order with Speaker John Bercow as she told of the threats.The Broxtowe MP said: "According to my office, they have just reported about five, if not more, tweets to the police issuing threats against myself following the front page article on today's Daily Telegraph."Would you therefore, Mr Speaker, make it very clear to everybody, in whatever capacity, that they have an absolute duty to report responsibly and make sure they use language that brings our country together and makes sure that we have a democracy that welcomes free speech and an attitude of tolerance.":: Twin tightropes for PM amid Brexit close combat Image: The controversial Daily Telegraph front page In response, Mr Bercow told Ms Soubry he was "extremely concerned" by her remarks, adding: "Members will not be intimidated and they never should be."The Daily Telegraph's front page followed the return of the EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons on Wednesday, in which Remain-supporting Conservative MPs voiced their anger at a proposed Government amendment to write an exit date of 11pm on 29 March, 2019 into the legislation.It has raised the possibility of the Government having to withdraw the amendment in order to avoid a humiliating defeat, as a number of Tory MPs signalled they would vote against it.Antoinette Sandbach, another of the Tory MPs included on the Daily Telegraph's front page, branded the newspaper's headline "silly", telling Sky News: "We are doing our job, which is looking at how we can improve this bill."Earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, fellow Conservative backbencher Michael Tomlinson appeared to allude to the Daily Telegraph front page when he asked Theresa May whether she would agree it is the "duty" of MPs to "scrutinise" and "debate" the EU Withdrawal Bill.Video: Soubry accuses Daily Telegraph of 'blatant bullying' The Prime Minister replied: "There is of course a lively debate going on in this place - that is right and proper, and that is important - and strong views are held on different sides of the argument about the EU on both sides of this House."What we are doing as a Government is listening to the contributions that are being made and listening carefully to those who wish to improve the bill, and I hope that we can all come together to deliver on the decision that the country took that we should leave the EU."Remain-supporting Tories have also signalled they could support a number of their own amendments to the Government legislation, which is being debated and voted on at committee stage over the next few weeks.A total of 464 amendments have been tabled to the bill.
Johnson 'keen' to take Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband to Iran:::::Boris Johnson is "keen" for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband to accompany him to Iran as the UK ups its attempts to secure her release, Richard Ratcliffe has said.Mr Ratcliffe - whose dual-nationality wife has been locked up in Tehran on spying charges since early last year - said the timing of the Foreign Secretary's trip had not yet been confirmed.He described a meeting between the pair on Wednesday morning as "positive" and "constructive".He said: "We talked about his trip to Iran, and as of the meeting, it's not confirmed when."He said he was keen to take me but it is a question to resolve both within the advice of the Foreign Office and also in liaising with the Iranians."We will still keep pushing for that."It's very important for me to go on that trip, to be standing alongside the Foreign Secretary, and I understand that's a big ask, it's reasonably unprecedented, but it's important for me."Image: Boris Johnson and Richard Ratcliffe spoke about giving his wife, Nazanin, diplomatic protection Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian charity worker, was detained in Tehran Airport in April 2016 as she was returning home from a family holiday with 22-month-old daughter Gabriella.The 38-year-old denies spying charges.She has been in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison since then and her husband has accused Mr Johnson of possibly increasing her sentence by five years after he told MPs last week she was "teaching people journalism" in the country.Mr Ratcliffe said he and the Foreign Secretary spoke about diplomatic protection for his wife."We talked of the point of diplomatically protection, which is different to diplomatic immunity," he said."It is, in essence, when a state like Britain decides Nazanin is being treated badly [and that] because she's British she's entitled to protection by the British state."It's not unprecedented but it's a big step.I said it would be important and helpful."The Foreign Office expressed reservations and we agreed there are some questions we've sent from the lawyers, they've agreed to answer the questions and then for the lawyers to sit down and talk it through both legally and practically.":: Johnson to 'leave no stone unturned' for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Image: Richard Ratcliffe said Boris Johnson told him he is 'keen' for him to go to Iran with the Foreign Secretary A Foreign Office spokesman said the meeting was "positive".He added the British ambassador in Iran had "once again" raised Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with the Iranian foreign minister and had urged they "provide consular access, appropriate medical treatment, a decision on Richard Ratcliffe's visa application and access for Richard Ratcliffe to see his wife if a visit does go ahead"."The Foreign Secretary and officials outlined that the key question is whether diplomatic protection will have a positive impact on the case, given all the representations that have already been made," he added."They agreed that lawyers should meet in the coming fortnight to discuss it further."On Mr Ratcliffe's request to accompany Mr Johnson to Iran before the end of the year, the spokesman said: "Our overriding principle in handling this case is to secure a permanent family reunion, not a temporary one."Any decision must be guided by that principle."Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his young daughter, who has been staying with Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family, for 19 months.She can no longer speak English, which makes it difficult for them to converse.He has been trying to get a visa to visit Iran for the past 19 months without success.
Government scraps 250m alternative to Operation Stack:::::Plans for a 250m lorry park off the M20 - pitched by the Government as an alternative to Operation Stack - have been dropped.Former Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the proposal for Stamford West, Kent, during 2015's Autumn Statement after huge disruption that summer due to industrial action by French ferry workers and migrant activity in Calais, which caused delays at the Port of Dover.It meant that Operation Stack - a police initiative which essentially creates 3,000 parking spaces for trucks on the motorway - was deployed for more than a month.But the lorry park proposal was not without controversy, having proved unpopular with nearby residents, and in October last year was subjected to a judicial review.Image: Chris Grayling will now have to work on an another alternative to Operation Stack Now the Department for Transport (DfT) has told the High Court that it will no longer be defending the plan, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has confirmed that the Government will go back to the drawing board for an alternative solution.He said: "My department and Highways England have, since being judicially reviewed, tried to find a solution so that the lorry park could be delivered as quickly as possible to mitigate the impacts of Operation Stack, whilst also meeting our environmental obligations.However, it has not proven possible to do so."But I can announce today that we are immediately starting the process to promote a lorry park through the normal planning process, including a full environmental impact assessment, as a potential permanent solution to Operation Stack."Image: Queues at the Port of Dover Mr Grayling added that the "scope, scale and location" of the potential solutions will have to be reassessed, with the Prime Minister having triggered Article 50 since the original lorry park was put forward.Last month Mr Grayling suggested the M20 could become a semi-permanent lorry park if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.Highways England will run a public consultation on an alternative early next year with a view to submitting a planning application in 2019, and an interim solution by March of that year.In the meantime, Manston Airfield will continue to be usable for lorry drivers during severe cross-Channel disruption.Roads Minister Jesse Norman added: "We know how seriously the lives of Kent residents and the prospects of businesses were affected when Operation Stack was implemented in 2015 and we remain fully committed to a permanent solution."
Scottish Labour leader Alex Rowley steps down over 'conduct':::::Interim Scottish Labour leader Alex Rowley has stepped down and been suspended from the party after claims about his conduct emerged.The MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife took over as interim leader from Kezia Dugdale after she unexpectedly quit on 29 August.Mr Rowley, who has also stepped down as deputy leader, has been suspended by the party while the claims are investigated.His stint as interim leader was due to come to an end this Saturday, when the result of the party's leadership election between Richard Leonard and Anas Sarwar will be announced.Mr Rowley said: "I totally refute these allegations and will take all steps necessary to clear my name."These allegations must be properly and thoroughly investigated in line with our party's procedures - and I will refer myself to the party so such an investigation can take place."While that investigation is carried out, I will step aside as deputy leader, as well as interim leader of the Scottish Labour Party."Ms Dugdale had earlier called for Mr Rowley to be suspended while the "serious and deeply concerning" allegations were looked into.Confirming the suspension, Business Manager James Kelly MSP said: "It is important that the investigation into these allegations is fair and transparent, and the matter will be thoroughly investigated using the Labour Party's internal complaints procedure."However, in light of the serious nature of the allegations, Labour at Holyrood has taken the decision to remove the whip from Alex Rowley for the period of this investigation."A Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: "Alex Rowley has stood aside as interim and deputy leader of Scottish Labour and referred himself to the party's internal complaints procedure regarding allegations made against him."The spokesman said it was not for the party to confirm or deny reports about allegations against party members.Mr Rowley, 53, was voted in as deputy Scottish Labour leader in August 2015.The father of three grown-up children is described as representing the left-wing of the Labour Party.He was considered former prime minister Gordon Brown's right-hand man and protege after working as his assistant, election agent and constituency manager for five years.
PMQs: Theresa May warned of Xmas 'trauma' over Universal Credit:::::The Prime Minister has been warned thousands of families are being put through the "trauma" of fearing eviction over Christmas due to flagship benefit changes.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tackled Theresa May over the roll-out of Universal Credit, as he revealed a letting agency's warning to tenants that they could be asked to leave their properties.In a letter from Lincolnshire-based GAP Property, tenants are told the company cannot sustain arrears "at the potential levels Universal Credit could create" when the new benefits system is introduced in the area next month.Highlighting a six-week wait claimants will face for their first benefit payments under Universal Credit, the agency adds: "IF YOU DO NOT PAY YOUR RENT WE WILL HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO LEAVE AND RECOVER LOSSES FROM YOUR GUARANTOR".GAP Property insists to tenants the letter is "not intended to cause you alarm, rather to inform you of the problems that could very well occur during the roll-out of Universal Credit".letter Corbyn brandished during PMQs Grimsby letting agents issuing a "notice seeking possession" because of 6 week universal credit gap pic.twitter.com/ZrdtJn3vCS Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) November 15, 2017 Challenging Mrs May over the letter at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn asked: "Will the Prime Minister pause Universal Credit so it can be fixed or does she think it is right to put thousands of families through Christmas in the trauma of knowing they're about to be evicted because they're in rent arrears because of Universal Credit?"In response, Mrs May acknowledged concerns about people managing their budgets to pay rent during the Universal Credit roll-out, but added: "What we see is after four months the number of people on Universal Credit in arrears has fallen by a third."The Labour leader told the Prime Minister he suspects "it's not the only letting agency that's sending out that kind of letter" and highlighted increased food bank usage and child poverty fears as he demanded the Government pause the roll-out of Universal Credit.Mrs May countered the new benefits system "is ensuring that we are seeing more people in work and able to keep what they earn".Video: Govt to cut six-week wait for Universal Credit payments Their exchanges came after Sky News was told the Government is to cut the controversial six-week wait for Universal Credit payments in the comings days in a bid to appease unhappy Conservative MPs.After PMQs, Mrs May's official spokesman said the Prime Minister had made clear she will "continue to evaluate" Universal Credit as it is rolled out He added there have "already been developments" on the new benefits programme, such as the number of people claiming advance payments "increasing significantly" and the scrapping of charges on Universal Credit phone lines.Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams repeated Labour's demand for a pause to Universal Credit while "these issues are fixed".She said: "The Government is reportedly planning to reduce the six week wait for Universal Credit payments."I hope they have now listened to Labour's repeated calls to significantly reduce the waiting time, which has driven many into debt, arrears and evictions."Much more needs to be done."The Government must confirm that alternative payment arrangements will be offered to all recipients, including fortnightly payments, and bring forward plans to restore the principle that work always pays under the programme."A flagship scheme of David Cameron's coalition government, Universal Credit aims to simplify the benefits system by rolling six existing benefits into one single payment.
Record numbers of EU workers in UK since Brexit:::::Record levels of EU nationals are now working in the UK, official figures have revealed.An estimated 2.38 million employees from other EU member states were working in Britain from July to September this year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found.This is the highest number recorded since comparable records started 20 years ago.In the same period last year there were 112,000 fewer EU employees.It marks the first time year-on-year comparisons of employment levels based on nationality have be made following the EU referendum in June last year.While EU employment rose, overall UK employment fell by 14,000 to just over 32 million in the three months to September, according to the ONS.Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK, said the figures "show that predictions of a Brexodus - an outflow of EU workers - are nonsense".Matt Hughes, ONS senior statistician, said: "The number of non-UK nationals in work is still rising, albeit more slowly than in the last couple of years."However, this is being driven by EU citizens; the number of non-EU nationals working in the UK has fallen in the last year.":: Job numbers slip back as pay squeeze deepens Image: Employees from Bulgaria and Romania, Germany, Italy, Spain and France have increased Much of the increase has been down to more Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK.In the third quarter of this year, 347,000 nationals from the two countries worked in the UK - an increase of 90,000 compared with the same period in 2016.Citizens from the two eastern European countries have only been allowed to work in the UK since 2014, after they became EU members in 2007.There was also a surge in the number of employees from long-standing members Germany, France, Italy and Spain, from 942,000 to 987,000.Workers from eight central and eastern European countries have fallen.During the last period there was an estimated 1.035 million employees from the EUA8 countries which joined the union in 2004.There were 20,000 fewer workers from these countries, which include the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.Overseas workers from outside the EU fell by 23,000 to 1.21 million.The ONS report said: "Since January to March 2009, the number of non-UK nationals from outside the EU working in the UK has been broadly flat but the number of non-UK nationals from EU countries working in the UK has continued to increase."Statistics published earlier this year revealed EU migrants account for up to one in 10 employees in some sectors.
Senators forge deal to improve gun background database:::::The new legislative push is led in part by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Senators forge deal to improve gun background database A bipartisan group of senators has struck a deal to bolster a federal database used to check the backgrounds of gun buyers in the aftermath of several recent mass shootings.The new legislative push is led by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), two powerful figures in their respective parties when it comes to gun policy.Though their bill has not been formally released, it targets the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which both senators have said is deeply flawed.Story Continued Below Their plan is twofold, according to two sources familiar with it: One is to incentivize states to send more information about criminal histories to the system, known as NICS.States usually arent required to do so, unless their own laws mandate it or they have to do so to receive federal funding.It would also make sure that federal agencies follow through on their own requirement that they send information to the database.The new plan would beef up the federal mandate and include punishments for agencies that dont comply, according to one of the sources.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Mass shootings in recent years have exposed flaws with the national database.Most recently, the U.S. Air Force disclosed after a massacre at a rural Texas church last week that officials there did not submit information to NICS about the gunmans history of domestic assault that should have stopped him from owning a gun.Cornyn said last week that he was working with Murphy and Democratic Sens.Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico on legislation to improve NICS.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is also supporting the bill, according to an aide.
How Cotton brought Obamacare repeal back from the dead:::::Sen. Tom Cotton was about to enter the White House early this month to discuss immigration policy when he got an unexpected call from President Donald Trump to talk about a different topic.For days, the Arkansas senator had been working behind the scenes to convince Republicans that reigniting a battle over repealing Obamacare in the tax fight wasnt as crazy as it seemed.But Trump, still smarting from GOPs failures to dismantle the law whom Cotton had first pitched on the idea four days prior, needed little persuading.Story Continued Below I am with you 1,000 percent on this, Trump told Cotton over the phone.Trump tweeted twice that Republicans should repeal the mandate, putting pressure on the GOP to tuck it into tax reform, despite the idea being widely dismissed at the time.That Nov. 2 conversation illustrates how the GOP rank-and-file methodically coaxed their leadership to embark on what seemed and could still become a fools errand to try again to take down Obamacare.In a surprise move, Senate Republicans said Tuesday that they would repeal Obamacares individual mandate with their tax plan, using the savings to plow into more tax cuts.Hesitant would be kind, Cotton said of leaderships initial reaction to his pitch.It was skeptical to outright opposed many people were burned by our experience on health care not once, but twice in July, but again with Graham-Cassidy in September, referring to another failed attempt to repeal Obamacare earlier this fall.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.At the very least, the strategy throws the political grenade of health care into the already-complicated task of overhauling the tax code.At least one influential swing vote on tax reform, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, has expressed concerns about adding Obamacare into the tax mix.Democrats vowing to kill the GOPs tax efforts are convinced that Republicans have only given them more ammunition.And the GOP will have to reckon with the consequences of striking the individual mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office says would cause health care premiums to spike and would lead to 13 million fewer people having insurance in the next 10 years.But Republicans argue it this way: It actually smooths passage for tax reform by giving them a pot of cash to play with for popular tax breaks.One GOP senator said Republicans might have had to set the corporate rate at higher than 20 percent if not for the savings from the mandate.The move also allows them to avoid killing popular tax breaks such as the adoption tax credit as the House initially had to do.Some of the skeptics finally decided that we were going to have to put some pretty unpalatable things in the bill and $338 billion alleviates some of the ugliness, said the Republican senator.Senate Finance Committee members had frequently brought up the idea of repealing the mandate in their regular meetings ahead of the release of the original bill.But the public push to repeal the mandate from Republican senators including Cotton, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky helped drive momentum to repeal the mandate, according to GOP aides.In an interview with POLITICO, Cotton said he became convinced that the GOP had to target the individual mandate during an Oct. 26 meeting with Senate Finance Committee members.Republican senators detailed what Cotton described as a parade of horribles a series of popular tax breaks they would need to rescind that would result absent the hundreds of billions in savings from nixing the health care requirement.I started seeing the looks of hesitancy and outright terror on the faces of my colleagues, Cotton recalled.[I] spoke to some of them over the next few days and just realized that if we wanted the tax bill to work within the constraints of the budget, we had to repeal the mandate.Cotton had already mentioned his idea offhand to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor.But then the senator quickly got to work on crafting a way to inject Obamacare repeal into the tax fight, as unlikely as it seemed.Cotton spoke privately with White House officials including legislative director Marc Short and Jonny Hiler a former Cotton aide who leads Vice President Mike Pences legislative operation as well as from the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.Even as the Senate GOP rank and file began to coalesce around the idea, there were other areas to smooth out before leadership could decide to include it in their tax plan.Cotton, Toomey and Sens.John Thune of South Dakota and Mike Crapo of Idaho met privately with CBO Director Keith Hall to make sure that repealing the mandate would yield at least $300 billion in savings.(The figure ultimately was $338 billion.)Ten days ago, I think people were a little surprised at the impact of what it would have in terms of the fiscal side, said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), adding $338 billion to begin with is a lot of dollars and it really does make tax reform a lot easier to put together.Now, GOP leaders say publicly that they have the votes for including the mandate repeal, even if it causes complications with the likes of Collins.The cash went to new provisions such as boosting the size of the child tax credit, as Sens.Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) wanted.Republicans are also framing the mandate repeal as a tax cut, say GOP aides.According to IRS figures, nearly 80 percent of Americans who paid the penalty in 2015 made less than $50,000.What members saw is an opportunity to help middle-class families, a Senate Finance aide said.Here is a pot of money sitting here and negatively impacting people trying to help.Still, the GOP plan would allow key tax cuts for individuals to expire, while business cuts would be permanent.That opens the party to criticism from Democrats for tilting their plan toward corporations while going after the health care law, yet again.Its not done in the abstract, Cotton said.Once you have to compare it to popular, widespread deductions like the mortgage interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction, then a lot of members who might be otherwise reluctant will see thats the simplest way to deliver more tax cuts for working families.Senate Republicans have other concerns they need to satisfy on their path to 50 votes, however.Sens.John McCain of Arizona, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have raised concerns about the deficit impact of the tax bill.And on Wednesday, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin became the first GOP senator to say outright that he opposes the tax bill.And even if the mandate repeal clears the Senate, it will have to contend with the House, whose plan does not include the provision.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is concerned that injecting controversial health care provisions into the tax package a top priority for Republicans will sink the entire bill.But House Republican sources say if the Senate can repeal the mandate, the House will almost certainly follow suit.Nonetheless, no one expected even a few days ago that the party would try again on health care.Things, mused Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), change quickly around here.
Rubio: Trump 'needs to work' on water drinking form:::::Sen. Marco Rubio got a chance to get back at President Donald Trump Wednesday.The president had previously mocked Rubio for his own water-related mishap.| Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Rubio: Trump 'needs to work' on water drinking form Marco Rubio has some advice for President Donald Trump on how to best quench his thirst.Trump taunted the Florida senator in 2013 for stopping to drink water while responding to former President Barack Obama's State of the Union address.Rubio got a chance to get back at the president on Wednesday when Trump paused while addressing reporters at the White House to open a bottle of water and take several sips.Story Continued Below "Similar,but needs work on his form.Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera.But not bad for his 1st time," Rubio tweeted Wednesday.Trump, during his first public comments since returning from a diplomatic trip to Asia, stopped suddenly while discussing his trade efforts in Japan."They don't have water.That's OK," Trump said.He initially ducked down beneath his lectern in search of water bottle.After someone off-camera pointed to the Fiji bottle on a table, the president picked it up and, without looking away from the television cameras, unscrewed the top.He glanced away and lowered his mouth to the bottle, then tipped it back and took a sip.A few minutes later, Trump paused again to sip from the water bottle.Trump, then a private citizen, had mocked Rubio for his own water-related mishap."Next time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottlewould have much less negative impact," Trump tweeted following the incident.Playbook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Trump also taunted Rubio for sweating on the 2016 campaign trail.He walks in and hes drenched.I have never seen a human being sweat like this man sweats," Trump said at a rally in February, 2016."It looked like he had just jumped into a swimming pool with his clothes on.Trump opened a water bottle and sprayed it, exclaiming, Its Rubio!
Dems seize on GOPs Obamacare attack to awaken the left on taxes:::::Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers joined liberal activists outside the Capitol on Wednesday for a rally against the Republican tax plan.| John Shinkle/POLITICO Dems seize on GOPs Obamacare attack to awaken the left on taxes Senate Republicans decision to strike at Obamacare in their tax legislation may be just what Democrats and progressive organizers need to rally an otherwise distracted base.The liberal activists who besieged the GOPs health bill have yet to rise up as fiercely against the tax plan.They havent been helped with headlines dominated by the Roy Moore scandal and a Russia probe drawing closer to President Donald Trump.Story Continued Below But the GOP bid to repeal Obamacares mandate that individuals buy insurance gives them a powerful opportunity to engage the grassroots, liberal leaders say.And thats good news for Democrats, who are eager to rev up their supporters as Republicans race to finish their tax bill by Christmas.Republicans have fired up our grassroots like we couldnt have imagined, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview.This is a major tactical error.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and more than a dozen of their caucus members joined liberal activists outside the Capitol for a Wednesday rally against the Republican tax plan.Groups on the left are also ramping up their activity, with MoveOn.org Washington director Ben Wikler touting hundreds of protests in the works for the week after Thanksgiving, when the Senate GOP is expected to bring its tax bill to the floor.The House is expected to pass its tax bill Thursday.Wikler compared liberals recent approach to the tax bill to the early days of the Obamacare repeal battle, when Trump seized headlines by firing FBI Director James Comey days after the House passed its repeal bill.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.There were so many different breaking stories all the time, Wikler said, and a vote far enough away that people didnt feel like they needed to push everything else to the side to focus on it.That period is over.Yet it remains unclear whether the left can recapture the fury that ultimately helped tank Republicans effort to repeal Obamacare.Senate GOP leaders are projecting confidence in their ability to steer the tax plan through with a repeal of the health insurance mandate, which saves hundreds of billions of dollars that they can use to help pay for other individual and corporate cuts.Obamacare swing votes such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) did not immediately oppose the idea.Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) acknowledged in an interview that it is discouraging and disturbing to see the full impact of the GOP tax bill not even getting attention, with Roy Moore and all the things on TV right now.Republicans decision to include repeal of Obamacares insurance mandate has raised attention, Udall added, citing Democrats on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee who report a pretty dramatic shift in public focus.One of those Finance panel Democrats from a state Trump carried, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, saw the White House court his support just last week.But Brown fumed on Wednesday at Republicans targeting of Obamacare in the tax bill, slamming the GOP for an immoral dismantling of former President Barack Obamas health care law.Indeed, Republicans addition of the mandate repeal to the tax bill promises to make a no vote politically easier for Browns fellow red-state Democrats.Part of Senate Democrats recipe for victory on Obamacare repeal earlier this year was unity of opposition, from conservative Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).The House minority is similarly rallying against their Republican bill.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) pointed to polling that shows the GOP tax plan is unpopular with the public, with a Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday that shows a majority of voters disapproving of the bill even before the addition of the Obamacare provision.I dont think their initial product was all that successful, Durbin said in an interview, but they have complicated their political life by including this elimination of the individual mandate.Within the outside groups that Democratic leaders are leaning on for support as the tax fight picks up, organizers are optimistic that the turbulent pace of the Trump era won't crowd out their efforts."We live in abnormal times," Murshed Zaheed, political director at the liberal group CREDO Action, said in an interview."We are dealing with a cluster bomb of explosive issues and oftentimes-daily bombshells that drop on Russia stories.We have this fiasco happening down in Alabama."But despite the noise generated by the investigation into potential Russian collusion by the Trump campaign and the furor over Moore's alleged sexual assaults in Alabama, Zaheed said, "I do believe Im seeing a lot of traction" with the Democratic base on taxes.Angel Padilla, policy director at the liberal group Indivisible, urged Senate Democrats to increase that traction by replicating the same procedural obstruction they mounted during the Obamacare repeal battle to draw public attention to the GOP's tax bill a step that some in the caucus say is not getting ruled out.Republicans are getting a boost from the distractions that Moore and Russia offer, especially as they try to pass the tax package so quickly, Padilla argued in an interview."The Thanksgiving break is in the middle of the fight, and its hard to pull people from their families in the middle of Thanksgiving," he said. "All of this is working against us.The timing is an issue."
First Republican senator breaks with GOP on tax bill:::::Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) was similarly ornery during the battle earlier this year to repeal Obamacare, although he ultimately ended up voting in favor of the GOPs health care plans.| Getty First Republican senator breaks with GOP on tax bill Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said Wednesday that he does not support the current versions of the Senate and House GOPs tax bills becoming the first Republican senator to outright oppose the partys plan to overhaul the tax system.Johnson said in a statement that he objects to the bills' treatment of businesses known as pass-throughs, whose owners pay taxes on their companies through the individual side of the tax code.Story Continued Below These businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind.Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions," Johnson said."I do, however, look forward to working with my colleagues to address the disparity so I can support the final version.Johnson, a not-unfamiliar headache for GOP leaders, first made his opposition known to the Wall Street Journal.The senator, who co-founded a small manufacturing business before getting into politics, told the publication that he believes the Republican plan benefits corporations which will see their tax rates drop from 35 percent to 20 percent under the proposal over pass-throughs.I have no problems in making all American businesses competitive globally, Johnson told the Journal.This isnt anti-big corporation at all.When youre going to do a tax reform, you have to treat them equitably so they can maintain their competitive position here at home as were making them competitive globally.Johnsons concerns have been well telegraphed.He was visibly frustrated following the Senate Republican Conference meeting where GOP leaders unveiled the Senate tax reform bills broad strokes last week.Then, he told reporters he particularly objected to the bills treatment of pass-throughs, a broad range of businesses owned by a small group of people that can range from self-owned small businesses to the Trump Organization.I dont think what theyre doing with pass-throughs is the right approach, Johnson said following the meeting, though at the time he said he had no red lines.Earlier Wednesday, Johnson also complained to reporters on Capitol Hill about how Republican leadership has handled the tax overhaul efforts, saying: Its not a good process.The Wisconsin senator was similarly ornery during the battle earlier this year to repeal Obamacare, although he ultimately ended up voting in favor of the GOPs health care plans.Bernie Becker contributed to this report.
Tax bill teed up for House vote:::::Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has promised lawmakers that the House will go to conference with the Senate and that any outstanding concerns could be addressed there.| Win McNamee/Getty Images Tax bill teed up for House vote GOP leaders are confident they will pass the bill Thursday without needing much help from Trump.House Republicans are set to pass a sweeping rewrite of the tax code Thursday, bringing President Donald Trump and the GOP closer to the major legislative win they so desperately want.And leadership apparently barely lifted a finger to whip votes this week.Speaker Paul Ryan and his top lieutenants have been working behind the scenes on a few tax reform holdouts in recent days.But House Republicans think theyve already got enough votes lined up and have not needed to turn to Trump to flip opponents.Story Continued Below Republicans cleared a key procedural vote on the massive tax-cuts package Wednesday afternoon on a party-line vote.The final passage vote is expected soon after Trump rallies the GOP Conference at an 11:30 a.m. closed-door meeting in the Capitol on Thursday.Theres little room for error for Republicans.House Democrats have been working to keep their 194-member caucus together, not only to show unified opposition but to deny Republicans any opportunity to tout the bill as a bipartisan effort.Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, has been keeping close tabs on the Democratic Caucus most squishy members for months and recently redoubled his outreach to individuals who may be considering voting for the GOP plan.On Wednesday, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer predicted that not a single Democrat will vote for the tax package.I dont think well lose anybody, Hoyer told reporters.I think the consensus conclusion of almost every Democrat pro-business Democrat, conservative Democrat is that this bill is not good for the country, is not good for average working people.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.White House sources say they're focusing all their energy on the Senate, with little concern about the House vote.The House whip team has not had to turn to the president to move people from "no" to "yes" if only because most Republicans are so desperate for a legislative win.Thats a shift from a few months ago, when Trump persuaded wavering House members to pass legislation repealing Obamacare.Republicans can afford to lose only 22 GOP votes.Most of those opponents, House Republican sources say, will be lawmakers from high-tax states, including half the delegation from New York and most of New Jersey, and perhaps one or two from California.Those members constituents could see a tax increase under the GOP plan because the bill axes their most prized tax break: the state and local tax deduction.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California has been working to keep fellow California Republicans on board after Rep. Darrell Issa peeled off last week.Its unclear whether any other Golden State Republicans will join him in opposing the legislation, though sources say several are concerned about how the bill will affect their districts.Issa told reporters Wednesday that he expects "two or three" California Republicans to follow suit.Meanwhile, some conservatives are sulking over leaderships refusal to include a repeal of Obamacares individual mandate in the tax bill.GOP leaders originally argued that mixing controversial health care matters with taxes could kill the tax package, legislation they believe they must pass to save their majority in 2018.They speculated that the Senate would be unlikely to pass such legislation if the two were combined particularly because the upper chamber failed to rally around a single Obamacare replacement proposal.But on Tuesday, Senate Republicans added the mandate repeal to their bill, surprising House GOP leaders and causing envy among some rank-and-file House members.Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker of North Carolina tried to persuade House leaders Tuesday night to add the mandate repeal to the House bill, offering an amendment cosigned by 60 House Republicans during a Rules Committee hearing to combine the two issues.Leaders rebuffed him.Despite some unhappiness with the final House product, GOP leaders have been selling members on the House plan by arguing that the bill they pass Thursday will not be the final version that heads to Trumps desk.Ryan has promised lawmakers that the House will go to conference with the Senate and that any outstanding concerns could be addressed at that time.That argument appears to have won over a large swath of lawmakers.Conservatives who want the individual mandate in the bill are willing to wait.Others with more niche concerns like preserving the historic tax credit to renovate older buildings, or changes they want made to the small business tax cuts are similarly holding their fire.Thats still a few weeks away, as Senate Republicans are expected to vote on their tax bill after Thanksgiving.After Senate passage, GOP leaders in both chambers will appoint conferees to begin hashing out their differences, from the phase-in of the corporate tax cuts to how they handle high-tax areas.House Democrats, meanwhile, are working to keep members unified in opposition to the bill.The White House and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady had courted some Blue Dogs and other moderate Democrats since the spring, hoping to pick off a few when their bill eventually made it to the floor.Neal has met with each coalition within the caucus in recent months from the pro-business New Democrats to the Congressional Progressive Caucus to get a read on members.And in the two weeks since the House GOP bill was first introduced, he touched base with members considering supporting the plan, working them on the House floor or coordinating with other messengers to talk to them.In a coup for Democrats, the leaders of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition put out a statement Wednesday announcing their opposition to the bill.The group, whose 18 members were seen as the most likely defectors, cited the tax bills deficit-busting numbers as the ultimate reason they decided to oppose the plan.But privately, Democrats said they also were discouraged by Republicans promises of bipartisanship before shutting them out of every part of the process.I think this is probably one of the most hypocritical bills that Ive seen on the floor of the House of Representatives, Hoyer said.It is one of the most fiscally reckless bills that has been presented.And I think theres a consensus in our party that thats the case.
Six Democrats demand Trump impeachment hearings:::::Were calling upon the House to begin impeachment hearings, Rep. Steve Cohen said.| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Six Democrats demand Trump impeachment hearings A small group of House Democrats welcomed President Donald Trump back to Washington on Wednesday with a call for impeachment hearings.Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) told reporters that five other Democrats have signed on to his resolution to introduce five articles of impeachment against the president.Story Continued Below The Democrats charge that Trump obstructed justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey; that he has violated the Constitutions emoluments clause by continuing to frequent and profit from his businesses; and that he has undermined the federal judiciary and freedom of the press.Were calling upon the House to begin impeachment hearings, Cohen said.Its not a call for a vote.Its a call for hearings.Cohen acknowledged that he doesnt expect the House Judiciary Committee, which he accused of operating like a branch of the administration, to hold hearings but pledged to hold briefings with experts to highlight what he contends are the presidents impeachable offenses.A Republican House Judiciary Committee aide said in response, Under the Constitution, impeachment is an extraordinary remedy to remove certain elected officials from office who have committed high crimes and misdemeanors.Its the policy of the committee to consider impeachment articles if and when the constitutional criteria for impeachment exist.Michael Ahrens, a Republican National Committee spokesman, added that the Democrats are pursuing "a baseless radical effort" because they "lack a positive message."House Democratic leaders have tried to tamp down talk of impeachment, worried that the push will distract from their efforts to keep the spotlight on unpopular Republican policies and potentially alienate independent voters in swing districts who might see the idea as little more than a partisan witch hunt.Democratic leaders think continuously plugging their economic message something that has so far failed to break through nationally is the key to taking back the House next year.There are a large number of Democrats who believe this president ought to be impeached.We have just made the judgment that the facts arent there to pursue that, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.)told reporters Wednesday.And what we want to pursue, we dont want to distract [from] what is our focus.Despite leaderships position, Cohen was joined by Democratic lawmakers Luis Gutirrez of Illinois, Al Green of Texas and Adriano Espaillat of New York at a news conference inside the Capitol.He said Democratic Reps. Marcia Fudge of Ohio and John Yarmuth of Kentucky have also signed on to the resolution and signaled that at least a dozen others may join.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.He did, however, acknowledge political concerns within the Democratic Caucus, highlighting the split in the party over pursuing impeachment in the first year of Trumps presidency.Some Democrats just want Trump to hang himself and think that we dont need to help him, Cohen said.But I think there are a great number of Democrats who think there have been impeachable offenses.I think the majority of Democrats think that, and I know that there are Republicans who think that, too, but they are constrained by Trumps base.As for their own base, some Democrats are betting that the pursuit of impeachment will resonate with voters.Everywhere I go in my district people are calling for this, Espaillat said of impeachment.This is not a call in a vacuum.There is a real sentiment in the nation for this to begin.Cohen said he spoke briefly with Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer, who has launched a $10 million ad buy calling for Trumps impeachment, and to the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.He said he also called Pelosi (D-Calif.) immediately after the presidents widely panned response to a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August to inform her that he couldn't stand idly by.There are already sufficient facts in the public record that warrant the start of impeachment proceedings in Congress.Given the magnitude of this constitutional crisis, theres no reason to delay, Cohen said.I said after Charlottesville I was gonna bring impeachment charges.Ive waited three months.Heather Caygle contributed to this report.
Ivanka Trump scores win with Senate plan to double child tax credit:::::Alex Wong/Getty Images Ivanka Trump scores win with Senate plan to double child tax credit Ivanka Trump notched a policy victory late Tuesday night when the latest revisions to the Senate tax bill proposed doubling the child tax credit.Trump, the president's older daughter and a top White House adviser, had been advocating for months for such a change meeting with social conservatives to build a coalition, visiting Capitol Hill to talk with lawmakers and partnering on the issue with Republican Sens.Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, who first proposed this type of expansion in 2015.Story Continued Below The Senate bill, with the new changes made public Tuesday night by the Senate Finance Committee, would increase the child tax credit to $2,000 from the current credit of $1,000.The House version of the tax bill would increase it to $1,600.On Twitter on Wednesday morning, Rubio called the Senate provision a good step.Good news for working families, the Senate #TaxCut bill now has #ChildTaxCredit at 2K.We are making progress, he wrote.Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.One hiccup is that the expanded child tax credit in the Senate bill would be temporary, meaning it would expire in 2025 along with a number of other tax provisions for individuals.The reduced corporate tax rate of 20 percent would be permanent under both the Senate and House tax legislation.The Senate wrote the bill with this mix of temporary and permanent provisions to ensure it meets strict Senate budgetary rules, which could allow Republicans to pass a tax bill on a party-line vote.
McConnell predicts expulsion if Moore wins:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans say that Alabama Senate GOP candidate Roy Moore is virtually certain to face a formal ethics complaint which would lead to expulsion proceedings should he be elected next month.Its an outcome that senior Republicans say privately is all but unavoidable after the embattled Senate hopeful was accused of sexual misconduct, including with a 14-year-old girl.The former Alabama Supreme Court justice is refusing to leave the race.Story Continued Below McConnell initially outlined his thinking at his weekly leadership meeting earlier this week.The Kentucky Republican said if Moore is elected, he expects a senator to file an ethics complaint against Moore, according to multiple sources.That process would eventually lead to a vote on expelling him.One option that McConnell floated during the meeting was for a Democrat, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, to initiate the process by filing the complaint, according to the sources.Democrats are not entertaining that option before the Dec. 12 special election because the partys candidate, Doug Jones, could win.On Tuesday, McConnell didnt mince words about what Moore would be up against if he makes it to the Senate.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.If he were to be sworn in, he would immediately be in a process before the Senate Ethics Committee, McConnell said at a Wall Street Journal event.He would be sworn in and be asked to testify under oath and it would be a rather unusual beginning, probably an unprecedented beginning.That he is publicly warning a potential future Republican senator of ethics proceedings illustrates the no-win situation in which the GOP finds itself.But the party see no other option, except perhaps a write-in campaign by a well-known Republican in Alabama that would still risk splitting the GOP and handing the seat to Democrats.McConnell oversaw the effort to expel Bob Packwood in the late 1990s after numerous sexual harassment allegations against the Republican senator from Oregon.McConnell recounted that experience during the leadership meeting on Monday evening, according to the sources.The majority leader also publicly detailed his numerous conversations with the White House about the spiraling Moore scandal.President Donald Trump telephoned him from Vietnam on Friday, and McConnell spoke with White House chief of staff John Kelly on Saturday and Vice President Mike Pence on Monday.Theres no question theres a deep concern here, McConnell told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday.Roy Moore should step aside.The women whove come forward are entirely credible, hes obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate, and weve looked at all the options to try to prevent that from happening.McConnell stressed that obviously this close to the election, its a very complicated matter, and I think once the president and his team get back, well have further discussions about it.Expelling a senator would be unprecedented in the modern-day chamber.The last time it occurred was in 1862, when three senators were expelled for supporting the Confederacy.And there is concern that taking steps to expel a senator for actions before he was in the Senate would subvert the will of voters.Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was the first lawmaker to raise the expulsion possibility.Gardner didnt get the green light from McConnell before he issued his statement Monday advocating the move, according to GOP sources, though McConnell is clearly open to the idea.Though the Senate would be constitutionally required to seat Moore if hes elected, continuing service is another matter, McConnell said Tuesday.Democrats, who are sensing significant momentum behind their nominee, Jones, view the political mess surrounding Moore as solely the GOPs responsibility.They are not considering scenarios beyond the election of the former U.S. attorney in what would be a colossal upset.Republican officials are still exploring a write-in option; the candidate would have to be someone totally well-known and extremely popular, McConnell said at the Wall Street Journal event.Referring to Jeff Sessions, McConnell added: The Alabamian who would fit that standard would be the attorney general.Id like to save the seat, and its a heck of a dilemma, McConnell said.Its a very tough situation.Sessions has shown no public signs that he is interested in returning to the chamber, though other Senate Republicans have tossed out his name as an option.Others have urged Republican Sen. Luther Strange, the current occupant of the seat, to wage a write-in bid, but he has essentially ruled it out.Its really in the hands of the people of the state of Alabama, and thats where it should be, Strange said in a brief interview Tuesday.Other Senate Republicans stressed that no matter how it happens, the controversial justice should not be allowed to stay in their ranks.He should not be in the United States Senate.Period, beginning and end, said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).Lorraine Woellert contributed to this report.
Trump faces wrenching call on Moore:::::President Donald Trump is returning from Asia to a political maelstrom in the United States one that could force him to decide whether to push out Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a Hail Mary attempt to save the Alabama Senate seat Sessions once held.Trump spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from Asia last week, and the Senate leader made an urgent plea: Please help push Moore out of the contest.On Monday, as a new female accuser emerged, the Republican leader discussed the Alabama situation with White House chief of staff John Kelly and Vice President Mike Pence.The conversation centered on tax reform, but the Senate Republican leader also proposed a dramatic idea: that Sessions run as a write-in candidate or be appointed to the seat he held for two decades.Story Continued Below White House officials plan to convene a meeting to talk through their options soon, and Trump is widely expected to address the predicament publicly when he returns from abroad.In order for the president to get involved, some aides to the president say, he would need an airtight plan that limits his political exposure to any fallout.Its a vexing call for Trump.If he tries to pressure Moore out of the race, as some people close to the White House expect him to do, theres no guarantee that the candidate will oblige.During the GOP nomination battle, Trump aggressively backed Moores opponent, appointed Sen. Luther Strange.Moore, a former state Supreme Court justice who once defied a federal order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from a state judicial building, may feel that he owes the president little.Intervening in a race against the candidate backed by conservative activists could also be seen as at odds with Trumps own insurgent campaign in 2016.Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Some of the presidents most loyal backers in the conservative state were angered by his decision to get behind the establishment-friendly Strange and desperately want him to stay out of the race.The establishment did everything they could to destroy Trump, and we the people stood with him.It would be very disappointing to see Trump believe these lies and turn on a rock-solid conservative like Roy Moore, said GOP state Rep. Ed Henry.McConnell and his political team have other ideas.One option being batted around by the leaders allies is having the state Republican Party withdraw Moores nomination and then have Sessions, an outsize figure in Alabama politics who served as senator for two decades, run as a write-in.Speaking at a Wall Street Journal/CEO Council event in Washington on Tuesday, McConnell was explicit that Moore would likely face expulsion proceedings if he were to win.As for the write-in possibility, McConnell said any candidate would have to be totally well-known and extremely popular.The Alabamian who would fit that standard would be the attorney general, McConnell said, referring to Sessions.Several Republican senators have appealed to Sessions in the recent days, asking him to save them from the prospect of a Democrat taking over his old seat.Sessions, however, has expressed a desire to stay on as attorney general, according to several people familiar with his thinking.And one White House official expressed concern that, in the event Moore would not withdraw, a Sessions bid would serve only to split the Republican vote and hand a win to Democratic candidate Doug Jones.But Sessions could have little choice in the matter if Trump pressures him to return to the Senate.Some Sessions allies believe that swooping in to save his old Senate seat would give him the chance to make a graceful exit from his current role, where his relationship with the president has soured.He has stood by as Trump has publicly derided him for recusing himself from the Justice Departments Russia investigation.In recent days, Sessions has privately expressed dismay at how much of a mess the race for his old seat has become, said one person close to him.Appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the attorney general said he trusted the accounts of Moores accusers.I have no reason to doubt these young women, he told the panel.Since the allegations surfaced on Thursday, the White House has been quietly examining its options.Counselor Kellyanne Conway has been in touch with Alabama Gov.Kay Iveys office to discuss possible paths forward.And political director Bill Stepien has spoken with Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel.On Tuesday, the RNC withdrew its support from Moore.Theres frustration with McConnell in some corners of the White House.Three administration officials said the leader erred by publicly calling for Moore to drop out, saying all it did was give the beleaguered candidate more grist to portray himself as a victim of a Republican Party establishment trying to run him out of the race.McConnell openly acknowledged Tuesday the jam he and other Republicans are in.A Moore loss would shrink the partys already slim Senate majority.But a write-in candidacy would be a long shot, and expelling Moore once hes seated could trigger an uprising on the right.Id like to save the seat, and its a heck of dilemma, he said.Its a very tough situation.
Limbaugh: Moore was a Democrat at time of sexual misconduct allegations:::::Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh on Tuesday criticized Republicans for distancing themselves from Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, while saying that Moore was a Democrat at the time he allegedly engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls.Did you know that before 1992, when a lot of this was going on, that Judge Moore was a Democrat?Limbaugh said on his radio show.Nobody said a word.When he supposedly was attracted to inappropriately-aged girls he was a Democrat, Limbaugh added.ADVERTISEMENT Limbaugh also went after Republicans who have called on Moore to step aside from the race.No matter what the real stories are here, and no matter what the evidence is, these guys, these people on the Republican side, are making it clear they are going to prevent this guy from ever being seated in the United States Senate, Limbaugh said.Moore earned an appointment to the circuit trial court in Etowah County in 1992 after switching his political affiliation from Democrat to Republican, according to Politico.Limbaughs remarks come after a fifth woman on Monday accused Moore of sexual misconduct when she was a minor.Beverly Young Nelson said that Moore, who was serving as the Etowah County district attorney, sexually assaulted her in a diner parking lot in 1977, when she was a 16-year-old high school student.Nelsons allegations followed those in a bombshell Washington Post report last week in which four woman accused Moore of sexual misconduct, including one who accused Moore of inappropriate touching when she was 14 and he was 32.Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them completely false.Prominent Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the Alabama Senate race to fill Sen.

Volvo pulls its ads from Hannity after Moore coverage:::::Volvo has pulled its advertisements from Sean Hannitys show on Fox News after his coverage of sexual misconduct allegations made against Roy Moore.We have spoken with our media agency and have advised them to cease advertising on the show.Volvo Car USA (@VolvoCarUSA) November 13, 2017 Volvo is the latest advertiser to pull its ads from "Hannity" in the wake of the prime-time host's coverage of Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women.Keurig and Realtor.com both said they were pulling their ads in recent days.Last week, The Washington Post published an investigative report in which four women claimed Moore pursued relationships with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one who said Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14.A fifth woman came forward Monday to accuse Moore of sexually abusing her when she was 16.ADVERTISEMENT None of the advertisers said they were pulling their ads because of Hannitys coverage of the allegations.However, the decisions come amid an online campaign targeting advertisers for Hannitys show.Hannity said on his show Thursday that viewers shouldnt rush to judgement against Moore.Every single person in this country deserves the presumption of innocence, Hannity said.With the allegations against Judge Moore, none of us know the truth of what happened 38 years ago.The only people that would know are the people involved in this incident.The Fox News host added that Moore should step aside and leave the Senate race if the allegations are true.Hannity has also interviewed Moore on his radio program after the news broke.Moore denied the Post's report that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, but admitted that he may have dated teenagers in his 30s.
Fox News host tore into Sessions in private meeting with Trump: report:::::During a private meeting with President Trump, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro reportedly tore into Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsCurtis wins Chaffetz's former Utah House seat Overnight Cybersecurity: What we learned from Carter Page's House Intel testimony | House to mark up foreign intel reform law | FBI can't access Texas shooter's phone | Sessions to testify at hearing amid Russia scrutiny FBI cant unlock Texas shooters phone MORE for his refusal thus far to appoint a special prosecutor to probe former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the Uranium One deal.The New York Times reported Tuesday that Pirro met with Trump early this month, during which she "excoriated" the attorney general for not investigating Clinton, Trump's Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential race.The report follows weeks of critical coverage on Pirro's show, "Justice with Judge Jeanine," and elsewhere on Fox, of the 2016 deal that allowed a Russian nuclear agency to purchase Uranium One, a Canadian company that owns access to uranium in the U.S. Clinton ran the State Department under former President Obama when the deal was approved by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.Pirro has also called for an investigation into reports that former FBI Director James Comey began drafting a letter exonerating Clinton from wrongdoing for her use of a private email server while at the State Department months before the investigation concluded.ADVERTISEMENT Jeff Sessions needs to follow his prosecutorial instincts and open a federal criminal investigation into the actions of Hillary Rodham Clinton and impanel a grand jury immediately, Pirro said in a September episode of her show."This woman should not get a free pass because she lost an election.Her reign was one of bold, brazen in your face pay-to-play corruption."In a statement to the Times, Pirro confirmed that she had merely repeated these sentiments to Trump during their meeting.Everything I said to President Trump is exactly what Ive vocalized on my show, Justice with Jeanine,'" she told the newspaper.Sessions was confirmed in February after several contentious hearings.Previously, he served as a Republican senator from Alabama.Trump himself has downplayed the likelihood that his administration will investigate Clinton, calling the 2016 election cycle "vicious."Look, I want to move forward, I dont want to move back, Trump said in November 2016.And I dont want to hurt the Clintons.I really dont.She went through a lot.And suffered greatly in many different ways.And I am not looking to hurt them at all.
FBI seeks Senate documents, signaling possible probe into sale of fetal tissue:::::The FBI has asked the Senate for unredacted documents it obtained from abortion providers, signaling agents may be investigating whether Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers illegally sold fetal tissue and body parts, according to sources familiar with the document request.The request was made in recent days, the sources said, to the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleySenators push mandatory sexual harassment training for members, staff Senate panel to hold hearing on bump stocks, background checks Senate panel to hold hearing on bump stocks MORE (R-Iowa), last December referred Planned Parenthood and several other abortion providers to the FBI for investigation after a lengthy probe into the transfers of fetal tissue.Grassley said at the time that his committee had uncovered enough evidence in its final investigative report to show abortion providers had transferred tissue and body parts from aborted fetuses to firms for use in research by charging dollar amounts above their actual costs.ADVERTISEMENT Abortion providers are allowed under a 1993 law to transfer fetal tissue for research at a cost equal to the price of obtaining it, but are not allowed to sell it at a profit.The Justice Department declined comment, saying it does not confirm nor deny whether an investigation is taking place.A spokesman for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Planned Parenthood said that while it is aware of Grassleys prior request for a criminal probe, none of its affiliates has had any contact with the FBI.It noted it provided more than 30,000 pages of documents and several witnesses to the congressional probes and believes it has complied with the law.Planned Parenthood strongly disagrees with the recommendations of the Senate Republican staff to refer this matter to the Justice Department, especially in light of the fact that investigations by three other Congressional committees, and investigations in 13 states including a Grand Jury in Texas, have all shown that Planned Parenthood did nothing wrong, said Dana Singiser, Vice President of Government Affairs for Planned Parenthood Federation of America.These accusations are baseless, and a part of a widely discredited attempt to end access to reproductive health care at Planned Parenthood.Planned Parenthood has never, and would never, profit while facilitating its patients choice to donate fetal tissue for use in important medical research, she added.The Senate probe and a similar investigation by the House were prompted by the public release in 2015 of several undercover videos from an anti-abortion group showing abortion providers or fetal tissue firms discussing how they took money for aborted fetuses.The Senate committee conducted interviews and gathered documents on its own as part of an investigation triggered by the videos.It is that information, including the unredacted documents Senate Judiciary gathered from abortion providers and fetal tissue firms, that was requested by the FBI, the sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity.The report documents the failure of the Department of Justice, across multiple administrations, to enforce the law that bans the buying and selling of human fetal tissue, Grassley wrote last December when he asked the FBI and Justice Department to investigate Planned Parenthood and other abortion and fetal tissue providers.It also documents substantial evidence suggesting that the specific entities involved in the recent controversy, and/or individuals employed by those entities, may have violated that law.Grassley staff is working to comply with the FBIs document request in compliance with Senate rules, sources said.One option would be for FBI agents to be allowed to come to the committees reading room and review the documents.A full Senate vote would be required if copies of the documents needed to be transferred to a grand jury, according to a source directly familiar with Senate document procedures.Lila Rose, a prominent anti-abortion activist, praised the FBIs document request.We, of course, applaud any action taken to follow the evidence to where it leads and to hold Planned Parenthood accountable, she said.The only thing that could hinder this investigation from leading to indictments of Planned Parenthood and the companies involved in the sale of fetal body parts is politics.The advent of a criminal investigation into abortion providers would mark a major escalation in a controversy ignited by undercover videotapes made by an anti-abortion group back in 2015.The Center for Medical Progress, which released the videos, saw two of its executives charged with state privacy violations for making the undercover tapes.The charges were dropped in Texas but remain pending in California, where they are being appealed.The group denies any wrongdoing.The centers head, David Daleiden, said Monday that an FBI probe is long overdue and that the sale of aborted baby body parts is the greatest human atrocity of our times and must finally be brought to justice under the law.The Senate report concluded that the prices paid for tissue and body parts exceeded the actual costs, and that in some cases such costs werent even calculated until after investigators began asking questions.In one example cited by the Senate report, a firms own records show it paid $60 for an aborted fetus from a Planned Parenthood clinic, then transferred the various parts for $2,275 including the brain for $325, two eyes for $650, and a part of a liver for $325.The firm also charged additional fees for shipping and disease screening, the report said.The companies involved in transferring fetal tissue have been free to receive substantial payment with impunity, relying on an expansive interpretation of the exception to the ban on buying and selling fetal tissue, the report said.Some of the companies involved in the transactions had not, in fact, conducted any analysis of their costs when setting fees, and their post ad hoc accounting rationalization invoked a bevy of indirect and tenuously related costs in an attempt to justify their fees, the report added.
Fox News's Shepard Smith hits Trump for 'inaccurate' claims on Uranium One deal:::::Fox News host Shepard Smith blasted President Trump on Tuesday for inaccurate claims about the Uranium One agreement following Trumps repeated calls for the Justice Department to investigate the deal.On his show, Smith laid out the controversy surrounding the Obama-era deal, which involved the sale of a uranium company that did some mining in the United States to a Russian company.Heres the accusation: Nine people involved in the deal made donations to the Clinton Foundation totaling more than $140 million, Smith said.In exchange, Secretary of State [Hillary] Clinton approved the sale to the Russians a quid pro quo.ADVERTISEMENT The accusation [was] first made by Peter Schweizer, the senior editor at large of the website Breitbart, in his 2015 book, Clinton Cash, Smith continued.The next year, candidate Donald Trump Donald John TrumpDems win from coast to coast Falwell after Gillespie loss: 'DC should annex' Northern Virginia Dems see gains in Virginia's House of Delegates MORE cited the accusation as an example of Clinton corruption.Smith then played a clip from a June 2016 speech Trump gave in New York City in which he repeated the claim.Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGOP rushes to cut ties to Moore Papadopoulos was in regular contact with Stephen Miller, helped edit Trump speech: report Bannon jokes Clinton got her ass kicked in 2016 election MOREs State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of Americas uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation, Trump said in the speech.Smith called the statement "inaccurate in a number of ways.""The Clinton State Department had no power to approve or veto that transaction.It could do neither," the Fox News host noted.Smith then laid out the approval process for the sale, which involves a nine-person committee made up of the heads of federal agencies, and noted that no one person could approve or veto the deal only former President Obama could do either.The Fox News anchor also detailed Trumps claim that the Clinton Foundation received money after the deal was completed.Here, the timing is inaccurate, Smith said, noting that the source of the majority of the donations, Frank Giustra, said he sold his stake in the uranium company before the company was sold and before Clinton became secretary of State.The accusation is predicated on the charge that Secretary Clinton approved the sale, Smith said.She did not.A committee of nine evaluated the sale, the president approved the sale, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and others had to offer permits, and none of the uranium was exported for use by the U.S. to Russia.That is Uranium One.Trump has repeatedly called on the Justice Department to investigate Clinton, saying earlier this month that he was very unhappy that federal officials were not investigating her."Hopefully they are doing something," Trump said of the Justice Department probing Clinton during a radio interview with host Larry O'Connor on Washington's WMAL."At some point maybe we're going to all have it out."In recent weeks, Republican lawmakers have called for a second special counsel to be appointed to investigate matters involving Clinton, including the Uranium One deal.But Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsCurtis wins Chaffetz's former Utah House seat Overnight Cybersecurity: What we learned from Carter Page's House Intel testimony | House to mark up foreign intel reform law | FBI can't access Texas shooter's phone | Sessions to testify at hearing amid Russia scrutiny FBI cant unlock Texas shooters phone MORE on Tuesday pushed back on the immediate need for a new special counsel during an appearance on Capitol Hill, saying it would take a factual basis that meets the standards of a special counsel to appoint a new investigator."We will use the proper standards and thats the only thing I can tell you, Mr. Jordan," Sessions said in a heated exchange with Rep.

Cruz pulls support from Moore: Allegations merit criminal prosecution if true:::::Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOvernight Finance: GOP criticism of tax bill grows, but few no votes | Highlights from day two of markup | House votes to overturn joint-employer rule | Senate panel approves North Korean banking sanctions GOP criticism of tax bill grows, but few ready to vote against it Anti-gay marriage county clerk Kim Davis to seek reelection in Kentucky MORE on Monday withdrew his support from Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore, saying allegations of sexual misconduct should be looked at by prosecutors.As it stands, I cant urge the people of Alabama to support a campaign in the face of these charges without serious, persuasive demonstration that the charges are not true, the Texas Republican told reporters, according to a Texas Tribune reporter.Both last week and this week, there are serious charges of criminal conduct that if true, not only make him unfit to serve in the Senate but merit criminal prosecution, he added.ADVERTISEMENT Cruzs statement came hours after a fifth woman came forward during a press conference and accused Moore of sexual misconduct when she was a minor.Beverly Young Nelson alleges that Moore, who was serving as the Etowah County district attorney, sexually assaulted her in a diner parking lot in 1977, when she was a 16-year-old high school student.Nelson said she felt empowered to come forward after The Washington Post reported last week on four other women who also claim Moore pursued a relationship with them when they were minors.The bombshell report detailed the account of Leigh Corfman, now 53, who says Moore made unwanted sexual advances with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.Cruz joined a number of Republican senators distancing themselves from Moore.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell expects Paul to return to Senate next week Former Hill staff calls for mandatory harassment training Gaming the odds of any GOP tax bill getting signed into law MORE (R-Ky.) on Monday led several senators in calling for Moore to drop out of the race, and Sen.

Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanGOP criticism of tax bill grows, but few ready to vote against it WATCH: Bipartisan support grows to rein in government surveillance law GOP rep: Trump did not make a good deal on debt ceiling MORE (R-Ohio), a leading voice among House conservatives, that it would take a factual basis that meets the standard of a special counsel for the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor.ADVERTISEMENT We will use the proper standards and thats the only thing I can tell you, Mr. Jordan, Sessions said.You can have your idea, but sometimes we have to study what the facts are and to evaluate whether it meets the standards it requires.Sessions on Tuesday did not entirely close the door to a probe and later clarified that he had made no prejudgment on the need for a new special counsel.He testified that he has directed senior Justice Department prosecutors to evaluate the concerns raised by conservatives including whether any merit the appointment of a special counsel.But it was apparent throughout the five-and-a-half-hour hearing that his refusal so far to appoint a special prosecutor is frustrating Republicans.House Judiciary Committee Chairman

stymied demands for a special counsel and Sessionss decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department's Russia probe, which has soured his relationship with President Trump.You have recused yourself from matters stemming from the 2016 election, but there are significant concerns that the partisanship of the FBI and the department has weakened the ability of each to act objectively, Goodlatte said.As special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has escalated, Sessions has come under pressure from Trump himself to take action against Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.On Nov. 3, shortly before leaving for a nearly two-week trip to Asia, Trump told reporters that the Justice Department should be looking at Clinton and the Democrats.Asked if he would fire Sessions if the Justice Department didnt have agents investigate the Democratic National Committee, Trump responded, I dont know.A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me, he said.House Republicans have urged Justice to investigate putative wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation, as well as the 2010 sale of a Toronto-based uranium company with U.S. holdings to a Russian state-owned firm a sale Trump has also repeatedly highlighted.They have also demanded a probe into how the Obama Justice Department handled the investigation into Clintons private email server, something the department's inspector general is currently investigating.Conservative media has amplified the pressure on Sessions, setting up a drumbeat of demands for a second special prosecutor.It all made for a grueling day for the beleaguered attorney general.The sudden pressure from Republicans along with hours of tough questions from Democrats on alleged discrepancies in his previous congressional testimonies left Sessions on the defensive and highlighted his perilous standing in the administration.The appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the presidents political opponents would almost certainly raise questions about the Justice Departments political independence something Sessions and the DOJ appear to be worried about.You must know the Department will never evaluate any matter except on the facts and the law, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a Monday letter alerting Goodlatte of the internal review.Professionalism, integrity, and public confidence in the Department's work is critical for us, and no priority is higher.Democrats have slammed even the suggestion of a new special counsel as a partisan move that reflected a dangerous acquiescence to political demands from the president.Sessions rejected a fiery argument from Jordan that it sure looks like a major political party was working with the federal government so they could then get a warrant to spy on President Trumps campaign.I would say looks like is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel, Sessions said sharply.He later said that the he did not mean to suggest I was taking a side one way or the other on that subject.I was simply responding that we would have to have full details before we made a decision on whether or not a special counsel is required, he said.While the internal review process Sessions revealed in the Monday letter could theoretically lead to the appointment of a new special counsel, it could also result in a recommendation from career attorneys to dismiss the matter a notion that gained some steam after Tuesdays testimony.I think this letter is best understood not as a hint to Trump that Sessions will do as the President wants, but as a way of shunting the matter to a mechanism that will enable him not to act, noted Benjamin Wittes, a confidant of former FBI Director James Comey and editor of the national security blog Lawfare.Should Justice move to open an investigation related to Clinton, it remains an open question whether Sessions would recuse himself, as he has done from the Mueller probe.The attorney general during his confirmation hearing in the Senate committed to stepping aside from any investigations related to the Democratic presidential candidate.I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it, he told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleySenators push mandatory sexual harassment training for members, staff Senate panel to hold hearing on bump stocks, background checks Senate panel to hold hearing on bump stocks MORE (R-Iowa) at the time.Grassley pressed him to clarify: You intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email investigation and any matters involving the Clinton Foundation, if there are any?Yes, Sessions responded.He declined to answer questions Tuesday regarding whether he has recused himself from any investigation related to Clinton, arguing that a yes-or-no answer would run afoul of Justice Department regulations requiring absolute silence about ongoing probes.House Republicans are still moving forward with their own investigations in the wake of Trumps clarion call that they do something.Absent action from Justice, Goodlatte said Tuesday, his committee had no choice but to open their own investigation announced late last month into the department's handling of the Clinton investigation.But proponents of a special counsel still left Tuesdays hearing dissatisfied.Last night, you sort of lean to the fact that they were genuinely considering a special counsel, Jordan told The Hill after the hearing.After his he seemed to get a little fired up when I was asking my questions I tend to think theyre leaning against that, he said.
Lawmakers describe pervasive sexual harassment on Capitol Hill:::::Efforts to combat sexual harassment on Capitol Hill gained momentum on Tuesday as female lawmakers shared stories of male colleagues engaging in predatory behavior.Lawmakers in both parties had already expressed support for mandatory sexual harassment awareness training, which is currently voluntary for legislative branch staffers.But they went further in a House Administration Committee hearing on Capitol Hills harassment policies and said even more can be done in a male-dominated workplace where sexual harassment can be pervasive.Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), in testimony before the panel, said at least two current members of Congress have engaged in sexual harassment.ADVERTISEMENT In fact, there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, right now, who serve, who have been subject to review or not have been subject to review, but have engaged in sexual harassment," said Speier, who declined to name the male lawmakers.Rep. Barbara Comstock Barbara Jean ComstockWilson endorses Foxx as next House Education chairman House transfers DC Metro board appointments to DOT Dems target DC-area GOP rep on Metro funding MORE (R-Va.) offered another example.She shared a story of a male lawmaker still in Congress who asked a young female staffer to bring materials to his residence.He opened the door dressed in only a towel, invited her inside and proceeded to expose himself.The staffer subsequently quit her job.That kind of situation, what are we doing here for women right now who are dealing with somebody like that?Comstock asked.Speier had previously shared her own experience of having a chief of staff forcibly kiss her when she was working as a congressional staffer in the 1970s.Since then, Speier said shes received a multitude of calls to her office from people sharing their own stories of sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.Those stories ranged from comments asking Are you going to be a good girl?to harassers exposing their genitals and grabbing private parts on the House floor.Rep. Linda Snchez (D-Calif.), a member of the House Democratic leadership, told The Associated Press earlier this month that a male colleague had ogled her and touched her inappropriately on the House floor when she first began serving in Congress.Snchez declined to name the lawmaker when asked about the incident on Tuesday.She never filed an official complaint, but learned to avoid being near him.Since then, Snchez told reporters, shes advised newer members to do the same.When you are new to a workplace, you dont always understand what the policies and procedures are, or what the avenues for reporting those kinds of incidences are, Snchez said.Now I know you can file an ethics complaint, she added.Now, of course, through hindsight, we can look at the Harvey Weinstein [case], and you see hundreds of women who have very similar stories.You can see a pattern; when its happening to you, you dont have the benefit of the 30,000 foot view.None of the three female lawmakers accused any of their colleagues by name of sexual harassment.Comstock said she heard the story secondhand and did not know the lawmakers identity, only that he is still a member of Congress.Yet she acknowledged it's hard to hold harassers accountable to their constituents if no one will name them publicly.Thats up to the victim, is the problem, Comstock said after the House Administration Committee hearing, suggesting that women often dont feel comfortable coming forward until they feel like theres comfort in numbers.Theres that blaming that women do.Theres did I ask for it?Speier plans to introduce legislation this week to overhaul the process available for staff to file harassment complaints.Under the current system run through the Office of Compliance, staffers must go through months of mediation and counseling with the employing office before they can file a formal complaint.They must also sign nondisclosure agreements.If staffers do go forward with a complaint, they can either file it in court or seek an administrative hearing that leads to negotiations for a settlement.Such settlements are paid out by a fund operated by the Treasury Department.Rep.

Sessions pushes back on calls for Clinton special counsel:::::ADVERTISEMENT "We will use the proper standards and thats the only thing I can tell you, Mr. Jordan," Sessions said."You can have your idea but sometimes we have to study what the facts are and to evaluate whether it meets the standards it requires."Jordan made a fiery case for allegations of improper spying on the Trump campaign by the Obama administration Department of Justice that widely was touted amongst Capitol Hill Republicans."We know one fact.We know the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the dossier," he said."And it sure looks like the FBI was paying the author of that document and it sure looks like a major political party was working with the federal government to then turn an opposition research document the equivalent of some National Enquirer story into an intelligence document to take that to the FISA Court so they could then get a warrant to spy on President Trumps campaign," Jordan said."Thats what it looks like and Im asking you, in addition to all the things we know about James Comey in 2016, doesnt that warrant naming a second special counsel?"he said.Sessions at first demurred, noting that Comey is no longer the director of the FBI and praising the current director, Chris Wray.But pressed further by Jordan "He's not here today, Attorney General Sessions, and you are" Sessions appeared to throw cold water on the immediate need for a special counsel."I would say 'looks like' is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel," he said sharply.
Poll: Most Americans Don't Like the Republican Tax Reform Plan:::::American voters oppose the Republican tax reform plan by a two-to-one margin, according to a new poll.A poll released by Quinnipiac on Wednesday found that 52% of Americans disapprove of the GOP tax plan, while 25% approve.Opinion of the tax plan was heavily split along party lines 60% of Republican voters approve of the plan, while 81% of Democrats disapprove.More voters (35%) thought the plan would increase their taxes rather than decrease their taxes (16%), while 36% said the plan would not have much of an impact.And a majority of voters (52%) said they did not believe the tax plan would cause an increase in jobs or economic growth.Republicans have said the plan will simplify the tax code and reduce taxes overall, but Democrats and interest groups representing small business owners, teachers and graduate students, among others, have slammed the proposal.An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that high-income households would see the largest cuts.The poll conducted from Nov. 7 to Nov. 13 surveyed 1,577 voters nationwide by phone and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
How Repealing the Obamacare Mandate Changes Tax Reform:::::Senate Republicans are including a repeal of the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate in their pending tax reform plan but it could complicate its chances of passing.The GOP says that scrapping the provision, which forces people who do not purchase health coverage to pay a tax penalty, would be good for the middle and low income families they say they want to help under the tax plan.The change would also make it easier on Senate, which is trying to keep costs of the plan low in order to get the bill passed under a process known as reconciliation repealing the mandate would save the federal government an estimated $338 billion.Thats a big deal considering they have to keep the cost of the plan, which includes changes to the individual tax rates and a corporate tax cut, under $1.5 trillion.The stakes are high Republicans are desperate for a big legislative win ahead of midterm elections but in mixing health care and tax reform, two hot-button campaign promises, the Senate is taking a bit of a risk.For starters, the Senate has already failed to pass health care reform this year.In opposing health care proposals when they came up, a handful of Republican Senators objected to the impact they would have had on health care costs.It appears the repeal of the individual mandate under the tax reform plan could have the same effect.The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have estimated that while deficits would dip, premiums would increase by 10% throughout most of the next decade if the mandate is repealed though the markets would largely remain stable.In the first year, four million fewer people would be insured, according to the CBO, and 13 million people would be without insurance by the end of the decade.The people dropping coverage would generally be healthier than average so that would raise premiums for individual market coverage because the average cost to people in the individual market would now be higher, says Matthew Fielder of the Brookings Institution.Even if they opted out of buying insurance because they are relatively healthy, some of those newly uninsured people could still get sick.Without coverage, though, they might not be able to pay for the care they need when they go to the hospital.Thats a situation where the rest of the health care system is now stuck holding the bag for those folks costs, he says.Repealing the individual mandate under the tax bill could also pose a challenge, Fielder says, because the savings wouldnt be used to clean up the mess that repealing the mandate would create in the insurance market.Here, the savings from repealing the mandate are being used to finance tax cuts that will overwhelmingly flow to people at the top of the income distribution, he says.I, at least, find it hard to understand why thats an attractive trade.Most Republicans do not like the mandate and theyve tried to scrap it repeatedly.Americans arent huge fans of it either some 6.5 million people opted to pay the penalty instead of getting insurance in 2016.On Capitol Hill on Wednesday, several Senators indicated they do not believe the individual mandate repeal would be a poison pill.I dont think thats going to have an affect on peoples opinions, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said.Its a tax on moderate to low income people, said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.Youre making a person pay a tax when theyre not making a choice that you want them to make.Graham said though, that once the individual mandate is repealed, Republicans would need to do something about the Affordable Care Act.You could make an argument that Obamacare is falling of its own weight until we repeal the individual mandate, he said.Then there is absolutely no excuse for us not to replace Obamacare because weve changed the fundamental principal of Obamacare.I hope every Republican knows that when you pass a repeal of the individual mandate its no longer their problem.It becomes your problem.Graham said a solution to that problem could come in the form of the health care proposal he and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana introduced earlier this fall.Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, who worked on a bipartisan measure to address health care challenges with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, said his bill also provides an opportunity.He said he and Senate leadership have discussed if that proposal, known as the Alexander-Murray plan, could be folded into an end-of-the-year spending plan.If we pass the Alexander-Murray bill we will be able to go home and say we reduced premiums in 2018, we reduced premiums in 2019 and weve given states more flexibility, Alexander said Wednesday.Still, there is some skepticism among Republicans.Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who cast one of the three deciding votes against this summers attempted skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act, said that while she is not a fan of the individual mandate and wants to see tax reform passed, she thinks mixing the two in one plan complicates things.I believe taxes are too high.I believe the current codes creates disincentives for the creation of jobs and encourages jobs to be created overseas, she said.I think individual middle income Americans need a tax break and that all of that would help stimulate the economy.I think this bill is a mixture of some very good provisions and some provisions that I consider to be big mistakes.The Senate can only afford to lose two votes on the bill in order for it to get through the body under reconciliation, a process that only requires a simple majority to pass.So far, at least one Republican Senator has already indicated hes a no Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said Wednesday that he does not like how pass-through entities are treated in both the House and Senate versions of the bill and therefore cannot support them in their current form.Other key Senators, including Bob Corker and John McCain, have yet to explicitly say whether or not they will vote for the bill.Any hopes of getting Democratic support seemed to fly out the window when the change was introduced.This bill seems to get worse by the hour, said Senator Ron Wyden, the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, said Wednesday.Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania called the tax reform process an insult to the country and the effort to include the repeal in the bill destructive on Wednesday afternoon.Theyre slapping it on to the tax bill hoping that they can rush it through and no one will notice before we can get the word out that 13 million people will lose their health care, he said.There could be an overlap between people losing their health care and people getting their tax increased in the same year from the same bill, he added.Its terrible on the substance but the process is making it worse.
Roy Moore: Sixth Woman Accuses Him of Sexual Misconduct:::::Another woman came forward on Wednesday to accuse Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, saying he groped her in 1991 after she met with him in his law office to discuss custody of her children.Tina Johnson told AL.com that Moore grabbed her buttocks as she was leaving his office behind her mother.Johnson was 28 at the time, and they had met with Moore to sign over custody of her 12-year-old son to her mother.He didnt pinch it; he grabbed it, she told AL.com, adding that Moore had made her uncomfortable during their meeting as well.He kept commenting on my looks, telling me how pretty I was, how nice I looked, she said.He was saying that my eyes were beautiful.Johnson is the sixth woman to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.She is the first woman to accuse Moore of touching her inappropriately while he was married.Moore has dismissed the allegations as lies and smears.If you are a liberal and hate Judge Moore, apparently he groped you.If you are a conservative and love Judge Moore, you know these allegations are a political farce, a campaign spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday night.Twelve women who have dated and worked closely with the Judge came out tonight to affirm his proven character, and you are going to see hundreds of women who really know him step forth in support of him.
Roy Moore's Campaign Wants Experts to Analyze One of His Accuser's Yearbooks:::::The embattled campaign of Alabama Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore wants one of his accusers to hand over her yearbook so experts can verify the authenticity of the candidates signature.On November 13, Beverly Young Nelson held a press conference with her attorney Gloria Allred, alleging that Moore had assaulted her in 1977 when she was 16 and working at a restaurant that he frequented as a District Attorney.Nelson noted that, before the assault happened, Moore would often pull her hair and complement her looks, and had signed her yearbook.At the press conference, Allred held up a copy that yearbook.The signature read to a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas.Love Roy Moore, D.A.Moore denied the allegations in a brief press conference Monday, saying he did not know who Nelson was.I dont know anything about her.I dont even know where the restaurant is or was, Moore said Monday.Jauregui also said that, even though Nelson said she had no contact with Moore after the incident, Moore was the attorney assigned to her divorce case in 1999.On Wednesday, Moores attorney, Phillip L. Jauregui, said that Allred needs to release that yearbook so the signature can be verified by a handwriting expert, arguing that a digital copy will not suffice.Everything on that page, they said was written by Judge Moore, said Jauregui.Now Judge Moore not only has denied everything she said before but now flatly denies that.And he says its not true.We have a handwriting expert thats looking at those.But heres the problem.A handwriting expert cant look at a copy on the internet, right?Theyve got to look at the original.The campaign has sent an official letter to Allred demanding the release of the yearbook, Jauregui said.Allred said in a statement that she had sent letters the Senate Judiciary and Ethics Committee asking that they hold public hearings where both Nelson and Moore would testify.Should that occur, she said, she would agree to have the yearbook examined by an independent party.
A Republican Poll Shows Roy Moore Way Down in the Alabama Senate Race:::::Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has come under fire from fellow Republicans in recent days after allegations emerged that he pursued teenage girls when he was in his thirties.And a poll from his own party shows that hes losing support.A new poll from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans, has Moore trailing his Democratic opponent Doug Jones by 12 points, percentage points, 51% to 39%, according to data obtained by TIME.The poll was first reported by Politico.The poll was conducted among 500 registered voters.November 12 and 13, three and four days after the Washington Post published its story detailing accounts from four women about the way Mooore pursued them when they were teenagers.Also on November 13, a fifth accuser, Beverly Young Nelson, came forward with allegations that Moore had assaulted her when she was sixteen and he was a District Attorney.Data from a NRSC survey conducted in the beginning of October showed Moore leading Jones by sixteen percentage points, 53%to 37%, with 10% of voters undecided.A second survey, conducted November 6 and 7 right before the Post article was published showed Moore ahead of Jones by 9 percentage points, 51 percent to 42 percent.The NRSC has been vocal in their opposition to Moores candidacy since the story broke, with NRSC Chairman, Colorado Senator Cory Gardner immediately calling on him to drop out should the allegations be verified.The NRSC withdrew from a joint fundraising agreement with Moore.On Monday, Gardner said that if Moore remains in the race and comes out victorious, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he doesnt meet the ethical and moral requirements of the chamber.I wouldnt put much stock in that NRSC poll showing Moore way down, which presumably was leaked in order to get him out of the race, FiveThirtyEight pollster Nate Silver wrote on Twitter after the results of the poll surfaced.But polls have shown the race tightening, even though a Democrat has not won a Senate race in Alabama in over twenty years.FiveThirtyEight noted on Monday that an average of five surveys conducted since the allegations emerged had Moore leading Jones by a mere two percentage points.
Live: President Donald Trump Gives Statement at White House:::::President Donald Trump is making his first public statement since his return from his trip to Asia.The speech is schedule for 3:30 p.m.ET on Wednesday, though the White House did not disclose the topic of the presidents speech.The president returned from Asia on Tuesday.He tweeted on Monday that he would be making a major statement, but did not release any details about the timing or the content.It is unclear whether Trump will weigh in on embattled Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has come under fire and calls to step aside following a report in the Washington Post that cited four women claiming he had pursued relationships with teenage girls when he was in his thirties Watch on the live-stream above.
House Democrats Move to Impeach Donald Trump as President:::::(WASHINGTON) A half-dozen Democrats on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, accusing him of obstruction of justice and other offenses, in a long-shot effort that stands little chance in the Republican-led House.Indeed, the large majority of Democrats seem intent on having nothing to do with the effort either as lawmakers await the results of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Democratic leaders have argued that the impeachment campaign riles up Trumps GOP base, a critical bloc in next years midterm elections.The five articles accused the president of obstruction of justice related to the FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, undermining the independence of the federal judiciary and other offenses.We have taken this action because of great concerns for the country and our Constitution and our national security and our democracy, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said at a news conference to announce the effort.Cohen said he understands that Republicans hold the majority in the House and are unlikely to allow hearings on the impeachment articles.He said the group will hold occasional briefings to explain each of the five articles of impeachment and where they believe Trump ran afoul of the law or committed misdeeds that warrant impeachment.The obstruction of justice allegation stems from Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey, which the lawmakers say was designed to delay and impede an investigation.The articles of impeachment also charge that Trump has accepted without the consent of Congress emoluments from foreign states and from the U.S. government.Finally, the articles of impeachment allege he has undermined the federal judiciary and the freedom of the press.Cohen and other leaders of the impeachment effort disagreed that their effort could hurt Democrats in next years congressional elections.I think the Democratic base needs to be activated.The Democratic base needs to know there are members of Congress willing to stand up against this president, Cohen said.Other lawmakers who have signed onto to the resolution are Democratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Al Green of Texas, Marcia Fudge of Ohio, Adriano Espaillat of New York and John Yarmuth of Kentucky.Gutierrez said he wasnt afraid to support the resolution despite the concerns of some fellow Democrats.I see a crime and I have a responsibility to dial 911 immediately.I dont call and try to reach my consensus with all my neighbors and all my friends and those whose opinion I might seek out, Gutierrez said.A spokesman for the Republican National Committee criticized the effort.House Democrats lack a positive message and are completely unwilling to work across the aisle, so instead theyve decided to support a baseless radical effort that the vast majority of Americans disagree with, said spokesman Michael Ahrens.
Roy Moore's Attorney Said an MSBNC Host's Cultural 'Background' Could Explain Dating Teens:::::Roy Moores attorney Trenton Garmon suggested on air that an MSNBC hosts background might help him understand why someone would date teenage girls.Garmon appeared on MSNBCs Velshi & Ruhle, which is hosted by Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle, to discuss the scandal surrounding his client, who has been accused of having sexual or romantic relations with at least five teenage girls, one as young as 14, while he was in his 30s.Moore has denied some accusations including those brought by Beverly Young Nelson, who says Moore sexually assaulted her in a vehicle when she was 16 and dismissed others, saying that he does not remember dating teenagers or dating any woman without the permission of her mother.In addressing the latter comment on MSNBC, Garmon deferred to cultural differences before mentioning Alis background.What does Alis background have to do with dating a 14-year-old?Ruhle asked.In other countries, theres arrangements through parents for what we would refer to as consensual marriage, Garmon eventually answered.Velshi, who is of Indian descent, is from Canada.
Can Roy Moore Still Win?:::::The alleged child molester or the Democrat?Alabama voters face that choice in a few weeks time, and its not clear which of those theyll find more odious.There are several reasons to think Roy Moore, the Republican nominee whos been accused of making sexual advances to teenagers, could lose the special Senate election scheduled for Dec. 12.But theres one big reason to think he could still win.Washington Republicans were always leery of Moore, a crusading Christian conservative who was twice elected to the Alabama supreme courtand twice booted off it for refusing to abide by higher courts rulings on the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage.But the recent revelations that Moore dated girls as young as 14 when he was an unmarried local prosecutor in his 30s have sent the national GOP into a moral and political panic.Moore has denied the allegations by five women, including one who said that he assaulted her in a locked car when she was 16.In his defense, he said he didnt recall dating any girl without the permission of her mother.Alabama is an overwhelmingly Republican state where President Trump got 62% of the vote.But Moore is not as universally popular as his two election wins might suggest.He previously lost two Republican gubernatorial primaries, and in his last judicial election he got just 52% of the vote, under-performing that years GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, by 9 points.Moore has a committed base of religious voters, particularly in rural Alabama.But when I traveled to the state earlier this year, I found many business-minded Republicans in suburban areas who disliked Moores disregard for legal authority and extreme positions on social issues.Some fretted that Moore validates the worst stereotypes outsiders hold about Alabamans as a bunch of barefoot, Bible-thumping rednecks.A GOP strategist following the race says private polling showed it within the margin of error even before the allegations of sexual impropriety.The Republican National Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee have cut ties with Mooreproof, he says, that he is a threat to the D.C.Establishment.But for all Moores bluster, his poorly funded, skimpily staffed campaign may struggle without institutional support.That happened in the 2012 Senate campaign of Missouri Republican Todd Akin, who lost the red state by 16 points after he said legitimate rape was unlikely to cause pregnancy and his backers bailed.In the Akin race, many Republican voters decided they would rather elect a Democrat than someone they regarded as a misogynist.The question in Alabama is whether enough Republican voters will not only believe the accusations but find them serious enough to override partisanship.Theres evidence this can happen.The current Democratic governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, won in 2015 after then-Sen. David Vitter acknowledged patronizing prostitutes.(That election is also proof Democrats can turn out to vote in off-year elections.)Even in the South, plenty of voters preferred a Democrat to a scoundrel.Theres a big caveat that hangs over any post-2016 political analysis, however: Donald Trump.The Presidents rise scuttled much of the old conventional wisdom about how voters behave.It revealed a change in the way religious-right voters judge the character of candidates.Six years ago, just 30% of white evangelical voters believed a candidate who acted immorally in private could still behave ethically in office, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.Asked again last fall, 72% thought candidates private morals were irrelevant.What happened in between, of course, was Trump.White evangelical voters backed him by a huge majority in 2016, rationalizing his louche personal life and his boasts about sexually assaulting women in the Access Hollywood tape.Evangelical leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr. argued that God chose mysterious instruments to work His will, that immoral people could still govern morally and that the U.S. faced a spiritual crisis from which only Trump could deliver the nation.Polls in Alabama show a close race, with neither candidate topping 50%.The Democrat Doug Jones is a well-credentialed former prosecutor who has begun airing ads about the Moore allegations.There are plenty of Republicans in Alabama who dont like Roy Moore, says David Mowery, a Montgomery-based independent consultant.Will they actually hold their nose and vote for a Democrat?In the age of Trump, thats a harder judgment than ever to make.Correction: The original version of this story misstated the results of a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute.PRRI said that six years ago just 30% of white evangelical voters believed a candidate who acted immorally in private could still behave ethically in office compared to 72% who said the same last fall, not 72% six years ago and 30% last fall.
Rob Cordray, CFPB Head, Resigns to Run for Governor of Ohio:::::(WASHINGTON) Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and an appointee of former President Barack Obama, has announced his resignation.Cordray plans to resign his office by the end of November.He is expected to return to his home state of Ohio to run for governor.The Democrat has been a leading critic of President Donald Trump within the government.He was the first confirmed head of the independent agency established by Dodd-Frank, the landmark banking law created after the 2008 economic crisis that was designed to prevent future meltdowns.Some Republicans had urged Trump to fire Cordray, who was critical of Republican efforts to undermine the Dodd-Frank law.
Tom Cotton: If We Want Tax Bill to Work, Rescind Individual Mandate:::::In less than a month, Sen. Tom Cotton helped resurrect the presumed-dead GOP healthcare effort by making repeal of Obamacares individual mandate part of the tax reform fight, Politico reported.He began his pitch in the Oval Office.I am with you 1,000 percent on this, President Donald Trump told Cotton over the phone earlier this month repeating the idea in an interview with Newsmax TV Nov. 3.This week, Senate Republicans climbed aboard, vowing to put a repeal of the mandate in their tax plan and use the $338 billion in savings to plow into more tax cuts.Cotton told Politico he became convinced the GOP had to target the individual mandate during an Oct. 26 meeting with Senate Finance Committee members after members detailed a parade of horribles a series of popular tax breaks they d need to rescind.I started seeing the looks of hesitancy and outright terror on the faces of my colleagues, Cotton recalled.[I] spoke to some of them over the next few days and just realized that if we wanted the tax bill to work within the constraints of the budget, we had to repeal the mandate.Cotton told the outlet he spoke privately with White House officials including legislative director Marc Short and Jonny Hiler a former Cotton aide who leads Vice President Mike Pences legislative operation as well as with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.Cotton and Sens.Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, John Thune of South Dakota and Mike Crapo of Idaho met privately with CBO director Keith Hall to make sure that repealing the mandate would yield at least $300 billion in savings.It was ultimately $338 billion."Its not done in the abstract," Cotton said."Once you have to compare it to popular, widespread deductions like the mortgage interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction, then a lot of members who might be otherwise reluctant will see thats the simplest way to deliver more tax cuts for working families."House Republican sources say if the Senate can repeal the mandate, the House will almost certainly follow suit.
Steve Scalise on Passing Tax Plan: 'Failure Is Not an Option':::::House Majority Whip Steve Scalise said Wednesday that Congress would get a tax-reform plan to President Donald Trump by the end of the year because "failure is not an option.""I have high confidence the Senate is going pass this bill," the Louisiana Republican told CNN."I know the House is going to pass this bill."Failure is not an option.We've got to get it done."We'll get it done and get the bill on the president's desk and it will get our economy moving again," he said.The House is scheduled to vote Friday on its version of the tax plan, which slashes the corporate rate and lowers taxes for most Americans.The legislation, however, limits the deduction for homeowners and adds $1.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade.The doubling of the standard deduction and an increase in the child tax credit would benefit middle-income families and wealthy Americans would be greatly helped by a repeal of the alternative minimum tax and phase-out of the estate tax under the plan."We'll pass the bill," Scalise told CNN correspondent Phil Mattingly."We want to cut taxes and put more money in the pockets of families and create jobs."Noting that the House has passed legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, Scalise said that he hoped plans to add a rescinding of the healthcare mandate made it into the final version of the Senate's tax bill.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, while repealing the individual mandate would reduce the federal deficit by $338 billion over a decade, the move would leave 13 million Americans without coverage."I hope the Senate gets the vote," Scalise told Mattingly."It is good policy and some of those numbers you heard were wrong."You give freedom to people and, so, nobody loses anything."
Ivanka Trump: 'No Reason to Doubt' Moore Accusers:::::Ivanka Trump said Wednesday she doesn't see a reason not to believe the accusations made against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.The daughter of President Donald Trump who currently serves as one of his senior advisors, Ivanka Trump spoke with the Associated Press about her push to include a higher childcare tax credit in tax reform efforts.She was also asked about the allegations that Moore had either sexual contact with teenage girls or tried to initiate romantic relationships with them nearly 40 years ago."There's a special place in hell for people who prey on children," Trump said, without mentioning Moore by name."I've yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts."She stopped short of saying Moore should exit the race.Moore will square off with Democrat Doug Jones in a Dec. 12 special election that will determine who occupies the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Many Republican lawmakers, including the leaders of both the House and Senate, have called on Moore to abandon his Senate hopes and step aside because of the allegations.Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.
Roy Moore's Lawyer Wants Handwriting Analysis of Accuser's Yearbook:::::The lawyer for embattled Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore raised questions about claims of a woman whos alleged Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 including her assertion she had no further contact with Moore afterwards.In a news conference, Moore lawyer Philip Jauregui noted that accuser Beverly Young Nelson claimed she had never seen Moore after he allegedly locked her in a car and inappropriately touched her.But Jauregui said it was Moore, who as a circuit court judge in 1999, who signed Nelsons divorce case.The lawyer also demanded Nelson and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, hand over Nelsons high school yearbook that they claim was signed by Moore for a handwriting analysis.We're still working through some things, but there are some things you need to know and we want to make you aware of, Jauregui said.We had a handwriting expert look at the evidence submitted at the Nelson news conference specifically, a high school yearbook, he said.Judge Moore not only has denied everything [Nelson]said before, but now flatly denies that and he says it's not true.We have a handwriting expert that is looking at those.Right now our attorney is sending a letter to Gloria Allred demanding that the year book be released to a neutral custodian.He questioned Moores signature in the yearbook.Judge Moore can't ever remember signing his name with D.A.after it, but he had seen it before, the lawyer said.You know where he had seen it?When he was on the bench, his assistant, whose initials are D.A., Deborah Adams, would stamp his signature on documents and put capital D.A.That's exactly how the signature appears on the divorce decree that Judge Moore signed for Nelson years later.Release the year book so that we can determine is it genuine or is it a fraud, he demanded.
Report: Alabama GOP Meeting to Decide Moore's Fate:::::The Alabama Republican steering committee is currently meeting to discuss whether it will disqualify Roy Moore as a candidate in the Senate race, Talking Points Memo reports.Moore has been battling allegations reported last week by The Washington Post he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago when he was in his 30s and pursued romantic relationships with three other teenagers.A new accuser came forward Monday saying Moore, now 70, sexually assaulted her in the 1970s.The 21 members of the steering committee are the only ones who can pull Moore's nomination.Most members of the committee have stayed silent so far, but decided to move ahead with a meeting because of the severity of the allegations."We are still weighing the evidence, but realize some decision or statement must come from the state party soon," one Alabama Republican told TPM on Tuesday.Politico on Tuesday reported the Republican National Committee was withdrawing its support for Moore and stepping away from a joint agreement to raise funds for him.It was also canceling a program for sending canvassers into the field before the special election Dec. 12.NRSC Chairman Cory Gardner told reporters Tuesday if Moore wins, "the Senate should vote to expel him because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate."
Ron Johnson Won't Vote for Senate Tax Plan in Current Form:::::Republicans in the Senate officially lost one vote for their tax proposal after Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Wednesday he will not support it."If they can pass it without me, let them," Johnson told The Wall Street Journal."I'm not going to vote for this tax package."Johnson claimed the tax plan, which would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and slashes individual rates as well, is generous to corporation-type businesses but is not as fair to other types of business structures."I have no problems in making all American businesses competitive globally," Johnson said."This isn't anti-big corporation at all.When you're going to do a tax reform, you have to treat them equitably so they can maintain their competitive position here at home as we're making them competitive globally."Johnson also said he does not agree with how GOP leaders are not allowing some members of the party to review and critique the bill."I don't like that process," Johnson said."I find it pretty offensive, personally."Johnson is the first Senate Republican to announce his opposition to the tax plan, which GOP leaders hope to pass before the end of the year.In an emailed statement from his office, Johnson said he does not support either of the tax proposals at least in their current form that have been introduced in the House and Senate."We have an opportunity to enact paradigm-shifting tax reform that makes American businesses globally competitive, helps our economy reach its full potential, and creates greater opportunity and bigger paychecks for every American," Johnson said."In doing so, it is important to maintain the domestic competitive position and balance between large publicly traded C corporations and 'pass-through entities' (subchapter S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships)."These businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind.Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions."I do, however, look forward to working with my colleagues to address the disparity so I can support the final version."Republicans began pushing the legislation through the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday, which now includes a measure to erase the individual mandate for health insurance an idea brought up by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Tuesday.House Speaker Paul Ryan said his chamber could pass a tax reform bill that includes an individual mandate repeal.With the loss of Johnson's vote, the GOP can only afford to lose one more vote if they want to pass the bill.

Sen. Collins: Insurance Mandate Repeal Will Spike Premiums:::::Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, warned against repealing the individual mandate in the GOP's upcoming tax bill, saying doing so could cause premiums to skyrocket and other problems for the middle class."I am no fan of the individual mandate, and I very much want to see tax reform," Collins told reporters Wednesday, per Talking Points Memo."But I believe taking a particular provision from the Affordable Care Act and appending it to the tax bill greatly complicates our efforts.One of my concerns is that it will cause premiums in the individual markets to go up as healthier, younger people drop out."On Tuesday the Maine Republican told reporters, according to The Washington Examiner, it is "premature" for her to "take a position on the bill," which the GOP hopes to vote on this week.She added Wednesday, "I have new statistics that show that for some middle-income people, it will cancel out their tax cut.The increased premium would be more than the tax reduction they would get from this bill."The Congressional Budget Office recently released a report which found repealing the individual mandate would cause premiums to rise by at least 10 percent every year for the next decade.
Sen. Graham: 'It Would Be Good' If Trump Spoke on Roy Moore:::::Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday that Alabama Republican candidate Roy Moore should be "held accountable" for alleged behavior "that is at the minimum creepy" and said "it would be good" if President Donald Trump spoke to the situation."The people of Alabama have to deal with it," the South Carolina Republican told reporters at the Capitol."It is a shame."I would like the Republican Party of Alabama to step up and fix this for the good of the state and the country."When Graham was asked whether Trump should weigh in on Moore, he responded: "Well, that will be up to him."He's the head of the party," the senator said."Yeah, it would be good if he will say something."Moore, 70, a former Alabama Supreme Court judge, has been accused by five women of harassing them when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s.One accuser alleged Moore tried to initiate a sexual encounter when she was 14, while another came forward Monday to contend the Senate candidate assaulted her behind the restaurant where she worked in Gadsden when she was 16.Moore was 32.He has said the allegations are false and has suggested the accusers were coming forward to try to stop his political career.The top Republicans on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky have called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to become a write-in candidate in the race.Sessions was a five-term Alabama senator whose appointment to the White House created the vacancy leading to the Dec. 12 special election.The New Yorker also reported Monday that Moore was banned from the Gadsden Mall when he was a prosecutor in the early 1980s after repeatedly trying to pick up teenage girls."I met a lot of people at the mall and if you get kicked out of the mall, that's a bad situation to find oneself in," Graham told reporters Thursday."The evidence is becoming overwhelming."In the '70s and '80s, he's on the no-flight list at malls, but it is stunning."He's being held accountable for behavior that was at the minimum creepy and I think the women's allegations have their own truth."This stuff about the mall confirms his behavior in question."
Q-Poll: More Credit Obama for Economy, But Trends to Trump:::::Fifty percent of Americans say former President Barack Obama is more responsible for the current state of the American economy, compared to only 37 percent who say it is more due to President Donald Trump, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday.Thirteen percent said they did not know or refused to answer.However, although this result has been about the same for the past half year, the general trend has been for more people to start giving credit to Trump as time passes.Back in March 67 percent credited Obama and only 19 percent Trump, which changed by May to 58 percent saying the state of the economy is due more to Obama and 29 percent crediting Trump.Since his November 2016 electoral victory, Trump has consistently claimed exclusive credit for the economy, frequently pointing to record highs in the Dow Jones industrial average and falling unemployment rates as proof that enthusiasm over his policies has spurred the economy, according to The Hill.Other results of the Quinnipiac University survey indicate: While 59 percent of Democrats say Obama is more responsible for the state of the economy and 58 percent of Republicans say it is due to Trump, Independents favor crediting Obama over Trump by a margin of 51 percent to 33 percent.When respondents were asked to describe their personal financial situation these days, 13 percent said excellent, 60 percent said good, 17 percent answered not so good and 8 percent poor.Those percentage have remained relatively stable in surveys since April.The poll surveyed 1,577 voters across the United States between Nov. 7-13.It has a margin of error of three percentage points.
Sen. Chris Murphy: Bipartisan Gun Legislation Deal Is Close:::::Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said a bipartisan deal on gun legislation is close.Murphy made his announcement in a Wednesday tweet: Big news: super close to a bipartisan breakthrough on gun legislation.Stay tuned... Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 15, 2017 The legislation is designed to close gaps in background checks for those looking to purchase firearms, Chris Harris, a spokesman for Murphy, told The Hill.The move follows the mass shooting at a Texas church earlier this month where 26 people were killed.It was later revealed the gunman, Devin Kelley, was able to purchase firearms, despite a history of violence, The Hill noted.Kelly died of a self-inflected gunshot after the massacre.
NJ Gov. Phil Murphy: State Going 'Back to Basics' for Economic Growth:::::The newly elected governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, appeared on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Wednesday to discuss his ideas for bolstering the state's economy."The big story of our election going forward is going to be the economy.We said the whole time on the campaign trail, 'we need a stronger, fairer economy that works for every New Jersey family,'" he said."Underneath that it means that we haven't grown, we're profoundly unfair, and when it works, it works for very few.When asked how "you get New Jersey to grow" economically, Murphy said, "You got to get back to basics.There's a couple of economies that we used to dominate.The two big ones are the innovation economy and the infrastructure economy.In the first case you can make a very credible argument that we were Silicon Valley before there was a Silicon Valley.Bell Labs, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, pharma, bio.A lot of that edge is gone.That's because we have stopped investing into K-12, higher education, infrastructure, etc."He added that New Jersey has "lost that economy" to states like Massachusetts despite their similarities, and that Bay State taxpayers accept paying a "premium" for the quality of life where they live."The question is specifically: can we deliver real property tax relief for the middle class in New Jersey," Murphy said."Yes.That starts with not just growing the economy, with under funded public education in New Jersey in the Christie years by over $9 billion.Anybody who's watching, pull out your property tax bill in New Jersey, on average 53 percent of your bill is public education.That's where we can deliver real relief in addition to growing the economy."
Rep. Pete King: Mulvaney Using Tax Reform to 'Screw' New York:::::Office of Budget and Management Chief Mick Mulvaney is using tax reform to "screw" the state of New York, Rep. Pete King said Wednesday, while strongly pushing against plans to remove state and local tax deductions from a tax reform bill that will come under consideration in the House soon."My real objection to Mulvaney is he was yesterday saying how if there is a bad impact on New York, that's New York's fault," the New York Republican told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" program."This is what Mulvaney [was] doing back in Congress ...We've been subsidizing him and his constituents for years and he's using this opportunity to screw us."King further complained that Mulvaney, when in office, "led the fight against the [Superstorm] Sandy relief money due to New York.He never supported the 9/11 healthcare bill for New York and now he seems to use every opportunity to take shots at New York.In his original budget, he cut dramatically the Homeland Security funding."Mulvaney also was scheduled to appear on the "Fox and Friends" program after King, but canceled his appearance for reasons that were not disclosed, co-anchor Sandra Smith commented.However, Smith said, he is still saying that the he feels confident that the House bill will pass in its current form, even without King's vote or the efforts to save the deduction."They may have the votes," King responded."I don't know what the vote count is.I hope they don't.If they do, they do."King has been angry since earlier this week, when Mulvaney told reporters that New York and other high-tax states were putting a burden on states like his South Carolina because of the tax deductions.He further commented it would be New York's own fault when asked about the possibility that wealthy residents would leave rather than pay more taxes."Is it the federal government's fault that New York taxes are so high that they're driving people out of the state?"Mulvaney said, reports the Buffalo News."I don't defend everything that New York has done," King said, adding that New York would be better off if it was treated the way Mulvaney's home state of South Carolina is."We pay $48 billion every year to the federal government, more than we get back," said King."We get 79 cents on the dollar.Mulvaney's state gets far more than that, 70 percent more than we do.If we have the same balance of payments to the federal government as Mulvaney does in South Carolina we wouldn't have the problems we have."King said he has not changed his mind about voting against the House bill, and said that most of his fellow New York delegation likewise will vote against it if it eliminates the tax deductions."I can't speak for all of them, but I know that [Rep.] Dan Donovan is definitely no," he said."Several others also.This again, we believe, will have a severe impact on New York, especially the downstate that we represent, where the property taxes and state income tax level is high, and so much of that would be lost."If the bill is passed, statewide, New Yorkers would lose billions, said King."As far as my district , downstate New York the average home tax probably is somewhere between $25,000 and $30,000 as well as state income tax and local property tax, [and] $10,000 of that would be allowed," King said."You have $15,000 to $20,000 they're losing in deductions.People tell you other pluses in the bill will make up for that.I haven't seen that yet.I would say most of the taxpayers in my district, a good number of them, would see their taxes go up because of this."
Quinnipiac Poll: 60 Percent Say Mueller Running Fair Russia Probe:::::Six out of 10 Americans believe that special counsel Robert Mueller is running a fair investigation into alleged collusion with Russia, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll.The results, according to Quinnipiac: 60 percent say Mueller is running a fair investigation.27 percent say Mueller's investigation is not fair.47 percent say President Donald Trump should be removed from office if he fired Mueller.46 percent say Trump should not be removed if he fired Mueller.That number is driven by Democrats, 76 percent of whom say the investigation is fair.Meanwhile, just 41 percent of Republicans think it's a fair probe, vs. 44 percent who don't think it's fair, according to Quinnipiac.Among Independents, 63 percent think it's fair, vs. 25 percent who said no and 12 percent who are undecided about the fairness of the probe.Overall, 64 percent of those surveyed say they believe Russia interfered with the 2016 election, including one-third of Republicans; 65 percent of Republicans, however, don't believe Russia interfered.Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,577 voters nationwide Nov. 7-13 with a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
House Panel OKs Bill to Sanction Financial Backers of Hamas:::::The Republican-led House panel delivered a blunt bipartisan warning to Qatar on Wednesday, backing legislation that would slap sanctions on any countries or individuals providing financial and material support to the Islamic militant group Hamas.The Foreign Affairs Committee passed the bill by voice vote, setting the stage for the full House to consider the measure.The bill specifically criticizes Qatar for supplying Hamas with significant financial backing and for hosting members of the militant group's leadership.Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain broke ties with Qatar earlier this year over allegations the Persian Gulf country funds terrorism.President Donald Trump echoed the accusation.The bill adds that in March 2014 the Treasury Department "confirmed that 'Qatar, a longtime U.S. ally has for many years openly financed Hamas.'"Late last month, however, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced a rare display of cooperation among the oil-rich Gulf states when he unveiled a coordinated counterterrorism effort involving Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain.The countries agreed to sanction a number of Yemenis and an entity suspected of financing the Islamic State group and al-Qaida.The bill underscores the complicated relationship between Qatar and the United States.Qatar is home to the massive al-Udeid Air Base, the forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command where nearly 10,000 U.S. troop are stationed as part of the campaign against the Islamic State group and the war in Afghanistan.Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Dan Donovan of New York said last month that "Qatar is the master of playing all sides."The country, they wrote in an op-ed published in The Hill newspaper, has used an "innovative approach" to avoid being punished by the U.S. and European nations for backing terrorists groups: "Pursue good relations with the United States, make false promises about combating terror, lavishly fund western universities and business projects - all while quietly financing and promoting terror, allying with Iran, and leveraging an American air base as an insurance policy against punishment for promoting terror," the congressmen wrote.Qatar is about the size of Connecticut and sticks out like a thumb on the Arabian Peninsula into the Persian Gulf.Qatar has the highest per-capita income in the world due to its natural gas reserves.Qataris practice an ultraconservative form of Islam known as Wahhabism.Hamas, which seeks Israel's destruction, has ruled Gaza with an iron fist since seizing control of the coastal area in 2007.Hamas has since clashed repeatedly with more radical groups, which have carried out their own attacks against Israel in part to undermine Hamas.Donovan said Wednesday that Hamas has been "intertwined with Iran ideologically, politically and militarily."Qatar, he added, "now has a strategic opportunity to sever itself from Hamas and by extension, Iran, which is a state sponsor of terrorism."The committee also approved a bill that would suspend U.S. financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority until it takes credible steps to end acts of violence against U.S. and Israeli citizens.The legislation is named after an American, Taylor Force, who was stabbed to death in Israel by a Palestinian.It reflects bipartisan outrage over what lawmakers have termed a "pay to slay" program endorsed by the Palestinian Authority.Force was an MBA student at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and a West Point graduate who was visiting Israel in March 2016 when he was killed.Force was from Lubbock, Texas.His parents live in South Carolina.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a separate version of the Taylor Force bill in early August.Palestinian officials criticized the Senate legislation as misinformed and counterproductive.
New Money: Mnuchin and Carranza Now on the Dollar Bill:::::Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza are now on the money, literally.The two officials took a tour of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on Wednesday to see firsthand the production of new $1 bills, the first currency that will bear their signatures.Mnuchin's signature is decidedly more legible than that of his predecessor Jacob Lew.Lew had handwriting that was so sloppy that former President Barack Obama once joked that unless he made his signature more legible, it might debase the currency.Carranza and Mnuchin, accompanied by his wife Louise Linton, examined sheets of the $1 bills at the bureau's Washington printing plant.The currency will be shipped to Federal Reserve regional banks around the country, and the new bills are expected to go into circulation in December.Both Treasury officials provided 10 sample signatures, from which one was chosen for government engravers.Signatures of Treasury secretaries have been appearing on U.S. currency since 1914.During his appearance to examine the new currency, Mnuchin did not address the issue of whether the Trump administration will reverse a decision made by the Obama administration to replace Andrew Jackson, who currently appears on the $20, with Harriet Tubman, the 19th century African-American abolitionist.During last year's presidential campaign, President Donald Trump criticized the move as "pure political correctness," while praising Jackson, the nation's seventh president.Asked about the possibility of reversing the decision to put Tubman on the $20, Mnuchin in September had said that the major focus was on improving security features to thwart counterfeiters and that the final designs were "very far in the future."The next bill scheduled for re-design is the $10.It will not be released until 2026.
Hatch Defends 'Obamacare' Repeal in Tax Bill:::::The head of the Senate's tax-writing committee is defending the decision to include in the tax bill a repeal of the Obamacare requirement for Americans to get health insurance.Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Wednesday the requirement that nearly everyone have insurance coverage or face a fine is a tax.Hatch said that's a "terribly regressive tax that imposes harsh burdens on low- and middle-income taxpayers."His panel started a third day of work Wednesday on the tax overhaul legislation.Democrats angrily protested the move.Repealing the mandate would raise an estimated $338 billion that could help pay for deep tax cuts, especially for corporations.Budget analysts say it would push 13 million Americans off the insurance rolls over the next decade.
John Ratcliffe Hails DOJ for Investigating Leaks:::::John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, on Wednesday praised Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department for looking into cases of leaked classified information."When people disclose America's most sensitive national security information there has to be consequences," Ratcliffe said on Fox News, according to The Washington Times."Members of the committee, we had about nine open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years.We have 27 investigations open today.We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks," Sessions said in his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, according to CNN Money."We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks," he added."I think it has reached epidemic proportions.It cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to make sure that it does not continue."Ratcliffe added on Wednesday, "that's one of the things I was most comforted to hear from the attorney general was that they're 'pedal to the metal' with respect to holding people accountable for those types of violations in law, which are the most serious and the most damaging to our national security."
Poll: Voters Disapprove of GOP Tax Plan 2 to 1:::::Over half of American voters disapprove of the Republican tax reform plan, according to a Quinnipiac University poll published Wednesday.The survey's results: 52 percent of American voters disapprove of the Republican tax plan, while 25 percent approve of the plan.60 percent of Republicans support the plan, 15 percent approve it, and 26 percent are undecided.The poll shows disapproval among all other breakdowns by party, gender, education, age, and racial groups, according to the poll report.Other opinions about the Republican tax plan expressed in the poll: 61 percent say the wealthy would be the plan's main beneficiaries, 24 percent said the middle class would benefit most, and 6 percent said those with the lowest incomes would be the main beneficiaries.16 percent said they believed the plan would reduce their taxes, while 35 percent said they believed it would increase their taxes, and 36 percent believe it will have little effect.52 percent do not believe the tax plan will lead to more jobs, while 36 percent believe it will produce more jobs.49 percent believe that lowering the corporate tax rate is a bad idea, while 45 percent favor the idea.58 percent believe that doubling the standard deduction is a good idea; 30 percent disagree.59 percent believe that dropping the deduction for state and local income taxes is a bad idea, while 30 percent disagree.48 percent favor eliminating the estate tax, while 43 percent think it is a bad idea."The sentiment from voters: The GOP tax plan is a great idea, if you are rich.Otherwise, you're out of luck," said Tim Malloy, Quinnipiac University poll's assistant director.The poll was conducted from Nov. 7 to Nov. 13 in a survey of 1,577 voters around the U.S., with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Post Editor: Call Seeking Dirt on Moore Was Fake:::::The executive editor of The Washington Post is dismissing as fake a call from someone claiming to be one of the newspaper's reporters seeking damaging information on Roy Moore in exchange for money.Marty Baron says the caller's reporting methods bear "no relationship to reality."An Alabama man says he received a phone message from someone claiming to be a Post reporter willing to pay thousands of dollars for dirt on Senate candidate Moore.The Post broke the story last week of allegations of sexual misconduct by Moore decades ago.Al Moore told WKRG-TV on Tuesday that the person offered to pay as much as $7,000 to women willing to make damaging remarks about the Republican candidate.Al Moore shared a recording with The Associated Press.

Why the Democrats Should Listen to Donna Brazile:::::The first reactions to Donna Braziles new book, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-Ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House, might best be described as frantica tone that was defined by the timing as well as by the players involved.The book appeared on November 7th, Election Day, and, a few days before, Brazile, who had served as the interim head of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 Presidential campaign, had published an advance excerpt in Politico about her investigation into whether the D.N.C.had rigged the nomination process in favor of Hillary Clinton.It described her calling Senator Bernie Sanders, on September 7, 2016, after first lighting candles and listening to gospel music, and telling him, I did find the cancer.That inspired this tweet from President Trump: The real story on Collusion is in Donna Bs new book.Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!Thats not quite what Brazile wrote; she was making a more nuanced point about the corrosive quality of the campaigns financial relations with the Party.But Democrats had a fiery response, too, some because they saw the charges as unjust, some because the charges affirmed their disappointment, and others because they believed that, whatever Clintons flaws might have been, Braziles account pointlessly and unfairly divided the Partys forces just as close races were being fought around the country, particularly the gubernatorial race in Virginia.Brazile said that her critics could go to Hell.The fury dissipated, somewhat, when those elections went very well for the Democrats.Brazile wasnt a spoiler, after all.But she does have a story to tell that the Democrats shouldnt dismiss, if they intend to win the White House in 2020.
Fiasco in Alabama: Can Republicans Block Moore?:::::When Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, an early sign of his success was that he was running respectably in unlikely corners of the country.He won over wealthy retirees at an exclusive South Carolina country club.He packed an amphitheater in Boca Raton before romping in Floridas primary.He locked down the nomination by crushing Ted Cruz in the Philadelphia and New York City suburbs.
ABA and Dems Smear Court Picks:::::Democrats and the liberal media are slamming President Trump for packing federal courts with "unfit" judges.Nonsense.Trump's nominees have impressive credentials.What's the left's real gripe?These judges will decide cases based on what the U.S. Constitution says, instead of rewriting law to suit a progressive agenda.Look for fireworks in the U.S. Senate Wednesday, when the American Bar Association tries to justify rating several of Trump's nominees "not qualified."ABA ratings are a political hit job masquerading as high-minded objectivity.Consider the ABA's "not qualified" rating of Leonard Steven Grasz, a Nebraska attorney nominated to the appeals court.The ABA claims Grasz is unfit because of his "deeply held social agenda."During his 11 years as Nebraska's chief deputy attorney general, he defended many of the state's laws, including a ban on partial birth abortion.Defending that law was his job.Opposing any limit on abortion is enough to outrage pro-choice activist Cynthia Nance, the law professor who led Grasz's recent ABA review.She stooped to grilling him on why he sends his children to religious schools -- an out-of-bounds question -- instead of sticking to probing his legal philosophy.Apparently, being religious is disqualifying.Grasz reiterated his "solemn obligation" to put aside personal views and "faithfully apply" Supreme Court precedent.Astonishingly, that's an assurance the left rejects.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D. R.I., argues "there's simply no way to prevent a judge's ... personal beliefs from influencing" rulings.The conclusion is obvious.To Democrats like Whitehouse, only nominees with left-wing agendas are acceptable.Another nominee rated "unqualified" by the ABA is Brett Talley, Trump's nominee to a federal district court in Alabama.Last Thursday, Talley won Senate Judiciary Committee approval despite the ABA's claim that Talley lacks "requisite trial experience."In truth, Talley is superbly qualified -- with a law degree from Harvard, clerkships at the trial and appeals court level, litigation experience in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and a stint as Alabama's deputy solicitor general.He's got about as much trial experience as Justice Elena Kagan, rated "well qualified" by the ABA when President Obama nominated her to the highest court.What's Talley real problem?His political views and Trump connections.(His wife is chief of staff to the White House counsel, a fact he should have disclosed sooner.)Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., grilled Talley about abortion, gun control, gay marriage and his disdain for Hillary Clinton -- whom he once dubbed "Hillary Rotten Clinton" on Twitter.Imprudent maybe, but hardly in the league with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's comment to The New York Times that she couldn't "imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president."Talley assured senators he would "never allow personal opinions or experiences to justify a departure from the law."When Whitehouse said courts need judges who empathize with what it's like to be a teenage mom, African-American, gay or poor, Talley shot back that everyone appearing in front of a federal judge deserves empathy.Back in 2013, Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., chastised Senate Republicans for opposing Obama's female nominees, arguing the court needs more women.But hypocrisy is on display now, with Warren and fellow Democrats attacking Trump's female nominees.Amy Barrett, nominated to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, got hammered for her Catholicism.Feinstein suggested Barrett's religion "lives loudly within" her, making her unfit.The University of Notre Dame's president warned that "it is chilling to hear from a United States Senator that this might now disqualify someone from service as a federal judge."Millions voted for Trump because he pledged to appoint judges who would uphold the Constitution, not invent law to advance a social agenda.Twenty-one percent of Trump voters called it their highest priority.But the ABA and other activists aren't surrendering their grip on the courts without a fight.Remember that when you hear the smears about "unfit" nominees.COPYRIGHT 2017 CREATORS.COM
Trump's Extraordinary 12-Day Adulation Tour:::::WASHINGTON -- As President Trump ends his Asia trip, he might sum up the 12-day journey with a revision of the remark attributed to Julius Caesar: Veni, vidi, blandivi.I came, I saw, I flattered.Trump's trip was closer to a pilgrimage than a projection of power.The president rarely explained details of U.S. policy.Instead, he mostly asked other leaders for help, lauded their virtues, and embraced their worldviews.Along the adulation tour, Trump spoke of his "really extraordinary" relationship with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe; his "incredibly warm" feeling for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he called "a very special man"; his "great relationship" with the "very successful" Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte; and his empathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose nation is "an asset to our country, not a liability."And the president praised himself at nearly every stop, telling reporters on the way home that the trip had been "tremendously successful" with "incredible" achievements.Trump's trip may indeed prove to be historic, but probably not in the way he intends.It may signal a U.S. accommodation to rising Chinese power, plus a desire to mend fences with a belligerent Russia -- with few evident security gains for America.If the 1945 Yalta summit marked U.S. acceptance of the Soviet Union's hegemony in Eastern Europe, this trip seemed to validate China's arrival as a Pacific power.As Xi put it to Trump, "The Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States."Trump voiced a clear desire for accommodation with an aggressive Russia, too.Much was made of his regurgitation of Putin's denial that he had conducted a covert action against America during last year's presidential campaign."President Putin really feels -- and he feels strongly -- that he did not meddle in our election."Remarked one former senior CIA official: "When the Art of the Deal meets the KGB, the KGB wins."But far more important than Trump's credulous response to Putin was his eagerness for Moscow's help in bolstering America's global position.Trump has noisily drawn a red line on North Korea, for example, but he evidently needs Russia's help, in addition to China's, to deliver without going to war.To get Moscow's help on North Korea, and Syria, too, Trump seems willing to give Putin a pass.Here's how Trump put it during a press conference in Hanoi, which may have been the most important statement of the trip: "People don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned," Trump said."It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken.... And I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world."Trump's ingratiating comments come at a time of American strategic disorientation."We're adrift," said one prominent congressional Republican staffer, expressing a view that's increasingly heard from nonpartisan analysts at the Pentagon, think tanks and universities.At a time when Russia, China and Iran are all rapidly advancing their military capabilities, the Trump administration has declaratory policies of military strength -- but hasn't yet made the necessary decisions about how it intends to actually combat these potential adversaries.A blistering summary of the administration's overdue obligation to make strategic decisions to deter Russia and China, as opposed to glad-handing them, came in a little-noted Oct. 27 letter from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.Stricken with cancer, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee holds nothing back these days."We now confront the most complex security environment in 70 years," McCain wrote."Misplaced priorities and acquisition failures have left us without critical defense capabilities to counter increasingly advanced near-peer competitors.... We no longer enjoy the wide margins of power we once had over competitors and adversaries.We cannot do everything we want everywhere.We must choose.We must prioritize."McCain suggested what many analysts have been saying quietly for months.The most worrying thing about Trump isn't his impulsive military threats (though there's reason to be concerned there, too).The deeper fear is that in national security, this administration is an empty suit.It doesn't make decisions.It doesn't set priorities.Trump is a vain man who flatters others so that he will be stroked himself.If there's a strategic concept underlying his approach, it may be realism married to acquiescence.The Asia trip left me feeling that we're watching an American retreat, accompanied by a shiny brass band.(c) 2017, Washington Post Writers Group

I Believe Juanita Broaddrick:::::Yet despite the rights evident bad faith, I agree with Hayes.In this #MeToo moment, when were reassessing decades of male misbehavior and turning open secrets into exposes, we should look clearly at the credible evidence that Juanita Broaddrick told the truth when she accused Clinton of raping her.But revisiting the Clinton scandals in light of todays politics is complicated as well as painful.Democrats are guilty of apologizing for Clinton when they shouldnt have.At the same time, looking back at the smear campaign against the Clintons shows we cant treat the feminist injunction to believe women as absolute.
Please, Dems, No More Phony Op-Eds About Bill Clinton:::::Ive reached my fill after just two pieces, that Michelle Goldberg piecethat Ed wrote about yesterday and now this new one from Matt Yglesias at Vox.I dont deny that part of the impulse behind them is virtuous.If left and right together can inculcate an ethic against men abusing their power over women at work by making an example of their own worst offenders, better late than never.If nothing else, the we should have been tougher on Bill pieces can be cited later to invoke zero tolerance the next time a powerful Democrat is accused of sexual misconduct.Because there will be a next time, just as therell be a next time for powerful Republicans.
For Border States Michigan and Arizona, NAFTA Is Essential:::::As the presidents of two border-state chambers of commerce, we know firsthand of the power of the North American Free Trade Agreement.NAFTA is an indispensable component of our states economic prosperity.Not surprisingly, our states international neighbors represent our largest trading partners.And for each of us, the other NAFTA partner country is our second-largest export market.For Arizona and Michigan, and for so many states, NAFTA means jobs.Nationally, 14 million jobs are tied to trade with Mexico and Canada.In Arizona, the total is more than 200,000; in Michigan, its nearly 400,000.Which is why President Trumps rhetoric over trade and his threats to exit NAFTA are both troubling and perplexing.Troubling because throughout its nearly 25-year history, NAFTA has fueled economic growth in our states, growing jobs here while preventing entire supply chains from migrating overseas to regions like Asia.Perplexing because cutting off U.S. manufacturers access to foreign markets and increasing the costs of everyday products here at home runs completely counter to the administrations stated goal of achieving 3 percent economic growth.While we share the presidents position on the need to reform our tax code and reduce job creators regulatory burden, making trade more cumbersome and expensive is a recipe for economic malaise, an opinion shared by over 80 percent of economists in a recent Wall Street Journal survey, who believe a NAFTA exit would result in an economic slowdown.The anti-NAFTA position is also strange for a president who not only won our states in the 2016 election, but whose victory hinged on winning Michigan.Pursuing a policy that harms the very voters who tipped the scales in your favor is hardly the foundation for re-election.The connections of our states economies with Canada and Mexico run deep, making us more competitive against foreign competition and proving the difference between adding jobs and shedding them.For example, electric car manufacturer Lucid Motors cited its forthcoming Arizona factorys proximity to Mexico and the highly integrated cross-border automotive supply chain as a reason for the companys $700 million investment in the state.In Michigan, the Detroit metro area alone is an international export powerhouse, sending $15 billion worth of exports marked Made in the USA to Canada and $17 billion worth to Mexico in 2015.Thats two-thirds of the states exports.In fact, an analysis by the credit ratings agency Fitch finds that Michigan has the most to lose if NAFTA is dismantled.Michigans exports account for 7.4 percent of its gross state product, which Fitch says leaves the state uniquely exposed if the agreement were unwound.It's easy to see why the potential for dramatic job losses looms large.Cross-border trade has now reached $1.2 trillion a year for the U.S., Mexico and Canada, an astonishing $3.3 billion a day, making NAFTA the worlds largest and most consequential trade bloc.While we are staunch advocates for NAFTA, we are not satisfied with the status quo.We believe strongly that an agreement that came into force in 1994 ought to be updated to reflect the realities of todays economy.A NAFTA that was negotiated in the dial-up age should be modernized for a broadband world.The renegotiations underway between the three NAFTA parties present an opportunity to streamline overly complicated customs regulations, guard intellectual property, protect investors interests in dispute proceedings, and recognize electronic commerce.The administration should not, however, approach a renegotiation as a chance to exact some sort of punitive trade agenda against our partners.Rather, we should be guided first and foremost by the goal to do no harm to an agreement that is a cornerstone of all three nations continued prosperity.The stakes are high for our border states as we craft a new NAFTA with our friends and neighbors.If the administration embraces the opportunity to modernize the agreement, Michigan and Arizona will emerge even stronger.But if the U.S. walks away from NAFTA, the effects will be devastating.We choose to stand with the millions of jobs that depend on trade.Richard K. Studley is the president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce.

One Simple Way to Improve GOP's Tax Reform Proposal:::::After a year of failures, Congress is on the verge of reforming Americas convoluted tax code for the first time in more than three decades.Both the House and Senate tax plans have the potential to unleash economic growth, create American jobs, increase wages for American workers, allow families to keep more of their hard-earned money, and make U.S. businesses more competitive across the globe.That said, no tax reform is perfect and each plan has room for improvement.Fortunately, Senate Republicans announced they plan to include the elimination of Obamacares individual mandate tax penalty to their tax overall.Given the Senates rules and unnecessary, self-imposed budget constraints, most improvements would require congressional tax writers to find savings, i.e., tax increases, elsewhere in the tax code.As we have seen, those trade offs can be painful in a town filled with corporate welfare, cronyism and self-entitlement.That is why eliminating Obamacares individual mandate tax penalty is such a politically advantageous option available.Lets start with the obvious: Obamacares individual mandate is an affront to small government conservatives and does not work, as evidenced by the 6.5 million who paid the individual mandate penalty and the 13 million who claimed an exemption in 2015.It also penalizes those that can least afford to hand over even more money to the federal government.In 2015, 90 percent of households that paid the Orwellian individual shared responsibility payment earned less than $75,000, and more than one in three household made less than $25,000.From a health care and freedom standpoint, eliminating the individual mandate tax penalty is obvious, but given the absurd logic used by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) it also saves $338 billion over the next decade.Those savings could be used to pay for additional tax cuts for hardworking Americans left reeling from the 2008 financial crisis.To be clear, the CBOs estimate is absurd because it assumes that millions of people would reject free health insurance in the form of Medicaid or massively subsidized health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges if they were not forced to buy it.That fallacy hampered congressional Republicans during this years debate on repealing and ultimately replacing Obamacare, but it now provides some additional wiggle room when it comes to tax reform and Obamacare relief.While $338 billion may sound like a lot, in the context of overall tax reform those savings will evaporate quickly as problems are identified and corrected.In the House, the most obvious change would be the elimination of the so-called 45.6 percent bubble rate and lowering the top rate or reducing the egregious marriage penalty in the 35-percent bracket.While the Senate bill is better on the individual side, the individual rates could go lower, the new corporate rate could start immediately, expensing could be more robust, or the plan could be more aggressive in eliminating the death tax.Also, the savings could be used beyond the 10 year budget window to ensure there are no expiring provisions -- with permanency being an important component of economic growth.Last month, Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) argued the individual mandate is simply a tax on Americans who cant afford insurance and its clear the scheme has fallen far short of expectations while hurting the working poor more than it is helping them.Monday, President Trump reiterated his support for eliminating the mandate as part of tax reform, tweeting that he was proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.}Were getting close!Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further?We agree, and fortunately Senate tax writers do as well.There are two additional benefits worth noting.First, recent polling suggests a plurality -- roughly 45 percent of voters -- support the Republicans' tax reform efforts.According to a 2017 YouGov poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans want the individual mandate repealed.That number jumps to 81 percent when looking just at Trump voters.In other words, including repeal will increase the popularity of the tax package.Second, eliminating the individual mandate penalty will alter the CBO's health insurance coverage calculation when Republicans return to repeal-and-replace next year.Remember, the CBO routinely estimated that 15+ million people would lose insurance coverage because the bill eliminated the individual mandate, handing the media and the left a powerful talking point against any future reform.The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are on the verge of delivering a decades-long promise to reform our nation's tax code, and including the elimination of Obamacare's individual mandate penalty will bring them even closer.We cannot allow self-serving special interests and a small group of lawmakers placing parochial interests above the nation's interests to torpedo this effort.Michael A.

Supreme Court to hear anti-abortion and free speech case: A breakdown of NIFLA v. Becerra:::::On Nov. 13, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on whether a California law passed in 2015, which requires anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform clients about free or low-cost abortion services, is a violation of free speech.Heres what you need to know about the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra before oral arguments are expected to begin late next year.What does the California law say?Californias Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency Act, more commonly known as the FACT Act, was passed in October 2015.It requires pregnancy facilities to post a disclosure to inform clients that California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services, prenatal care and abortion for eligible women, according to law.It also requires unlicensed, non-medical facilities to inform clients that they are not licensed medical providers.The public notice is required to be posted in a conspicuous place in the facilitys waiting room, and must be "8.5 inches by 11 inches and written in no less than 22-point type."However, clinics can also choose to provide printed or digital notices to clients instead.If pregnancy centers fail to comply with the law, theyre fined $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for each subsequent offense, according to the law.Whats the rationale behind the law?More than 700,000 California women become pregnant each year, and half of those pregnancies are unintended.Yet, thousands of women remain unaware of the public programs available to provide them with contraception, health education and counseling, family planning, prenatal care, abortion or delivery, California legislators argue.Because pregnancy decisions are time sensitive, and care early in pregnancy is important, California must supplement its own efforts to advise women of its reproductive health programs, the law reads.Low-income women can receive access to free or low-cost family planning services through Californias Medi-Cali and Family PACT programs.But only Medi-Cal providers who are enrolled in the Family PACT program can enroll patients at their health centers.Thats why legislators argue that the most effective way to ensure women in the state quickly obtain the information and services they need to make and implement timely reproductive decisions, according to the bill, is by requiring licensed health care facilities -- regardless of their stance on abortion -- to inform women of their options.In addition, legislators argue its vital that pregnant women in the state know when they are receiving medical care from a licensed professional.This is addressed by the requirement that unlicensed facilities that advertise and provide pregnancy testing must disclose to clients that they are not licensed medical care providers.This portion of the law is also targeted at religious pregnancy resource centers because many of them are not licensed medical facilities, supporters of the legislation say -- adding that these facilities provide misleading information about the services they offer to women to deter them from getting an abortion.Whats happened since the law was passed?The legislation triggered lawsuits almost immediately after it was passed.One religious non-profit, the Scharpen Foundation, won its case against the state of California and will no longer have to adhere to the FACT Act.But other pro-life pregnancy centers have been widely unsuccessful in getting the law overturned, especially at a federal level.The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, commonly known by its acronym "NIFLA," and the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case, sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit enforcement of the Reproductive FACT Act.NIFLA claimed that the law violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected both arguments and upheld the law -- arguing that the state could regulate professional free speech and the law protects public health interests.On Nov. 13, the Supreme Court granted "certiorari," or a formal order, to only review NIFLAs free speech argument.What do opponents say?NIFLA, which first filed a legal challenge to the FACT Act in 2016, is a public interest law firm that gives legal counsel and training to pregnancy centers across the country.Roughly 135 pregnancy resource centers in California are members of NIFLA, Thomas Glessner, founder and president of the organization, told Fox News.With the Supreme Court case approved, this means that NIFLA will fight the law for each of its members collectively as opposed to each center individually fighting the law on its own.[The law] was a brilliant political move on their part, Glessner said.It mandates under law that the pro-life centers are advertising for abortion.But Glessner added that he thinks its scandalous that the law allows a multimillion-dollar abortion industry to bully small non-profits.While the case is related to abortion, the real issue here, he said, is compelled speech -- a form of speech that is presumably unconstitutional.Can the government impose and compel a faith-based ministry to proclaim a message that they are fundamentally opposed to with the risk of being fined or shut down?- Thomas Glessner Can the government impose and compel a faith-based ministry to proclaim a message that they are fundamentally opposed to with the risk of being fined or shut down?he asked.Thats the issue here.Glessner said he believes NIFLA, which will be represented in court by the Christian non-profit Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), is going to win going away, adding that the Supreme Court hates compelled speech, which is why Im confident well get the liberals on the court.In a statement to Fox News, Denise Harle, legal counsel for the ADF, said: "It is unjust for the government to force anyone to speak a message they disagree with -- and to punish them if they dont."What do supporters say?In a statement, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra vowed to uphold the law.Information is power, and all women should have access to the information they need when making personal health care decisions, Becerra said.The Reproductive FACT Act ensures that women in California receive accurate information about their health care options, including whether a facility is a licensed medical provider.The California Department of Justice will do everything necessary to protect womens health care rights."The attorney general was not immediately available for additional comment when contacted by Fox News.What will happen if NIFLA wins?What if they lose?The Supreme Court is intervening to regulate these types of laws and provide a sense of consistency.Indeed, other courts in states like New York, Texas and Maryland have invalidated laws that were similar to California's FACT Act.But some states -- such as Hawaii and Illinois -- currently have similar laws in place, which, like in California, have also led to appeals and other lawsuits.Specifically in Hawaii, Glessner said, one of the pregnancy resource centers is located in a church.If we win California, that should take care of Hawaii, he said.Its hard to speculate on what will happen if NIFLA either wins or loses.But if NIFLA does win the case, the law will be enjoined and California will not be able to enforce it, Glessner said.If NIFLA loses, similar laws could be passed in the future.Additionally, a win in this case would mean "the Supreme Court confirms that all Americans are free to speak or not to speak, without coercion from the government," Harle said."The Supreme Court has continually held that the government cannot compel people to speak messages against their consciences, and we are very hopeful well prevail on this basic question of free speech," she added.
GOP Sen. Johnson comes out against tax reform bill:::::Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., announced his opposition Wednesday to the GOP's tax bill, the first Republican senator to do so.In a statement, Johnson said both the House and Senate versions of the legislation unfairly benefited corporations over so-called "pass-through entities" -- such as partnerships and limited liability corporations -- whose owners do not pay taxes at corporate rates.Johnson's opposition was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."If they can pass it without me, let them," Johnson told the paper."Im not going to vote for this tax package."In his statement, Johnson said pass-through entities "truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind."He added that, "I do ... look forward to working with my colleagues to address the disparity so I can support the final version."Republicans are hoping to push the legislation through Congress by Christmas, but Johnson's opposition could signal potential obstacles for that plan.Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the full Senate and can afford to lose just two GOP senators and still prevail.Vice President Mike Pence would cast the tie-breaking vote.In addition to Johnson, GOP Sens.Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee have expressed concerns about the bill but have not signaled which way they would vote.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Menendez corruption and bribery trial: What to know:::::The jury concluded deliberations for the day Wednesday without reaching a verdict in Sen. Bob Menendez's bribery and corruption trial.Earlier this week, the jury informed the judge that they could not come to a verdict.But the judge implored them to continue with deliberations, saying to "take as much time as you need" and to "not hesitate to re-examine your own views and change your own opinion if convinced it is erroneous."The defense teams filed a joint trial brief asking that the court recognize that a hung jury is a legitimate outcome and informing the jury of that fact.They also stated that the judge should be able to poll the jurors if they remain deadlocked.The judge also spoke with individual jurors earlier this week about comments a dismissed juror made to the media over the weekend.Menendez spoke to the press briefly before leaving the courthouse, saying he was grateful to the jurors who were "standing up" for him."For two and a half years I have never wavered from asserting my innocence," he said."And I appreciate that there are clearly jurors who are asserting my innocence as well in the jury room."Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, is accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence.Both Menendez and the doctor, Salomon Melgen, have maintained their innocence.Its the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.What is Menendez accused of?Menendez, 63, accepted an abundance of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.In return, he used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgens business interests, according to prosecutors.Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf.Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.Melgen paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.NBC NEWS CALLS MENENDEZ A REPUBLICAN IN CORRUPTION CASE REPORT Federal prosecutors said that Menendez sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldnt afford.The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.What is the senators defense?Both Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.Throughout the trial, defense attorneys sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.At times emotional, Menendez has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.What has happened in the trial so far?Defense attorney Raymond Brown got into a spat with U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls at the start of the trial.Brown accused Walls of being extremely prejudicial to the defense.Walls had denied Menendezs request that the trial be recessed during critical Senate votes, stating that his job should not be treated differently from that of a construction worker or cab driver.MENENDEZ CASE MAY IMPACT VOTES The trial has also focused on a meeting former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set up with Menendez and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a nearly $9 million Medicaid billing dispute.Sebelius testified in court that the incident was the first time in her role in government that she was asked by a senator to take a meeting with another senator.She said that Melgen wasnt specifically mentioned in the meeting but that she assumed his case was the topic.Prosecutors didnt call Reid to testify before it rested its case on Oct. 11.Walls declined to throw the case out despite the defenses objections that the accusations against Menendez didnt fit the narrow definition of bribery that was a result of a 2016 Supreme Court decision.Menendez also had a little help from his friends.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., arrived at the Newark courthouse to testify as a character witness for the Democratic senator, Grahams office confirmed.He testified about his experiences with Menendez in the Senate, unrelated to the underlying charges, his office said."In very difficult circumstances he always keeps his word," Graham, said during his testimony."A handshake is all you need from Bob.He's a very honest, hardworking senator."Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., has also appeared in support of Menendez.Menendez was also emotional when he was asked by reporters about his colleagues support.Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S. During that case, prosecutors argued that Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, robbed Medicare of as much as $105 million, according to the newspaper.His sentencing has been delayed until after this trial.WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.What happens if Menendez is convicted?If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov.Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.Vice President Mike Pence has said that it would be "altogether inappropriate and wrong" for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate.However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didn't resign.Menendez is up for reelection next year.He was selected to replace former Gov.Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005.The most serious charges against the two men carry a maximum 20-year prison sentence.Fox News Tara Prindiville and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Army drops plans to give waivers to recruits with history of mental illness:::::The Army's top officer said Wednesday that the service had "rescinded" a controversial memo permitting people with a history of severe mental illness to seek waivers allowing them to join up.Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told reporters the memo was "unauthorized" and its author did not have the authority to change the Army's recruitment policy."It was rescinded last night," Milley said of the memo, which was dated Sept. 7 of this year and initially reported by USA Today on Sunday."There wasnt a change in policy," Milley added."There cannot be a change in policy by someone who doesnt have the authority to change policy.I know it sounds circular."According to the memo, potential recruits with a history of self-mutilation, bipolar disorder, and drug and alcohol abuse would be eligible to obtain waivers to join the Army."For all waivers," the memo specified, "the burden of proof is on the applicant to provide a clear and meritorious case for why a waiver should be considered."Milley said the Army had done a "terrible" job explaining the waiver policy.He explained that in August, the Army delegated decisions on accepting recruits to Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Snow, the commanding general of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC).Snow has the ultimate authority over waivers."Theres a whole series of prohibitions from coming into the military," Gen. Milley said."We havent changed any of those."
Democrat congressmen push to impeach Trump: What to know about the process:::::Six Democratic congressmen moved to impeach President Trump Wednesday as they accused him of a litany of offenses that included obstruction of justice.Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, was among the lawmakers who pushed to impeach the president.Green although the rest of his party has largely stayed away from this effort has led the push to impeach the Republican president.He has encouraged his colleagues to vote on impeachment by Christmas.The five articles introduced by the congressmen hits Trump on the FBIs investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.They accuse him of obstructing justice and undermining the independence of the federal judiciary among other offenses.What does impeachment mean?Congress has the ability to remove a sitting president from office before his term is finished an authority granted by the Constitution.Along with the president and vice president, all civil officers in the U.S. can be removed from office if they are impeached and convicted of bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors, according to the Constitution.How does impeachment work?Article One of the Constitution grants the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment; the Senate has the sole authority to try all impeachments.If the president is being tried, the Chief Justice should preside over the trial.The House must vote, requiring a simple majority, to adopt the articles of impeachment.Before a vote, the House Judiciary Committee or another special committee may investigate the articles.The House is able to vote to impeach even if the committee does not recommend doing so.Should that vote be reached, then the House will appoint members called managers to act as prosecutors as the proceedings will then go to trial in the Senate.The president is able to have defense attorneys.The Senate would need a two-thirds majority in order to find the president guilty.Should that happen, the president would be removed from office and the vice president would take the presidents place.Have other presidents been impeached?Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached and neither were removed from office.Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998.While an impeachment proceeding began against former President Richard Nixon, he was not actually impeached.Nixon was the only president to resign from office.What do the Democrats have to say?House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has publicly opposed impeachment calls.Most Democratic lawmakers have also stayed away from Greens efforts.But six Democrats came together on Nov. 15 to introduce five articles of impeachment against Trump.Aside from Green, they are: Steve Cohen of Tennessee, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Marcia Fudge of Ohio, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and John Yarmuth of Kentucky."We have taken this action because of great concerns for the country and our Constitution and our national security and our democracy," Cohen said.Cohen also said he understood the unlikeliness that the cohorts efforts will be successful but said they would nonetheless hold briefings on the impeachment articles.Aside from obstruction of justice, the congressmen allege that Trump accepted emoluments from foreign states and from the U.S. government without congressional approval.They also say he has undermined the federal judiciary as well as the freedom of the press.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
100 lawmakers urge US Army not to award Bergdahl possible $300G in back pay:::::One hundred members of Congress have signed a letter urging the U.S. Army not to award Private Bowe Bergdahl a possible $300,000 in back pay after he was given a dishonorable discharge and demoted for deserting his base in Afghanistan in 2009.We are writing to encourage the United States Army not to award Private Bowe Bergdahl any back pay prior to or subsequent to separation from the United States Army, read the letter obtained by Fox News.The initiative was spearheaded by Republican Arkansas Rep. Rick Crawford and signed by 99 other members of Congress.As Members of Congress committed to our servicemen, servicewomen, and veterans, we understand the incredible sacrifice that is required of those in uniform ... With that said, it is our firm belief Private Bergdahl should not be awarded back pay.Bergdahl could reportedly be entitled to as much as $300,000 in compensation for the time he spent in Taliban captivity after he deserted his post in 2009 and was captured.All captive servicemen are entitled to receive a compensation worth around $150,000 in addition to the basic pay they were supposed to receive while in captivity.Despite being given a dishonorable discharge and demotion from sergeant to private, he remains eligible for significant back pay, the letter added.It remains up to the military officials to ultimately decide whether the deserter should receive the pay.Bergdahl's admission of guilt in court complicated the issue, with a military official telling the Army Times that In order to figure out what hes owed, youre basically going to have to start from that point of captivity.The military could determine that since he deserted the post, he might not be entitled at all and could possibly even owe money to the army, if he is found to have been overpaid since his return.Bergdahl narrowly avoided jail time after the judge spared him a prison sentence earlier this month.President Trump called the ruling a complete and total disgrace.
Treasury boss Mnuchin, wife raise eyebrows with big money photo op:::::It started as a routine photo op: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and wife Louise Linton touring the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing Wednesday to view the first $1 bills bearing Mnuchin's signature.It ended in an image that set social media alight: Mnuchin and Linton flashing an uncut sheet of singles for the camera in a manner that some Twitter wags compared to a Hollywood blockbuster.Others drew attention to Linton's attire, which one social user compared to Christopher Lloyd's Judge Doom character in the 1989 movie, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, and the Scotland-born actress Linton have been repeatedly criticized over bad optics.In August, Linton had to apologize for lashing out on Instagram at a woman who criticized her for taking a trip on a government airplane.LOUISE LINTON, WIFE OF TREASURY SECRETARY, APOLOGIZES FOR INSTAGRAM OUTBURST On Aug. 21, Linton posted a photo showing her and Mnuchin stepping off the plane, and noted some of the designer clothes she was wearing.When a user posted, "Glad we could pay for your little getaway.#deplorable," Linton fired back."Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband?"she asked rhetorically."Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?Im pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did."The next day, Linton apologized for her comments, which she called "inappropriate and highly insensitive."Mnuchin himself has not escaped scrutiny over his travel.Last month, the Treasury Department's inspector general found that Mnuchin did not violate any laws by taking seven trips on government planes, but did note that his office had failed to provide proof of why he needed to use the more costly mode of travel.
Trump halts speech to sip water, sparks Marco Rubio flashback:::::In his first public speech since returning from a trip to Asia, President Trump made a splash at the White House on Wednesday.The president halted his speech to take a sip from a water bottle while discussing his 13-day trip something for which he previously poked fun at Sen. Marco Rubio.I am pleased that since January of this year, Japanese companies have announced investments in the United States worth more than $8 billion, 17,000 jobs, Trump remarked, before interrupting himself to look for water.They dont have water, thats OK. Finding the water near the podium, he drank from the plastic bottle and Rubio noticed.Similar,but needs work on his form.Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera.But not bad for his 1st time, Rubio tweeted.In February 2013, Rubio while giving a rebuttal to President Obamas State of the Union address paused mid-speech to take a gulp from a water bottle.Politicians, along with comedians from the likes of "Saturday Night Live," mocked the senator, and before he was president, Trump took a jab at him too, tweeting: Next time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottlewould have much less negative impact.Trump also poked fun at Rubios gaffe while on the presidential campaign trail, tossing water to a Texas crowd in imitation of the Florida senator.Its Rubio!Trump said to a cheering crowd.
Sen. Ron Johnson first to oppose tax package:::::**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?Sign up here.** On the roster: Sen. Ron Johnson first to oppose tax package - Alabama state Republicans yet to speak out on Moore - House Dems promote new candidates for 2018 - Mueller shifts focus to foreign lobbying - But wheres the toast?SEN. RON JOHNSON FIRST TO OPPOSE TAX PACKAGE WSJ: Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) said he opposes the Senate Republican tax package, saying it unfairly benefits corporations more than other types of businesses.If they can pass it without me, let them, Mr. Johnson said in an interview.Im not going to vote for this tax package.Mr. Johnsons position could undermine the Senates efforts to pass a tax plan by early December or get the bill to President Donald Trumps desk by Christmas.Other Senate Republicans have expressed concerns.Jeff Flake of Arizona, for example, has worried about deficits and Susan Collins of Maine has worried about Republican plans to repeal the insurance coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act as part of a tax overhaul.Until now, no Senate Republican has come out definitively against the GOP tax plan.The risk for Senate Republican leaders is that other Republicans get behind Mr. Johnsons opposition.Ryan says including ObamaCare repeal would have complicated vote - Fox News: House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told a Fox News town hall Tuesday that Republicans did not include a provision to repeal ObamaCares individual mandate in the House tax reform bill because we didnt want to needlessly complicate a vote on the measure later this week.The House did this already, Ryan told hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Herndon, Va.The House passed our health care bill back in May, which repealed the individual mandate.So, were on record in favor of this.Ryan spoke hours after Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee said they would insert a provision repealing the health care requirement into their bill in an attempt to finance the legislations deep tax cuts.The House is expected to vote on its tax bill later this week.Perry Bacon Jr.: Taking on Obamacare with tax reform may backfire for Republicans - FiveThirtyEight: There is an obvious policy rationale for their move.Republicans are trying to find ways to raise government revenue to limit how much the federal deficit would increase if their proposed tax cuts for both individuals and corporations went into effect.In a report this month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate (the requirement that people purchase health insurance or pay a fine) would save the government $338 billion over the next 10 years.Thats because without the requirement, the CBO calculates that 13 million Americans would not get any insurance, thereby saving the federal government from the costs for people whose coverage (either via Medicaid or the health care exchanges established under Obamacare) is heavily subsidized by taxpayers.Pence meets with CEOs in effort to sell tax plan - WSJ: Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday he believes that Republicans will secure the votes to pass a tax overhaul that is now making its way through Congress, whatever the outcome of the volatile Senate race in Alabama.Speaking at The Wall Street Journals CEO Council gathering, Mr. Pence also called on the business executives in the audience to help make the case for passage of the tax plan.He exhorted them to talk to employees and suppliers and to hold town hall style events in company cafeterias to build momentum THE RULEBOOK: POWER IN NUMBERS The true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of these vices, and have made no less than four regular experiments by EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLIES, convened for the special purpose, to apply a remedy.Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Federalist No.20 TIME OUT: CUE HAMILTON History: After 16 months of debate, the Continental Congress, sitting in its temporary capital of York, Pennsylvania, agrees to adopt the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union on this day in 1777.Not until March 1, 1781, would the last of the 13 states, Maryland, ratify the agreement.In 1777, Patriot leaders, stinging from British oppression, were reluctant to establish any form of government that might infringe on the right of individual states to govern their own affairs.The Articles of Confederation, then, provided for only a loose federation of American states.Congress was a single house, with each state having one vote, and a president elected to chair the assembly.Although Congress did not have the right to levy taxes, it did have authority over foreign affairs and could regulate a national army and declare war and peace.Amendments to the Articles required approval from all 13 states.On March 2, 1781, following final ratification by the 13th state, the Articles of Confederation became the law of the land.Flag on the play?- Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD Trump net job-approval rating: -20 points Change from one week ago: up 0.4 points [President Trumps score is determined by subtracting his average job disapproval rating in the five most recent, methodologically sound public polls from his average approval rating, calculated in the same fashion.]ALABAMA STATE REPUBLICANS YET TO SPEAK OUT ON MOORE WaPo: The chorus of national Republican leaders speaking out against Alabama GOP nominee Roy Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct grew louder Tuesday But this growing criticism has yet to sweep over key Republicans in Alabama, many of whom are standing by the former judge or staying silent on the controversy.Republican officials in Alabama continued to express skepticism about the accusations made against Moore, saying that they are still waiting for the evidence to back up the allegations.As of today, with the information thats been introduced to me, and if these charges are not proven to be true, then I would continue to support and vote for Judge Moore, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) said Tuesday in an interview with CNN.Others in the state said that there is little that can be done, as the Dec. 12 election to fill the seat vacated by Sessions earlier this year approaches.Senate Republicans believe Trump is last hope for ousting Moore - AP: Having pushed publicly and privately for Moore to get out of the race, Republicans believe their last best shot is Trump, who they hope can persuade his fellow political rebel to fall in line.Trump has given little indication of whether hes interested in playing the role of party heavy.Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has echoed other Republican leaders, saying last Friday that Moore should step aside if the allegations are true.But as other Republicans began to call for Moore to quit the race, Trump was notably silent in public.On Tuesday, he didnt address the issue when he spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, nor did he respond to shouted questions about Moore as he entered the White House that night.Bannon isnt going anywhere - Politico: Steve Bannon is not backing away from Roy Moore, the controversial Alabama Senate candidate facing a slew of accusations that he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers.Two sources close to the former White House chief strategist and Trump campaign CEO swatted down speculation that Bannon was reevaluating his support for Moore in the wake of the allegations.It is 100% fake news that Steve Bannon would abandon Judge Moore, said a source familiar with Bannon's thinking, comparing the situation with the Access Hollywood video scandal that prompted calls for Donald Trump to drop out of the presidential race.He is standing with Judge Moore through thick and through thin.The polls show the people of Alabama believe Judge Moore is innocent until proven guilty the source added.HOUSE DEMS PROMOTE NEW CANDIDATES FOR 2018 The Hill: House Democrats campaign arm has named the first round of candidates to its Red to Blue program as the party looks to highlight promising Democratic challengers ahead of the 2018 midterms.All but one of the 11 candidates highlighted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) are running against GOP incumbents.Only three in districts that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016, suggesting that they face a tougher path to victory.But Democrats are emboldened by the early signs from these campaigns, as well as the national trends tilting in the partys direction The House is in play in 2018 and incredible Democratic challengers are stepping up to run across the largest offensive battlefield in a decade.These candidates have their own unique experiences rooted in these districts, but what they all have in common are records of service to their communities and our country, DCCC chairman Ben Ray Lujn said in a statement.MUELLER SHIFTS FOCUS TO FOREIGN LOBBYING The Hill: The cottage industry of foreign lobbying is taking center stage as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates the activities of people in President Trumps orbit.Foreign advocacy work in Washington is common, lucrative and occasionally controversial, but has rarely received the front-page scrutiny its attracting now.The Hill spoke with a half-dozen foreign agents for this story.Most of them requested anonymity to speak freely about their thinking and about foreign advocacy work in general.Working as a foreign agent has long been a profitable niche.While there are smaller-dollar contracts, foreign entities will sometimes pay firms $100,000 or more per month for representation in Washington.Domestic clients typically pay much less.But taking on these kinds of clients comes with its own risks, both legally and otherwise.Lobbyists have to make tough decisions about what clients to accept, given the possible damage to their reputation if they are seen as helping corrupt or repressive actors overseas.PLAY-BY-PLAY House Democrats file articles of impeachment against President Trump -

Roy Moore's sexual assault allegations have Republicans looking at options to replace him:::::Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore continues to face fallout after allegations that he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls surfaced last week.The Republican National Committee pulled its funding from the candidate Tuesday after five women went on record to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers.One woman who claimed Moore inappropriately touched her said she was 14 at the time of the alleged assault.Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations.Still, prominent Republican lawmakers have been scrambling to come up with a plan, as Alabama election law says its too late to remove the former judge from the ballot.From launching a last minute write-in campaign to a White House intervention, here are some possible outcomes for the Dec. 12 election.The party can revoke its nomination The Alabama state GOP could revoke Moores nomination, but party chairwoman Terry Lathan told AL.com that idea is far-fetched.Members of the partys steering committee have not decided what action if any to take regarding Moore, she said.While its too late to remove Moores name as the partys nominee from the ballot, Lathan could move to have Moores election nullified with Alabamas secretary of state office.At this moment, that is a very unlikely scenario, as of today, Lathan told AL.com.Yanking the nomination would be a blow to members of the party who backed Moore and could cause a rift within the state GOP.Steven Taylor, a political science professor and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Alabamas Troy University, noted to Fox News that stripping Moore of the nomination could also present legal issues and speculated that the party isnt willing to go that route.Its unclear what effect that [option] would have.Would there be another election?Would she [Alabama Gov.Kay Ivey] appoint someone?Would the second place winner automatically win?Thats an issue the courts would have to deal with, he said.A write-in candidacy is launched Republicans could launch a write-in campaign.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that his party is in discussion here about how to salvage this seat, if possible.And it appears as if the only option would be a write-in.But a write-in candidacy presents two problems: finding a likable candidate who would garner enough support and the possibility that such a candidate could split the vote, paving the way to victory for the Democrats' nominee, Doug Jones.Sen. Luther Strange, the Republican incumbent, wouldnt be popular enough to cumulate enough support, some Alabamans warn.Strange, who was backed by establishment Republicans and President Trump, lost the special election primary to Moore in September.If he was popular enough [to launch a successful write-in], he would already be the nominee, Taylor said.Another contender for a write-in candidate is Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- whose old seat Moore hopes to snag.That obviously would be a big move for him and for the president, McConnell said at the Wall Street Journals CEO Council meeting.Richard Fording, a University of Alabama political science professor, argued that because McConnell is such an unpopular politician in Alabama, his support for a write-in candidate might not matter to voters.I would be skeptical that enough of Roy Moores supporters would show up and vote for a write-in, he said to Fox News.Moore drops out of the race Despite multiple Republicans calling for Moore to step aside, this option seems the most unlikely, according to multiple Alabama politicos.Its not in his DNA to back down, Fording said.He noted that Moore was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice for defying federal law once when he refused to remove a boulder-sized Ten Commandments monument from the statehouse and again when he instructed probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples."It's not in his DNA to back down."- Richard Fording, University of Alabama political science professor Hes already been twice removed from a job because he wouldnt follow the rules, Taylor said.I cannot see him not fighting to stay the nominee no matter what.Moore wins, but the Senate votes to expel him This would be one of the most unprecedented options Moores opposition has since the last sitting senator to be expelled was in 1862 for supporting the Confederate rebellion.According to the U.S. Constitution, the House and Senate has the authority to expel a member with a two-thirds vote.Only 15 senators have been expelled since 1789.Expelling him would also set a major precedent, said Derek Muller, an election law expert and associate law professor at Pepperdine University School of Law.Expel him, but not others accused of wrongdoing over the course of their lives?Why him?What makes it different?Muller said."It would be a rather unusual beginning."- Mitch McConnell But McConnell said Tuesday that its safe to say the process for expulsion in the Senate ethics committee would immediately begin if Moore is sworn in.It would be a rather unusual beginning, McConnell said.Moore wins, but hes shunned Senators dont necessarily have to be promoted to a committee, so his colleagues could essentially shun him when hes there, Taylor said.Moore wins, and becomes an active senator Moore winning the election and becoming seated as a U.S. senator is the most straightforward option at this point, Muller said.He added that the question is whether this scandal can fade away over the next month or if it will continue to plague him.With the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday and big Alabama college football games on the horizon, the prospect of Alabama voters losing attention in the scandal is possible, Taylor said.He would really be disruptive in the Senate, Taylor said.I really do wonder, if hes going to be a pain in the rear end most of his time there, would Republicans just as soon have Jones and live with it.Jones is far more liberal than Roy Moore and would probably have a liberal voting record, but being from Alabama, youd think hed at least sometimes vote with Republicans.Alabamas governor intervenes in the race Despite rumors that Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, could step in and change the election date, her communications director said no.The governor is not considering and has no plans to move the special election for U.S. Senate, he told AL.com.Rescheduling the election would present due process challenges, Muller said.Theres potential constitutional concerns there to delaying an election just because you dont like whats happening with a candidate from both a practical and legal standpoint, Muller said.Secretary of State John Merrill noted that absentee and overseas voters have cast ballots already in the election since Oct. 18, according to AL.com.Some have speculated that Ivey could call on Strange to resign from his Senate seat early and appoint a new special election to take place.But experts and lawyers have said this option is unlikely and could be a legal headache.Were still looking into whether she would even be allowed to do this, a source in the Alabama secretary of states office told Fox News.Trump intervenes in race Some Republicans have asked Trump to involve himself in the special election as he returned to the U.S. from a 12-day trip across Asia.President Trump should intervene in Alabama immediately, Scott Jennings, a Kentucky Republican who worked as an adviser to former President George W. Bush, said on Twitter.Moore is embarrassing the president and puts his agenda in jeopardy.While Trump has not publicly commented on the Moore kerfuffle yet, he did reportedly speak to McConnell while he was in Asia.McConnell implored him to help push out Moore, Politico reported.
Tax reform back at center stage with Trump home from Asia:::::President Trump was in Asia while all the heavy lifting on the tax bill was going on in Washington.But now hes back in the saddle, ready to swing deals and rein in wavering lawmakers as both the House and Senate begin to take consequential votes.Mr. Trump will be on the phone with Republican holdouts, hosting lawmakers at the White House and closely coordinating with GOP leaders to corral the votes needed for a tax reform bill that is at the center of the presidents economic agenda.There is going to be very active engagement, a White House official said.The president mostly kept his cards close to his vest on key details of the reforms.But hell have to start wheeling and dealing on issues ranging from the fate of state and local tax deductions, or SALT, to the size of the expanded child tax credit.Mr. Trump launched a similarly aggressive outreach to lawmakers during the attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare.The outreach included the president hosting senators and their families at White House dinners and posing in group photos with them.He later described the shmoozing as a chore.That effort, however, faltered, and the bill failed in the Senate by a single Republican vote.The White House insisted this time will be different.This is probably the most unified that the White House and the Hill Republicans have been on an issue, and we are very, very optimistic that we will be able to deliver on this, a senior administration official said.Mr. Trump returned late Tuesday from a nearly two-week trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.He was on separate phone calls Wednesday with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, to strategize the path forward on the tax bills.Huddling Thursday with House GOP members at the Capitol before they put the tax reform package to a vote, the president is expected to both applaud the progress getting the bill to the floor and muster last-minute votes for passage.Mr. Trump is pleased with the shape the bills have taken, according to White House sources, and he is determined to keep the process on track to get the bill to his desk by Christmas.There is a long tradition of horse trading by presidents to get major legislation through Congress.Former President Bill Clinton took the practice to extreme levels and was criticized for buying votes with carveouts and pork spending.To get the North American Free Trade Agreement across the finish line, Mr. Clinton resorted to a dizzying array of deals.Political activist Ralph Nader at the time said Mr. Clinton was buying these votes, offering an assorted variety of pork and taxpayer-funded goodies in order to obtain one vote after another.Former President George W. Bush was more subtle, perhaps because of the example of his predecessor.But he still engaged in plenty of political arm-twisting to get his priorities passed, including on the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.Former President Obama wasnt shy about pressuring lawmakers.He publicly pushed Capitol Hill Democrats to force through the health care bill now known as Obamacare using budget reconciliation rules that prevented a filibuster.The tax reform bills are moving through Congress under the same rules.Although Mr. Ryan joked before Mr. Trump left on the Asia trip that his absence would avoid any interference when the House bill was introduced, the president has not been completely absent from the process.He managed with a tweet to prod the Senate to include the repeal of the Obamacare mandate in its bill, freeing up $300 billion over 10 years to help pay for some of the tax cuts.From here on out, though, the president will exert a hands-on influence.
Formal complaint: Oregon state senator harassed 15 women:::::PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - An Oregon state senator has filed a formal complaint against a male senator over allegations of sexual harassment and is demanding his expulsion from the Oregon Senate.In a complaint filed Wednesday, Sen. Sara Gelser says Sen. Jeff Kruse touched her breasts, put his hand on her thigh, kissed her cheek and whispered in her ear so closely that he left her ear wet.The Corvallis Democrat says at least 15 other women have come forward about the Roseburg Republican.Gelser posted on Twitter last month that she had been the subject of Kruses unwanted advances.Senate President Peter Courtney has removed Kruse from his committee assignments and now says he will appoint an independent investigator.Kruse has denied any impropriety.He didnt return a phone message left Wednesday.
Greenhouse gas plan being worked out by Republicans, Democrats:::::Amid a raging debate about how the U.S. should approach climate change, Republicans and Democrats on a key Senate panel Wednesday sought common ground on the best ways to continue reducing the nations greenhouse gas emissions through research, innovation and private-sector leadership.Lawmakers on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who often disagree sharply with one another over the proper federal role in regulating energy development and dealing with global warming, were able to find something of a consensus at Wednesdays hearing on the need to pursue technological advancement.Despite deep policy differences, leaders of both parties agree that it is by no means impossible to continue cutting emissions while at the same time growing the nations economy.This is not an either-or situation.In order for the United States to continue to be the worlds leader in this clean energy revolution we need both federal investment in technology and common-sense regulations, said Sen. Thomas R. Carper, Delaware Democat and his partys ranking member on the committee.The hearing, which included witnesses from the manufacturing sector, energy research hubs and other panelists, came just days after new data found that the U.S. is on track to cut its greenhouse gas emissions further this year.Studies from the Global Carbon Project found that American pollution is expected to drop at least 0.4 percent this year despite President Trumps decision to pull the U.S. from the global Paris climate treaty and a broader effort by the administration to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations.The report found that countries that have signed on to the Paris deal, such as China and India, are projected to have significant increases in their emissions this year.Those countries increases are projected to fuel a global spike in emissions by at least 2 percent this year.Critics of the deal, including committee Chairman Sen. John Barrasso, said innovation in energy production, in the auto sector, the manufacturing industry and elsewhere across the economy is key to continuing those reductions.Since 2005 the United States has reduced its combustion-related carbon dioxide emissions more than any nation in the world, the Wyoming Republican said at Wednesdays hearing.New technologies have improved how we use energy to reduce emissions.Indeed, U.S. emissions across the board have decreased dramatically over the past several decades.More recently, much of the drop can be attributed to market shifts away from coal and toward natural gas, which emits less pollution.In the manufacturing sector, pollution has dropped substantially.Ross Eisenberg, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, told the committee Wednesday his industry has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent over the past decade while increasing its value to the economy by 19 percent during the same time period advancements that he said largely have come from innovation, not government rules.All the trend lines on every kind of major pollution have gone straight down, he said, assuring the committee that his industry, despite its opposition to many specific Obama-era regulations, wants to address climate change.We believe we should be acting on climate, period, he said.Manufacturers are taking matters in their own hands.At the outset of the Trump administration, officials said a top priority was to provide the manufacturing sector and other industries regulatory certainty, and to eliminate the confusion and legal mess that resulted from many actions over the past eight years.Specialists say that type of regulatory certainty is necessary if the nation is to continue greenhouse gas reductions.A sound regulatory framework is critical to providing companies the certainty necessary to make the large long-term investments in innovation at scale, said Zoe Lipman, director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups and labor unions.
Second Colorado lawmaker accused of sexual harassment:::::DENVER (AP) - A second Colorado lawmaker on Wednesday denied allegations of sexual harassment, this time made by a political organizer who claimed the legislator improperly touched him at a 2012 fundraiser.Democratic Rep. Paul Rosenthal of Denver denied the claims by Thomas Cavaness, which were reported by The Denver Post Wednesday.Cavaness, an organizer for U.S. Rep. Jared Polis 2018 gubernatorial campaign, told the Post that Rosenthal touched him inappropriately and tried to kiss him at the fundraiser in early 2012.Cavaness said he was inspired to come forward by the #metoo social media movement in which victims of sexual harassment and abuse have come forward worldwide.I also want it to be known that there are men who are victims, and this is a systemic problem within the gay community in my opinion, he said.Both men are openly gay.Rosenthal was a candidate for the state House at the time of the alleged incident.He was elected in November 2012.Rosenthals attorney, Harvey Steinberg, emphatically denied the claims.Steinberg said Cavaness filed a formal complaint with the state House leadership on Tuesday - but that since Rosenthal wasnt a member of the House at the time of the alleged incident, the Legislature had no formal jurisdiction to handle the complaint.We unequivocally deny any of it took place, Steinberg said.Secondly, there are numerous Facebook posts and correspondence between the two of them until recently, but there is nothing to suggest any romantic interest on the part of either party.There is no jurisdiction, and nothing happened, Steinberg said.Efforts to reach Cavaness by telephone and via social media werent immediately successful.Democratic House Speaker Crisanta Duran issued a statement saying she would not comment due to my role in investigating any formal complaints.But Duran did suspend Rosenthal from his post as vice chair of the House Local Government Committee, said House Democratic spokesman Dean Toda.On Friday, Duran removed Democratic Rep. Steve Lebsock from his post as chair of the Local Government Committee and called on him to resign from the Legislature after Rep.Faith Winter and two other women alleged he sexually harassed them.Winter, an Adams County Democrat, filed a formal complaint about an alleged 2016 incident involving Lebsock on Monday.Lebsock, who also represents Adams County and is running for state treasurer in 2018, has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Federal officials ask Jackson about voided immigration law:::::JACKSON, Miss.(AP) - The U.S. Justice Department wants Mississippis largest city to prove its cooperating with federal efforts to deport people in the country illegally.However, a state law overturned the Jackson policy that federal officials are asking about.Jackson was one of 29 jurisdictions nationwide getting letters Wednesday demanding they show compliance with federal law on sharing immigration information.The law says no government can restrict the ability of a government entity to maintain, send or receive information about someones citizenship or immigration status.Jackson could lose federal aid if it doesnt comply.Jackson in 2010 passed an ordinance preventing police officers from asking about immigration status.Gov.Phil Bryant signed a law in March that immediately voided the ordinance.City spokeswoman Kai Williams says lawyers are evaluating the letter.
Inside the Beltway: Feisty support emerges for GOP tax reform:::::The dreaded floor vote looms over Capitol Hill on Thursday.The House will signal yea or nay on Republican tax reform, accompanied by much handwringing from Democrats, who treat the vote like a fearful spectacle though many supported key components of the bill in a previous era.Much of the news media refuses to frame the legislation as positive or productive, embracing the standard narrative that the bill favors the rich and hurts the poor or words to that effect.But wait.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise points to some strong support for the GOP plans.Mr. Scalise points to 50 major retailers and industry groups that applaud the bill.They include National Retail Federation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Trucking Association, the American Bankers Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Consumer Technology Association, AT&T, Ford Motor Co., the National Restaurant Association, the Association of Broadcasters, Raytheon, UPS and Walmart.As an American automaker with more than 85,000 U.S. employees, we appreciate your positive steps and strong commitment to advance tax reform to help make our nation more competitive by supporting American investment and jobs, Ford advised House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in an open letter.We support ongoing consideration of tax reform legislation in the House and Senate.The proposals under discussion could provide meaningful tax relief to a number of American families as soon as next year, many of whom shop in our stores and online with us every week, Walmart said in its own statement of support.Those with an eye on the American family have some good things to say as well.More than 30 conservative interest groups also have stepped forward with feisty support, including the Family Research Council, the Family Business Coalition, the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Prosperity and Citizens Against Government Waste.Americas families have already waited too long for tax cuts that let them keep their hard earned dollars and care for their families.We must not fail them, Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed said in an open letter sent to every member of the House and Senate.The tax reform bill is a tax cut and a jobs bill.Growth.Growth.Growth.Long overdue.Great news for taxpayers and those left behind by eight years of slow growth under Obama, advised Americans for Tax Reform.GORSUCH, SESSIONS AND COTTON These are learned lawyers to be reckoned with.On Thursday a big flock of them will descend on the nations capital for The Federalist Societys National Lawyers Convention, staged at a historic hotel a few blocks north of the White House and boasting much august discussion and 90 speakers.Among those appearing during the three-day gathering: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sen. Tom Cotton, White House Counsel Donald McGahn and stalwart attorney C. Boyden Gray.For the uninitiated, The Federalist Society has been around since 1982, is composed primarily of conservatives and libertarians and was founded on these principles: That the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.A LITTLE RICKETY The age of 70 was proclaimed the new 50 a few years ago.While thats a great marketing phrase, it may not work so well in politics.The Democratic Party has an old people problem, writes Alexi McCammon, deputy new editor for Axios.She has done all the math.Democrats are rethinking their future but doing it with the leadership of old men and women deeply rooted in the past.The top three House Democrats in leadership are all nearly 80 years old.By the numbers: The average age of Democrats serving under them is 61.Three of the most talked-about 2020 contenders are Sen. Bernie Sanders, 76; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 68; and former Vice President Joe Biden, 74, Ms. McCammon notes.Why it matters: Older Democratic leaders are unwilling to give up their seats, even as younger Democrats call for a new generation of leaders, as top House Democrat Linda Sanchez said when she asked for Nancy Pelosi to step down.And former DNC Chair Howard Dean told MSNBC: Our leadership is old and creaky, including me.USE THE FORCE, HARRY Talk about a cameo appearance: British PrincesHarry and William secretly play Stormtroopers in the upcoming Star Wars film, reports Hollywood Reporter correspondent Alex Ritman.Episode VIII: The Last Jedi will be released Dec. 15.The pair of famous royals will be seen guarding Finn a lead character played by John Boyega in an elevator.Singer Gary Barlow and actor Tom Hardy also will be the scene, also in Stormtrooper garb in clandestine roles.THE AMERICAN FAMILY IN THE AGE OF TRUMP An event on note Thursday: The American Family in the Age of Trump, a collection of pollsters, family experts and other sages who will meet at the American Enterprise Institute.Karlyn Bowman, the organizations senior analyst, will moderate a discussion of the Trump-era family and present a survey conducted in concert with Brigham Young University and Deseret News.The findings reveal substantial differences between the views of those who voted for President Trump and those who favored Hillary Clinton.But it also reveals some concerns and family experiences cut across lines of political division, the organizers advise.See the event streamed live beginning at 9 a.m.ET at AEI.org.POLL DU JOUR 60 percent of registered U.S. voters have never heard of Judge Roy Moore; 27 percent of those who know of him have an unfavorable opinion, 14 percent a favorable opinion.59 percent of voters have never heard of Sen.

GOP working good tax policy for year-end victory:::::ANALYSIS/OPINION: It is more likely than not that we are heading into a virtuous cycle for the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill if they seize the moment.With the House expected to pass their version of tax reform legislation in the next 24 hours, the bicameral legislative process begins with continued urgency and increasingly strong chances for success.The Senate Finance Committee is aggressively moving its version of the bill for potential Senate floor consideration before Thanksgiving, allowing enough time for a conference committee to work and for both houses to pass one reconciled bill before years end.This timeline matters for two reasons, one that is symbolic and another that is practical.If President Trump can sign a tax reform bill before years end, he will invalidate the talking point that his administration did not have a significant legislative accomplishment in its first year.More substantively, if he can sign a bill before years end, taxpayers can begin to see larger paychecks as soon as January, as the amount withheld from them will decrease, giving them more money to spend or save immediately.The political benefits of passing tax reform are many: Republicans need a legislative victory.They did use the Congressional Review Act in the House to undo regulations that cost the economy billions of dollars.They did pass a sweeping reform of the Veterans Affairs administration.The House has nearly 300 bills awaiting Senate consideration.The Senate did confirm a stellar Supreme Court justice.But this is not nearly enough, and to date no Republican is yet satisfied.The White House and Capitol Hill Republicans need something to unify them for tougher battles ahead: the year-end spending fight, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) deadline, potential new sanctions against Iran, an infrastructure bill next year and a potential bill to legislate direct subsidies to health insurers to offer low-cost, subsidized plans to low-income Americans.These are all politically fraught and complicated issues that will require Republican unity for success to be possible.A stronger economy will improve the political environment.Americans appear increasingly positive about the economy, but sustained economic growth above 3 percent is not assured.Two consecutive quarters of over 3 percent GDP growth is encouraging and significant but could be short-lived.Tax reform will provide an additional boost.Republicans appear to be facing headwinds in next years midterms, but an improved economy, with benefits broadly shared, will limit the pessimism and potentially create real optimism.The tax reform plan could be a real success.Cutting the corporate tax rate will lead to new capital investment and employee raises.Doubling the standard deduction will double the number of Americans in the zero-rate category.Expanding the child care tax credit will make it easier to start and raise a family while working.A one-time repatriated profits tax rate will bring trillions back from overseas, and when coupled with the lower corporate rate, that money can stay here and be invested into the economy.The dual goal of the tax reform effort is to provide a significant tax cut for the middle class, while also spurring greater economic growth.A proposal to repeal the individual mandate tax penalty, which the Senate is including, will add at least $300 billion in revenue to the bill, and may be useful as the conference committee works to reconcile the two versions.It will serve as a middle-class tax cut, as Vice President Mike Pence said today.Americans for Tax Reform has found that 79 percent of households who were forced to pay the fine earn less than $50,000 annually, and 37 percent of those forced to pay the fine earn less than $25,000 annually.Perhaps most importantly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has theorized that repealing the individual mandate will cause 16 million Americans to lose health insurance, on the absurd belief that they will choose not to continue coverage if the mandate is not in place.Once the mandate is gone, any new legislative effort to replace Obamacare will no longer be subject to the 16 million coverage loss projection from CBO.Passing tax reform by years end will create a virtuous cycle where incomes and consumer spending rise, capital investment spikes and economic growth increases, which will benefit all taxpayers specifically and all Republicans generally.Good policy makes good politics.Matt Mackowiak is the president of Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C.-based Potomac Strategy Group, a Republican consultant and former press secretary to two U.S. senators.His politics podcast, Mack on Politics, is on iTunes and Google Play.
Lawmakers clash over American Bar Associations role in rating judges:::::The American Bar Association said Wednesday it didnt ask one of President Trumps judicial nominees about his personal opinions on abortion, saying the ABAs negative evaluation of him was instead based on peers who doubted he could leave his politics behind if he becomes a federal judge.Pamela Bresnahan, chair of the ABAs Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, was defending her organizations role in the vetting process for federal judges, which involves rating a presidents picks.In the latest case of Leonard Grasz, nominated to the 8th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals, the ABA rated him not qualified.Hes one of four Trump picks to get the lowest possible grade so far.During his confirmation hearing earlier this month, he alleged the organization gave him the poor review after asking about his personal stance on abortion, while negatively referring to conservatives and Republicans as you people.Ms. Bresnahan denied that claim in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee.The evaluators upon questioning the peers came to the conclusion that he could not be open minded, free from bias, when he made the jump from advocate to judge, she said.Peer reviews said over and over again, We do not think he can follow the law.Democrats have called the ABAs rating the gold standard for evaluating judicial picks, and have suggested low ratings should be a black mark against nominees, but Republicans have been more skeptical.Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, told Ms. Bresnahan the American Bar Association is a liberal advocacy organization.You have First Amendment rights, said Mr. Sasse.Whats not OK is being a liberal advocacy organization and be masquerading as a neutral, objective evaluator of these judicial candidates.Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said out of the 15 people on the American Bar Associations Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, none have donated to pro-life organizations, but a couple have donated to Emilys List, an organization dedicated to electing pro-choice candidates.He also said theres a political party bias.In terms of presidential campaigns, three of the 15 [committee members] donated to Hillary Clintons campaign, said Mr. Cruz.Of the 15, zero donated to President Trumps campaign, [Mitt] Romneys campaign, or John McCain.The Texas senator also took issue with the ABA evaluators who interviewed Mr. Grasz, saying one had donated to a number of Democratic politicians including Mrs. Clinton, former President Barack Obama, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Kamala Harris of California.He said the other evaluator had opposed Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alitos confirmation because his record was insufficiently pro-choice.Ms. Bresnahan said their evaluations arent tainted by the lawyers own personal politics.The committee has spent hundreds of hours both as evaluators and reviewers, she said.The Judiciary Committees top Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said if the allegations were true about the American Bar Associations political bias, then 49 of Mr. Trumps 53 nominees wouldnt have had qualified ratings.The statistics dont indicate that thats the case, she said.None of Mr. Obamas judicial nominees were given a not qualified rating by the American Bar Association, according to a Congressional Research Service report, while seven of President George W. Bushs picks earned the low score.President Bill Clinton had four.The committee also heard from two of Mr. Trumps nominees for the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday, James Ho and Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett.Justice Willett drew most of the questions from senators, who asked about his prolific use of Twitter.Mr. Willett said he wasnt sure if he would stop tweeting even if he were to be confirmed.Sen. Al Franken, Minnesota Democrat, specifically questioned Justice Willett about a tweet sharing a Fox News article on a transgender student wanting to play on a high school softball team.The justice added the comment Go away A-Rod to the tweet.Justice Willett called the tweet a joke.A-Rod had just recently accepted his year long suspension from Major League Baseball and that happened at the same this article came out, and I think it was admittedly a ham-handed attempt at levity, he said.Any human being looking at that, looks at that as a disparagement of her, as making fun of her playing softball on a mens team, telling her to go away, said Mr. Franken.Does this display the kind of judgment that we want for a lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary?
Patrick Leahy says bacon joke by Don Willett, judicial nominee, is same-sex marriage attack:::::One of President Trumps judicial nominees found himself in the odd position of defending a two-year-old bacon joke Wednesday when a Democratic senator called it an attack on same-sex couples.Texas Supreme CourtJustice Don Willett may wind up serving on the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, but the record now includes bacon questioning related to his Twitter feed in April 2015.Sen. Patrick Leahy claimed multiple times that the judges support for marrying bacon a joke was an underhanded jab at the Supreme Courts historic Obergefell v. Hodges case.The Obergefell decision you equated that constitutional right to same-sex marriage with a constitutional right to marry bacon Why have you so attacked Supreme Court decisions?the Democrat asked.I dont believe I had attacked Supreme Court precedent, but certainly, if I were fortunate enough to be confirmed as a federal circuit judge, I would be honor-bound, categorically, absolutely, to follow every controlling precedent, the judge replied, the Washington Free Beacon reported.He then continued: Senator, as for the bacon tweet, that was the day after the Obergefell decision was issued and it was my attempt to inject a bit of levity.The country was filled with rancor and polarization.It was a divisive time in the nation.And you think that cut back the divisiveness with a comment like that?an incredulous Mr. Leahy replied.Conservatives, most prominently then-Sen. Rick Santorum, did frequently make slippery slope arguments against gay marriage that if a person desires a marriage that isnt possible under current law, that doesnt make that definition of marriage unjust.In more-serious iterations than bacon, they warned that if the male-female definition of marriage is thereby unjust, so too would be such limitations as age, number and lack of blood relationship in other words, gay marriage would lead to child marriage, polygamy, and marrying parents or siblings.Nevertheless, the conservative website Hotair mocked Mr. Leahys line of questioning as pitifully stupid, particularly since the judges Twitter feed prior to his nomination was filled with jokes.Its a testament to how inoffensive his humor is that the best Democrats could do after scouring his social media for problematic tweets was a jest about his, and Americas, love affair with bacon, which is an Internet genre unto itself, writer Allahpundit said.I dont think Willetts meaning with the bacon tweet went any deeper than seizing on something topical at the time, the Supreme Courts deliberations on gay marriage, and turning it into what might politely be called a dad joke.The judge punctuated his exchange with Mr. Leahy by saying every American is entitled to equal worth and dignity.
New Bush groping accuser says former president wasnt in wheelchair:::::WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) A Broadway actress says she was groped by former President George H.W.Bush in 2009, before he started using the wheelchair that a spokesman has cited in previous apologies.Megan Elizabeth Lewis tells NJ.com that Bush was standing when he grabbed her buttocks at the performance of a musical in Houston.She says she was upset by a spokesmans statement that Bushs arm sometimes falls on the lower waist of people when he is in his wheelchair.The spokesman, Jim McGrath, did not respond to a request for additional comment Tuesday.Six other women have said Bush grabbed their buttocks as they stood next to him for photos.The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual assault without consent, but is using the names of women who have spoken publicly.
GOP Sen. Ron Johnson: I do not support House, Senate tax plans:::::Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, on Wednesday announced he opposes the GOPs current tax overhaul plans in both the House and Senate, saying they dont do enough to boost small businesses.Mr. Johnson said in a statement that its important to strike a proper competitive balance between larger corporations and smaller pass-through companies that file their taxes as individuals and are often taxed at levels higher than the 35 percent corporate rate.These businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind, Mr. Johnson said.Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions.I do, however, look forward to working with my colleagues to address the disparity so I can support the final version, said Mr. Johnson, a past co-founder of a manufacturing company.Assuming no Democrats vote yes, Republicans can lose no more than two votes in the Senate and pass a bill using fast-track rules that allow them to approve a plan with a simple majority.SEE ALSO: NFIB endorses Senate tax plan Republicans did try to address such small businesses in their tax plans, saying tax rates for the smaller companies had to at least be competitive with a new lower corporate rate of 20 percent, down from 35 percent.The House plan provides a new 25 percent rate for certain income for pass-through companies, and the Senate plan includes a 17.4 percent deduction for such businesses.But lawmakers did tweak the provisions in both cases to try to make the benefits apply to more companies, after the National Federation of Independent Business said the initial House version left too many small businesses behind.The NFIB, a top small business lobbying group, announced its support for the changes in both plans.
Lawmaker wants ethics probe of sexual harassment settlement:::::FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - A Democratic lawmaker in Kentucky says he has asked a state ethics commission to investigate a sexual harassment settlement involving four members of the House of Representatives.Rep. Jim Wayne says he filed a complaint with the Legislative Ethics Commission, which has the power to subpoena witnesses.He wants the commission to investigate a sexual harassment settlement involving former Republican House Speaker Jeff Hoover and three other GOP lawmakers.Hoover acknowledged the settlement and resigned from his leadership position earlier this month.He is still in the legislature.House Republican leaders have hired a law firm to conduct their own investigation.The commission investigated sexual harassment allegations against former Democratic Rep. John Arnold in 2014.The commission voted to fine him $3,000.
Utah lawmakers reject anti-harassment training for lobbyists:::::SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A panel of Utah lawmakers rejected a proposal Wednesday that would have required lobbyists to undergo annual anti-harassment training in order to be licensed to lobby at the state Capitol.The proposal, which could still be considered and passed during the upcoming Legislative session, came as waves of sexual harassment allegations have surfaced in governments and businesses around the country.Utah already requires lawmakers and staff to undergo training about harassment thats based on sex, religion, race or other factors, but not lobbyists who frequent the Capitol and meet privately with lawmakers and staff.A legislative committee declined to endorse the proposal Wednesday as lawmakers cited concerns about regulating guests at the Capitol.Legislative lawyers and the Utah lieutenant governors office, which regulates lobbyists, said the proposal wasnt prompted by bad behavior but is something they began looking at in May, long before allegations of harassment and assault were made public against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, sparking similar allegations to surface against powerful men in media, politics, entertainment and other industries.Requiring anti-harassment training for lobbyists helps ensure that the state is doing what it can to create a safe workplace at the Capitol, said Thomas Vaughn, the Legislatures Associate General Counsel.Its just meant to be careful and to have a process in place in the hopefully never-happening event that one of these situations occurs, Vaughn said.The proposal would have allowed the lieutenant governors office to issue a fine of up to $2,000 and suspend a license to lobby for up to five years if a lobbyist is found to have harassed someone.Republican state Rep. Brian Greene, of Pleasant Grove, said he didnt like the burden it would put on lobbyists and lobbyist regulators.I think its pretty clear whats appropriate and what isnt, Greene said.I hate to get into the false sense of security that we can somehow educate people on what appropriate behavior is and inappropriate behavior is.Democratic state Rep. Patrice Arent, of Millcreek, said lobbyists arent regular guests at the Capitol and are already treated differently than the general public, being required to get a license and wear a name tag in the statehouse.Arent sid she was discriminated against when she used to lobby at the Capitol but didnt immediately offer further details.It happens, she said of harassment.You need to open your eyes and to know that common sense doesnt solve these problems.She later told The Associated Press in an email that she faced discrimination at the Capitol dating back to the 1970s when she was an intern and in the decades following when she worked as a legislative attorney, when she lobbied on behalf of attorney generals office and served a lawmaker.
Indicted Maryland legislator charged with tipping off target:::::ANNAPOLIS, Md.(AP) - A Maryland state senator already indicted on charges that he accepted illegal payments while using the word lollipop as a code for every $1,000 he expected to collect was indicted again after investigators say he tipped off the target of a federal investigation, the U.S. attorneys office said Wednesday.A federal grand jury indicted Sen. Nathaniel Oaks on an obstruction of justice charge.An attorney for the senator did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Oaks, a 71-year-old Baltimore Democrat, had agreed to cooperate with the FBI by recording his conversations with the target of a new investigation.At the direction of the FBI, Oaks covertly recorded his telephone conversations and in-person meetings with the target from Jan. 9 until March 30, the U.S. attorneys office said.The target is not identified.Oaks allegedly approached the target March 17 at a bar in Annapolis without recording or disclosing the conversation to the FBI, telling the target what we talked about, just say no.Oaks again allegedly approached the target in the hallway of a state government building in Annapolis and said: Im going to ask you for something, just say no.The indictment alleges that the statements were intended to dissuade the person from engaging in the activity that was the subject of the criminal investigation, the U.S. attorneys office said, adding that Oaks and the person had discussed the activity in a recorded conversation earlier that day.The target understood from Oaks statements on the two days that the senator was warning him not to engage in the activity because there was a criminal investigation underway, prosecutors said.The original indictment earlier this year charged Oaks with wire fraud, honest services wire fraud and violations of the Travel Act for allegedly accepting illegal payments in exchange for using his official position to benefit an individual on business-related matters.His trial is scheduled for April.In the initial case, when a cooperating source asked Oaks how much the senator should be paid for filing a $250,000 bond bill for a project, he asked the lawmaker: How many lollipops should I bring, a question Oaks avoided answering directly, saying he had faith in him.An affidavit says the source and Oaks had established the word lollipop as a code word for $1,000, stemming from the time he put a Tootsie Pop in his mouth to halt open discussion of monetary amounts.The case stems from an investigation dating to 2015, when Oaks was a member of the House representing a district in Baltimore.Oaks represented Baltimore in the House of Delegates from 1983 until early 1989.In 1988, he was convicted of theft and misconduct in office charges for stealing thousands of dollars from his re-election fund.He received a five-year suspended sentence and lost his House seat as a result.But in 1994, Oaks was re-elected to the House, where he served until February, when he was appointed to replace a senator who retired.Oaks faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, 20 years in prison for honest services wire fraud and five years in prison for each count of the Travel Act.He also faces 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge.
Marco Rubio: Donald Trump needs to work on his water drinking:::::President Trump interrupted his speech Wednesday on his Asia trip a couple of times to drink from a bottle of Fiji water and Sen. Marco Rubio said his drinking game needs some work.When Mr. Rubio, Florida Republican, gave the Republican response to then-President Obamas State of the Union speech in 2013 his first big moment in the national spotlight he interrupted his speech to drink some water.The moment became an internet phenomenon and widely snarked at, a history that led Fox News producer Pat Ward to copy Mr. Rubio on his tweet of the Trump water moment, essentially soliciting the senators comment.The quick-witted Mr. Rubio did not disappoint.Similar, but needs work on his form, Mr. Rubio replied on Twitter.Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera.But not bad for his 1st time, the senator jokingly continued.
Donald Trump declares Asia trip a roaring success: America is back:::::President Trump said Wednesday that his trip to Asia was a success in bolstering security and trade, and that his visits demonstrated a renewed respect for the U.S. abroad.My fellow citizens, America is back and the future has never looked brighter, Mr. Trump said in remarks delivered at the White House.The president touted building a united front against North Korea and negotiating billions of dollars in trade deals during a nearly two-week trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.He said that he was greeted with great respect at every stop and forged stronger relations based on his America first foreign policy agenda.Mr. Trumps triumphant return was overshadowed by the political turmoil over allegations that former Judge Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in Alabamas special election for U.S. Senate, had pursued romantic relationships with teenage girls when he was in his 30s, including inappropriate advances on a 14-year-old girl.As he exited the room after his remarks, Mr. Trump did not answer questions about Mr. Moore that were shouted by reporters.In his remarks, the president said he made good on his vow to put American citizens and American workers first, and that was a position of strength that garnered respect.I swore that in every decision and with every action I would put the best interest of the American people first, Mr. Trump said.That is exactly what I have done.The 12-day journey was the longest visit by a U.S. president to Asia in more than a quarter-century.It coincided with rising tensions with North Korea, and Mr. Trump made confronting the nuclear threat from the rogue regime a top priority in each visit.The other goals outlined by Mr. Trump were to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the region and reverse years of what the president described as lopsided trading relationships.Mr. Trump said he met each of the goals.However, the presidents critics were less than impressed with his performance.President Trump failed to make meaningful progress on these critical economic and security issues during his trip to East Asia, said Sen. Edward J. Markey, Massachusetts Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asia Subcommittee.It is past time for President Trump to focus on working with our partners to find a meaningful diplomatic solution to the North Korea crisis, he said.President Trump was too distracted by the pomp and circumstance in Beijing to extract meaningful economic and security concessions from China.
Town officials cancel vote on town manager amid criticism:::::EAST GREENWICH, R.I. (AP) - Officials in a Rhode Island town have postponed a vote to reinstate a town manager whose appointment was voided by a judge.The East Greenwich Town Council canceled its Tuesday night meeting after residents filled the room and open government advocates criticized it.The council president says the room was at capacity.A Superior Court judge ruled last week that the process of appointing Gayle Corrigan as town manager in June violated the states open meetings law.The councils agenda Tuesday included consideration of Corrigans appointment and ratification of all actions she has taken as town manager.The open government coalition ACCESS/RI says the public wasnt given proper notice that Corrigans decisions would be retroactively ratified and the council was thumbing its nose at the publics right to know.
Prosecutor urges jury to convict former state senator:::::SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico state prosecutors urged a jury Wednesday to convict a former state senator on corruption charges during closing arguments at trial.Assistant Attorney General Clara Moran described defendant Phil Griego as a savvy political puppeteer who used his role as lawmaker to profit from the sale of a state-owned building without proper disclosure.She said Griego avoided numerous opportunities to disclose his personal financial interest as a real estate broker in the 2014 sale of the building as he guided approval of the transaction past a state agency, the Legislature and a public buildings commission.Griego acted as a real estate agent for the buyer of the property, earning a $50,000 commission.He had the duty - the duty to disclose that he had a direct conflict, a direct pecuniary benefit, and he never did that, Moran said.He is on trial for abusing his office.Griego, a Democrat, says he broke no laws and testified on Tuesday that he had tried to avoid any appearance of a conflict between his responsibilities as a lawmaker and opportunities for financial gain as a real estate broker.Griego served 18 years in the Legislature before resigning in 2015 at the conclusion of a legislative investigation that showed he violated Senate ethics rules and constitutional provisions barring lawmakers from using their office for financial benefit.Griego said he signed off on the conclusions of that investigation because he thought it would end the matter.Prosecutors on Wednesday highlighted evidence that Griego repeatedly failed to report his financial interest in the sale of state property.Moran reviewed testimony showing how Griego arranged for a colleague in the House of Representatives to introduce legislation authorizing the sale without mentioning communications with the prospective buyer, and intervened repeatedly in the Senate to ensure the legislation would advance to a final vote of approval in February 2014.Griego said he felt there was no personal financial conflict at the time, and that he signed an agreement to receive a commission only after the Legislature had adjourned that year.Criminal charges against Griego include fraud, bribery, perjury, violating the ethical principles of public service, unlawful interest in a public contract and violating financial disclosure requirements.A conviction on all counts would carry potential penalties of more than 23 years in jail and fines up to $33,000.Defense attorneys were scheduled to provide their closing arguments later in the day.Defense attorneys have highlighted that several top state officials backed the property sale and knew of Griegos involvement.
The Latest: Pence says Trump, GOP governors have momentum:::::AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - The Latest on the Republican Governors Association meeting in Texas (all times local): 4:20 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence has told Republican governors at a gathering in Texas that momentum is on our side despite last weeks electoral defeats and sagging White House approval ratings.Pence said at the Republican Governors Associations annual meeting on Wednesday that President Donald Trump is committed to overseeing historic tax cuts years end.Pence called the association the most effective political organization in the United States and said that he and Trump are pretty fond of our governors.The feeling may not be entirely mutual.Republicans have to defend 26 governorships in 2018, after losses last week in New Jersey and Virginia.Trumps approval ratings are falling and, so far, Congress hasnt kept promises to repeal the nations health care law or cut taxes.___ 2 p.m.The chairman of the Republican Governors Association insists that President Donald Trumps flagging popularity wont hinder the partys effort to defend 26 governorships in next years midterm elections.Speaking to reporters at an association meeting in Texas capital on Wednesday, Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walker said he has urged his colleagues to, Run your own race.He said that if Democrats only argument is that Republicans are in the same party as someone, thats going to be a failing race.Florida Gov.Rick Scott agreed, but added that its important for Congress and the president do what they said they were going to do.Trumps approval ratings are falling and the Republicans who control Congress have thus far failed to make good on their vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act.They are still working on tax cuts.___ 1:40 a.m. Republicans who control two-thirds of the nations governorships are gathering in Americas largest red state, in part to strategize about how to maintain their political dominance.But electoral defeats last week, unfulfilled congressional promises and President Donald Trumps plummeting popularity have some attendees concerned about a shifting political landscape.Vice President Mike Pence will be the keynote speaker during the two-day gathering of the Republican Governors Association, which kicks off Wednesday in Austin, Texas.Some of the former Indiana governors ex-colleagues may need a pep talk.Just as some Democrats facing tight midterm elections once shied away from President Barack Obama, there might now be Republicans tempted to tip-toe away from their partys leadership.
Governor urges Trump to extend temporary immigration status:::::BOSTON (AP) - Republican Massachusetts Gov.Charlie Baker is urging President Donald Trumps administration to extend Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, Hondurans and El Salvadorans.Baker said in a Monday letter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security that losing roughly 12,000 immigrants from those nations would be a huge blow to his state.He said Massachusetts 6,000 El Salvadorans, 5,000 Haitians and 1,000 Hondurans with TPS are overwhelmingly hard-working people who make valuable contributions to the states economy and culture.For the past year, the Trump administration has been reviewing the temporary authorizations, which are generally granted to residents of nations impacted by natural disasters and civil wars.The administration has until Nov. 23 to decide whether to extend TPS for Haitians beyond Jan. 22.Hondurans and El Salvadorans also have looming deadlines.
