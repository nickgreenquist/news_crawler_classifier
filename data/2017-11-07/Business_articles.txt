Why Qatar Airways has bought 9.6% of Cathay Pacific:::::THIS mornings news that Qatar Airways, a national carrier with global ambitions, has bought nearly 10% of Cathay Pacific, Hong Kongs flag-carrier, came as a shock for financial markets.Shares in Cathay Pacific dropped in value by around 5% in the minutes after trading resumed first thing today.But the fact that Qatar Airways was in the market for another acquisition came as no surprise for analysts in the aviation industry.Since 2015 Qatar has acquired 20% of IAG, a European group of airlines that flies 100m passengers a year, 10% of LATAM, Latin Americas biggest carrier, and 49% of Meridiana, an Italian outfit.It has even been invited by the Indian government to start up a new airline there with 100 jets.So why has Akbar al-Baker, Qatar Airways outspoken chief executive, gone on a shopping spree worth billions of dollars?On the face of it, such a strategy does not look wise.Etihad, a rival to Qatar Airways based nearby in Abu Dhabi, attempted to do the same a few years ago, buying stakes in Air Berlin, Alitalia and Jet Airways.The idea was to use the carriers to feed passenger traffic from Germany, Italy and India via its hub in Abu Dhabi.But the strategy came unstuck this year with the bankruptcy of Air Berlin and Alitalia, the collapse of which some sources estimate may have cost Etihad as much as $4.5bn in losses.Following this path would bring Qatar few rewards especially as, in the words of Greg Waldron of Flightglobal, an online trade journal, Qatar seems to invest in far flung assets with no clear synergies .But Mr Baker has no intention of repeating Etihads errors.The search for partners abroad is not simply an attempt to drive passenger traffic through its base in Doha.Instead, it is a search for allies in the face of hostility from its neighbours in the Middle East.As Gulliver writes in this weeks print edition : Since June, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed a blockade on Qatar, banning its flag-carriers jets from their skies.That has resulted in the cancellation of over 50 daily flights to these countries, costing the airline a tenth of its business and $500m in profit this year, calculates Diogenis Papiomytis of Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy.But even before the blockade Mr Baker surely knew that there were limited growth opportunities in the Middle East.The forces that caused passenger traffic through the region to sky-rocket over the past decade are unwinding.Terror attacks and geopolitical instability have reduced the attraction of transiting through airports such as Doha.Low oil prices have sapped demand for business-class travel from energy companies in the region.Cheaper fuel prices, combined with the introduction of fuel-efficient aircraft such as Boeings 787 jetliner, have improved the economics of direct flights between Europe and Asia that do not require a stop in the Middle East.And so buying up other airlines in the oneworld allianceof which Qatar Airways, IAG, LATAM and Cathay Pacific are membersseems more sensible than throwing more aircraft and investment at its Doha base.So far the strategy has worked: the share prices of IAG and LATAM have surged since Mr Baker first took stakes in the duo.Cathay Pacific also looks like a good bet.Its shares have been performing poorly since it revealed its first annual loss since 2008 earlier this year.But if its managers play their cards right, the Hong Kong-based carrier should be able to benefit from the rapid rise in outbound tourism from mainland China.Whether this increase in Qatars influence in the aviation industry is good for consumers is another question.Most airline bosses Gulliver has met in recent months predict privately that within the next five or ten years, the long-haul international travel market will be controlled by three massive airline groups.This, they predict, will be the result of the members of todays alliancesoneworld, Skyteam and Starbuying stakes in each other.The Cathay Pacific deal adds more evidence to the argument that Mr Baker wants Qatar Airways to be the leader of one of these future goliaths of the aviation industry.So far, the only major oneworld carrier to refuse Qatars advance point blank is American Airlines, a determined enemy of the Gulf carriers, which Mr Baker tried and failed to buy 10% of earlier this summer.With the global airline business moving towards consolidation, however, how much longer it can resist its rivals courtship remains to be seen.
Where economic power goes, political power will follow:::::BACK in 1992, in his book "The End Of History and the Last Man", Francis Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy had triumphed.The return of authoritarianism in Russia, and the growing power of absolutist China, has undermined the argument at the geopolitical level.And events in recent years have caused questions on the ability of liberal democracy to flourish in some countries where it seemed established.The new nationalists that have emerged in Turkey, Poland and Hungary tend to regard disagreement with their policies as unpatriotic and are quick to brand opponents as being in the pay of foreign powers.What used to be called "the Whig theory of history" saw civilisation steadily moving in a more open, liberal direction.In the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, countries became more democratic, first allowing most men and then women to vote.There were setbacks in the 1920s and 1930s with the emergence of fascism and, of course, the imposition of communism in eastern Europe and China after the Second World War.But in a broad swathe of the world - North America, western Europe, Australasia and Japan - democracy seemed well established.And that democracy was accompanied by the growth of welfare states, higher taxes on the wealthy and a general decline in inequality.The period from the 1940s to the 1980s was known as the "Great Compression".The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989-1991 brought a range of new countries into the sphere; Latin America also moved in a democratic direction.But all was not completely well, as I outlined in a 2013 book "The Last Vote".The respect held by voters for politicians fell sharply; turnout (and party membership) also dropped.People became both cynical and complacent about democracy.Cynical in the sense that they felt politicians were all the same; complacent in that they did not really fear the loss of their rights.The financial crisis that began in 2007 has, by creating an additional degree of voter dissatisfaction, further undermined democracy.If we go back to the growth of democracy in 19th century Britain, one can see the gradual extension of the franchise through the reform acts; broadly speaking to the middle classes in 1832, to the better-off urban workers in 1867; agricultural workers in 1884; and to all other men (and women over 30) in 1918.As those classes joined the electorate, parties tailored their policies to appeal to them.Education for children after 1870, for example and old age pensions in 1909.The emergence of the welfare state and managed economies after 1945 arose from the demands of working-class voters and were also seen by the better-off as a price worth paying for avoiding either fascism or communism.In that sense, then, it might seem as if economic power followed political power; once given the vote, ordinary people backed policies that would redistribute income in their favour.But what if the sequence of events was reversed?The economic power of the middle classes helped get them the vote in 1832; the power of industrial workers, though strike action, earned them the vote later on; the mass mobilisation of women in the First World War turned into female suffrage.Citizens demanded the political status to match their economic power.By the same extension, then, we could see the rise of inequality since 1980s and the threats to democracy as two sides of the same coin.The wealthy used their economic power to fund politicians and bend the legislative agenda in their interest; the decline of manufacturing industry and trade unions in the west weakened the economic power of workers.The wealthy are more likely to vote and far more likely to have their voice heard.In his book "Unequal Democracy", Larry Bartels compared the voting patterns of US senators with the view of their voters, by income.He found that the views of those in the upper third of the income distribution received 50% more weight than those in the middle third.The view of those in the bottom third received no weight at all.Senators did not meet these people socially, or at fund-raisers.The potential feedback process is clear.The rich back politicians, allowing the latter to pass policies that favour the wealthy, giving them more money for political funding.The poorest voters are appeased with nods to cultural issues, as Thomas Frank argued in "What's the Matter with Kansas?".The rise of populism will not redress the balance; Donald Trump's cabinet, packed with billionaires, is pushing for a tax-cutting package that will mainly help the rich.The main economic impact of Brexit so far has been a squeeze on real wages thanks to a fall in the pound.Admittedly, the immigration issue does not fit easily into this template.Business owners tend to favour liberal immigration rules so they can attract the best workers.Still, note that those on the right may favour restrictions on movement of people but not on the movement of their capital.Perhaps we are not heading to the totalitarian nightmare pictured in George Orwell's "1984".But we could be moving close to the Roman model, under which in theory the system allowed for expression of the popular will, but in practice, rule by the rich occurred.The masses were kept happy with "bread and circuses"; the modern equivalent being junk food and reality TV shows.
A massive trove of data on offshore transactions is leaked:::::IN APRIL 2016, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) dropped a bombshell.Its articles about the Panama Papers, a leaked trove of documents which had been stolen from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm, sent shock waves round the worldfelling the leaders of Pakistan and Iceland, leading to multiple arrests and pushing several countries to tighten laws related to offshore financial dealings.The revelations also caused a further hardening in public attitudes towards offshore finance, which had been souring since the global financial crisis.Now the ICIJ and its 95 media partners around the worldincluding the BBC and the New York Times are back with another cache of pilfered files, this time dubbed the Paradise Papers.This latest batch of revelations, the organisations sixth substantial leak investigation, began on November 6th and will be rolled out over a week.It shines light on offshore transactions linked to hundreds of wealthy clients of Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm.These include politicians (Wilbur Ross, Americas commerce secretary, pictured), entertainers (U2s Bono) and even royalty (arise, Queen Elizabeth).The ICIJ promises a spectacle.As the first articles went out, the consortiums director, Gerard Ryle, wrote: Each [ICIJ] project, in turn, has generally involved more documents, more journalists and bigger revelations.And each, in turn, has prompted new levels of outrage.Judging from the first days output, however, the Paradise Papers may fall well short of their Panamanian predecessor.The articles are based on 13.4m documents initially leaked to Sddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), a German daily newspaper that was also the recipient of the Panama Papers leak.Just over half of these files come from Appleby and a service provider called Estera that used to be part of its stable.Around 6m are from the corporate registries of the Bahamas, Malta and other offshore centres.A much smaller number were plucked from the database of a Singaporean trust company.As with the Panama Papers, the SZ refuses to reveal its source or sources.The most eye-catching early stories concern Mr Ross, social-media firms and Britains monarch.Mr Ross, a private-equity boss turned senior member of the Trump administration, is reported to have held a 31% stake (through a buy-out firm he owns) in a company called Navigator, which received tens of millions of dollars for shipping oil for a Russian client.That client, a firm called Sibur, was part-owned by Russians with alleged Kremlin ties who are subject to American sanctions, including Gennady Timchenko, the former co-CEO of Gunvor, an oil trader.The ICIJ also reports that Yuri Milner, a Russian tycoon who invested in Facebook and Twitter, was secretly backed by two Russian financial institutions known for doing the Kremlins bidding.Stories about such connections are guaranteed a wide audience at the moment given heightened scrutiny of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow.Queen Elizabeths private estate, meanwhile, is shown to have invested millions of pounds in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio that was not previously disclosed.These revelations, however, are a far cry from what could be found on the darkest pages of the Panama Papers, which contained details of serious money-laundering lapses and secret accounts held by corrupt politicians and public officials, stuffed with money whose provenance took some explaining.There is no suggestion of illegal activity by Mr Ross, or of improper contact between him and Russian interests.A spokesman for Mr Ross said he recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, has had no contact with the sanctioned individuals, and was not even aware of them until this week.The ICIJ says that Mr Milner told it his firms investments, including those in Facebook and Twitter, have always been based on business merits and have nothing to do with politics.He said one of the Russian financial institutions was a passive investor in Twitter.His firm no longer owns a stake in either tech company.Britains royal estate, meanwhile, insists it derived no tax advantages from its investment in the Cayman fund.Thousands of private-equity and hedge funds are registered in tax-free or low-tax offshore centres.This typically has more to do with avoiding an extra layer of taxation in the country where the fund is based than with dodging tax owed in the investors home country, which still has to be paid.Moreover, such funds are hardly the preserve of the rich only: many pension funds invest through them.The ICIJ also highlights the royal estates investments in Threshers, an off-licence chain that went into administration, and BrightHouse, a retailer accused of exploiting poor people.These look unwise, but they could just as easily have been made onshore as offshore.Plenty of nefarious things happen offshore.A recent example is the giant, globe-spanning corruption scandal around 1MDB, a Malaysian state-investment fund from which investigators in several countries believe more than $4bn was misappropriated, much of it through offshore shell companies.But the first lot of Paradise Papers revelations seem to contain nothing so damning.Moreover, the focus on Bermuda risks reinforcing the stereotype that the real culprits are small, palm-fringed islands, when it is in fact the much larger, onshore financial centres, such as London and New York, that offer the most attractive combination of respectability and secrecymaking them magnets of unparalleled power for the worlds tainted money.
Investors call the end of the government-bond bull market (again):::::FOR the umpteenth time in the past decade, a great turning-point has been declared in the government-bond market.Bond yields have risen across the world, including in China, where the yield on the ten-year bond has come close to 4% for the first time since 2014.The ten-year Treasury-bond yield, the most important benchmark, has risen from 2.05% in early September to 2.37%, though that is still below its level of early March (see chart).Investors have been expecting bond yields to rise for a while.A survey by JPMorgan Chase found that a record 70% of its clients with speculative accounts had short positions in Treasury bondsie, betting that prices would fall and that yields would rise.Meanwhile a poll of global fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) in October found that a net 85% thought bonds overvalued.In addition, 82% of the managers expected short-term interest rates to rise over the next 12 monthssomething that tends to push bond yields higher.In part, this reflects greater optimism about the global economy.For the first time since 2014, America has managed two consecutive quarters of annualised growth of 3% or more.Forecasts for European growth have also been revised higher.Commodity prices, including oil, have been rising since June, which may be a sign of improving demand.The BAML survey found that, for the first time in six years, more managers believe in a Goldilocks economy (in which growth is strong and inflation is low) than in a secular stagnation outlook (in which both growth and inflation are below trend).If those views turn out to be correct, then it might be expected that bond yields would move a bit closer to more normal levels.Until the crisis of 2008, the ten-year Treasury-bond yield had been above 5% for most of the previous four decades.Investors also expect that, eventually, some kind of fiscal stimulus will be passed in Washington, DC.Of the fund managers polled by BAML, 61% expect tax cuts in the first quarter of next year.Such a package may increase the deficit and induce more economic growth; both factors would push bond yields higher.Another factor behind the upturn in yields is a shift in central-bank policy.The Federal Reserve has started to wind down its balance-sheet, by not reinvesting the proceeds when bonds mature.The European Central Bank will soon cut the amount of bonds it buys every month by half, to 30bn ($35bn).The private sector will have to absorb the bonds that central banks are no longer purchasing.Whether this will trigger the long-prophesied collapse of the bull market in bonds is another matter.Globally, there are no signs of a sustained surge in inflation (see previous article).PIMCO, a fund-management group, thinks that global economic conditions may now be as good as it gets.The momentum of growth may already have reached its peak.Central banks also know that higher bond yields can act as a brake on economic growth.In G20 advanced economies, the combined debt of households, governments and the non-financial corporate sector has been rising steadily and stands at 260% of GDP.Every debt is also a creditors asset, but higher borrowing costs can create awkward adjustments; in America, for example, 30-year mortgage rates are around half a percentage point higher than they were a year ago.So the pace of tightening will be very slow.And if the economy shows any sign of wobbling, central banks will probably relent.Perhaps the real area of worry should be the corporate-bond market.Low government-bond yields have pushed investors in search of a higher income into taking more risk.American mutual funds now own 30% of the high-yield bond market, up from less than 20% in 2008.The spread (extra interest rate over government bonds) on these riskier securities is close to its lowest level since before the financial crisis.BlackRock, another fund-management group, says there is a more favourable environment for issuers at the expense of lenders, especially as the quality of the covenants protecting lenders has been deteriorating.With the rate of bond defaults falling, and the global economy doing well, investors probably feel there is little to worry about.But there is a problem: the corporate-bond market is less liquid than it was before 2007, as banks have pulled back from their market-making roles.Investors have found it easy to get into the market in search of higher yields.When the time comes, they will find it much more difficult to get out.
As the global economy picks up, inflation is oddly quiescent:::::A FEW years ago, the news about the euro-zone economy was uniformly bad to the point of tedium.These days, it is the humdrum diet of benign data that prompts a yawn.Figures this week show that GDP rose by 0.6% in the three months to the end of September (an annualised rate of 2.4%).The European Commissions economic-sentiment index rose to its highest level in almost 17 years.Yet when the European Central Banks governing council gathered on October 26th, it decided to keep interest rates unchanged, at close to zero, and to extend its bond-buying programme (known as quantitative easing, or QE) for a further nine months.The central bank said it would slow down the pace of bond purchases each month, to 30bn ($35bn) from January.But Mario Draghi, the banks boss, declined to set an end-date for QE.A hefty dose of easy money will be necessary, he argued, until inflation durably converges on the ECBs target of just below 2%.It shows few signs of doing so, despite the economys strength.Underlying, or core, inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, fell from 1.1% to 0.9% in October, according to data published a few days after the ECB meeting.The euro zones miseries of 2010-12 were unique.But in its present, happier state of vigorous activity, low inflation and easy monetary policy, it is like many other big economies (see chart).After a decade of interest rates at record lows, those central banks that are inclined to tighten policy naturally attract attention.The Bank of Englands monetary-policy committee raised its benchmark interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% on November 2nd, the first increase since 2007.On the same day, the Czech National Bank raised interest rates for the second time this year.The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged this week, having raised them in March and June, but a further increase is expected in December.In Turkey, perhaps the only big economy that is obviously overheating, the central bankwhich has been browbeaten by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who believes high interest rates cause inflationopted on October 26th to keep interest rates on hold.Yet in most biggish economies, underlying inflation is below target (see chart) and monetary policy is being relaxed.Brazils central bank cut interest rates on October 25th from 8.25% to 7.5%.Two days later, Russias central bank trimmed its main interest rate, to 8.25%.This week the Bank of Japan voted to keep rates unchanged and to continue buying assets at a pace of around 80trn ($700bn) a year.These economies are gathering strength.It is a puzzle that, in such circumstances, global inflation is stubbornly low.To figure out why, consider the model that modern central banks use to explain inflation.It has three elements: the price of imports; the publics expectations; and capacity pressures (or slack) in the domestic economy.Start with imported inflation, which is determined by the balance of supply and demand in globally traded goods, such as commodities, as well as shifts in exchange rates.Commodity prices have picked up smartly from their nadir in early 2016.The oil price, which fell below $30 a barrel then, has risen above $60.This has put upward pressure on headline inflation: in the euro zone it is 1.4%, half a percentage point higher than the core rate.Where inflation is noticeably high, it is generally in countries, such as Argentina (where it is 24%) or Egypt (32%), that have withdrawn costly price subsidies and whose currencies have fallen sharply in value, making imported goods dearer.In Britain, rising import prices linked to a weaker pound have added around 0.75 percentage points to inflation, which is 3%.A second influence on inflation is the publics expectations.Businesses will be more inclined to push up their prices and employees to bid for fatter pay packets if they believe inflation will rise.How these expectations are formed is not well understood.The measures that are available are broadly consistent with the central banks inflation target in most rich economies.Japan is something of an outlier.It has struggled to meet its 2% inflation target in large part because firms and employees have become conditioned to expect a lower rate of inflation.Japans prime minister, Shinzo Abe, recently called for companies to raise wages by 3% in next springs wage round to kick-start inflation.Leave aside the transient effects of import prices, and inflation becomes a tug-of-war between expectations and a third big influence, the amount of slack in the economy.The unemployment rate, a measure of labour-market slack, is the most-used gauge.As the economy approaches full employment, the scarcity of workers ought to put upward pressure on wages, which companies then pass on in higher prices.On some measures, Japans labour market is as tight as it has been since the 1970s.Americas jobless rate, at 4.2%, is the lowest for over 16 years.Inflation has nevertheless been surprisingly weak.In other words, the trade-off between unemployment and inflation, known as the Phillips curve, has become less steep.A paper last year by Olivier Blanchard, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, found that a drop in the unemployment rate in America has less than a third as much power to raise inflation as it did in the mid-1970s.The central banks that see a need for tighter monetary policy are worried about diminishing slack.There are tentative signs of stronger pay pressures in Britain and America, and firm evidence of them in the Czech Republic, where wage growth is above 7%.Even so, with inflation expectations so steady, the flatter Phillips curve suggests that the cost for central banks in higher inflation of delaying interest-rate rises is rather low.The ECB is quite a way from such considerations.The unemployment rate is falling quickly, but remains high, at 8.9%.There is still room for the euro-zone economy to grow quickly without stoking inflation.The dull routine of good news is likely to continue.
Japanese cars enjoy an afterlife in Myanmar, but not for much longer:::::THE Japanese make cars that last but replace them relatively quickly.The average car in Japan is three years younger than in America.This combination of durable manufacturing and dutiful consumption of a prized national product works out well for the rest of the world; many countries import older Japanese cars in bulk.Secondhand vehicles fill vast parking lots in Japans port cities, awaiting shipment to New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.The third-most-popular destination is Myanmar, which imported over 80,000 used Japanese vehicles in the first nine months of this year, according to Japans International Auto Trade Association.Drivers believe that Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans can stand up to the countrys pockmarked roads, a faith not yet shown in South Korean and Chinese cars.There is only one problem, which is that Japan drives on the left, Myanmar on the right.As a consequence, most of Myanmars drivers sit on the wrong side of the car, where it is harder to see oncoming traffic.Settle into the passenger seat of a Honda taxi on a narrow rural road and you may be called upon to perform unexpected duties like telling your driver when it is safe to overtake a slow-moving lorry, without hitting a scooter, gaggle of children or bonnet-less jalopy travelling in the other direction.Not everyone executes these responsibilities successfully.Myanmar has the highest rate of deaths per vehicle among the ten members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), according to the World Health Organisation.Evidence of accidents litters the roadside outside Yangon: a silver Toyota that has lost everything in front of its windscreen and a red Suzuki hatchback that also now has a hatchfront.Myanmars government periodically tightens the import rules to keep older and less safe cars off the countrys roads.In October it said it will allow individuals to import only cars built in 2016 or after.And after this year, it will no longer grant import permits for right-hand-drive cars.The tighter policy may encourage local car assembly.Suzuki will open a new factory for left-hand-drive cars outside Yangon next year, adding to its existing plant in the citys east.But the change will oblige drivers to buy cars that are either more expensive or less authentically Japanese.The new left-hand-drive Corolla on display in the Toyota Mingalar dealership in Yangon, for example, was made in Thailand and is listed at $33,900, over 26 times the countrys national income per person.One other constituency may also come to regret the altered rules.Many poorer residents of Yangon, where motorcycles are banned, ride bicycles or sit in three-wheeled trishaws, trundling alongside the kerb.As more of Myanmars drivers shift to the left seat, oncoming traffic will be easier to spot; but these kerbside pedal pushers will be more exposed than ever.
A merger between CVS Health and Aetna could be what the doctor ordered:::::STANLEY and Sidney Goldstein would scarcely recognise their creation.In 1963 the brothers opened a humble storefront in Lowell, Massachusetts, selling health and beauty products.Determined to put customers first, they named their enterprise Consumer Value Stores.Today the Goldsteins startup, soon afterwards sold to a bigger firm, is nothing short of a health-care Goliath.Revenues at CVS Health reached $177bn last year, riches which come from 9,700 retail pharmacies and from its operations in mail-order drugs and sales of more expensive speciality medicines.The firm commands nearly a quarter of the American market for prescription drug sales (see chart).It is also the biggest pharmacy-benefit manager (PBM) in America, a type of middleman that negotiates bulk discounts on drugs with large pharmaceutical firms on behalf of employers and insurers.Yet even that formidable position is not enough.CVS is reported to have made a bid for Aetna, a big American health insurer (both firms have refused to comment publicly).Aetna, which had revenues last year of about $63bn, is in a different business, serving mainly corporate clients by providing health insurance for their employees.The two companies already have a relationship, however, since CVS has a contract to serve as Aetnas PBM.If consummated, the transaction would be one of the biggest ever in American health care (and a tie-up between the two would doubtless encourage other transactions of a similar nature).That raises two questions.Why would the two be contemplating a deal?And crucially, given the tendency of prior mergers to fatten profit margins rather than lower prices, would such consolidation yield benefits to consumers?Start with the reasons for a deal.Health care is becoming increasingly unaffordable for American consumers.Since 2014, total health-care cost inflation has been 6-7%, owing to growth in the cost of everything from doctors and hospitals to medical devices and drugs.Such large rises cannot continue indefinitely.Drug retailers in particular fear the prospect of Amazon entering their business.The e-commerce titan was recently reported to have sought regulatory approval to distribute pharmaceutical products in a dozen or so states.That news, which broke in October, prompted sharp falls in the shares of several firms in the pharmaceutical supply chain.Selling drugs would be harder for Amazon than out-competing department stores, in part because consumers do not typically pay much of the cost of drugs (insurers do).If it has serious ambitions in health care, it might even be forced to build or buy a PBM.Even so, history suggests that the firms relentless focus on consumers and willingness to forgo profits for years make it a huge potential threat to incumbent pharmacies.PBMs, once seen as cash cows, also face an uncertain future.These middlemen took off in the 2000s by promising to cut drug prices through aggregating demand and negotiating discounts with Big Pharma.Pembroke, an industry consultancy, estimates that the total value of drug rebates and discounts soared from $39bn in 2008 to $125bn in 2015.Some PBMs used questionable practices, including secret rebates (in addition to the discounts negotiated upfront on drug prices, that were passed on to PBM customers), which allowed them to pocket much of the savings rather than pass them on to insurers and employers and in turn, to consumers.Anthem, a big health insurer, sued Express Scripts, which it fired as its PBM, for $15bn last year, alleging that the latter firm had withheld savings and overcharged it by huge sums (Express Scripts denies the allegations).In October Anthem unveiled plans to launch its own in-house PBM with help from CVS.UnitedHealth, another giant health insurer, acquired Catamaran, a big PBM, in 2015, and merged it into OptumRx, its in-house PBM.Greater transparency in pricing is coming, argues Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners, an industry consultancy, be that through vertical integration (as in the purported deal between CVS and Aetna) or via the entry of a titan like Amazon.If opacity is reduced, the PBMs lose market power and profits, he says.This combination of forces explains why a CVS-Aetna merger might make sense: to make CVS a more formidable competitor against possible new entrants, such as Amazon, into the bit of the business started by the Goldsteins, and to extract efficiencies by cutting out the middlemen in the health-care supply chain.Other such deals are easy to imagine.Analysts reckon that insurance firms including WellCare, Centene and Humana are potential targets for acquisition.As the biggest stand-alone PBM, Express Scripts is thought to be a potential target, too.Anthem, which may lose CVS as a partner if antitrust authorities prise the two firms apart as a condition of approving a CVS-Aetna deal, may soon be shopping for a new PBM.The specific nature of these sorts of tie-up offers some reason to hope that the answer to the second questionwhether consolidation will benefit consumerswill turn out to be positive.In the past, firms have typically joined horizontally within a market segment.This has generally led to oligopolies that enjoy fat profits but do little to lower prices and lift quality for patients.Such horizontal mergers have been increasingly frowned upon by regulators in recent years.Up and down, not across The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers.If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of Uniteds pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.As costs spiral upwards, insurers interest in ensuring the good health of consumers deepens.Because United can now analyse both a patients medical files and her pharmacy records, it can track how medications are taken and whether or not they work well.A small group of integrated health-care systems in America, such as Kaiser Permanente, Intermountain and the Mayo Clinic, has been shown to have delivered better care and lower costs.By creating a much more integrated firm, the CVS-Aetna deal could do the same.CVS already has more than a thousand MinuteClinics (cheap and cheerful health centres) at its pharmacies offering affordable medical care seven days a week.The combined firm would offer everything from basic health services to diagnostics to drug-infusion centres.It would have a strong incentive to make sure that customers have good access to primary care, including vaccinations, medical information, prescriptions, and follow-ups.Consumers would save through lower premiums, lower out-of-pocket spending at preferred CVS outlets, or both, reckons Adam Fein of Pembroke.Moreover, the accumulation of data on what interventions work best in similar patients would speed the personalisation of medicine.In truth, no one knows how a CVS-Aetna deal would affect consumers of health care, as this structure of transaction, at this scale, has not been tried.The concern for patientsand for trustbustersis what would happen if customers of a combined firm wanted to receive care from other clinics or buy drugs from other pharmacies, perhaps because it was restricting choice or increasing co-payments.The reason for hope is that this vertical deal could become a template for a new sort of health-care firm, which offers a lower-cost ecosystem of quality health care.That could be a boon to consumers; it would have pleased the Goldstein brothers, too.
Japan Inc gingerly embraces more foreigners:::::MICHAEL WOODFORD, the first non-Japanese president of Olympus, likened the camera-makers board members who sacked him in 2011 to children in a classroom.Mr Woodford had confronted Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, the companys imperious chairman, over a $1.7bn hole in its finances.Mr Kikukawa responded by orchestrating a show of hands in a boardroom coup that sent the Englishman packing.It all fitted a clich of Japans boardrooms as an all-Japanese, all-male club where wizened bosses ruthlessly enforce wa , or harmony.Gradually, the serenity is being disrupted.Nearly 15% of companies in the Nikkei 225 stock index now have at least one non-Japanese on their boards.That is still less than half the share in Britains FTSE 100, but it is up from 12% in 2013 and the trajectory seems set.Japans biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Takeda, its largest pharmaceuticals company (which in 2015 appointed its first foreign chief executive, a Frenchman) announced the appointment of foreign directors this year.Of the ten directors at SoftBank, a telecoms and internet giant, seven are non-Japanese.When Japanese firms buy Western competitors, they often absorb foreigners into their higher echelons.Suntory, a drinks company, put the British chief executive of Beam, a spirits-maker, onto its board in 2014 when it acquired the American company.SoftBanks embrace of foreigners reflects a diverse portfolio that includes ARM, a British chipmaker, and Sprint, an American telecoms firm.Greater outside influence over Japanese firms also stems from more overseas investors, who hold about 30% of Japanese shares, up from 23.5% in 2008.But more still needs to be done, and quickly, if large Japanese firms are to maintain global relevance, says George Buckley, an outside director of Hitachi, a conglomerate.Many boards continue to be rubber-stampers, not vigilant overseers of the sort that foreigners expect to sit on, agrees William Saito, a venture capitalist who advises the government.Elderly ex-chairmen and chief executives often wield considerable power even after retirement.(And if corporate giants are excluded, the number of foreigners on boards of listed firms has barely inched up, from 0.6% in 2001 to 0.8% last year.)Livelier boardrooms might help prod Japans risk-averse companies to invest more of their 214trn ($1.9trn) of cash, and boost the economy.Their foreign operations would also benefit from appointing more non-Japanese as business heads.In the past the easiest way for Japans manufacturers to control subsidiaries abroad was to send people they knew.That may not work for services, warns Masahiko Uotani, president of Shiseido, a cosmetics company.You need people who can really understand local tastes, he counsels.Unless Japanese business changes its ways, firms risk staying dangerously out of touch, agrees Christina Ahmadjian, a non-executive director at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, another conglomerate.The number of Japanese companies in the Fortune Global 500, a scorecard for big business, has dropped from 149 in 1995 to 51.A bit of disharmony can be productive.
Southwest Airlines tries to bring music concerts to the skies:::::LAST week brought some good news for those who are fans of both flying and country music.Warner Music Nashville, a record label, and Southwest Airlines announced that they will be bringing concerts to the skies.The scheme is an expansion of the airlines existing Live at 35 series, in which bands surprise passengers by playing a few songs in the planes cabin.Devin Dawson (pictured), an artist on the label, marked the occasion with a performance on a flight from Nashville to Philadelphia.He told Billboard , a music publication, that: Some people dont really enjoy flying; some people get very nervous and dont like it.I hope that something like this [performance] is just a cool surprise for some [passengers] that helps them forget about their everyday woes, and Ill just play a couple of songs to make them smile.However, Mr Dawsons enthusiasm was not shared by everyone.The reactions on social media were swift and brutal.The New York Daily News tweeted that the carrier is forcing passengers to listen to in-flight music live because air travel isnt torture enough.Vice ran the headline : Southwest Airlines will regularly inflict live music on trapped passengers.Frequent flyers asked how there could possibly be space for a band to perform, when airlines are cramming seats into every available inch of their planes.Business travellers complained about the distraction.Some vowed never to fly Southwest again.This is an example of airlines trying to make flying fun.(Other attempts include using ever-catchier safety videos or even making flight attendants perform dance numbers, as Gulliver has previously reported .)But the problem is that most travellers just want to get from one location to another with minimal hassle.Many business travellers reported in a recent survey that they prefer to avoid human interaction altogether when in transit.And although a concert is not an interaction, in some ways it is far worse.There is no way to cut off the conversation.Sleeping through it is a near-impossible challenge.Reading or working is harder still.Though misguided, the airlines attempts to enliven flights are understandable.Travellers tend to choose their carriers on the basis of price and convenience, even if they complain about the food or service along the way.That forces airlines to find cheap ways to attract customers without denting profit margins.A live concert seems like an affordable and potentially enjoyable gimmick.After all, if videos of the performances go viral, Southwest could become known as the fun airline.But most travellers do not want fun.They want quiet and they want reliability.Even though these qualities are harder for airlines to provide, they will make customers more satisfiedand perhaps more loyal too.
Smoking rooms are disappearing from hotels:::::TO THE list of endangered travel facilitieswhich includes pay phones, communal aeroplane screens and concierges there is one more to add: smoking rooms.Even a few years ago, guests were routinely asked whether they would prefer a smoking room or not.But today fewer hotels are offering smoking rooms and those that do have a vanishingly small supply.According to the latest report from the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group, the share of hotel rooms that are non-smoking has steadily risen from 74% to 97% over the last decade.And the proportion of hotels that only offer non-smoking rooms has jumped from 38% in 2008 to 85% last year.For a business traveller with a tobacco habit, then, there are few options.Those seeking a dash of glamour will struggle, as 97% of luxury hotels do not have smoking rooms.Only among budget-hotel categorythe lowest price segment of five listed in the surveydo the majority of establishments have any smoking rooms on offer.Small hotels are more likely to have smoking rooms than larger ones.And older hotels are a slightly better bet than new ones.Non-smokers may want to avoid these cheaper, older haunts.Even if they land a non-smoking room in a hotel with smoking options, they are still subject to second-hand smoke.A study in 2013 found that the levels of tobacco air pollutants in non-smoking rooms were five times as high as in non-smoking hotels.And levels of surface pollution, such as cigarette ash, were 25 times higher.Smokers can, of course, stay in non-smoking rooms and use a variety of strategies to get their fix.The most obvious of which is to brave the elements for a puff outside.But many opt for more devious approaches.Internet forums are full of advice for people who want to smoke in non-smoking rooms (and dodge the often-hefty fines for the hotel to decontaminate the room).The least obnoxious of these is to upgrade to a room with a balcony.More egregious options include smoking out the window, exhaling into the bathroom vents, turning on a hot shower so that the steam can absorb the smell and putting a wet towel under the door.But travellers who indulge in tobacco should recognise the way that the winds are blowing.In America, none of the hotels owned by Marriott International allow smoking, nor do Wyndham Hotel Groups lifestyle and full-service brands.Two new Hilton brands, Canopy and Tru, will not allow smoking in any of their hotels in the world.Outside of America, there are usually more smoking options, although Europe is also increasingly going smoke-free.Smokers who do not want to mess around with wet towels and steam baths, should prepare for a future in which having a cigarette in a hotel room is no longer an option.
Catalonia and the perils of fiscal redistribution:::::POPULISM is the weapon not just of the downtrodden.As the crisis in Catalonia demonstrates, the rich have economic anxieties of their own.Catalonia has an identity distinct, in important ways, from that of the rest of Spain.But the recent drive for independence has been energised by anger over the flow of fiscal redistribution from rich Catalans to their countrymen: people seen, in parts of the restless north-east, as thankless and lazy as well as alien.Paradoxically, globalisation has inflamed separatism around the world by raising the question Catalans now confront: to whom, exactly, do we owe a sense of social responsibility?Every country or restive region has its own idiosyncratic history.Yet over the long run national borders are surprisingly malleable.Some circumstances offer better prospects for the small and newly independent than others.The smaller the country, the more easily its government can satisfy its peoples political preferences.A broadly satisfying compromise is easier among 300,000 people than 300m.But as Alberto Alesina and Enrico Spolaore note in their book, The Size of Nations, smaller countries also face hardships.They sacrifice economies of scalethey need, for example, to operate their own state agencies, rather than spread the expense of government across a larger population.Borders are bound to add to trading costs, leaving countries with smaller internal markets at an economic disadvantage.At times of foreign-policy tension, smaller countries, with correspondingly constrained armies and defence budgets, are easier to bully.So the world is more likely to sprout new countries when it is relatively peaceful, and when technology and global co-operation reduce international barriers to trade.Although moves towards independence in East Timor, Kosovo and South Sudan were accompanied by appalling bloodshed, it is no coincidence that over the past half-century the number of sovereign states has increased in tandem with a decline in global violence and an increase in trade.For Catalonias residents, membership of the Kingdom of Spain brings sacrifices, like the need to share decision-making on some matters with millions of other Spaniards.Were Catalonia able to secede from Spain yet keep its existing trade relationships, leaving would look quite attractive.Smaller regions motives for seeking independence are not always high-minded.In rich economies, the better-off subsidise the poor through an array of welfare programmes.That means richer regions support poorer ones financially.Geographical redistribution is not always a source of tension.Residents of Massachusetts rarely moan about the flow of their federal-tax dollars to Mississippi.Wealth divisions that coincide with stark cultural differences, however, can be more contentious.The financial crisis and its aftermath, by swelling the ranks of the unemployed (and thus of those dependent on government help), was ammunition for politicians in regions keen to cut ties with their national economies.Catalans bridle at the fiscal drag placed on them by the rest of Spain, but they are not alone; just last month, Italians in the richer north also voted to demand greater autonomy.Fearing dismemberment, national governments often use fiscal decentralisation to reduce separatist pressures.Nationalist sentiment lies along a spectrum, and giving unhappy regions more say over their taxing and spending can deflect moderates from a pro-secession stance.Decentralisation has been a part of Britains (so far successful) strategy for managing Scottish separatism, for example.Delegating greater authority to regions, however, brings risks.As the capacity of regional governments grows, citizens might become more confident in their prospects as truly independent countries.So governments will sometimes instead tighten the screws on the disgruntled region in order to limit its ability to govern itself.Madrid has used such tactics at times, most recently in 2010, when Spains right-leaning Popular Party succeeded in rolling back rights previously granted to Catalonia.Similarly, the EU has said that seceding regions will have to reapply for membershipimplying a damaging period of economic impairment.Decentralisation is not a costless concession by the national government.In the short run, it clearly exacerbates inequality within the affected country, since fewer resources flow to poorer people and places.Some economists, like Jason Sorens of Dartmouth College, argue that, over longer periods, by encouraging regional competition for mobile people and capital, decentralisation leads to better economic performance.But if rich places tend to stay rich, because productive firms and people benefit from proximity to other such firms and people, then decentralisation can create lasting hardship for poorer places.Rich regions can support high-quality public goods at low cost because a larger tax base can be tapped to manage fewer of the social ills associated with poverty.In poorer ones the reverse is true, as more health, education and other needs must be met from a smaller tax base.It is just that the alternativethe abrupt, possibly extra-legal secession of the unhappy regionoften looks worse.Closer and closer For liberals, it is hard to know how to view separatism.Democratic self-determination seems a laudable principle.The threat of secession may even act as a check on the temptation among a poorer majority to saddle a richer minority with economically stifling levels of taxation.But cultural identity is a fuzzy, mutable thing.When it becomes an excuse for dodging responsibilities while enjoying the benefits of open markets, it endangers both social harmony and openness.The geographical scope of redistribution will inevitably be limited by popular ideas about who truly belongs within the national fold.But it is better for everyone if that circle expands over time, rather than shrinks.
Asian households binge on debt:::::ONE of the more persistent beliefs about the global economy is that Asians are more frugal than others.Explanations have drawn on culture (the self-discipline of Confucianism), history (memories of privation) and public policy (flimsy social safety-nets forcing people to save).For Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore, and other theorists of Asian values, thrift was one of them.Whatever the true reason, data long supported the basic claim that Asian households were indeed careful with their cash.But over the past few years consumers across the region have done their best to prove that prudence was perhaps just a passing phase.Household debt in advanced economies has generally declined as a percentage of GDP since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to the Bank for International Settlements.In a number of Asian countries, however, it has been going in the opposite direction (see chart).The biggest increase has been in China, where households have borrowed about $4.5trn over the past decade.But Chinese households were starting from an extremely low base.Relative to income levels, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia have reached much loftier heights.Over the same period, consumer borrowing has also risen in Hong Kong and Singapore.The increase in debt is, to a certain extent, healthy.An oft-heard criticism of Asian economies is that, in terms of global growth, they have been punching below their weight.They produce lots of stuff but rely on profligate Westerners to buy it.The rise in debt has, so far at least, helped change that dynamic, fuelling more consumption.Retail spending in Asia, excluding Japan, has grown by about 10% a year over the past half-decade.Greater access to credit has made it easier to buy homes, cars and clothes.But debt can also be dangerous.A recent paper by the IMF observed that, in the short term, an increase in household borrowing props up economic growth and keeps unemployment down.After a while, though, these gains are reversed.The IMF study found that a five-percentage-point increase in the household debt-to-GDP ratio over three years tends to result in a 1.25-percentage-point decline in real growth three years in the future.And an increase of a single percentage point in household debt increases the likelihood of a banking crisis by a similar percentage.In Asia financial fragility is not the main worry.Even if households have been indulging themselves more freely, most regulators have remained prudent.In South Korea they mandate that mortgages cannot exceed 70% of a propertys value.Singaporean homebuyers who borrow from banks must make downpayments of at least 20%and potentially much more if they already have outstanding loans.Asian banks are also reluctant to pursue the kind of subprime lending that made consumer debt so toxic in America a decade ago.The bigger risk in Asia is interest rates, says Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.He notes that fixed long-term rates are rare in the region.Most consumer loans have shorter durations, so if central banks start to increase rates, debt-servicing costs for households will quickly rise.That will eat into incomes and act as a drag on consumption.It is already possible to detect headwinds.Mortgage payments in China have reached about 4.5% of total annual household income, up from 3.6% in 2015, according to Ernan Cui of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm.That, in turn, is beginning to weigh on consumption.For the government this entails a trade-off.The increase in mortgages has helped reduce a glut of unsold homes, which posed a graver danger to the economy than does consumer debt.There is also an uglier side to the rise in household borrowing.As in other parts of the world, unscrupulous lenders prey on the most vulnerable.In South Korea the share of low-income households struggling under heavy debt burdens has been creeping up.Choi Pae-kun, an economist at Konkuk University in Seoul, points out that poorer people may have no choice other than to borrow to cover living and medical costs.In China online lenders have been involved in a series of scandals.Some have demanded exorbitant interest rates and, in a number of cases, forced students to post as collateral naked selfies, with the threat they could be distributed if dues are not paid.Debt can undermine Asian values in more ways than one.
Snap Inc.s shares plummet after growth figures fall far short:::::Shares of Snap Inc. plunged nearly 20 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday after the company sorely missed Wall Streets forecasts for sales and user growth.The operator the Snapchat app which has been dogged by worries that Facebooks Instagram app has been knocking off Snapchats features and stealing away its users reported revenue of $207.9 million, well short of expectations of $235.5 million.Snap said its daily active users famously fond of the apps vanishing photos and bunny-ear filters rose 17 percent to 178 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.That was up 4.5 million from the second quarter, missing the 8 million additional users expected by analysts.In a statement, CEO Evan Spiegel pinned much of the blame on the apps functionality and said Snapchat would soon be undergoing a redesign.One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback, he said.Spiegel added, however, that there is a strong likelihood that the redesign would be disruptive to Snapchats business in the short term.We dont yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application, he said.Were willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business.Snap lost $443 million in the quarter, including a $40 million write down on Spectacles sunglasses that it wasnt able to move.Late last month, the social network laid off 18 employees from its recruiting division as it looks to slow hiring in 2018.In an email to employees at the time, CEO Evan Spiegel said company leaders would have to make hard decisions about underperforming employees.Its not the first time Snap has laid off employees in recent months.In late September, the company pink-slipped a dozen employees from a marketing team focused on Spectacles, the companys wearable camera-cum-sunglasses combo, as it restructured its hardware division.
Bloomingdales is moving 1K workers to Queens:::::More than 1,000 Bloomingdales jobs will move to Queens starting in 2020, The Post has learned.Bloomingdales owner Macys said last year it is leasing 550,000 square feet of office space at a new development in Long Island City, but it didnt say at the time which employees would be moving there, or how many.The new Long Island City digs, under construction at 2801 Jackson Avenue in Queens Plaza, will be housed in a 1.1-million-square-foot Tishman Speyer project called The Jacx that includes two 27-floor office towers.The Bloomingdales employees, including Chief Executive Tony Spring, merchandise buyers, IT workers and clerical staff, will be moving to Queens from various office spaces throughout Manhattan, including the flagship Bloomingdales store on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.CEO Spring may keep an office at Lexington Avenue, said a spokeswoman, adding that if there is room some Macys support staff may move to Long Island City as well.The move will foster a more collaborative work environment, give the company additional location flexibility, and increase the diversity of benefits we offer to our employees as we continue to recruit talent, the company said in a statement.Macys is heading to the Jacx along with office space startup WeWork, which has taken 250,000 square feet in upcoming development.Macys already has a studio facility in Long Island City called The Factory where it photographs its merchandise.
Businesses fear Amazon way more than they fear Trump:::::In the early weeks and months after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, it was all companies could talk about.While industries debated what the new administration might mean for them, stocks skyrocketed or plummeted as part of the Trump trade phenomenon.But even when the stock markets fascination with Trump was at record highs, corporate America was more fixated on the influence of a different, and powerful actor.Online retailer Amazon has been cited more than Trump in company financial results over the last five years, including since Trumps election last fall, according to an analysis done for MarketWatch by financial research platform Sentieo.In other words: The Amazon effect trumps the Trump trade.The Sentieo analysis illustrates how competitive risks, especially from disruptive technologies, appear to have stronger and longer-term effects than current regulatory issues, experts said.Amazons pull on company earnings also speaks to the online retailers size and clout in a wide and growing array of industries, they said.Trump represents essentially, for the market, political risk.Amazon is not political risk its a long-term structural trend, the powerful disintermediation of centuries-old business models, and thats something a CEO really has to get their arms around and figure out how to navigate, said Michael Purves, chief global strategist and head of equity derivatives strategy for Weeden & Co.The Amazon issue, well be talking about that in three years, five years, he said.The Trump stuff who knows?In large part, thats because companies and investors are unsure about how many Trump policies will actually get passed.After repeated failed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, companies are hopeful but wary about tax reform and other Republican legislative priorities.That hasnt stopped Trump from taking credit for record stock market highs.But the highs are more likely a testament to a lack of new regulation and a strong economy, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Companies feel increasingly confident in the durability of this economy as well as the business climate, regulation, and other factors, to say I dont think theres going to be anything thats necessarily going to be harmful, in the way of regulation, he said.If its helpful, thats terrific, but it doesnt have to be either to have confidence in our businesses and invest in our businesses.As a result, the uncertainty once posed by the administration has been more or less ironed out, said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group.Certainly in the early days of the Trump administration, you would say that the effects were a new factor that had to be reckoned with, Sosnick said.Now, if youre a company, you cant really use Trump as a risk factor or as an excuse thats not the way the market is treating the administration as a whole.Amazon is definitely the bogeyman du jour.Also important: Amazons dominance over various retail categories, including a recent acquisition of grocer Whole Foods Market and a reported interest in selling pharmaceutical drugs.In the latest quarter alone, Amazon has been brought up as a competitive threat, partner, client and consideration by companies in the healthcare, clothing, technology, media, real estate, food and even stamp-selling industries.Now, particularly for anyone in a space that abuts Amazon and that seems to be an increasingly growing number of spaces that would be the factor, said Sosnick.Amazon is clearly a factor thats influencing business decisions, as was the new administration earlier in the year.That, in turn, begs a new question, Purves said.What happens in D.C. in response to this unbelievable market power?he said.It seems in some ways its approaching Standard Oil levels or Microsoft back in the 90s levels.Whether U.S. policy will change at all, and if so how much, is so unclear that you almost cant compare Trump and Amazon, Purves said.Amazon is a long-term, structural force, while political stuff, political landscapes shift quickly, he said.If I had to bet, Id say political gridlock is going to be in place here.Amazon shares have surged nearly 50 percent year-to-date, compared with a 15.5 percent rise in the S&P 500 and an 18.9 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
This keg holds a year supply of ranch dressing:::::Its going to take a lot of buffalo wings to kick this keg.Hidden Valley has unveiled a metal keg that contains 5 liters of ranch dressing a coma-inducing quantity thats getting billed as a year supply.It isnt a party unless the Hidden Valley Ranch is flowin, according to a product listing on Flavour Gallery, a retail website.Priced at $50, the keg doesnt look like a bargain.By comparison, Walmarts website is advertising 20-ounce bottles of Hidden Valley ranch dressing for $3.99, which works out to about $33 for 5 liters.Nevertheless, Clorox-owned Hidden Valley notes that the 9.7-inch tall kegs are stackable in the event that 5 liters isnt enough, adding that a special inside coating meets FDA specifications and keeps the ranch tasting fresh.The keg is currently available for pre-order and will begin shipping on Dec. 11 just in time for Christmas and the NFL Playoffs.The dressing-obsessed in December can likewise purchase a $110 Hidden Valley Ranch fountain thats 18-inches high and holds two pounds of dressing.
Forbes: Wilbur Ross is lying about being a billionaire:::::Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been falsely claiming that hes a billionaire for more than a decade, Forbes alleged in an explosive report.The 79-year-old dealmaker has long been a fixture on the Forbes 400 list of Americas richest, with his net worth last year pegged by the magazine at $2.9 billion.But in a blistering report Tuesday, Forbes said it was intent on removing him entirely, as financial disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Trumps cabinet showed less than $700 million in assets.It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004, Forbess Dan Alexander wrote Tuesday.When Forbes challenged Ross about his White House disclosures, the magazine said the veteran investor contended that he had created trusts for his family worth more than $2 billion that werent included in the filings, according to the article.But after one month of digging, Forbes said it is now confident that that money never existed.Ross told Forbes that the $2 billion in question was transferred to those trusts between the election and the nomination, according to Tuesdays article.But the Commerce Department then told Forbes in a statement that there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Rosss confirmation.The Forbes article went on to report that Ross has exploited his supposed billionaire status to attract business.Really, for us, it was a bet on him, said Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor.I dont know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past.Forbes said Ross also has a pattern of misleading colleagues and investors that has led to millions of dollars in fines and tens of millions in refunds to backers, as well as numerous lawsuits.Wilbur doesnt have an issue with bending the truth, David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No.3 person in his firm, told Forbes.Ross couldnt immediately be reached for comment on the Forbes report.Despite Tuesdays article, Ross is still listed on Forbes The Worlds Billionaires list on its website with a reported net worth of $2.5 billion.
Silly new name for Coachs parent doesnt help handbag sales:::::Coachs corporate parent has a new name, but thats not helping sales.The struggling handbag makers holding company which switched its name from Coach Inc. to Tapestry Inc. last month, drawing jabs that it mainly reminded shoppers of an old Carole King album posted weaker-than-expected results Tuesday and blamed the weather.Same-store sales at Coach the companys biggest unit fell 2 percent, while analysts had expected a 2 percent rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Tapestry, which got its new name to reflect the fact that it also houses the Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands, said sales were hit by inventory issues and hurricanes in North America and typhoons in Asia.The company posted net loss of $17.7 million, or 6 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $117.4 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.Tapestry took a $188 million charge related to its acquisition of Kate Spade.Excluding one-time items, the company earned 42 cents, beating analysts average estimate of 36 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net revenue rose 24.2 percent to $1.29 billion, while analysts on average had expected $1.31 billion.With Reuters
Lyft finally opens a permanent office in New York:::::Lyft is finally opening a permanent office in New York City.Ubers smaller ride-hailing rival said it will be setting up shop in Manhattans Chelsea neighborhood at 245 West 17th St., with employees slated to begin moving in Tuesday.The new, 11,000-square-foot office, which has a capacity for more than 80 employees, will house members of its engineering team, as well as marketing and sales.Lyfts New York-based engineers will, among other responsibilities, be working on the companys continuing research into driverless cars, a spokesperson said.The diversity of New Yorks neighborhoods and urban layout makes it an ideal place for engineers to understand and strengthen Lyfts technology nationwide, the spokesperson said.If you can understand and build transportation in NYC, you can do it anywhere.Currently, Lyft has 30 employees in New York, as well as an operations team based in Long Island City.With the new office, the company will look to grow its team of engineers.The announcement of the new office comes less than a month after Lyft revealed that it had raised $1 billion in a financing round led by Capital G, the investing arm of Google parent Alphabet.The latest funding round put the ride hailing companys value at $11 billion.
Apple is charging $999 for the iPhone X because it can:::::Why does an iPhone X cost nearly $1,000?So Apple can make a ton of money.Thats according to a newly published analysis, which found that while Apples new flagship smartphone does cost 25 percent more to manufacture than the iPhone 8, its marked up a full 43 percent higher at retail.The iPhone X smartphone costs $357.50 to make and sells for an eye-watering $999, giving it a gross margin of 64 percent, according to TechInsights, a firm that tears down technology devices and analyzes the parts inside.The iPhone 8 sells for $699 and has a gross margin of 59 percent.The finding is surprising because technology products tend to become more profitable as they age and the parts for them drop in cost.The iPhone X is a brand new design that went on sale Friday, to apparently strong demand, while the iPhone 8 is an update on last years iPhone 7, which itself was similar to the iPhone 6 released in 2014.Apple declined to comment on TechInsights analysis.Apple is unique in the electronics industry for its ability to charge a premium price for its latest devices and for its ability to maintain that price even when selling devices through third parties like telecom carriers, said Al Cowsky, the costing analyst for TechInsights, which planned to post the results to its site late Monday.Apple can be different here because they are the 800 pound gorilla, Cowsky said.Several of Apples design choices for the iPhone X pushed up its price.In particular, its 5.8-inch (14.8-cm) edge-to-edge display and associated parts cost $65.50, compared with $36 for the iPhone 8s 4.7-inch display, the analysis found.That is largely because the iPhone 8 uses older LCD technology, while the iPhone X uses what is called Super AMOLED technology, which allows for more vivid colors and a thinner overall design.Another pricey choice was the stainless steel chassis of the iPhone X, which cost $36 versus $21.50 for the aluminum housing of the iPhone 8.Cowsky said the steel is less likely than aluminum to bend when flexed, a problem that dogged the iPhone 6 when it came out.This is their lesson learned from that, he said.With Reuters
ADP CEO says Bill Ackman got an ass-whipping in proxy vote:::::Activist hedge fund manager William Ackman lost his bid on Tuesday to win seats on the board of Automatic Data Processing after a hostile, months-long proxy contest that was crucial to him retaining support from some of his own investors.His Pershing Square hedge fund did not get any of its three nominees, including Ackman himself, elected to ADPs board, with less than 25 percent of voting shares supporting his proxy campaign.This was an ass-whipping, ADP Chief Executive Carlos Rodriguez said after the vote tally was announced at the payroll processors annual shareholder meeting in Roseland, New Jersey.For three months, Ackman and ADP have traded increasingly bitter barbs through securities filings, television appearances, conference calls, webcasts and private meetings with investors.Ackman, who had expected to win, told Reuters he felt he accomplished a lot despite the loss, which he blamed on a flawed proxy voting system.The company, in order to win, made a number of very significant commitments to shareholders about growth, he said at the meeting.If they achieve those objectives and they exceed them, then I think shareholders will be happy, the stock will go up.If they dont, well be back next year.Ackman launched the ADP proxy contest as an underdog, taking aim at a company engaged in the unglamorous business of providing human resources technology and largely backed by Wall Street.ADPs share price has more than doubled under Rodriguezs tenure, and the company has posted relatively solid earnings growth.But Ackman contends that management complacency has turned ADP into an inefficient corporate slugabed pushing outmoded products that even a top sales force could not sell.ADP has countered that Ackman brings no new ideas to the table, risks disrupting the companys steady path to growth and behaves like a spoiled brat.The 51-year-old billionaire had asked ADP shareholders to approve his proposal to seat three new directors, including himself, and oust three others, including Chairman John Jones.He has also suggested Rodriguez is the wrong person for the job, and called for the departure of ADPs technology chief, Stuart Sackman.Ackman posted double-digit losses in his key funds in 2015 and 2016 due to high-profile bets moving against him, and has produced underwhelming performance this year compared to major stock market indexes.Several Pershing investors who spoke to Reuters in the run-up to the ADP vote said the outcome would affect their confidence in his investment ability.He said before the proxy battle that he would not exit the ADP investment if the shareholder vote went against him.Instead, he has said he plans to continue agitating for change loudly and publicly from the outside.Ackmans Pershing Square owns almost 2 percent of ADPs common shares, making it the seventh-largest voting shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.When counting unexercised options, the value of the stake is roughly $2.3 billion.
Apples offshore move has helped save them billions in taxes:::::Apple quietly sidestepped a crackdown on its much-maligned Ireland tax avoidance practice by moving its overseas operation to the tax haven of the Channel Island of Jersey, documents leaked from an offshore law firm revealed.The move, beginning in 2015, allowed Apple to continue to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes.Apple, the most valuable and most profitable company in the world, had been paying a corporate income tax of 5 percent or less thanks to a loophole in US and Ireland tax law, according to reports.That is much less than the 12.5 percent Irish corporate tax rate and the 35 percent top US corporate tax rate.The loophole, known as the double Irish, is perfectly legal.The overseas operations of the Cupertino, Calif., company were based in Ireland and all of its non-US sales were funneled through that office.But beginning in 2013, the European Union began an investigation of Apples double Irish.So Apple quietly searched for a new tax-friendly home for its international HQ.That search led to the Jersey island offices of the Appleby law firm, a business whose main goal was to help wealthy individuals and companies legally avoid taxes.Apple, in several emails, asked the law firm about moving its Ireland headquarters to the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, according to the leaked documents, known as the Paradise papers.In the emails, Apple made it clear it wanted to keep the move secret, according to the BBC, which reported on the leaked emails.For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity, one email read.They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.The Channel Island of Jersey, a UK dependency, sets its own tax laws.The corporate rate for foreign companies is zero percent, the BBC reported.In 2017, Apple earned $44.7 billion outside the US and paid just $1.65 billion in taxes, the BBC reported Apple, in a statement on Monday, said it pays every tax dollar it owes.Apple believes every company has a responsibility to pay its taxes, and as the largest taxpayer in the world, Apple pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world, the statement reads.Were proud of the economic contributions we make to the countries and communities where we do business.A German newspaper was leaked more than 13 million documents from the law firm.They were reviewed and released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Apple has more than $250 billion in profits on the island of Jersey.
Oprahs investment in Weight Watchers is paying off big time:::::Oprah may be slimming down, but her wallets getting fatter a lot fatter.The media mogul has seen her investment in Weight Watchers soar 617 percent over the past 25 months as her efforts as a pitchwoman for the weight loss company has attracted an uptick in subscribers.The last 8.8 percent of the gain came Monday in after-hours trading, sparked by the New York companys solid third-quarter results.The gain pushed Weight Watchers 2017 gain to about 300 percent, to $49.00 a share.Oprah Winfrey took a 10 percent stake in the company when its shares were trading at just $6.79.Winfreys social media updates about her weight loss it reached 42/ pounds last January attracted new customers.In the latest quarter, subscribers rose 18 percent while operating profits gained 37 percent and revenue rose 15 percent.Weight Watchers has delivered eight consecutive quarters of membership increases since Winfrey signed on as both an investor and director.The company also raised its profit guidance for the year.Now more than ever Im confident about the opportunity and the scalability of the Weight Watchers brand, said Chief Executive Mindy Grossman on an earnings call with analysts.Dieting companies make their biggest push for new members at the beginning of the year, and Weight Watchers has been testing a new points program over the past year that it will unveil over the next month, said Grossman, who joined the company from HSN four months ago.Oprah is a strong advocate of new our program and will play a strong role in our new marketing campaign, Grossman said.Dieters are sticking with the program longer for about nine months, compared with 8 months a year ago before they cancel their membership, the company said.Members are seeing value in the program even after theyve reached their goal, Grossman said.
EBay removes listings of Hawaii beach sand from its website:::::HILO, Hawaii Online auction and sales company eBay has removed multiple listings of sand said to be taken from Hawaii beaches.The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Saturday that it asked the company about the listings before they were taken down.Among them was a listing claiming to have sand from Papakolea Beach, also known as Green Sands Beach.It is illegal to take sand from Hawaii beaches, state Department of Land and Natural Resources spokeswoman Deborah Ward said.The law contains a limited number of exceptions that do not include personal or commercial sales.Fines for illegally collecting Hawaii sand can reach upward of $100,000.It used to be legal to take sand up to a certain amount per person, per day.However, the law was changed, and taking sand is now illegal, Ward said.She said the department is investigating one case of sale of sand on social media, but she declined comment on whether the sale was through eBay.Ryan Moore, eBay director of global corporate affairs and communication, said the company took the listings down and notified sellers after the newspaper reached out.While we havent been directly contacted by the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, we are certainly willing to work with them on the best way to address this issue in the future, Moore said.Weve removed the active listings on the marketplace and have educated the sellers that listing these products are against eBay policy.Hawaiis prohibition on taking sand from beaches dates to 2013.Before then, one person could take up to one gallon a day from the shoreline.The then-chairman of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, William Aila, testified to the Legislature that erosion, illegal sand mining and other factors were shrinking Hawaiis beaches.The law exempts people who accidentally bring sand home in their clothes, toys and other belongings.Ken Lawson, an attorney and faculty member at the University of Hawaii at Manoas William S. Richardson School of Law, said eBay has a responsibility to police potentially illegal activity on its website.I think if (the sellers) purport that theyre selling sand from Hawaii beaches, theyre doing it on eBay and its a violation of Hawaii law, then eBay does have a duty .to let them know that thats not a legal sale, Lawson said.Offers for the sand ranged from 2 milliliter vials for $3.50 to a pound for prices ranging from $4.50 to $14.95.
Flying across the US to buy an iPhone X may be your cheapest option:::::If you couldnt bring yourself to wait in line for the iPhone X this weekend, your next best bet may be to buy a plane ticket.Several unlocked versions of Apples new, $999 smartphone were getting sold on eBay Monday for north of $1,500 after big crowds queued up at stores across the US over the weekend to gobble up most of the inventory.Impatient gadget geeks are resorting to price gougers on eBay because they now face wait times of three to four weeks before the next iPhone X batches get delivered, according to Apples website.However, there were still a few Apple Stores in the US with the iPhone X on hand as of Monday afternoon, most notably in the Pacific Northwest.That meant an Apple-obsessed New Yorker on Monday could get a better deal than much of what was being offered on eBay by, for example, booking a $450, round-trip flight on Skywest Airlines leaving Newark to Spokane, Wash., where Apples site showed (and Apple employees confirmed) that iPhone Xs were still available.For those willing to take a more scenic route, the round-trip from JFK to Anchorage, Alaska on Skywest was $663 still making for a deal comparable to many eBay offers that promised next-day shipping.An Apple store in Portland, Ore., also was advertising availability of the iPhone X.But elsewhere, in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Las Vegas and Austin, Texas, the sleek new phone wasnt available for pick-up.With its edge-to-edge OLED screen and Face ID technology, the iPhone X represents the most significantly upgraded iPhone design since the iPhone 6 in 2014.In an earnings call last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company is quickly moving past the production issues that have reportedly plagued the iPhone X in recent months, noting that facilities have been ramping up smoothly.However, Cook said that he does not know when supply will catch up with demand.Apple shares were up 1.2 percent to $174.48 on Monday afternoon.
21st Century Fox held talks to sell assets to Disney: report:::::Twenty-First Century Fox shares spiked 9.9 percent Monday after a report that the company has talked to Disney about selling parts of its media assets.The talks between the two are no longer ongoing but they could start up anew, according to the report.Fox, which owns Twentieth Century Fox, the Fox News Channel and the Fox broadcast network, discussed selling its Hollywood studio, TV production unit and some overseas assets to the Mouse House, according to CNBC, which cited people familiar with the situation.Foxs entertainment cable networks, FX and National Geographic, were also included in the sale talks.A price was not disclosed in the report.The Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Sports and the broadcast network would not be sold.Both companies declined comment.Bloomberg reported that the talks, which took place over the last two weeks, are considered dead.Others gave the report, confirmed by other news outlets, more credibility.The talks come amid the changing video consumption habits of Americans who are opting more for offerings from Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google.As such, content providers need critical mass.Needham entertainment analyst Laura Martin called the possible tie-up a dream come true.Putting these assets under Disneys hands will make them a lot more money, she said of a transaction she estimated would cost Disney between $20 billion and $30 billion.At the end of the day, Fox will get more money than it could have by its operating those businesses, she said.Amir Malin of Qualia Capital, an investment firm focused on media and entertainment, was also optimistic especially in light of Disneys plan to launch two direct-to-consumer streaming services in the next two years.Indeed, since announcing in August it will pull its movies from Netflix at the end of 2018 and put them on its own over-the-top platform in 2019, Disney has had some on Wall Street wondering if its library, massive as it is, has enough content to mount a Netflix-like alternative.Disneys other OTT platform an ESPN service featuring some 10,000 sporting events each year has not raised any worries.There is some logic to a potential M&A transaction: cost synergies, Fox IP contributing to Disneys streaming platforms, an expansion of content for both the film and TV distribution lines, Malin told The Post.It would certainly create a content engine juggernaut Alien, Avatar, Planet of the Apes and X-Men back into the world of Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar.Fox shares closed at $27.45.Disney shares gained 2 percent, to $100.64.
Sprint shares plunge after talks with T-Mobile end:::::Shares of Sprint fell more than 13 percent on Monday after the No.4 US wireless carrier called off merger talks with T-Mobile US and a wireless partnership with cable company Altice USA failed to appease investors.It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile, Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters.Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.Sprints shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent.Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprints network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target, he said.I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.
Supreme Court rejects Samsungs appeal on Apple patent ruling:::::The US Supreme Court on Monday refused to step back into the years-long feud over patents between the worlds top smartphone makers, declining to hear Samsungs appeal of a lower court ruling that reinstated a jury award of about $120 million in favor of Apple.The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Koreas Samsung Electronics had infringed Apples patents on several popular features of the California-based companys iPhone.Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple.In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a federal jury in San Jose, California, ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission.Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said the patent courts judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments.The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders rights at the expense of innovation and competition.Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing novel or important to review in its rivals appeal.The Trump administration backed Apples view.
Biggest tech deal ever expected to be huge takeover battle:::::Chip maker Broadcom on Monday announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm for $103 billion as it looks to boost its presence in the wireless market, setting the stage for what could be one of the biggest takeover battles.Qualcomm said it would review the proposal and act in the best interests of its shareholders.The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raise the stakes for Intel, which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but it did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to the sources.Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a legal dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.Broadcom said Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal.Including debt, Broadcoms bid values the transaction at $130 billion.Shares of Qualcomm were up 3.5 percent at $63.98 in premarket trading, well below the offer price, indicating that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.In our view, $70 per share wouldnt be sufficient, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note.Qualcomm shares traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.Canaccord Genuity analysts said they believed Qualcomms board would likely reject the initial bid as too low and said the company would prefer to remain independent.The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company that is based in Singapore and the United States.It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.Tan appeared at the White House last week with US President Donald Trump, describing the United States as a great country for businesses.Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of US assets.Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple , Samsung and LG that help phones connect to wireless data networks.Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.Broadcoms offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomms closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the companys shares.
Oil hits two-year high amid Saudi crown princes crackdown:::::Oil jumped to its highest in over two years on Monday as Saudi Arabias crown prince cemented his power through a crackdown on corruption, while world shares eased a notch and major currencies traded in tight ranges.Oil prices reached their highest since July 2015 as Mohammed bin Salmans purge led to arrests of royals, ministers and investors including prominent billionaire investor Alwaleed bin Talal.The news stirred concerns of Middle Eastern money pulling out of global financial markets.A weekend call by Chinas central bank governor for tougher financial regulation also hit investor sentiment.Brent futures were up over half a percent at $62.49 a barrel.US crude added half a percent to $55.91.Shares in French hotel group Accor fell as much as 1.7 percent at the open, the biggest of the CAC 40 fallers, after its third biggest shareholder Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was arrested in the Saudi Arabian crackdown.Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm Kingdom Holding, invests in firms such as Citigroup and Twitter.He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, three senior officials told Reuters on Sunday.MbSs (Mohammed bin Salmans) accumulation of power runs the risk of prompting the Kingdom to shift further away from consensus-based policymaking, ruffling more feathers within the royal family as well as those closely tied to it, said Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics.The big risk here is of a backlash against MbS from these elites that undermines his authority and raises the Saudi risk premium.Prince Mohammeds reforms include a plan to list parts of giant state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco next year, and a higher oil prices is seen as beneficial for the market capitalization of the future listed company.
Amazon pays to slash holiday prices for third-party sellers:::::Amazon is cutting prices of products from third-party sellers on its website, moving beyond its more typical method of discounts on items it sells directly.The discount provided by Amazon applies to products including board games and technological gadgets offered by other merchants as the holiday season approaches.The retailer has been trying to compete aggressively on some items to win sales and draw customers away from low-priced rivals like Wal-Mart.The move allows Amazon to sell the products at lower prices while still giving full price to the sellers.When Amazon provides a discount, customers get the products they want at a price theyll love, and small businesses receive increased sales at their listed asking price, an Amazon spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, noting that businesses can opt out at any time.Marketing the items at lower prices, however, risks angering Amazons third-party sellers, who instead could list their products elsewhere online.The move has drawn attention within Amazon Services seller forum.Some merchants have criticized Amazon in the past for discounting and, they say, devaluing their products.
Queen Elizabeth owns her own McDonalds, and its fittingly regal:::::Fast food isnt usually fit for a queen, but this McDonalds outlet in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom is because its owned by one.Thats right: in addition to her vast collection of jewels and gold bullion, Queen Elizabeth II also owns her very own McDonalds.The restaurant is located in the Banbury Gateway Shopping Park, 60 miles west of London, and boasts a level of fanciness thoroughly befitting its royal owner, according to Business Insider.Diners can choose between plush leather couches or sleek designer replica chairs, wirelessly charge their phones while they eat and even browse the internet on complimentary tablets while they wait for their meals to be delivered to their tables.Yep, it has table service.Proper English breakfast Even the menu is a cut above, featuring British classics including porridge, English Breakfast tea and bacon butties (thats a bacon sandwich to you and me) alongside the more traditional burgers and fries.As the British Head of State, Queen Elizabeths property holdings are vast she owns everything from race courses, hotels, historic castles even an offshore wind farm.Among the more mundane things in her portfolio are thousands of retail properties, including the Banbury shopping precinct.Her holdings are worth an estimated $20 billion and net millions of pounds in rent and profits every year which is all reinvested in the Treasury.Queen of chocolate The Queen is known to be something of a fussy eater.She is said to prefer simple meals made from local produce and is reportedly a fiend for chocolate.As such, its fairly unlikely shes ever eaten any McDonalds at all, let alone sampled food from her own restaurant.William and Harry however, are very familiar with Big Macs.Princess Diana used to take them to various London McDonalds locations as part of her mission to give them as normal a childhood as was possible under the circumstances.Perhaps we might see him carrying on this tradition and taking George and Charlotte for a Happy Meal sometime soon.
Target to close a dozen underperforming stores:::::In a move toward growth, Target has decided to close stores, and a dozen of them at that.The Minneapolis-based Star Tribune first reported on the news Tuesday afternoon."We have a rigorous process in place to evaluate the performance of every store on an annual basis, closing or relocating underperforming locations as needed," a spokeswoman for the big-box retailer told CNBC."Typically, a store is closed as a result of seeing several years of decreasing profitability," she added.The 12 stores spread across states including Michigan, Florida, Illinois and Texas will close on Feb. 3 of next year.Meantime, Target is in the midst of vastly expanding its portfolio of smaller-format stores, which Chief Executive Brian Cornell has said are more profitable than the retailer's big-box locations.This year, Target will have opened 32 pint-sized stores, with 35 openings planned for 2018.Minneapolis-based Target is also putting money toward remodeling existing stores.It has plans to update 1,000 of its 1,800 stores by 2020.The stores being shuttered include those in: Minneapolis' Twin Cities metro area (Hastings); Fergus Falls in outstate Minnesota; Harper Woods, Michigan (Eastland); Hutchinson, Kansas; Benton Harbor, Michigan; Macon, Georgia; Slidell, Louisiana; Lauderhill, Florida; Matteson, Illinois; Romeoville, Illinois; Baltimore (West), and San Antonio (Far East).
UPS dives into blockchain technology as trucking companies seek to evolve:::::Autonomous vehicles and Amazon may be the shipping industry's buzzwords today, but blockchain is well on its way to becoming the future.United Parcel Service announced on Tuesday it has joined the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA), the latest logistics company taking a closer look at the platform's offerings."The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders," Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, said in a statement.UPS' foray into blockchain a technology that the Chicago Fed defines as "a network of users, each of which stores its own copy of the data" is not a surprise to investment group Stifel, however."In our view, blockchain will combine with the truckload pricing futures market, with data analytics-assisted [and] artificial intelligence-assisted real time matching of loads and empties," Stifel analyst John Larkin wrote in a note on Oct. 29.Larkin said three companies will "invest enough in technology to drive the consolidation of the industry around these core transformational technologies:" UPS, C.H.Robinson Worldwide and XPO Logistics.
Lowe's is bringing 'smart home' centers to its stores just in time for the holidays:::::Lowe's knows its shoppers are increasingly looking to purchase smart home devices, and it wants to help.On Tuesday, the home improvement retailer unveiled plans to launch so-called stores within its stores, in a partnership with b8ta, to sell and educate shoppers on smart home products.With the software retailer, Lowe's will set up centers at 70 locations nationwide, where various tech gadgets will be sold aside knowledgeable customer service representatives."Consumers aspire to live a connected life and crave solutions that make this possible," Ruth Crowley, vice president of customer experience design at Lowe's, said in a statement."Smart home products simplify life but the technology can sometimes be confusing or intimidating," she added."So, we developed Smart Home powered by b8ta to emulate a 'lab-like' atmosphere that empowers customers to make informed decisions."Lowe's is allowing its shoppers to learn about and try certain smart home technology before making a purchase.The mini stores will feature more than 60 smart home products, sold from brands such as Google, Sonos, Nest, Samsung and Ring.The items on sale will include thermostats, cameras, speakers and security systems.In addition to the 70 Lowe's stores getting a complete smart home outfit, 1,000 Lowe's locations will launch smart home displays ahead of Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.Lowe's website has also been updated to speak to the b8ta collaboration, and to offer smart home product education, tips and tricks.As far as retailers go, Lowe's has fared better than many in the industry this year, having watched its shares climb roughly 10 percent in 2017.The S&P 500 Retail ETF (XRT), for comparison, has fallen 11 percent over the same period.North Carolina-based Lowe's has been experimenting with new technology and ways to excite customers for years, through its Innovation Labs team.Its 70 mini smart home stores are the latest example of that.Just earlier this year, Lowe's rolled out a virtual realty experience that offers do-it-yourself assistance through tutorials inside Lowe's Holoroom.Then, in September, Lowe's launched two new augmented reality apps one for measuring an object, or distance, within the phone's camera view, and one for viewing images of furnishings, at scale, within a user's own home."From a competitive position, we believe LOW is at lower risk from e-commerce than most other retailers in the near term, and has the scale to make many of the necessary investments for future growth," KeyBanc analyst Bradley Thomas wrote in a Monday note to clients.Thomas' firm has initiated coverage on Lowe's stock, with an overweight rating and a $98 price target.Lowe's shares were last trading around $78 apiece."Essentially all physical retailers are facing a growing threat from e-commerce and Amazon," Thomas added."The home improvement sector has historically exhibited less risk from e-commerce."
NY Rep. Collins says donors told him to get tax reform done 'or don't ever call' again:::::A House Republican is stating the political necessity for Republicans to deliver tax overhaul legislation this year.New York Rep. Chris Collins said Tuesday, "My donors are basically saying 'get it done or don't ever call me again."'President Donald Trump and the Republicans need to show a tax bill as a major legislative accomplishment to protect their majorities in next year's elections.Meanwhile, Democrats on the House's tax-writing committee plan to propose a battery of revisions to the Republican tax overhaul bill that focus on middle-class concerns like childcare and home buying.As the committee works on the legislation, an initial amendment proposed by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., would shut down the plan's tax cuts if in two years the $20 trillion national debt had increased.The amendments, without chance of approval by the Republican-dominated Ways and Means Committee, focus attention on the issue of whether the middle class would benefit from the tax plan.
Accounting software giant Intuit launches direct business loans:::::Financial software firm Intuit is offering loans directly to businesses with a lending product called QuickBooks Capital.The company, which makes tax-preparation and accounting software, said Tuesday it would enable firms to use its bookkeeping software to access up to $35,000 in credit, with a term between three and six months.Intuit follows in the steps of a number of tech corporations most significantly Amazon to offer business loans to its customers."There are a number of tech companies that do small business lending in varying degrees," Rania Succar, head of QuickBooks Capital at Intuit, told CNBC in an email last week."For example Square, PayPal and Amazon offer loans to merchants."But Succar said that Intuit's product differed to those offered by competitors."As the largest small business accounting platform with approximately 2.4 million customers, the QuickBooks platform provides the most complete set of small business data available in the market," she said.QuickBooks Capital uses machine learning to help small businesses demonstrate credit-worthiness."For example, we give small businesses the ability to get credit for future profits by looking at things such as open invoices", Succar said."Using machine learning, we're able to predict when those invoices are likely to be paid, thereby providing an extremely detailed picture of a business' cash flow.According to a study by the Federal Reserve earlier this year, only 23 percent of businesses younger than five years get access to credit.Business lending is a market that has been traditionally dominated by banks.But some warn that tech giants like Google and Amazon could be set to disrupt it.A number of fintech start-ups have already set their sights on the business lending market, with firms like LendingClub and Funding Circle offering peer-to-peer lending platforms.Last month, digital invoice finance platform MarketInvoice said it would offer business loans for the first time.
September job openings holds steady near record high:::::Job openings posted by U.S. employers in September held steady from the prior month.The Labor Department on Tuesday said openings were 6.1 million in September, little changed from 6.08 million in August.The number of openings makes it clear that employers have plenty of jobs to fill but are still searching to find qualified workers at the pay levels being offered.The opportunities available remains near an all-time high of 6.2 million hit in July.That number was the highest on record dating to 2000.The number of people who quit their jobs was also held steady at 2.2 percent, a trend that generally means workers are leaving for jobs that pay better.More job openings were posted in professional and business services, as well as state and local government education, other services and federal government.
Bitcoin has no future because of its anonymity, SocGen CEO says:::::Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are unlikely to survive long-term as governments scramble to regulate them, according to the chief executive of French banking giant Societe Generale.Frederic Oudea said that, while he was a believer in distributed ledger technology which allows data to be stored in enormous volumes across a secure network of computers virtual currencies carry too much risk due to their anonymity."The benefit so far is it provides anonymity to the people who are making the transactions," Oudea told CNBC on the sidelines of the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday."I can't see a future of this when I see the attention played by all governments and regulators on anti-money laundering, on anti-tax evasion, on anti-terrorism financing.The anonymity of the transaction is a problem I think which would put pressure on bitcoin."Societe Generale has itself experimented with a blockchain-based trade finance platform.But Oudea said: "I prefer to use the word distributed ledger technology and not blockchain."Blockchain technology was originally created to serve as a digital log of all bitcoin transactions.But now companies are looking at other use cases of the technology.Oudea said he was "not convinced" digital currencies would "see any development.""I'm more a believer of a distributed ledger technology where you have a defined set of players (that are) well-identified," he said."We choose this mix of crypto technology to secure transactions."
WWE experimenting with virtual reality:::::World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is conducting virtual reality trials in order to try and bring every fan ringside seats to Wrestlemania.Speaking at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Paul Michael Levesque better known by his ring name Triple H said virtual reality could prove to be a perfect fit for the business."In some ways, it is kind of custom-made for what we do and I think as the technology improves it will get better and better," the WWE executive said."Everybody wants to be there live and in person and if its Wrestlemania and you can put a headset on, or whatever that device is at the time, and you can actually put yourself on that front row sitting there experiencing it... that's a whole different point of view," he added.While the 14-time WWE champion said virtual reality was "wide open" for the franchise to explore and develop, Levesque cautioned that WWE would still need to understand how to make the best use of the technology.
Weight Watchers shares soar on earnings beat, heightened outlook:::::Weight Watchers International shares are rapidly gaining weight.The stock is on a tear after the company raised its full-year earnings outlook, calling a push within its massive subscriber base to round out fiscal 2017."We are excited about the upcoming winter season," Chief Executive Mindy Grossman said in a statement."We are confident our business momentum will continue throughout the balance of the year."Weight Watchers shares were climbing more than 15 percent Tuesday morning on the news.Its shares have risen more than 360 percent in 2017.On Monday evening, Weight Watchers reported net income of $44.7 million, or 67 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter, up from $34.7 million, or 53 cents per share, one year earlier.Analysts were calling for earnings of 51 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Weight Watchers' quarterly revenue climbed 15 percent, to $323.7 million, up from $280.8 million last year.Analysts were calling for sales of $316 million, Thomson Reuters said.Not expecting to slow down anytime soon, Weight Watchers has raised its earnings outlook for the full year, now expecting to earn $1.77 to $1.83 a share versus a prior forecast of $1.57 to $1.67.The weight-loss company ended the latest quarter with 3.4 million subscribers, up 18 percent from last year.Weight Watchers owes some of its success to Oprah Winfrey, who acquired a stake in the business about two years ago and became the face of its campaigns.Since then, Weight Watchers has posted eight-consecutive quarters of membership increases.
WWE sees 'massive opportunity' in China and India:::::World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is setting its sights on the two most populous countries in the world to enhance an already "astronomical" growth rate, according to one of WWE's biggest players.Speaking at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday, Paul Michael Levesque better known by his ring name Triple H said WWE would look to stimulate the most growth in China and India over the coming months.The 14-time WWE champion stressed that while 70 percent of the WWE's viewership were internationally based, it currently accounted for just 30 percent of the franchise's overall revenue."What we need to do is create a talent pipeline, we need to do it globally and we need to do it now," Triple H said.He described the opportunity in China as "massive," before adding that wrestling's popularity in India had soared to such an extent that it had become second only to the national sport of cricket.Last year, the WWE launched a new tournament in London in order to try and find the next breed of British superstars.Triple H said Tuesday that it would continue to be this type of "localized content" that would help expand the WWE's global presence.
Avis shares hammered after hurricanes hit revenue:::::Avis Budget Group stock plunged nearly 12 percent in midday trading Tuesday after reporting rising costs for its fleet of automobiles.The car rental company reported third quarter profits after Monday's close above estimates, but revenue of $2.75 billion was below Wall Street's expectations of $2.78 billion in a FactSet survey of analysts.Avis' costs per vehicle rose 3 percent, which company management has previously said is due to increasing the rental fleet too quickly in the first half of the year.MKM Partners remained optimistic despite the lackluster results, saying "the outlook for fleet costs is more sanguine" looking into 2018."Hurricane headwinds in the third quarter should not mask improvement in underlying trends," MKM analyst Christopher Agnew wrote in a note Tuesday."While Agnew noted that the costs from hurricanes battering the southeast were greater than expected, he says "the market should and ultimately will look through noise from the storms.""We believe the strength in underlying trends are more important going forward," Agnew added.Avis lowered the higher end of its revenue forecast by $50 million for 2017, saying it now expects to generate between $8.9 billion and $8.8 billion.
Chief marketing officers might become chief growth officers:::::When Coca-Cola consolidated marketing into a new "chief growth officer" (CGO) role in March, it followed previous Fortune 100 companies in doing so Hershey's announced Mary Beth West had joined as CGO earlier that month, while Kellogg gave the same job title to Clive Sirkin in 2015.According to consultancy Forrester, this is a trend that will continue next year."In 2018, we expect CMOs to fall under even more pressure to drive growth or step aside while someone else takes the reins," its "Predictions 2018" report states.The new CGO roles will include marketing, strategy and commercial responsibility, with Forrester suggesting eight more Fortune 100 companies will appoint such positions in 2018.It predicts that CMOs will "grow or go" in the coming year, with chief executives expected to put marketers under pressure to reduce advertising spend.
SocGen investigated over possible French anti-corruption law breach:::::Societe Generale said the French financial prosecutor had opened a preliminary investigation into possible violations by the bank of French anti-corruption laws, and had requested documents on its ties with the Libyan Investment Authority.Earlier this year Societe Generale agreed to pay nearly 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to settle a long-running dispute with the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), avoiding a costly and potentially embarrassing court case.LIA, Libya's sovereign wealth fund, had presented allegations that trades were secured as part of a "fraudulent and corrupt scheme" involving the payment of $58.5 million by SocGen to a Panama-registered company.The bank said in an update to its 2016 annual report published on Monday, that in September and October 2017 it had received judicial requests from the French financial prosecutor."Societe Generale also received two judicial requests to produce documents regarding its relations with the LIA in the scope of a preliminary investigation opened by the French National Financial Prosecutor's office regarding possible violations of French anticorruption laws," it said.A spokesman for SocGen declined to comment further on Tuesday.SocGen is also currently in discussions with U.S. authorities in order to reach an agreement to resolve an investigation into potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in connection with certain transactions involving Libyan counterparties, including the Libyan Investment Authority."Any such agreement would include a requirement that Societe Generale pay a monetary fine and may in addition impose other sanctions," the bank said in the update, adding that it was impossible to determine with certainty the amount of the fine."It is possible, without it being certain, that the pending discussions lead to an agreement in the next weeks or months".The bank had 2.2 billion euros in litigation provisions as of end-September.
A.I. could produce 'a new sector that we probably don't know about yet,' Nasdaq vice chair says:::::Firms exploiting the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) could spawn a completely new sector, the vice chairman of U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq said Tuesday."I think AI is really going to be the technology behind a lot of these great companies that provide the innovations that will be a new sector we probably don't know about yet," Bruce Aust told CNBC at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.Aust highlighted self-driving cars as an example of companies utilizing AI technology to create an entirely new market."You look at autonomous vehicles, things like that, they really do use a lot of artificial intelligence too.So I think we're excited about the early stage companies that are here, and we hope that eventually they'll come to market and list on Nasdaq one day."The executive said that AI could be "applied to really enhance and modernize a lot of things that we're doing today" and create more jobs, contrary to fears of mass job losses caused by automation of manual labor.On Monday, physicist Stephen Hawking gave a less optimistic view of the technology.Hawking said that, with the potential of AI, dangers such as autonomous weapons and economic challenges could spell the "worst event in the history of our civilization."
Ackman investors wonder if ADP bet will deliver their paychecks:::::Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman faces a crucial shareholder vote on Tuesday that will decide his months-long battle with Automatic Data Processing to get three seats on the payroll company's board.The result could affect not just his scorecard as a corporate agitator but the amount of capital investors maintain at his firm.A handful of investors have told Reuters they are either pulling cash out of Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management or considering doing so after a string of setbacks on his high-profile investments.Withdrawals and losses have shrunk Pershing Square's assets to $10 billion as of Sept. 30, less than half of what it had in early 2015 but the same amount it managed in 2013.If Ackman loses the ADP proxy contest, dealing a blow to his efforts to make the paycheck processor and human-resources technology company more efficient and profitable, it is not clear that ADP's shares will fall or that he will sell his $2.3 billion stake.But clients, rivals, and associates say that if the ADP bet does not work out, it could be another strike against Ackman's once-unquestioned investing prowess and could threaten outside capital housed with his firm."It is only so long that we can ignore poor performance," said Joelle Mevi, chief investment officer at the City of Fort Worth Employees Retirement Fund, which is invested with Pershing Square.George Hopkins, executive director of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, which invests $180 million with Ackman, said his fund has not made any moves to exit Pershing Square but is not planning to add money either.Several others said they were waiting to decide whether to stay with Ackman.
Indonesia threatens to block WhatsApp over sexual content:::::Indonesian authorities say they will block access to the popular WhatsApp instant messaging app if it doesn't remove sexually explicit content.The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology said Tuesday on its website that it has already asked internet companies to block domain names used by Tenor, which provides animated image files known as GIFs through WhatsApp.The government has sent three notices to WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook and widely used in Indonesia, asking it to remove pornographic content and will block the app if there's no response by Wednesday, ministry official Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan said at a news conference on Monday.Indonesia blocked web versions of the messaging app Telegram in July because it included chat groups for Islamic State group supporters.It lifted the partial ban after Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov visited Indonesia in August and agreed on efforts to remove radical content.Facebook's Asia spokeswoman Charlene Chian said that WhatsApp lets users search for GIFs using third-party providers and that WhatsApp can't monitor their content because communications on the app are encrypted."We've directed the Indonesia government to work with these third-party providers to review their content," she said.Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has strict anti-pornography laws and authorities are increasingly seeking to censor online content they deem to be offensive or a threat to national unity.
Report: Apple revamped overseas ops to find new tax havens:::::Apple revamped its overseas subsidiaries to take advantage of tax loopholes on the European island of Jersey after a crackdown on Ireland's loose rules began in 2013, according to The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.The news outlet and the nonprofit investigative organization cited confidential records that were obtained by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung ("ZOOT-doi-cheh DZEYE-tung") and shared.The cache of 13 million secret documents came from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that helps businesses and wealthy individuals find tax shelters.The moves came after a U.S. Senate subcommittee found in 2013 that Apple had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by using overseas havens.The paper said Apple has $128 billion in offshore profits not taxed by the U.S. By 2015, Apple had moved the tax home of two Irish subsidiaries to Jersey, a self-governing island in the English Channel, and also made Ireland the tax home of a different European subsidiary.Apple said in response that the reports contained various "inaccuracies."For instance, the company said its 2015 corporate reorganization was "specially designed to preserve its tax payments to the United States, not to reduce its taxes anywhere else."The Cupertino, California-based company said it was the largest taxpayer in the world, paying $35 billion in corporate income tax over the last three years, including $1.5 billion in Ireland.It said it pays an effective tax rate of 21 percent on foreign earnings.The company said that it told regulators in the U.S. and European Commission of the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries in 2015 and said the moves did not reduce its tax payments in any country.
It's becoming clear just how worried UK firms are about a Brexit cliff-edge:::::But, of course, there will also be an impact on European firms that have close links to the U.K.The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) recently reported that British businesses are increasingly searching for domestic suppliers, to obviate the need for any European participants in their supply chain.This will bolster the argument that Brexit will raise costs for many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and will have negative consequences for Britain's trading relationship with the single market.And that cuts both ways.Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of the EU companies the CIPS has surveyed said they were planning to relocate aspects of their supply chain elsewhere, as the British government prepares to exit Europe's customs union.That is a significant increase from the institute's numbers back in May, when just 44 percent said they would be doing so.Another survey last week from Ipsos Mori found that more than four-fifths of foreign businesses operating inside the U.K. were "not very," or indeed "not at all confident" about a positive outcome from the negotiations that will end in March 2019.And a mere one in eight foreign firms took an optimistic view.But that does not stop Theresa May from talking positively about a "new chapter in the story of the British economy."Speaking in the shadow of Canary Wharf before heading back to Downing Street in her five-vehicle convoy with police motorcycle outriders, the prime minister promised attendees at the CBI conference that her government would get "the best Brexit deal" for Britain.But nobody should be under any illusion that what that constitutes is entirely subjective, and it comes with a caveat that it can only be the best "possible" deal under the circumstances.Right now, May's most pressing priority in the negotiations, as she acknowledged, is to nail down detailed arrangements for what she terms a "time-limited implementation period."Besides adding to the work-load of already overburdened British diplomats, such a multi-pronged request designed to buy British business more time to plan for the future is useless unless it too comes with what the CBI's Fairbairn demands: unity, clarity and, at this late stage, urgency.Correction: This story has been updated to correctly identify the U.K. CEO of JLL as Chris Ireland.
Lockheed gets Air Force contract to develop high-power airborne laser weapons:::::Lockheed Martin has been awarded an Air Force Research Laboratory contract to develop and produce high-energy fiber laser weapons for tactical fighter aircraft.Analysts say airborne laser weapons could help non-stealth military aircraft become more resistant to enemy missiles and potentially reduce the vulnerability to advanced air-defense systems.In a release, Lockheed said its team is "focused on developing a compact, high efficiency laser within challenging size, weight and power constraints."It said the Air Force lab plans to test the laser on a tactical fighter jet by 2021.The contact is valued at $26.2 million, but the potential market opportunity for such airborne weapon systems in the future could become significant once technology challenges are overcome."There are a couple of great advantages of laser weapons, assuming all the technology works properly," said Daniel Goure, a defense analyst and senior vice president of the Lexington Institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization based in Arlington, Virginia."You get a low cost per shot much cheaper than a missile in almost every case."Added Goure, "One of the things we find in a lot of our systems land, sea and air is that we run out of shots particularly on the defense.You just run out of bullets or missiles.And if you have laser, it avoids having to reload."The Lockheed contract is part of the Air Force lab's so-called Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator Advanced Technology Demonstrator (or SHiELD), which is designed to combine small, high-power laser systems on tactical aircraft for self-defense capabilities, including to defend against missiles."Lockheed Martin continues to rapidly advance laser weapon systems and the technologies that make them possible," Rob Afzal, senior fellow of laser weapon systems at Lockheed Martin said in a release."We have demonstrated our ability to use directed energy to counter threats from the ground, and look forward to future tests from the air as part of the SHiELD system."Afzal pointed out that Lockheed earlier this year delivered a ground-based laser for U.S. Army vehicles."It's a completely new and different challenge to get a laser system into a smaller, airborne test platform," said the Lockheed executive."It's exciting to see this technology mature enough to embed in an aircraft."Laser weapon systems could one day become standard for self-defense capabilities on Air Force aircraft and augment existing kinetic capabilities.It could also be used to better defend non-stealth aircraft that are seen as increasingly vulnerable to advanced anti-aircraft defense systems developed by Russia and China.Ian Williams, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said even Iranian air defenses are now seen as potentially a challenge for non-stealth U.S. warplanes."We have to have stealthy platforms that can penetrate those systems, but if you're looking at something larger like a B-52 or transport aircraft bringing in troops ... they would need extra protection beyond the traditional kind of countermeasures," said Williams.According to Williams, the military isn't necessarily looking just to kill enemy missiles with directed energy weapons but can also "blind it or throw it off course.They are looking at a lot of applications."Overall, directed energy weapons are still considered a nascent market although significant progress has been made on laser weapons for use in naval and ground-based applications, including systems capable of downing drones.Airborne laser weapon research isn't new and Boeing was one of the early pioneers."There's been a lot of progress on getting the size of directed energy platforms down," said Williams."They did this a while back with a large chemical laser on a 747 that they used to destroy some Scud-type missiles in tests."In 2002, Boeing began testing an airborne laser weapons systems aboard a 747-400 aircraft for the Air Force in a program known as YAL-1.The flying testbed was designed to shoot down missiles but had mixed success and the Pentagon scrapped the $5 billion project in 2011."It wasn't seen as a practical platform just because you're not going to be flying a 747 full of chemical tanks on it through enemy air space," said Williams."But it demonstrated that it was possible to destroy missiles with lasers."Goure agreed, saying the earlier testing provided "an incredible amount as kind of R&D" for the military both in terms of pointing and tracking as well as managing lasers so they could do damage to targets."Those kind of things are worth their weight in gold," Goure said."You can build the most powerful laser in the world, but if you don't get the pointing, tracking and beam control right, you've got a big lighter on your hands and that's it."Boeing's airborne laser for the YAL-1 used a chemical laser that was fired through the nose assembly on the jet.The Lockheed contract is for a fiber laser, although it's not considered as powerful as the chemical laser based on current technology.That said, analysts say the chemical lasers tend to be heavier so are less portable and can be toxic and dangerous to handle.As a result, the fiber laser or solid state lasers are considered more practical and current research and development is aimed at helping them to become powerful and reliable.
Priceline earnings Q3 2017:::::Shares of The Priceline Group fell after hours Monday after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter guidance that overshadowed positive third-quarter results.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: $35.22 per share vs. $34.25 expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Revenue: $4.43 billion vs. $4.34 billion expected in the Thomson Reuters survey.Gross bookings: $21.8 billion vs. $21.45 billion expected, according to StreetAccount's consensus Shares of the company fell more than 9 percent after hours.Priceline projected growth in room nights booked of between 8 percent and 13 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with estimates of 15 percent.For the fourth quarter of 2016, room nights booked grew 31 percent year over year.Room night bookings and rental car days both grew slower year over year in the third quarter of 2017 compared with the year-ago quarter.The company has seen strong growth, fueled by its business overseas.Priceline has said that it expects that trend to continue as more travelers outside the U.S. embrace online travel booking.The company is eyeing opportunities in China in particular.Last month, the company announced a $450 million investment in Chinese mobile internet company Meituan-Dianping.CEO Glenn Fogel has said that China is the company's most important market.On a conference call with investors following the earnings release, however, he said it was a very competitive market."We have to continue to be mindful that if we don't give the best price, we may not get the booking," Fogel said.While Priceline continues to experience strong growth, the online travel market is becoming crowded.Google's travel business is encroaching, and is possibly even larger than Priceline, according to the research firm Skift.Priceline has cited Google's "Book on Google" reservation functionality, as well as its Flights and Hotels features, as possible risks to its business.Though Google Flights launched more than five years ago, Google appears to be getting increasingly serious about the service.Fogel acknowledged competition on Monday for instantly bookable vacation rentals offered by companies such as Airbnb."I'm not naive; I recognize we are not the leader in this space right now," he said."There is a competitor who is a little bit bigger and doing a little bit better I suspect in this area than we are.And that's why we are going to invest money," he said.Shares of competitor Expedia nosedived in October after the company reported weak booking numbers that it attributed to hurricanes and struggles with hotel price comparison site Trivago.Priceline shares had surged nearly 30 percent so far this year.They were up almost 20 percent year-to-date following Monday's slip.
JC Penney set to open its doors earlier on Thanksgiving:::::J.C. Penney is opening its doors on Thanksgiving an hour earlier this year, the retailer announced Monday, keeping with an industry-wide trend to get a jump-start on seasonal deals.Penney's doors will open for 2017's Turkey Day at 2 p.m., compared with 3 p.m. in past years.Meantime, Penney's department store peers Macy's and Kohl's are both opting to open at 5 p.m. this year.While Macy's didn't adjust its hours, Kohl's shifted to kick things off one hour earlier.Big-box retailer Target also on Monday unveiled its Thanksgiving store hours, planning to open at 6 p.m., while Wal-Mart has yet to announce its holiday schedule.New to this year, Target will close briefly at midnight and reopen its doors at 6 a.m. on Black Friday.Toys R Us, in its holiday push, will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving and remain open for 30 consecutive hours.On the whole, retailers are pushing deals and sticking with early openings this holiday season.Eating a Turkey Day lunch then hitting the stores still seems to be a popular choice."Getting a late start to the holiday shopping season" has become less frequent over the past decade, according to survey findings from NPD Group.In 2017, more Americans are expected to begin their holiday shopping in the middle of the season, or Thanksgiving weekend, as opposed to beginning later in the season, NPD said.In an attempt to arouse excitement around shopping its stores, Penney's is challenging its customers this year to "get everything on their list for less than they think."The company is encouraging shoppers to post photos of their receipts on social media to flaunt their savings.Penney's said it will post its Black Friday sale prices online as early as Nov. 19.And the department store chain is hosting a "Black Friday Prices Now" event from Nov. 16-18, promising Black Friday-esque prices on items such as pajamas, cookware and jewelry.For comparison, Kohl's 2017 holiday strategy includes more ways for shoppers to earn Kohl's Cash, in-store deals on Cyber Monday and heavier Black Friday promotions that started as soon as last week.Sears, in a big push, is taking the month of November to put its entire store on sale.And Wal-Mart is trying to lure shoppers in earlier with more in-store events and holiday parties the first of which took place Saturday.Penney's, though, could arguably use a boost this holiday season more than most.Just last month, the retailer slashed its 2017 profit and comparable sales forecasts, sending Penney's shares to an all-time low.Chief Executive Marvin Ellison explained the company has been discounting heavily ahead of the holidays to get rid of excess inventory.Then, just last Friday, Penney's revealed that its current chief merchandising officer, John Tighe, will be leaving the company and won't be replaced."This simplified structure offers greater flexibility, which is critical to ensuring our assortment remains fresh and relevant, and compels more shoppers to choose JCPenney," Ellison said in prepared remarks about the changes.Penney's shares have fallen near 70 percent in 2017.
Target joins retailers in kicking off Black Friday deals early:::::Target will give some shoppers a taste of its Black Friday deals even earlier this year.The big-box retailer announced on Monday plans to offer "early access" shopping for its credit card holders on Nov. 22, the Wednesday before turkey day.That morning, more than 100 deals will go live on Target.com."This is the most Black Friday deals the retailer has ever made available before Thanksgiving," Target said in a statement.One top deal from the Minneapolis-based retailer this year is buy one item, get one at 50 percent off on hundreds of beauty sets.It's the most beauty bundles Target has ever put on sale.The company also plans to push its new in-house fashion brands, like A New Day and Goodfellow & Co., by offering steep holiday discounts.Meantime, Target has unveiled its Thanksgiving store hours, planning to open its doors at 6 p.m. that Thursday, in line with the past three years.However, new to this year, Target will close its stores at midnight and reopen at 6 a.m. on Black Friday."These new hours will accommodate guests who make Black Friday shopping part of their Thanksgiving tradition, and reflect when the retailer has seen the most shopping in stores for the past several years," the retailer said.This year, Target isn't alone in rolling out deals earlier in November.Department store chain Kohl's 2017 holiday strategy includes more ways for shoppers to earn Kohl's Cash, in-store deals on Cyber Monday and heavier Black Friday promotions that started last week.Sears, in a big push, is taking the month to put its entire store on sale.And Wal-Mart is trying to lure shoppers in earlier with more in-store events and holiday parties.The first one took place Saturday."Getting a late start to the holiday shopping season" has become less frequent over the past decade, according to survey findings from NPD Group.This year, more Americans are expected to begin their holiday shopping in the middle of the season, or Thanksgiving weekend, as opposed to beginning later in the season, NPD said.Target, like many U.S. retailers, could use a holiday boost to round out the year.As of Monday, its shares have fallen more than 18 percent in 2017.
Michael Kors hikes 2018 outlook, sending luxury retailer's shares up:::::Michael Kors is starting to see a lift from its turnaround efforts.The handbag retailer on Monday raised its sales and profit outlook for fiscal 2018, having finally completed its acquisition of luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo."Our second quarter results were better than expected, and we are pleased with our continued progress executing on our strategic plan, Runway 2020," Chief Executive John Idol said in prepared remarks."The positive signs that we are seeing in our business illustrate that our efforts across product innovation, brand engagement and our customer experience are beginning to take hold," Idol added.Michael Kors' shares were climbing more than 14 percent Monday morning on the news.The London-based brand on Monday reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $202.9 million, or $1.32 per share, up from $160.9 million, or 95 cents a share, one year ago.Excluding one-time items, Michael Kors earned $1.33 a share, outpacing a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate for 83 cents.Total sales climbed 5.4 percent, to $1.15 billion, up from $1.09 billion during the same period last year.Analysts were calling for sales of $1.05 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters."Michael Kors has been on a long journey of reinvention, but these latest numbers suggest the brand is starting to reach its destination of reestablishing itself as a well-regarded premium player," GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients."Strategically, the decision to buy Jimmy Choo along with the latest collections, suggests that Michael Kors is looking to move into a more exclusive and distinct part of the luxury market," Saunders added.With another brand in its pocket now, Michael Kors expects total revenue for fiscal 2018 to be roughly $4.59 billion, which includes between $215 million and $225 million of incremental Jimmy Choo sales.Previously, the company was calling for revenue closer to $4.28 billion.Full-year adjusted earnings per share are now expected to come in between $3.85 and $3.95, which includes an 8-cent impact from Jimmy Choo."[Michael Kors is] one of the largest accessories companies in the world," Idol told CNBC earlier this year."We have two industry leaders with this [Jimmy Choo] deal.... We feel that the luxury space is the best opportunity long term."To be sure, Michael Kors increasingly faces competition from other luxury brands and especially handbag maker Coach, which just changed its parent name to Tapestry after it acquired accessories brand Kate Spade earlier this year.During the quarter, Michael Kors said it created a "platform for future acquisitions," as it continues to pilot refreshed store concepts and maintains a focus on "luxury layering" throughout its product categories.Including Monday's gains, Michael Kors shares have climbed more than 25 percent in 2017.
China and Australia ink fintech deal to share information on new trends:::::China and Australia's regulators have agreed to partner up on financial technology (fintech), a move that will give them oversight on new trends in each other's markets.The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said Monday that they would cooperate on the sharing of information related to emerging themes in the fintech sector."Cooperation between regulators is essential to realize the benefits of the technological revolution," Greg Medcraft, chairman of the ASIC, said in a statement Monday."Understanding new developments and their impact in overseas markets helps us to remain proactive and forward-looking in our domestic approach."
Trump says Japan could shoot missiles from North Korea 'out of the sky':::::Trump: What happened to Otto Warmbier in North Korea is 'a horrible story 2:22 AM ET Mon, 6 Nov 2017 | 01:31 Japan could shoot down North Korean missiles with U.S. military technology, President Donald Trump has said.Trump said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be well-equipped for an attack from North Korea after buying equipment from the U.S. "He will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States," Trump told a press conference Monday."He will easily shoot them out of the sky, just like we shot something out of the sky the other day in Saudi Arabia, as you saw."Trump was referring to a missile fired by Yemen, which was reportedly intercepted by Saudi Arabia over the weekend.The president referred to that particular missile as "a needle in the sky," and said that the U.S. makes "the best military equipment by far."He added that the purchasing of military equipment would bring both employment to the U.S. and safety to Japan."It's a lot of jobs for us, and a lot of safety for Japan, and other countries that are likewise purchasing military equipment from us, that frankly a year ago or two years ago were not."
A new twist: Trump a victim of hackers years before election:::::Four years ago, well before the furor over allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 election that put Donald Trump in the White House, at least 195 web addresses belonging to Trump, his family or his business empire were hijacked by hackers possibly operating out of Russia, The Associated Press has learned.The Trump Organization denied the domain names were ever compromised.But a review of internet records by the AP and cybersecurity experts shows otherwise.And it was not until this past week, after the Trump camp was asked about it by the AP, that the last of the tampered-with addresses were repaired.After the hack, computer users who visited the Trump-related addresses were unwittingly redirected to servers in St. Petersburg, Russia, that cybersecurity experts said contained malicious software commonly used to steal passwords or hold files for ransom.Whether anyone fell victim to such tactics is unclear.A further mystery is who the hackers were and why they did it.The discovery represents a new twist in the Russian hacking story, which up to now has focused mostly on what U.S. intelligence officials say was a campaign by the Kremlin to try to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy and benefit Trump's.It is not known whether the hackers who tampered with the Trump addresses are the same ones who stole Democratic officials' emails and embarrassed the party in the heat of the campaign last year.Nor is it clear whether the hackers were acting on behalf of the Russian government.The affected addresses, or domain names, included donaldtrump.org, donaldtrumpexecutiveoffice.com, donaldtrumprealty.com and barrontrump.com.They were compromised in two waves of attacks in August and September 2013, according to the review of internet records.The attacks took place as Trump was preparing to travel to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, which was held on Nov. 9, 2013, at a property owned by a wealthy Russian real estate developer.Many of the addresses were not being used by Trump.Businesses and public figures commonly buy addresses for possible future use or to prevent them from falling into the hands of rivals or enemies.The Trump Organization and its affiliates own at least 3,300 in all.According to security experts, the hackers hijacked the addresses by penetrating and altering the domain registration records housed at GoDaddy.com, a seller of web addresses.Accounts at GoDaddy, like at any site that requires a user name and password, are often subject to malicious messages known as phishing attacks, which are designed to trick people to reveal that personal information to hackers.Computer users who entered or clicked on one of those Trump addresses probably would have had no idea they were redirected to servers in Russia.Within days after the AP asked the Trump Organization about the tampering, the affected web addresses were all corrected.
One of Asia's major banks just sacrificed profits to finally put bad loans behind it:::::DBS has been 'conservative' and 'proactive' on oil services: CEO 12:33 AM ET Mon, 6 Nov 2017 | 05:08 Southeast Asia's largest bank, DBS Group Holdings, unexpectedly set aside another 815 million Singapore dollars ($597.4 million) to cover for bad loans from the troubled oil and gas sector a move it hopes will finally put worries over asset quality behind it.That action resulted in a 23 percent year-on-year fall in net profit to S$822 million ($602.2 million), the bank said in its third-quarter earnings release.That fell short of the S$1.13 billion ($828.2 million) average estimate by analysts in a Reuters poll.DBS, wrapping up earnings season for Singapore's largest banks, lagged behind its smaller peers.Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp's third-quarter net profit jumped 12 percent from a year ago to S$1.06 billion ($776.8 million), and United Overseas Bank reported a 12 percent increase to S$883 million ($647.1 million) over the same period.But DBS Group Chief Executive Piyush Gupta said the bank was being conservative in recognizing bad loans.He explained that his company decided to classify certain loans as non-performing even though they are not yet overdue.Doing so will allow investors to turn their focus to DBS' "operating performance and digital agenda," he added."We've chosen in this quarter to be conservative and to be proactive," Gupta told CNBC."We bumped up our provisions to 1.5 billion (Singapore dollars) to cover everything else.Therefore, I think we're pretty much cleaned up on this portfolio and I really do not expect to see any further impairments coming down the pipe on account of offshore marine and oil and gas."
Qatar Airways to buy 9.6% stake in Cathay Pacific:::::Hong Kong's Kingboard Chemical Holdings on Monday said it had agreed to sell its 9.6 percent stake in Cathay Pacific Airways to Middle Eastern carrier Qatar Airways for HK$5.16 billion ($661 million).Kingboard, an investment holding company, said it would recognise a gain of HK$800 million on the sale which represented its entire stake in the Hong Kong airline.Cathay shares have risen by 29.4 percent since the start of January despite the airline in August posting its worst first-half loss in 20 years.The Hong Kong airline has a highly concentrated share register with Swire Pacific owning 45 percent and Air China holding 30 percent.This is not the first time Qatar Airways has taken a stake in another airline.The carrier owns 20 percent of International Consolidated Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, as well as 10 percent of South America's LATAM Airlines Group and 49 percent of Italy's Meridiana.Qatar Airways and Cathay are both members of the oneworld alliance, as is British Airways and LATAM.The Qatari carrier in August dropped plans to build a stake of up to 4.75 percent in American Airlines Group.Those investment plans were met with suspicion by critics at a time when Qatar is embroiled in the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights dispute with three other Gulf states.
Turkey's plan to acquire Russia's S-400 air-defense system may never happen, analysts say:::::Analysts say the sale has other problems too, including the Russian military equipment's lack of interoperability with NATO's armed forces.No NATO ally currently operates the S-400."I do not think it will happen," said Luke Coffey, director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, the Washington-based conservative think tank.First, he believes Ankara is using the Russians as leverage to get a better deal on an air-defense system from the U.S. or a European ally.Second, he doesn't believe Moscow will transfer the S-400 technology to Turkey.Indeed, Turkish paper Hurriyet last month reported a Putin advisor, Vladimir Kojin, had said Russia would not provide the technology transfer sought by Ankara.Also, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was quoted by the Istanbul paper Aksam as saying: "If Russia doesn't want to comply, we'll make an arrangement with another country."Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a note last month that Erdogan "overruled" the comments by his foreign minister and also "pointed out having talks over the still-in-development S-500 missile system," a newer version of Russia's defense system.Even so, Russian media have still played up Turkish interest in the S-400 for many months, noting that China was a buyer of the system.More recently, it's been reported that Saudi Arabia is interested in the air defense system.Back in 2015, Turkey looked set to acquire China's export version of the FD-2000 long-range air-defense missile system for $3.4 billion but backed out after pressure from NATO.Also, the Chinese reportedly refused to budge on all of the Ankara government's technology-transfer demands."We're not expecting Turkey to switch course again, but further estrangement from the U.S./NATO and closer ties with Russia could create risks around existing programs like the F-35," said Keay.Turkey is scheduled to get 100 F-35 stealth fighter jets, with the first aircraft delivery expected to happen in 2019.Despite strains in the U.S.-Turkish alliance, analysts say the controversial Erdogan probably is playing to a domestic audience with the Russian hardware purchase since it fits into his strategy to continue consolidating power and demonstrating regional superpower status regardless of NATO."Turkey is doing a lot of posturing to show that it is capable of going elsewhere besides NATO for its weapons and its alliances," said Loren Thompson, a defense industry consultant and chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a Virginia-based public-policy think tank supported by U.S. defense giants.Since a failed coup attempt in 2016, Erdogan's government has detained several Americans.Erdogan blames the West for helping alleged coup plotters and their sympathizers.Other challenges in the U.S.-Turkish relationship stem from the U.S. alliance with the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces to defeat ISIS.The Kurdish YPG militia are a branch of the outlawed terrorist group PKK (or Kurdistan Workers' Party), which is accused of killing some 1,200 Turkish security forces and civilians.Additionally, there's been a diplomatic dispute between Ankara and Washington that led Erdogan last month to accuse the U.S. of unfairly treating its longtime ally.There's also been a diplomatic spat and suspension of visa services to each other's citizens.Meantime, Erdogan and Putin have worked to mend a relationship that was rocked after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet in late 2015.Putin has visited Turkey at least two times since ties between the two countries resumed last year."Maybe Erdogan and Putin get along personally, but these countries have been competitors and enemies on and off through the course of centuries," said Coffey."The idea that they will all of a sudden become these close buddies goes against the grain of history."Added Coffey, "Erdogan tries to play one off the other to advance Turkey's position in the region.He'll cooperate with Russia when he thinks it suits it, or then he'll go back to NATO and the U.S."
Inside story: How Russians hacked the Democrats' emails:::::It was just before noon in Moscow on March 10, 2016, when the first volley of malicious messages hit the Hillary Clinton campaign.The first 29 phishing emails were almost all misfires.Addressed to people who worked for Clinton during her first presidential run, the messages bounced back untouched.Except one.Within nine days, some of the campaign's most consequential secrets would be in the hackers' hands, part of a massive operation aimed at vacuuming up millions of messages from thousands of inboxes across the world.An Associated Press investigation into the digital break-ins that disrupted the U.S. presidential contest has sketched out an anatomy of the hack that led to months of damaging disclosures about the Democratic Party's nominee.It wasn't just a few aides that the hackers went after; it was an all-out blitz across the Democratic Party.They tried to compromise Clinton's inner circle and more than 130 party employees, supporters and contractors.While U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was behind the email thefts, the AP drew on forensic data to report Thursday that the hackers known as Fancy Bear were closely aligned with the interests of the Russian government.The AP's reconstruction based on a database of 19,000 malicious links recently shared by cybersecurity firm Secureworks shows how the hackers worked their way around the Clinton campaign's top-of-the-line digital security to steal chairman John Podesta's emails in March 2016.It also helps explain how a Russian-linked intermediary could boast to a Trump policy adviser, a month later, that the Kremlin had "thousands of emails" worth of dirt on Clinton.Phishing for victims The rogue messages that first flew across the internet March 10 were dressed up to look like they came from Google, the company that provided the Clinton campaign's email infrastructure.The messages urged users to boost their security or change their passwords while in fact steering them toward decoy websites designed to collect their credentials.One of the first people targeted was Rahul Sreenivasan, who had worked as a Clinton organizer in Texas in 2008 his first paid job in politics.Sreenivasan, now a legislative staffer in Austin, was dumbfounded when told by the AP that hackers had tried to break into his 2008 email an address he said had been dead for nearly a decade."They probably crawled the internet for this stuff," he said.Almost everyone else targeted in the initial wave was, like Sreenivasan, a 2008 staffer whose defunct email address had somehow lingered online.But one email made its way to the account of another staffer who'd worked for Clinton in 2008 and joined again in 2016, the AP found.It's possible the hackers broke in and stole her contacts; the data shows the phishing links sent to her were clicked several times.Secureworks' data reveals when phishing links were created and indicates whether they were clicked.But it doesn't show whether people entered their passwords.Within hours of a second volley emailed March 11, the hackers hit pay dirt.All of a sudden, they were sending links aimed at senior Clinton officials' nonpublic 2016 addresses, including those belonging to longtime Clinton aide Robert Russo and campaign chairman John Podesta.The Clinton campaign was no easy target; several former employees said the organization put particular stress on digital safety.
Snapchat User Growth Disappoints in Another Down Quarter:::::In total, Snaps third quarter revenue was $207.9 million, up 62 percent from a year ago but below Wall Street estimates of $235.5 million.Its net loss was $443.2 million nearly four times the size of the loss a year ago and more than twice as large as what analysts had predicted.About half of that loss was because of the cost of stock-based compensation that the company pays its employees.Snap added 5 million users to its Snapchat messaging service from the previous quarter, but that, too was below estimates from Wall Street, which expected 8 million new users.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Snaps chief executive, Evan Spiegel, said revenue growth had been hurt by the companys move to automate its ad-buying process.That transition caused ad pricing to drop by about 60 percent from the previous year, he said, though the change is now largely complete.I am grateful that this transition is nearly behind us, Mr. Spiegel said on a call with analysts.This has been a good test for our business.Mr. Spiegel also said that Snap was redesigning its app to make it easier to use and that the company would focus on user growth in 2018, as well as on content and augmented reality.In the past, Mr. Spiegel has said little about Snaps product strategy.Unlike many other companies, Snap also does not give an estimate for future revenue in its earnings report.Mr. Spiegels talk of goals for 2018 and notes of contrition were a welcome change.For the past two quarters, analysts have expressed frustration over Mr. Spiegels unwillingness to give guidance about the companys product strategy.On stage at a recent conference, Mr. Spiegel said that he needed to do a better job communicating with investors.Snap also indicated it was cutting back on Spectacles, its video recording sunglasses.The company said it had misjudged strong early demand for Spectacles and wrote off $39.9 million of the sunglasses in the quarter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said there remained reasons for optimism about Snap and he questioned Wall Streets focus on user growth.The last time I checked this isnt a subscription business, he said of Snapchat.Theyve done really well retaining their users.Theyre doing well at what they say they can do.Snap has also avoided the kind of criticism that other tech companies have faced over the use of their technology to spread false and misleading information.Last week, Facebook, Twitter and Google faced questions from Congress about how they were turned into a distribution platform for bogus news during the 2016 presidential campaign.Snap tightly controls the news and entertainment content that appears on its Discover news platform.
Ackman Is Defeated in Activist Bid to Jolt ADP Board:::::But in remarks at the shareholder meeting where the votes were tallied, Carlos Rodriguez, ADPs chief executive, disputed Mr. Ackmans rosy interpretation of the outcome.Bill, despite your characterization of the result as close, what I was told was this was an ass-whooping, Mr. Rodriguez said.The result was a very public no-confidence vote in Mr. Ackman by the investor community.He made his name as one of the most aggressive activist investors, shaking up companies like Wendys and Canadian Pacific Railway and enriching himself and his investors along the way.But his performance has suffered in recent years.An investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International cost Mr. Ackmans hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, around $4 billion, prompting Mr. Ackman to acknowledge it was a huge mistake.His bet against Herbalife, the supplements company, has also proved to be a mistake.And his investments in companies including Borders and J.C. Penny did not result in the promised turnarounds, either.Other activist investors have also struggled to sway investors this year.Nelson Peltz tried to shake up Procter & Gamble, but lost a shareholder vote by a slim margin last month and is awaiting the results of a recount.And David Einhorn faltered in his campaign to shake up the General Motors board and create a new class of shares.ADP was an unusual target for Mr. Ackman.Although the company is facing challenges from upstarts that use newer technology, it has performed well in recent years.Revenue has grown steadily, and the stock has doubled over the last five years.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Despite that, Mr. Ackman started his aggressive campaign in August, suggesting that Mr. Rodriguez should be replaced as chief executive.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Rodriguez did not mention Mr. Ackman in a statement on Tuesday announcing the results.This process has sharpened our focus on the importance of insightful, strategic engagement with our investors, which, over the past few months, has given us a greater appreciation of our owners perspectives on our business and growth plans, he said in the statement.Mr. Ackman and his candidates were defeated despite having substantial support from the three main proxy advisory firms, which give shareholders advice on how to vote in such situations.Two of the firms, Egan-Jones and Glass Lewis, supported the election of Mr. Ackman and both his nominees.But Institutional Shareholders Services, or I.S.S., the most influential of the firms, essentially encouraged investors to vote for Mr. Ackman, but not Ms. Hagen or Mr. Unruh.That was clearly not enough to persuade ADP shareholders.Over the past several months, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of them about ADPs performance, strategy and our positive outlook for the future, as well as hear their ideas and views of the company, John Jones, the ADP board chairman, said in a statement.We appreciate all of their input and look forward to continuing that dialogue.Mr. Ackman said the company had expressed a commitment to improving margins and introducing new products in the future.As a major shareholder, he added, he would benefit if that happened.If they do that, the stock is going to do extremely well and we will win, he said in the interview on Tuesday.Our goal is not wining proxy contests, its making money for our investors.And if the company fails to perform well, Mr. Ackman said he would be back next year.This board will be under huge pressure to deliver, he said.Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of Okapi Partners, a firm that helps run proxy fights but was not involved in this one, said that Mr. Ackmans reputation had taken a blow, but that if ADP performed well in the future, investors might give him some of the credit.The short term sting to Ackmans reputation will be painful and may impact his next campaign, he said.Nevertheless, the true reputation of any activist is based on the change in value of the target selected and the impact on that value that can be attributed to the campaign.
How Business Titans, Pop Stars and Royals Hide Their Wealth:::::Serving a Growing Elite Founded in 1898 by a British officer, Maj. Reginald Appleby an avowed opponent of taxation Appleby now has offices in nearly all the worlds tax havens: Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Hong Kong, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Shanghai.Such locations offer low or zero tax rates, companies consisting only of a postbox, and accountants and lawyers skilled at hiding money.In a statement, Appleby said the firm had done nothing wrong.We are an offshore law firm who advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business, the statement said.We do not tolerate illegal behaviour.Income Rises for the Wealthy Share of pre-tax U.S. income, by percentile.% 60 40 20 0 Top 1% Top 10% Bottom 90% 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 In recent years, billionaires fortunes have grown by an average of 7 to 8 percent a year, while total wealth has grown at just 3 percent annually, said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.Globalization, deregulation and declining taxes have all been factors.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other important thing is the rise of the global, cross-border wealth management industry, including Appleby, Mr. Zucman said.The richest 1 percent of the worlds population now owns more than half of global wealth, and the top 10 percent owns about 90 percent.The data suggests that most of the gains at the top are coming at the expense of the rest of the population, Mr. Zucman said.That conclusion is shared by many other scholars.The wealthy use the power that accompanies their money, he said, to exert political influence, reduce taxes and regulation and hire experts to keep their money safe.Photo Minimizing Taxes Mr. Simons, the hedge fund billionaire, was a young math professor in 1974 when a Colombian friend established a trust in Bermuda on his behalf using a gift of $100,000 to him, his parents and his descendants.American tax authorities would consider the Lord Jim Trust, as it was named, a foreign entity, limiting the visibility of the Internal Revenue Service into its holdings and its ability to tax its funds until it made distributions to the Simons family.(Appleby did not create the trust but later provided legal advice.)In 1982, Mr. Simons founded Renaissance Technologies, a New York-based hedge fund whose secret trading algorithms soon generated rates of return that became storied on Wall Street.Over the next three decades, Renaissance became one of the most lucrative hedge funds on the planet, making Mr. Simons a billionaire many times over.Mr. Simons, in response to questions, said that when he and his family received distributions from the Bermuda trust, they were reported to the I.R.S.But Mr. Simons said he and his relatives took out only limited amounts, mainly in the early years of the trust, whose main investments were Renaissance funds that enjoyed spectacular returns.As Renaissances investments grew, so did its footprint in American life.Mr. Simons became one of the countrys top political donors.During the last election cycle, he was the sixth-largest contributor to political candidates and causes, giving more than $26 million, nearly all to Democrats, including $11 million to Priorities USA Action, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton.Photo Mr. Simonss business partner and Renaissances departing co-chief executive, Robert Mercer, rose to the highest ranks of Republican donors and became an influential backer of Donald J. Trumps presidential campaign, contributing more than $3 million.A major funder of Breitbart News, Mr. Mercer influenced critical decisions of Mr. Trumps candidacy, such as the hiring of Stephen K. Bannon, then Breitbarts executive chairman, as the campaigns chief executive.Mr.Mercer has also been an Appleby client.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2014, a Senate committee accused Renaissance and another hedge fund of using a complex accounting maneuver to improperly avoid taxes.Renaissance is still fighting the resulting tax bill, estimated at $6.8 billion.As the tax dispute has proceeded, Mr. Simons is now estimated to be the 25th-richest person in the United States, with a net worth estimated at $18.5 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest Americans.But such rankings, important yardsticks in the study of global development and inequality, often rely on incomplete public data.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Simonss Lord Jim Trust offers one example.Though the trust has been listed in various filings, a 2010 document in Applebys files provides details for the first time.If it had been fully accounted for in calculating his net worth, he would have vaulted even higher in the ranks of the superrich.Yet factoring the trust into his wealth isnt so straightforward, because Mr. Simons says his share is now in an offshore charity, Simons Foundation International.In 2010, he and his wife, Marilyn, signed the giving pledge established by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, vowing to give the great majority of their wealth to philanthropic purposes.A person familiar with Simons Foundation International, who was not authorized to speak on the record about it, said it had $8 billion in assets.That is more than double the approximately $3 billion in Mr. Simonss New York-based Simons Foundation, whose mission of funding scientific research and education is shared by the Bermuda foundation.So far it has not been very active, Mr. Simons wrote in a response to questions from The Times.In future years, as my income decreases and ultimately ceases, SFI will play an increasingly larger role in funding.But the Simons Foundation International operates in obscurity.Though it would easily rank in the top 10 foundations in the United States, it has no website.Mr. Simons said that keeping the foundation in Bermuda made it easier to give to charities that werent American and also avoided the minimal annual giving requirements that foundations must follow in the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ray D. Madoff, a professor of law at Boston College who focuses on philanthropies and taxes, said that in terms of oversight and transparency, the first sin was whatever it was that allowed however many billions of dollars of a U.S. citizen to be growing tax free in Bermuda.But Michael G. Pfeifer, a Washington lawyer who specializes in estate planning for wealthy people and helped write the tax rules governing overseas trusts, said that Mr. Simons merely followed the rules.I would have told the guy, Youve got this money offshore just leave it offshore, Mr. Pfeifer said.And he did.Photo Fines and Restitutions If Mr. Simonss motive for setting up offshore entities is complex, Mr. Stephenss seems more obvious.In late 2011, representatives of Mr. Stephens and his business partner, James R. Carnes, asked Appleby to incorporate two offshore companies as part of a plan to help Native American tribes set up lending operations, a common business tactic because such ventures can claim tribal immunity against outside legal challenges.The new ventures parent company, Hayfield Investment Partners, was incorporated in Delaware considered a tax haven like a half-dozen other American states, underscoring that secrecy and tax advantages are not limited to palm-dotted tropical islands.Hayfield already had a separate subsidiary called Integrity Advance, an online payday loan company whose lending practices were coming into the cross hairs of regulators across the United States.Documents in Applebys files show that Mr. Stephens and his funds owned 40 percent of Hayfield, which received additional investments from executives of Stephens Inc., the family investment bank, and acquaintances like the golf star Phil Mickelson, who contributed $12,000.It did not take long for Integrity Advance to generate complaints from borrowers and regulators.People short of cash who took out small loans would later see large withdrawals from their bank accounts for interest and services fees that often far exceeded the amount they originally borrowed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By November 2012, Integrity Advance had received cease-and-desist letters from state regulators in Connecticut, Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi and South Carolina.In May 2013, a Minnesota district court ordered the company to pay nearly $8 million in civil penalties and victim restitution, saying that the firm had targeted financially vulnerable citizens with interest rates as high as 1,369 percent.One borrower, Nils Paul Warren, a broadcast audio technician for Nascar in Orlando, complained to Florida regulators that hed had to shell out more than $1,300 to repay a short-term $500 online loan he got from Integrity Advance in 2009 a sum far greater than what he had expected.I think the bulk of their clientele are people who are a paycheck away from being homeless, Mr. Warren said in an interview.As complaints mounted, Mr. Stephens and Mr. Carnes sold part of Integrity Advance to a pawnshop-style loan company, Ezcorp.Eventually the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Integrity Advance of false and deceptive tactics, and last year, an administrative law judge recommended to the head of the bureau that the company and Mr. Carnes, its chief executive, pay more than $51 million in fines and restitution to borrowers.Integrity Advance and Mr. Carnes are appealing the ruling.In its legal action against Integrity Advance, the bureau emphasized Mr. Carness 52 percent ownership of Hayfield, the parent company.Neither regulators nor the news media has ever mentioned Mr. Stephenss sizable stake.(Mr. Stephens declined to comment.)If he kept quiet about his role in the embattled payday loan business, he showed no similar reticence in attacking the consumer bureau.In June 2013, he told The Wall Street Journal that the bureau bore some blame for lagging business growth.The stories we hear about that are pretty scary, the billionaire said.During last years campaign, Mr. Stephens contributed $3 million to Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that has pushed Congress to strip the bureaus enforcement powers.Along with helping bankroll such Washington battles, Mr. Stephens has recently used his investment bank, Stephens Inc., to start an online video series called This Is Capitalism to improve millennials opinion of free-market economics.In his introduction, Mr. Stephens wrote that he hoped the series would counter the notion that the free market is a system that enriches a few at the expense of the many.
How Qualcomm Became Vulnerable to a Takeover Bid:::::They also explain why Qualcomm, once so powerful and profitable, has become vulnerable so quickly and why Broadcom, another big chip maker, is pouncing with a $105 billion takeover bid.Changing Smartphones Several forces are working against Qualcomm, including the rise of China as both the dominant smartphone manufacturer and a huge consumer market, and the growing clout of the Apple and Samsung brands.But perhaps as much as anything, the smartphone inventions that attract consumers today are not provided by Qualcomm.In earlier generations of products, faster wireless connections sold new phones.Today, people walk into stores looking for an Apple iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, and ask about features like the size of the screen, the camera, and its memory and storage capacity.All these technologies have little or nothing to do with Qualcomm, said Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet.The landscape, the environment has changed.These technologies have enriched the smartphone experience and driven up the price, especially for top-of-the-line iPhones and Galaxy models.But what has generally not changed is Qualcomms licensing formula typically charging fees of about 5 percent of the wholesale price of a phone, analysts say, even though its technology accounts for less of the value of many smartphone models.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That position has increasingly irritated big customers like Apple and Samsung and contract manufacturers like Foxconn, which is Apples major supplier.(The contract manufacturers are usually the ones that directly pay fees to Qualcomm, and receive pass-through payments from Apple and others.)Antitrust Concerns The other Qualcomm practice that has prompted scrutiny from various antitrust investigators is charging smartphone makers license fees whether or not they use Qualcomm chips, because of the strength of its patents.Qualcomm contends that its licensing practices are fair, simple and efficient allowing new entrants, especially start-ups in Asia, to enter the smartphone market.But after an antitrust investigation in China, Qualcomm paid a fine of $975 million in 2015.As part of the settlement, Qualcomm agreed to license some of its patents to Chinese handset makers at lower rates.Analysts estimate that Qualcomms overall royalty rates in China were cut by as much as half, to about 2.5 percent.The settlement allowed Qualcomm to keep operating in the vast Chinese market and smoothed relations with government officials there.This week, Mr. Mollenkopf is traveling with President Trump in China.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In other antitrust cases, Qualcomm paid South Korea $853 million in December and Taiwan $773 million last month.In the United States, an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission is underway.Shortly after the commissions move in January, Apple sued Qualcomm, claiming unfair patent-licensing practices.Battle With Apple Apple declined to comment on its chip plans or how a Broadcom acquisition might affect its patent suit against Qualcomm.Analysts say Apple has already been exploring whether to work with other chip makers, or design its own chips.Already, though, Apple is not making pass-through payments to its contract manufacturers for Qualcomm royalty payments.In turn, those payments an estimated $2.5 billion a year are not made to Qualcomm.Qualcomm has said another major company, which it has not named, has stopped paying license fees of $1 billion a year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the fiscal year ended in September, the company reported net income of $2.5 billion, less than half of the $5.7 billion in the previous year.Things went off the cliff pretty quickly, mainly because of Apple, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research.Mollenkopfs Bets Mr. Mollenkopf, 48, has worked at Qualcomm for more than two decades, starting as a bench engineer.He is the first chief executive of Qualcomm who was not part of the founding family.Irwin Jacobs co-founded Qualcomm in 1985 and headed the company until 2005, when his son Paul became chief executive.Paul Jacobs is executive chairman today.Mr. Mollenkopf was elevated to the top job in 2014, after his name surfaced as a candidate to succeed Steven Ballmer as chief executive of Microsoft.Analysts say he has been a champion of Qualcomms efforts to build a third large business alongside patent licensing and chips.He really understands that Qualcomms future depends on its ability to diversify beyond its core smartphone heartland, said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, a technology research firm.Past efforts faltered.For example, Qualcomm invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a unit called MediaFlo, which tried to develop a content delivery service for smartphones.It folded that business, but did sell much of the units assets and technology to AT&T for $1.9 billion in 2010.Qualcomms big bet for the future is 5G technology.The next generation of wireless communications technology holds the potential to connect billions of devices to the internet, from cars to sensor-filled clothes.A pending $39 billion purchase of NXP, whose specialized chips with beefed-up security are used in some cars and mobile payment systems, would be a big step toward that hoped-for third leg.The deal has been slowed by regulatory reviews.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a conference call with analysts last week, Mr. Mollenkopf pointed to the 5G future, declaring that Qualcomm was leading the industry.The 5G story is likely to play a prominent role in Qualcomms effort to stay independent or at least drive up the price Broadcom eventually pays.Its strongest hand is the promise of 5G and that its leadership position will lead to an explosion of demand for its technology, said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who has written case studies on Qualcomm.Still, 5G devices are not expected to reach the market in volume until 2019 and the patience of Qualcomms shareholders is uncertain.
Thomas Barracks Colony Capital Ends Bid for Weinstein Studio:::::Photo LOS ANGELES A potential buyer walked away from the Weinstein Company on Tuesday, nudging the struggling studio closer to the brink.After disagreeing on price, Colony Capital, the private equity firm run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., ended talks with the boutique studio to buy some or all of its assets, according to two people briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was private.The Weinstein Company entered into exclusive talks with Colony on Oct. 16 as it rushed to contain the fallout from allegations of sexual harassment and assault against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein.We believe the company has substantial value and growth potential, Mr. Barrack said in a statement at the time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Colony found more disorder than it had expected and less value once it started closely examining the studio.By Oct. 26, a preliminary agreement for Colony to give the Weinstein Company an immediate cash infusion had fallen apart, even as Colony continued to evaluate the possible purchase of some or all of the studio.
Disney Ends Ban on Los Angeles Times Amid Fierce Backlash:::::Critics organizations also came out against Disney.On Tuesday, members of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics denounced Disneys blackout of The Los Angeles Times.Each group voted to disqualify Disneys movies from year-end award consideration unless the blackout was publicly rescinded.The Los Angeles Times had made Disneys blackout public in a note to readers last week that explained why no feature articles about Disney movies appeared in its 2017 holiday movie preview section.Disney also did not give The Times early access to Thor: Ragnarok so that it could prepare a review in time for the movies Friday opening.Disney has a history of taking punitive action against news organizations and analysts when they publish articles or analysis that it deems unfair.Company representatives consistently tell journalists that the medias access to its films and executives is a privilege and not a right.In explaining this particular blackout, Disney cited a Los Angeles Times investigation that was published in September about the companys business ties to Anaheim, Calif., where its popular Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks are.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The two-part investigative series detailed the subsidies, incentives, rebates and protections from future taxes that Disney had secured from the city, as well as the companys impact on local elections.We regularly work with news organizations around the world that we dont always agree with, but in this instance the L.A. Times showed a complete disregard for basic journalistic standards, Disney said in a statement last week.The Los Angeles Times responded at the time by saying that Disney had not asked for any corrections.Since then, it has not covered the outcry from critics and news organizations that followed the blackout.Disneys decision to block Los Angeles Times journalists from advance screenings inadvertently drew national attention to the articles on the companys dealings with Anaheim.It also stirred outrage and scrutiny.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As long as Disney is blocking the critics from the Los Angeles Times from press screenings, I cant in good conscience attend similar showings or write reviews in advance, Alyssa Rosenberg, who covers culture for The Washington Post, wrote on Monday.The New York Times also joined the boycott on Tuesday, before Disney lifted the ban, saying in a statement that it would not attend preview screenings for Disney movies until access is restored to the Los Angeles Times.A powerful company punishing a news organization for a story they do not like is meant to have a chilling effect, The Times said.This is a dangerous precedent and not at all in the public interest.

Sky Threatens to Shut News Channel for 21st Century Fox Deal:::::Photo LONDON The British satellite broadcaster Sky warned on Tuesday that it may shut down its 24-hour news channel if the property becomes an obstacle to the companys effort to sell itself to Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox.In a regulatory filing with the Competition Markets Authority in Britain, Sky wrote that the regulator should not simply assume the continued provision of Sky News if ownership of the channel posed a problem for the $15 billion transaction.The threat is an aggressive move by Sky to win approval of the transaction, which has been under review by the British government for nearly a year.In September, Britains culture minister, Karen Bradley, said that she intended to refer the proposed deal to the competition regulator.Questions over the fate of the deal, in which 21st Century Fox would buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, have haunted it from the beginning.Mr. Murdoch is a divisive figure in Britain, and critics have questioned whether owning Sky would give his company too much power over British media, with stakes in television, newspaper and online outlets.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The bid by 21st Century Fox, a multinational media company based in New York, is rooted in the companys effort to expand its global reach.Mr. Murdoch essentially created Sky in 1989, and the news channel was started the same year.Analysts have long believed that the media mogul would seek to take full control of the company.
Wind and Solar Power Advance, but Carbon Refuses to Retreat:::::This statistic, alone, puts a big question mark over the strategies deployed around the world to replace fossil energy.In a nutshell: Perhaps renewables are not the answer.Over the past 10 years, governments and private investors have collectively spent $2 trillion on infrastructure to draw electricity from the wind and the sun, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Environmental Progress, a nonprofit that advocates nuclear power as an essential tool in the battle against climate change, says that exceeds the total cost of all nuclear plants built to date or under construction, adjusted for inflation.Capacity from renewable sources has grown by leaps and bounds, outpacing growth from all other sources including coal, natural gas and nuclear power in recent years.Solar and wind capacity installed in 2015 was more than 10 times what the International Energy Agency had forecast a decade before.Still, except for very limited exceptions, all this wind and sun has not brought about much decarbonization.Indeed, it has not added much clean power to the grid.Whose Power Is Cleanest?The portion of electricity that countries generate from clean sources runs the gamut from none to almost all.Share of all electricity generated from clean sources HYDRO + NUCLEAR TOTAL WIND + SOLAR Norway 97 % Sweden 91 France 89 Switzerland 86 Canada 79 Brazil 74 Slovakia 72 Austria 68 New Zealand 65 Finland 62 Belgium 60 Colombia 60 Romania 58 Ecuador 58 Spain 57 Ukraine 55 Hungary 55 Venezuela 53 Bulgaria 50 Peru 49 Portugal 48 Denmark 45 Lithuania 38 Britain 37 Pakistan 36 Biggest carbon emitters in bold.Russia 35 Vietnam 35 Czech Rep. 34 Germany 34 Argentina 32 United States 32 Chile 31 South Korea 31 Turkey 31 Italy 31 China 27 Greece 27 Ireland 22 Uzbekistan 20 Mexico 16 India 16 Japan 15 Australia 15 Philippines 12 Malaysia 12 Netherlands 12 Kazakhstan 10 South Africa 10 Poland 9 Egypt 9 Azerbaijan 8 Iran 7 Indonesia 6 Thailand 4 Israel 2 Bangladesh 2 Belarus 1 Algeria 0 U.A.E.0 Trinidad & Tobago 0 Kuwait 0 Saudi Arabia 0 Turkmenistan 0 Qatar 0 Environmental Progress performed an analysis of the evolution of the carbon intensity of energy in 68 countries since 1965.It found no correlation between the additions of solar and wind power and the carbon intensity of energy: Despite additions of renewable capacity, carbon intensity remained flat.Some countries have bucked the trend.Denmark has sharply cut its carbon intensity with vast installations of wind turbines.And yet Germanys experience seems to be more typical.The country went all out in deploying wind and solar energy over the past 10 years, but the decline in carbon intensity was minuscule, from 212 to 203 grams of CO 2 per kilowatt-hour.The renewables-or-bust crowd on the periphery of the meeting in Bonn might argue that the sun and wind owe their poor track record at decarbonization in countries like Germany to the fact that nuclear power was being phased out at the same time that they came online.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is true that Germans would have made more progress in the battle against climate change had they kept their nuclear reactors running and shut plants burning lignite instead.Still, there are other reasons behind renewables poor track record in decarbonizing electricity.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Nuclear power faces hurdles beyond popular mistrust.Notably, reactors require a lot of capital up front.But renewables have a hard time producing power at a nuclear scale.For instance, the Diablo Canyon reactor that California plans to close produces 14 times as much power as the Topaz solar farm, which requires 500 times as much land, according to Environmental Progress.The Wind Catcher farm in Oklahoma occupies 2,400 times as much land as Diablo Canyon but produces half as much energy.The most worrisome aspect about the all-out push for a future powered by renewables has to do with cost: The price of turbines and solar panels may be falling, but the cost of integrating these intermittent sources of energy on when the wind blows and the sun shines; off when they dont is not.This alone will sharply curtail the climate benefits of renewable power.Integrating renewable sources requires vast investments in electricity transmission to move power from intermittently windy and sunny places to places where power is consumed.It requires maintaining a backstop of idle plants that burn fossil fuel, for the times when there is no wind or sun to be had.It requires investing in power-storage systems at a large scale.These costs will ultimately be reflected in power prices.One concern is that by raising the retail cost of electricity they will discourage electrification, encouraging consumers to rely on alternative energy sources like gas and pushing CO 2 emissions up.Another concern is that they will drive wholesale energy prices down too far.Because they produce the most energy when the sun is up and the wind is blowing, renewable generators can flood the grid at critical times of the day, slashing the price of power.This not only threatens the solvency of nuclear reactors, which cannot shut down on a dime and must therefore pay for the grid to accept their power, but also reduces the return on additional investment in renewables.A study by Lion Hirth from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research found that the value of wind power falls from 110 percent of the average power price to 50 to 80 percent as the penetration of wind rises from zero to 30 percent of total consumption.Competitive large-scale renewables deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate, he concluded.The diplomats in Bonn may be tempted to wave away these concerns.Thomas Bruckner of the University of Leipzig, one of the lead authors of the latest report on energy systems by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, argues that in the case of Germany, expanding renewables to supply 80 percent of power by 2050 is not a significant burden.Heavy German investment in renewable energy technologies over the last decade succeeded in bringing prices down, he contends; it will be much cheaper to go the rest of the way.Perhaps.But there is some evidence that among investors, at least, the excitement may be waning.After half a decade of sustained increases, investment in solar and wind energy has been fairly flat since 2010, at around $250 billion per year.While that is a lot of money, it is nowhere near enough.We will need twice as much investment over a sustained period of time to get anywhere close to achieving 2 degrees, said Ethan Zindler, head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance in the Americas, referring to the objective of the worlds climate diplomats: keep the average world temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above its average in the late 19th century.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I would suggest that the challenge is not just to raise more money.Building a zero-carbon energy system requires broader thinking about the technological mix.
Waymos Autonomous Cars Cut Out Human Drivers in Road Tests:::::Waymo said its driverless cars hit the public roads last month.The company did not say whether it was testing the driverless cars in environments considered challenging for autonomous vehicles, like bridges or tunnels, or more difficult conditions, like driving at night or in rain and snow usually not a big concern in the dry Phoenix climate.While the prospect of cars without emergency drivers may raise concerns among some passengers, Waymo said it had confidence in the safety of its self-driving technology.It has included backup systems like a secondary computer to take over if the main computer fails.And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now.Waymo employees sit in the back seat of the cars, monitoring them, a company spokesman, Johnny Luu, said.Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car.If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own.Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws.Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the drivers seat.On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.In December, Waymo published a report for Californias Department of Motor Vehicles about how frequently its car disengaged deactivating its autonomous mode because of a system failure or safety risk and forcing a human driver to take over.In the report, Waymo said this happened once every 5,000 miles the cars drove in 2016, compared with once every 1,250 miles in 2015.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet, said that data demonstrated that the cars are not ready to drive without any human intervention and that Waymo was following the Silicon Valley model of beta testing a new technology on the public.Its the wrong approach when youre dealing with self-driving cars, said John M. Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog.When things go wrong with a robot car, you kill people.Researchers believe self-driving cars can be safer than cars operated by human drivers because they are programmed to adhere strictly to traffic laws, they dont get distracted, and they usually refrain from taking unnecessary risks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Timothy Tait, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Transportation, said the state was on pace to exceed 1,000 automobile-related fatalities this year and that its top priority is the publics safety particularly by advancing efforts to reduce crashes and deaths on its roads.We are closely monitoring emerging technologies like self-driving cars that may ultimately support safer travel and open up opportunities for populations who today are unable to drive for themselves, he said in a statement.Waymo, which started as a research and development project for Google in 2009, maintains what many in the industry consider a technological advantage over its competitors.Waymo said its autonomous vehicles had driven more than 3.4 million miles on actual roads with safety drivers as well as running 10 million miles every day in a virtual simulator.In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first commercial application of the companys driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation.Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google.Because youre accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make, he said.They can be designed for specific purposes or tasks.
Building a Buzzy Hive of Invention and Collaboration:::::Bruce J. Katz, a scholar with the Brookings Institution, was a co-author of a 2014 report on innovation districts, which he said were recognized at that time as a shift in the geography of innovation but still largely undefined.Three years later, Mr. Katz said he was hard-pressed to come up with a city thats not thinking about how either the hubs around the universities or these very distinctive parts of the city, usually around waterfronts, where theres legacy from older industrial space can be converted to other purposes.In his experience, the biggest hurdle for these districts is getting a network of public, private, civic, academic and entrepreneurial interests to act in unison.In general, he added, this is not about the government.A lot of it is bottom up, and networked, he said.Officials in Chattanooga, Tenn., leveraged an ultra-high-speed broadband network installed by the city-owned utility in 2009 to start a downtown innovation district.Expansion is likely to require strengthening the districts partnerships with the University of Tennessee and the public school system, said Mayor Andy Berke, who noted that the United States Department of Energys Oak Ridge National Laboratory opened an office in the district last year.Photo It doesnt feel like its going to run out of steam anytime soon, Mr. Berke said.But, he added, we have to pay attention to it so it doesnt wither.The Providence district, which is designated by the city as a 125-acre riverfront swath, was largely born of the realignment of Interstate 195 out of the city core, freeing for development about 20 acres that intersect with the former jewelry manufacturing hub.As part of an effort to jump-start a state economy that lagged the rest of the region in its recovery from the recession, the administration of Gov.Gina Raimondo is using significant subsidies and tax credits to help spur innovation-oriented redevelopment.This neighborhood was once a fount of innovation costume jewelry products were pioneered here, said Stefan Pryor, the state's secretary of commerce.We are reawakening that innovative spirit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To make the area feel less isolated, the state is creating a five-acre waterfront park that will link to an existing river walk through the heart of downtown, which is undergoing a residential building boom.And a pedestrian bridge being built on pylons left from I-195 will connect the district to College Hill.Photo Wexford Science & Technology, a Baltimore company that specializes in developing what it calls knowledge communities around major research universities, has become a major investor in the district.Wexford teamed up with CV Properties on the $220 million power station redevelopment, which includes student housing and a parking garage.(Ventas, a real estate investment trust and Wexfords capital partner, has since bought the power station.)And in September, Wexford broke ground on a 191,000-square-foot innovation center.The center will be anchored by Browns School of Professional Studies; the Cambridge Innovation Center, a Boston-area company that leases space to start-ups; and a Johnson & Johnson health technology operation.Wexford secured about $41 million in state subsidies and tax credits for the $89 million project.The state also contributed the land, with the $4.5 million value to be returned over time, said Thomas Osha, Wexfords senior vice president of innovation and economic development.He said the subsidies would enable Wexford to provide some innovation and collaboration space at affordable rates.The challenge is how to ensure youve got a good mix of space at a variety of price points, he said.With Ventas, Wexford is involved with 12 innovation districts around the country.However, Mr. Osha said, at any one time, I am in advanced conversations with another half-dozen cities, and initial conversations with another six to 10.Photo It can be three-plus years from initial conversations to shovel in the ground, he added.Mr. Osha described Providences strengths as its proximity to New York and Boston and its very active, collaboratively focused universities, which also include the Rhode Island School of Design and Johnson & Wales University.For example, the design school and the University of Rhode Island are working with the states Lifespan health system and Ximedica, a contract medical design company, to start a New England Medical Innovation Center in the district.Peter J. Snyder, a senior vice president and the chief research officer at Lifespan, said the center would assemble teams of engineering, design and medical professionals to develop solutions for medical needs, perhaps spawning new companies in the process.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lifespans Rhode Island Hospital, an academic medical center, is within a stones throw of one of the best design schools in the country, said Mr. Snyder, who is also a scholar in residence at the Rhode Island School of Design.We can bring them in, along with U.R.I.s school of engineering, and run many teams with a deep bench of talent across many specialties.Mr. Katz said he thought most innovation districts were far from reaching their potential for employment and business growth.There is an intense focus at universities on, how do we get better at commercialization?he said.These are still early days, which I think is remarkable.
Sina Doubles Down to Ward Off Activists After Proxy Fight:::::On Tuesday, however, the company took steps to ensure it would not have to face an activist campaign again.It issued a new class of shares with super voting rights that have been transferred to a holding company controlled by Mr. Chao.The changes will give him a 55.5 percent voting stake in Sina and could prevent future attempts to introduce new board members or force votes on business strategy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sina said in a news release that it had to divert significant amount of time, attention and efforts from the companys normal business operations and strategic planning because of the proxy fight with Aristeia.The company believes any future proxy contest could be costly, time consuming and disruptive, it added, and argued it was taking the steps to protect itself from potentially disruptive and value destructive situations in the future.It also said that it would be establishing a nominating and corporate governance committee within the board to find more independent directors.Representatives for Aristeia and Sina declined to comment.Shares in the Chinese company fell about 10 percent on Tuesday.Bare-knuckle activist campaigns have been relatively rare in Asia where, in recent years, Daniel S. Loeb has taken on the owner of 7-Eleven, while Paul Singers Elliott Management has picked fights with Samsung Electronics and the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong.Still, Sina would have appeared to have been an unlikely target for such a challenge.The company had seen its stock price increase markedly over the past year as investors bet on the growth of Chinas internet sector.But Aristeia argued that Sina was failing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards and called for the company to consider a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo, which is separately listed, or a buyback of shares by management.
Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions:::::The Times analysis looks at the direct effect of the tax changes on Americans incomes and does not account for changes in economic growth that Republicans say will amplify the impact of the tax cut and deliver higher wages to Americans across the income spectrum.Economic models disagree about the size of those effects, but generally agree they would be smaller in the initial years after a bill was passed since the tax cuts would take a while to filter throughout the economy.Still, Republican leaders in Congress and the White House havent just argued that the bill would have broader economic advantages.Rather, they have repeatedly described it as a tax cut for middle-class families.This whole tax reform is designed for the middle-class family thats working so hard, for that Main Street business thats working so hard, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on MSNBC on Thursday.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, went further, telling the MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt over the weekend that nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase under the bill.Few independent economists find evidence to support that claim.Analyses published since the plan was introduced last week have consistently found that some middle-class families would see their taxes go up immediately, compared with existing law.One such analysis, from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 8 percent of middle-income earners would pay more in 2018 and 21 percent in 2027 with upper-middle-class taxpayers more likely to see their taxes rise.The Times analysis accounts for the differing financial situations of Americans who look relatively similar on paper.It shows significant differences in how typical families might fare under the Republican bill.Consider, for example, a four-person family earning about $75,000 a year.There are nearly 150,000 such taxpayers in the United States, according to data from the Census Bureau.About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average.But the other thirds taxes would go up, by nearly $700 on average, and some would pay thousands of dollars more than under current law.The Benefit for the Middle Class Under the Republican tax proposal, 68 percent of taxpayers who earned between about $50,000 and $160,000 in a family of three would get a tax cut, but 29 percent would see their taxes rise.In about a decade, the number who got a tax cut would decrease to 53 percent.7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in

devised to allow millions of Americans to simplify their tax returns to file, as Republican leaders put it, on a postcard.The plan would most likely simplify taxes for some taxpayers, who would choose to take advantage of the plans more generous standard deduction.But the analysis suggests that among lower- and middle-class families, the greatest benefits of the bill flow to those taxpayers who already file simple returns and do not itemize their taxes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The millions losing out under the bill would largely be families with more complicated finances, who now generally itemize their deductions.The bill would eliminate many common and valuable tax deductions that, in some cases, would eliminate thousands of dollars in tax benefits.This would be particularly acute for taxpayers who deducted state and local income and property tax payments, interest on student loans, or the cost of health insurance for self-employed workers.The plan could be particularly costly for Americans facing large medical bills.Nearly nine million taxpayers collectively deducted about $84 billion in medical expenses from their taxes in 2015.The House bill would eliminate that deduction.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mark Mazur, the director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said any attempt to reform the tax system as opposed to just a broad-based tax cut would have winners and losers.But he noted that many of the provisions that would benefit middle-class taxpayers in the House bill were set to expire or lose value over time.You could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people, Mr. Mazur said.Thats not what this is.The Timess figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.The organizations model does not yet fully account for the tax bills treatment of so-called pass-through income, which is business income that is taxed at the individual rate under current law.And because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans household finances.The source of the tax increases is rooted in the structure of the Republican bill.The plan would roughly double the size of the standard deduction, to $24,000 for married couples and $12,200 for individuals.That could yield a substantial tax cut for many middle- and lower-income families that now take the standard deduction, or whose itemized deductions amount to less than those thresholds.But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.Its elimination of the deduction for medical expenses could hit some families particularly hard because medical bills can be so large, unpredictable and unavoidable.Of the roughly 6.5 million middle-class families whose taxes would rise in 2018 under the bill, about 800,000 took advantage of the medical expense provision, deducting more than $17,000 on average from their taxes.Nearly 200,000 middle-class families owed no income tax under the current law at least in part because the medical-expense exemption offset their taxable income.The Republican proposal would also be costly for many large families.Thats because, in addition to raising the standard deduction, the plan would eliminate the so-called personal exemption, which lets most taxpayers deduct about $4,000 for every person in their household.The plan would replace the exemption with an expanded child tax credit, but that would fill only part of the gap for many families.Fewer than 40 percent of middle-class families with at least three children would receive a tax cut under the plan, compared with nearly 80 percent of families without children.Negotiations over the House bill are continuing, and details could change.In the Senate, Republicans such as Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have pushed to expand the child tax credit further, a move that could mitigate many of the tax increases on middle-class families, but that would force leaders to find other sources of revenue to offset the change.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats, meanwhile, have been quick to seize on analyses finding middle-class tax increases.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon last week called the bill a middle-class con job.
Chinas Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order:::::Cybersecurity laws enacted this summer give the Ministry of State Security the power to conduct security reviews of technology sold or used in China, said James A. Lewis, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Such a step could require companies to expose some of their most valuable secrets.At some companies, Chinese security officials conduct the inspections in corporate clean rooms in the United States, with the Chinese officials traveling on business visas, Mr. Lewis said.The companies argue that the access takes place under controlled circumstances that limit what Chinese officials might learn.If American companies have a big market in China, they say to the Ministry of State Security, Come in, Mr. Lewis said.Everyone fears retaliation.No one wants to lose the China market.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Old Rules, New Products Wary of the push, the United States has used existing rules to stop Chinese purchases of foreign businesses in areas important to national security.But many of those tools do not apply to todays deals, as A.M.D.s Chinese pact shows.A.M.D.s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.The park represents Beijings vision of the future.Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes.Offices of Chinas most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D.works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.Photo Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D.agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers.Because A.M.D.controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But A.M.D.struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls.That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers.The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers.China already makes the worlds fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers.With A.M.D.s help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make Chinas supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.We have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export, an A.M.D.spokesman said in an emailed statement.He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D.sells in America.Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.s control was not involved in chip development.Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center

New Era?For some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Called Unrestricted Warfare, the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily.Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.Some American officials see in it a guide to Chinas plan.Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis.They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures.The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.Theres concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages, said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.Such changes could ripple through the tech world.Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached.Some tech companies say that is good for innovation.Chinas spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them.The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules.But the W.T.O.has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public.Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firms business.The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.Made in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China, said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.If Made in China 2025 achieves its goals, he said, the U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.
NPR C.E.O. Jarl Mohn Apologizes to Staff, Goes on Leave:::::Since the article appeared in The Post, other information has surfaced concerning Mr. Oreskes, including that a current NPR employee, Rebecca Hersher, complained to NPR in October 2015 about his behavior, just months after his arrival.Two women had complained to NPR in the fall of 2016 and last month about Mr. Oreskes conduct when he was working at The New York Times, where he held various jobs for more than two decades.Mr. Mohns leave of absence is perhaps an unsatisfying coda to an embarrassing episode for NPR.Long viewed as a bastion of liberalism, the organization was accused of sweeping sexual harassment allegations under the rug.Mr. Mohn initially insisted that the news reports had not prompted him to ask for Mr. Oreskes resignation.In a memo to his staff last Wednesday announcing Mr. Oreskess departure, Mr. Mohn said NPR was already acting on accusations against Mr. Oreskes before The Posts article was published.Some have asked me if it took published news reports for us to take action, Mr. Mohn said in the memo.The answer is that it did not.He reiterated that position later that afternoon during an interview on NPRs All Things Considered.What had led him to put Mr. Oreskes on leave and then ask for his resignation, Mr. Mohn said, was a new case involving Mr. Oreskess interactions with a current employee that was reported to NPR after the news articles were published.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Inside NPRs newsroom, employees were skeptical, if not outraged.Some questioned Mr. Mohns statements about his handling of the matter.On the Friday edition of the program 1A, Mary Louise Kelly, an NPR correspondent, said it had been a brutal week in the NPR newsroom.During an all-staff meeting on Friday, Mr. Mohn said he had not taken warnings about Mr. Oreskes seriously enough, according to an NPR report.He had let people down, he said, and should have acted faster and more decisively.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his note on Tuesday, Mr. Mohn said he had tried hard to be as transparent as possible about our handling of complaints that were raised against Mike Oreskes.In the same note, he revealed that there had been a previously undisclosed complaint of sexual harassment against Mr. Oreskes, but that he had not discussed it because it had not been publicly reported.In addition, Mr. Mohn said, there had been other signs of Mikes bad judgment, including invalid expenses.NPR investigated those concerns, Mr. Mohn added, and Mr. Oreskes had recently reimbursed the organization for roughly $1,800.NPRs board, Mr. Mohn said, was working to bring on a law firm to review its handling of the allegations against Mr. Oreskes.Loren Mayor, NPRs chief operating officer, will manage the organizations day-to-day operations in Mr. Mohns absence.Ms. Mayor joined NPR in 2012 after a five-year stint at PBS.Though he was not accused of misconduct accusations himself, Mr. Mohn became part of the wave of powerful men in the media and entertainment industries who have been swept up in sexual harassment allegations.Since the publication of articles last month on the many accusations of sexual harassment and assault against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein, numerous men have been forced out of leadership positions and acknowledged inappropriate behavior.Mr. Mohn said his leave would last a minimum of four weeks.

For Bill Ackman, a Stinging Defeat on ADP:::::Photo Credibility is everything to an activist.That makes the defeat at ADP on Tuesday especially embarrassing for William A. Ackman.Fewer than one shareholder in four backed the Pershing Square bosss bid for three seats on the board of the payroll processor.The result capped a bitter three-month battle between the hedge-fund manager and ADP.Mr. Ackman argued that the Roseland, N.J.-based company was losing ground to upstart rivals and needed to respond by changing management incentives and putting more emphasis on software development.He secured the backing of the major proxy advisers: Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones called on holders to vote for his three nominees, while Institutional Shareholder Services supported a single seat for Mr. Ackman.But ADP wasnt an obvious target.Its stock had more than doubled over the preceding five years, handily outperforming the S.&P.500 and Pershing Squares own Amsterdam-listed shares.The company has been working on its digital strategy at a pace that doesnt scare off existing customers.The ADP chief executive, Carlos Rodriguez, didnt shrink from the fight, either.He vigorously defended the companys performance and strategy, and he lambasted Mr. Ackman as a spoiled brat.Mr. Rodriguez was anything but magnanimous in victory on Tuesday, using coarse language to describe the defeat of his nemesis.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shareholders seem ready to give Mr. Rodriguez time to execute ADPs technological shift.Although the stock has given up half the 12 percent bump it received when news of Pershing Squares stake first broke back in July, it was trading nearly 1 percent higher after the meeting.Mr. Ackman is unlikely to get such a respite.His listed vehicle was down 3.3 percent net of fees in the first 10 months of this year, while Hedge Fund Researchs Activist Index gained 5.7 percent in the first three quarters.Hes now on a three-year losing streak.Failed bets on the drugmaker Valeant and against Herbalife, a nutritional-supplement maker Mr. Ackman said was a Ponzi scheme, contributed to the funds negative returns of 13.5 percent last year and 20.5 percent in 2015.Chipotle Mexican Grill, another key holding, is down 42 percent so far this year.

Another Arnault Steps Into the Spotlight:::::Photo I have always liked drinking Champagne, said Stephanie Watine Arnault, the niece of Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury conglomerate, and reportedly Frances richest man and the latest family member to step into the spotlight.I got a taste for it when I was very young and growing up in France, Ms. Watine Arnault, said, tucking back a strand of her long blond hair.My grandmother used to let me have sips at the dinner table.And that was that.Now she has convinced her uncle to help her share her taste with others.On Nov. 2, Clos19, LVMHs first e-boutique and travel experience agency dedicated to Champagne, wines and spirits, had its debut in the United States, via a fizz-fueled soiree in New York.The focus of Ms. Watine Arnaults brainchild, she said after the party, is on the art of hosting in the 21st century.So what, one wonders, does that entail?Clos19 isnt exactly an online bottle shop.Yes, you can order crates of LVMHs finest drinks brands, like Dom Perignon, Veuve Cliquot, Belvedere or Hennessy, to be delivered to your door in 24 hours.But you can also specify the temperature of the deliveries, and the glassware to go with it.Tastings or consultations with in-house experts will be regularly offered, as is event planning for weddings and dinner parties.
How the Tax Bill Affects Students and Families Paying for College:::::The tax legislation that House Republicans proposed last week includes several changes that could affect student loans: the ability to deduct the interest on your loan would be eliminated; tuition paid by an employer would become taxable; and three existing tax breaks would be consolidated into one.Its hard to immediately tell how any one person would fare because of the wholesale change across the entire tax system.For example, while some part-time students would lose a popular tax break because they dont take enough classes to qualify, other individuals may see their tax burden fall because of a significant increase in the standard deduction.There are other changes as well, and the impact will vary depending on your situation.These two scenarios calculated by Jackson Hewitt, the tax service illustrate how much taxpayers would owe under the current system, and how their tax bill might change if the Republican plan becomes law.
Theyre Rich but Trying to Reach Beyond the Money Bubble:::::She began working to help neighborhoods that were struggling; some of those efforts succeeded, some did not.Last year, she and her husband joined a group of affluent residents to give money and time to Thomasville Heights, a very poor area of about 4,000 people., Ansley Park is a privileged bubble within the town, she said.The first time we visited Thomasville Heights and found out about the desperation people felt, we met there in a rec center.After our meeting we found out we had been on lockdown.There was a shooter outside.I felt very unsettled, which was the entire point.It was just a few miles away.Photo A Growing Gap Economic inequality is a well-known issue in the United States and around the developed world.Not only has a gulf grown between the haves and the have-nots, but so has the gap between the haves and the have-mores.An outgrowth of this has been the creation of gilded ghettos.While far nicer and more comfortable than their urban counterparts, these gilded ghettos similarly narrow the vision of the people who live in them and their understanding of people outside of them.They also set their residents on a trajectory in life that is hard to stray from.In this case, these gilded ghettos are perpetuating wealth, a sense of safety and access to great education.A byproduct is that they often unintentionally exclude others from those same opportunities.Its the defining element of our time, said Richard Florida, author of The New Urban Crisis and professor of business and creativity at the University of Toronto.Economic inequality is an important component, but its not what is getting people angry.Its this geographic separation of people, these clusters of extreme affluence on the one hand and concentrated pockets of poverty on the other hand.The old middle-class neighborhoods are gone.Mr. Florida is referring to neighborhoods mixed by income and occupation.His father was a factory worker, but lived next door to his uncle who was an executive at Colgate-Palmolive.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They were best buddies, Mr. Florida said.My dad was poorer.My uncle was richer.My dad was a Democrat, but my uncle was a Republican.Thats unimaginable today.They wouldnt live next to each other.He said in the 1970s 70 percent of people lived in middle-class neighborhoods, but today only 40 percent do.Photo The effect is that people in different socioeconomic groups do not spend time with one another.That lack of contact causes different points of view for sure, but it also leads to very different outcomes in life.We used to think of these divides as city and suburbs, with the poor in the city and the rich in the suburbs, Mr. Florida said.But the truth of the matter is we have this patchwork of concentrated affluence surrounded by much larger areas of concentrated disadvantage.The interesting thing is this wealth divide is not city-suburb anymore.Its chock-a-block.We look more like a third-world country, where poor and rich are bumped up against each other.Before he became president, Donald Trump had a life that was defined by the gilded ghetto he created for himself.He lived and worked in Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper he developed and opened in 1983.He ate at restaurants he knew, like the 21 Club.When he traveled, he went by private plane.He spent time at the resorts and golf clubs he owned.Now even wealthier people are buying apartments that stretch into the sky on Manhattans so-called Billionaires Row along Central Park South.For a reported $220 million, Kenneth Griffin, the founder of the hedge fund Citadel, bought a four-floor condominium with a view of Central Park.That building and others that have gone up are filled with apartments costing $30 million or more.Even if these are extreme examples, that walling off is solidified, even among people closer in income level and occupation.Bay Colony, a development in affluent Naples, Fla., is separated from the rest of the high-end Pelican Bay development by its own gate in other words, a gated community within a gated community.On the one hand, such gating allows people to spend time with exactly the type of people they have the most in common with; on the other hand it creates an echo chamber of beliefs and expectations that further separates the have-mores from everyone else.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If you had $10 million, the first thing people think is youd be able to do the things important to you, said Paul K. Piff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine.You get yourself more space.You choose to live in a neighborhood with other like-minded people.You can curate your life in so many different ways that make it more comfortable.Photo But at the same time it becomes this physical and psychological barrier between you and the rest of the world, Mr. Piff added.That can slowly erode our natural psychological tendencies to orient toward others.Its a basic component of empathy.It helps you see their common humanity.Without that concept you dont have that empathy.He pointed to a study in the Chronicle of Philanthropy that showed affluent people who lived among other affluent people were less charitable than people who lived in more mixed neighborhoods.Immigrant Beginnings Ms. Allen didnt grow up in a wealth bubble.Her father immigrated from Italy and worked construction jobs in Chicago before starting his own company.She said her group of affluent residents, brought together by the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, were inspired to help after listening to Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, discuss his book, Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis, which talks about the opportunity gap between rich and poor young people in the United States and how it is making upward mobility difficult.That group has committed to spending $350,000 over two years, with a focus on practical things like increasing school attendance and parental involvement and decreasing how often people change homes and schools.The groups goal, Ms. Allen said, is modest: to help these children get a bit further up the socioeconomic ladder.I ended up in a lucrative field, Ms. Allen said.We worked hard, yes.But plenty of people work hard, and theyre not getting anywhere, and they dont have the kinds of jobs that are lucrative.While such charitable efforts aim to make improvement, they are limited in their impact.What they cannot do is give disadvantaged children the networks that their more prosperous peers have.Photo Thomas Peters, president and chief executive of the Marin Community Foundation in Novato, Calif., said people often associated the county with affluent towns like Mill Valley and the enormous wealth of Silicon Valley.But Marin Countys gilded ghettos abut areas of extreme poverty.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You could go from Mill Valley about five minutes and be in an area in San Rafael where families are jammed together in a single one-bedroom apartment, he said.And the deal is they rent it by a third of a day.You have that room or couch for eight hours and thats a five-minute drive from some of the most gorgeous homes in America where people could get lost in the house.Mr. Peters said some of the work of the foundation was to bridge the divide between Silicon Valley wealth and the poverty in other parts of the county through grants, but also access to its donor networks.The 400 families involved with the foundation have given $1.3 billion and have another $1.7 billion committed to give.We can address the fact that there are thousands of kids here who have all the natural ability and biologically vested intelligence to do spectacularly in life, but whose opportunities to do so are restricted, he said.Still, Mr. Peters is cognizant that the children who benefit from grants and the mentorship of successful donors are the lucky few.It is not something, in the parlance of the region, that is scalable.Its heartbreaking to admit that, he said.But its what we have.Its what we can do.Absent the answer to a grand plan, this is a good plan.Up From Middle Class Michael Novogratz and his wife, Sukey, who are billionaires, grew up middle class and met at Princeton University.He was a star wrestler and went on to become a partner at Goldman Sachs and the chief operating officer at the Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund that went public in 2007.They have deep networks in college sports, the Ivy League and the highest echelons of finance that would seem to allow them to get the biggest bang for any buck they spent to help even the playing field.Photo Yet Mr. Novogratz said he and his wife were the exception to the rule when they began moving from their middle-class roots in the 1980s to the exclusive world they now inhabit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Social mobility in the country has gone down, not up, he said.Some of it is, its harder to get into the schools and the jobs that create these robust networks of opportunity.One program he supports is Beat the Streets, which uses wrestling to help disadvantaged urban children.He said about 12,000 young people go

Im Rich, and That Makes Me Anxious:::::Wealth frequently comes with a bundle of expectations anxiety and pressure to make smart money decisions, for example, about how it is managed, spent, passed on to future generations, or used to create a legacy.There is a degree of fear.People are afraid of the money, how it might corrupt them, or make them insensitive to other peoples plights, Ms. Mellan said.They worry about their kids having so much money thrown at them that they will not be motivated to work for money and have a meaningful life.Eric D. Bailey, founder and chief executive of Bailey Wealth Advisors in Silver Spring, Md., said possessing wealth was an uneasy feeling for many of his clients, a combination of business owners and mid- and upper-level executives whose average net worth is $3 million to $15 million.They dont take it for granted, he said.They never do feel they have enough.It takes some coaxing to get them to spend money.He said he helped them understand that under any combination of scenarios, the odds were very low that they would outlive their money.What many people who become wealthy are not prepared for is the emotional difficulty of dealing with money, said James Grubman, a psychologist and founder of FamilyWealth Consulting.For more people than you would think, the adjustment to having money is quite stressful, Mr. Grubman said.No one gets a lot of empathy talking about these things.This is easy to understand if you think about the stereotypes that society generally has about the rich, he added.If you grow up hearing money messages like rich people only care about themselves or other negative beliefs about the wealthy and then you become wealthy yourself, how are you going to reconcile what you believed about those people in the fact that now you are one of them?Another worry is that if you are rich, you have a target on your back, and people are always going to hit you up for loans and gifts.There is the security and the stability and the success that wealth represents, but people just do not want the identity and the downside of what they associate with being rich, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story One way to combat the apprehension about wealth is financial education.The anxiety that comes with having acquired wealth is alleviated by having the confidence you can learn what you need to learn, said Charlotte Beyer, author of Wealth Management Unwrapped Revised and Expanded: Unwrap What You Need to Know and Enjoy the Present and founder of the Institute for Private Investors, a provider of educational and networking resources for ultrahigh net worth investors and the nonprofit Principle Quest Foundation, which supports education and mentoring for girls and women.You need to decide what do I want this money to do?Ms. Beyer said.How you spend your money is the ultimate representation of your values, and you should do it with joy and fun and love.Inherited wealth comes with some different worries.Susan Remmer Ryzewic, 66, came into a fortune after her father died and his engineering business was sold for $100 million.The biggest anxieties were working out the differences with my siblings on how the family wanted the money invested and what they felt the money should represent, she said.If you dont manage the emotional and family aspects, the money doesnt matter.When the familys fortune landed, it was overwhelming.We found we couldnt move forward initially because we were all so concerned about our own agenda that we were not really listening to each other, Ms. Remmer Ryzewic said.It took awhile for us to be speaking the same language.Ms. Remmer Ryzewic, her brother and two sisters spent a lot of time in the first few years getting educated.She took a number of courses on fixed income investments and aspects of portfolio management so she could be a reasonably informed consumer.And there is that nagging feeling of being taken advantage of.In the beginning you are thinking all these people are so wonderful and nice and then you realize everybody wants a piece of something, Ms. Remmer Ryzewic said.You get sort of cynical.And I started feeling I was being defined by it.Now I just feel so fortunate that it provides me with choices.Initially, it was way more responsibility; now I am comfortable with the responsibility.One highlight of their good fortune: Ms. Remmer Ryzewic, her sisters and mother, who is now deceased, set up The Remmer Family Foundation, a private charitable foundation, with some of the proceeds.One of the foundations goals is to reduce poverty for women and youth by helping disadvantaged adolescent and preadolescent girls take ownership of their lives.The foundation also encourages environmental stewardship by improving the sustainability of the worlds fisheries.Acquiring wealth from the sale of an entrepreneurial venture has its own set of mental gymnastics.First generation wealth creators who sell their business and now are investing their wealth and dealing with their wealth are different than second generation, or someone who got it by the lottery, said Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of Tiger 21, and author of Think Bigger: And 39 Other Winning Strategies From Successful Entrepreneurs.They have finally made it from modest beginnings and are now in a brave new world, he added.Theyre in their sweet spot, and then they sell their business and theyre adrift, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said.It is like jumping through the looking glass, he said.You are going back to square one.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then too, for many entrepreneurs, they spent a lifetime reaching just beyond their grasp, always reaching for the next goal, he said.Its a really lucky person who can say I have enough.I am comfortable with what I have.
Harvey Weinstein Expelled From Television Academy Over Abuse Claims:::::Photo Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer accused of sexual harassment and assault by several women, has been banned for life from the Television Academy because of widespread examples of this horrific behavior.The organization, which awards the Primetime Emmys, voted Monday to oust Mr. Weinstein, Variety reported.The Academy supports those speaking out against harassment in all forms and stands behind those who have been affected by this issue, the organization said in a statement to Variety.The unfolding and widespread examples of this horrific behavior are deeply disturbing to the Academys leadership.Investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker have revealed accusations of sexual harassment, assault and rape from women going back decades.Mr. Weinstein said his behavior has caused a lot of pain.A representative for Mr. Weinstein has said he denies allegations of nonconsensual sex.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The New Yorker reported Monday that Mr. Weinstein had hired private investigators to collect information on his accusers and on journalists who were reporting about their allegations.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His ouster from the Television Academy is the latest in a series of professional condemnations since widespread accusations about his treatment of women were published last month.Since the accusations surfaced, he has been kicked out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and fired from the Weinstein Company, which he co-founded.
Report Details Weinsteins Covert Attempt to Halt Publication of Accusations:::::We learned today that the law firm of Boies Schiller and Flexner secretly worked to stop our reporting on Harvey Weinstein at the same time as the firms lawyers were representing us in other matters, the statement read.We consider this intolerable conduct, a grave betrayal of trust, and a breach of the basic professional standards that all lawyers are required to observe.It is inexcusable and we will be pursuing appropriate remedies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.On Monday night, David McCraw, The Timess deputy general counsel, declined to say what those remedies might be.But, he said, I think that what they owe us is an explanation of what actually happened, adding, We need to know much more.Mr. Boies did not respond to an email inquiry on Monday.But he told The New Yorker that while he oversaw the contract, he himself did not select the firm or direct its agents.And while he said he did not believe his work for Mr. Weinstein and his firms representation of The Times represented a conflict, We should not have been contracting and paying investigators that we did not select and direct.Black Cube promotes itself as a select group of veterans from the Israeli elite intelligence units.One of its agents posed as a potential Weinstein accuser to secure two meetings with Ben Wallace, a New York magazine reporter who was pursuing a Weinstein article that never came to be.She also reached out to one of the two lead New York Times reporters on the Weinstein story, Jodi Kantor, The New Yorker reported, an attempt that went nowhere.Ms. Kantor was also investigated, along with the New Yorker reporter on the Weinstein story, Ronan Farrow, by another firm Mr. Weinstein hired, PSOPS.The firm had been used, as well, to dig up dirt on accusers like Ms. McGowan, producing one long briefing that included a subheading that read, Past Lovers, The New Yorker reported.Mr. Weinsteins habit of using investigators to undermine accusers and reporters dates back more than a decade, according to the New Yorker article published on Monday, which was also written by Mr. Farrow.The magazine reported that Mr. Weinstein had used Kroll to dig up unflattering information about the former New York Times media columnist David Carr, who died in 2015, when Mr. Carr was working on an article about Mr. Weinstein in the early 2000s for New York magazine.The article quotes from a report about Mr. Carr that Mr. Weinsteins investigators produced, noting that he had learned of Ms. McGowans allegations.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, Sallie Hofmeister, denied Mr. Weinstein had assigned a private eye to look into Mr. Carr when The Times asked her about it last month.Ms. Hofmeister did not respond to emails on Monday night.
Saudi Money Fuels the Tech Industry. Its Time to Ask Why.:::::The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records from Saudi Arabias government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund stands in stark contrast to those aims.By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions, said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of todays tech companies have lost a moral compass.There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys and, yes, its always guys in the room, she said.Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about.SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column.Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment.So did Uber, which garnered a $3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund.The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleeds Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring declined to comment on his arrest.Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking.Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government his arrest by the government underscores this and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including giving women the right to drive, a restriction that the kingdom says will be lifted next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi governments supposed push for modernization.The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the states dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force.The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the worlds least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but its the part of the government that wants to do better.Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments.When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, its true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia.But its SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders.The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBanks fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug.When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers.You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi governments portfolio.Then, finally, theres the justification of desperation.Some companies dont have any choice but to take money thats offered to them.(In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who has been criticized for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money.For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term operational flexibility.But why take it from the Saudis?I suspect its the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.Now were in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.
Will Taylor Swift Stream? Music Industry Is Left to Guess:::::Ms.Swift and her label, Big Machine, have not announced their plans, and a spokeswoman for the star declined to comment.The fact that Ms.Swift can keep the industry on edge shows her extraordinary power.Her apparent lack of commitment to streaming also shows that although streaming has taken over listening habits, it is still not fully embraced by artists as a satisfactory source of income.Taylor Swift is one of the few artists who has the combination of star power and fan cultivation to truly drive how her music is consumed, said Vickie Nauman, an industry consultant and former digital music executive.The last big star to avoid streaming was Adele, who two years ago kept 25 from those platforms and had record-breaking sales.Ms.Swift also kept 1989 off streaming services, reaching a deal with Apple Music only after eight months; by that time, the album had sold five million copies via download and CD.By most analyses, these have been financial calculations: It would take 150 streams of every song on a 10-track album to equal the revenue of a single CD sale, according to standard industry estimates.Beyonc, perhaps the only other comparable artist, has kept her latest record, Lemonade, from streaming on Apple and Spotify, but her reasons may be competitive she is a partner in Tidal, the streaming service controlled by Jay-Z.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Reputation seems to be following a similar strategy as 1989, with much of its marketing campaign focused on sales.UPS trucks emblazoned with Ms. Swifts face are poised to deliver copies of the CD, and Target will sell a special version of it with Taylor Swift-designed print magazines.Through a partnership with Ticketmaster, Ms.Swift has told fans that they can boost your place in line for tickets to her concert tour by purchasing CDs and merchandise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I anticipate she will hold it from streaming until she hits some sales mark, said Stephanie Kellar, an associate professor at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, and then she will revisit that decision.By contrast, many hip-hop albums, which now dominate streaming, do not release a CD version at first, potentially leaving money on the table.For those who have been watching Spotify closely, there have been signs of a lack of promotion of Ms. Swifts music.When she released a new track, Call It What You Want, last week, the song did not appear on Spotifys popular New Music Friday playlist.Graham James, a spokesman for Spotify, declined to comment on whether the service would have Ms. Swifts album.When asked about the songs absence from its playlist, he said, Our policy is to work with artists and managers who want to work with us to connect with their millions of fans on Spotify.Representatives for Apple, Amazon and Tidal declined to comment.For Ms.Swift, absence from streaming where the bulk of listening now occurs, especially for young people carries an additional risk of shunning the market.The albums first single, Look What You Made Me Do, went to No.1 and logged hundreds of millions of streams, but successive songs have missed the mark.Ready for It?, for example, released shortly thereafter, stalled at No.4 and has been streamed a moderate 93 million times on Spotify.If Ms.Swift decides to withhold her music from streaming services, her lead may be followed by other artists, Professor Kellar said, but likely not with the same success.She will not be the last one to do it, she said, but she is one of the few that can.
A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up:::::We now have teachable robots, Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new companys offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.The new company is part of a much wider effort to create A.I.that allows robots to learn.Researchers in places like Google, Brown University, and Carnegie Mellon are doing similar work, as are existing start-ups like Micropsi and Prowler.io.Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazons massive distribution centers.But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications.The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.Today, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter, said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firms investment in Embodied Intelligence.But most real problems cant be solved that way.You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.Photo Mr. Abbeel and the other founders of Embodied Intelligence, including the former OpenAI researchers Peter Chen and Rocky Duan and the former Microsoft researcher Tianhao Zhang, specialize in an algorithmic method called reinforcement learning a way for machines to learn tasks by extreme trial and error.Researchers at DeepMind, the London-based A.I.lab owned by Google, used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game of Go better than any human.In essence, the machine learned to master this enormously complex game by playing against itself over and over and over again.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Other researchers, across both industry and academia, have shown that similar algorithms allow robots to learn physical tasks as well.By repeatedly trying to open a door, for instance, a robot can learn which particular movements bring success and which dont.Much like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques.Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table.Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot.Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.Photo We collect data on what the human is doing, Mr. Chen said.Then we can train the machine to imitate the human.These and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics.It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I.at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster.And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence.Andrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: I want to do this in practice, Mr. Abbeel explained.That same thing goes for us.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.He said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry.Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they cant yet master.That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media.Machine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics, said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University.And it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.But Mr. Abbeel is among the worlds top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.It is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics, said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.
Disney Said to Have Held Talks to Acquire 21st Century Fox Assets:::::Photo LOS ANGELES The Walt Disney Company recently held preliminary talks to buy entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the Fox movie and television studio, the FX cable network and a share of Hulu.The talks were first reported by CNBC on Monday and confirmed by two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private information.The two companies are no longer talking, although discussions could restart.Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment.The talks, however preliminary, say a lot about the rapidly evolving media industry.Big players like Disney are seeking to get bigger as they follow Netflix into the streaming business and square off against technology giants like AT&T, which is in the final stages of acquiring Time Warner.Medium-size players like 21st Century Fox may be realizing or accepting that gaining the scale they need to compete may be out of reach at this point.In July, Discovery Communications spent $11.9 billion to buy Scripps Media, creating a powerhouse in unscripted television.Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nations largest owner of television stations, has been trying to win regulatory approval for its $3.9 billion purchase of Tribune Media.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Disney shares climbed 2 percent on Monday.Disney is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.
Commerce Secretary May Sell Investment in Russia-Linked Company:::::Photo The commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., indicated on Monday that he would probably sell his stake in a shipping company with business ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putins inner circle, amid fallout from publication of a vast leak of offshore files that documented the connection.Mr. Ross retained an investment in the shipper, Navigator Holdings, even as he sold off numerous other holdings to join the Trump administration, information that did not emerge publicly during his confirmation proceedings.Among Navigators biggest clients is Sibur, a Russian energy firm whose owners include Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch who is a friend of Mr. Putins and is subject to United States sanctions, and Kirill Shamalov, Mr. Putins son-in-law.Navigator earns millions of dollars a year chartering ships to Sibur.In an interview with Bloomberg, Mr. Ross said that he would probably not keep his Navigator investment, but that it did not pose a conflict of interest.He also defended Navigators business dealings with Sibur, saying there was nothing whatsoever wrong with it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Navigator was not listed in an ethics agreement Mr. Ross submitted in January that described the investments he intended to keep after joining the Trump administration.It had appeared in an earlier filing showing his assets as of December 2016, but the subsequent agreement named only the partnerships that he used to retain his Navigator stake, not their underlying assets.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The connection between the partnerships and Mr. Rosss continuing investment in Navigator was made by journalists investigating a leak of records from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda that counted Mr. Ross among its top clients.The Appleby records were obtained by the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other media organizations, including The New York Times.News of Mr. Rosss Navigator ties prompted Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the commerce committee, to assert that Mr. Ross had misled senators during his confirmation hearing by not making clear he had the investment.He called Mr. Rosss financial disclosures a Russian nesting doll, with blatant conflicts of interest carefully hidden within seemingly innocuous holding companies.
Hedge Funds Push the Price of Bitcoin to New Highs:::::Now market watchers say a significant amount of the new money is coming from large institutional investors, many of them hedge funds looking to capitalize on the skyrocketing price.Many of the hedge funds were set up over the last year to invest exclusively in virtual currencies.The research firm Autonomous Next has said the number of such hedge funds has risen from around 30 to nearly 130 this year alone.More general-purpose hedge funds have also been buying up Bitcoin, like one run by Bill Miller, a well known mutual fund manager who spent most of his career with Legg Mason.Even more big investors are looking at the space after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced last week that it would launch a Bitcoin futures contract in the next few months.The contract will make it easier for financial institutions plugged into the exchange to get involved with the Bitcoin market without having to worry about holding Bitcoin itself.Bobby Cho, the head trader at one of the largest Bitcoin trading businesses, Cumberland, said that after years of hesitancy, institutional investors now accounted for most of his business.The vast majority of the trading we do is with institutions, Mr. Cho said.The education and research have turned into real-life activity.The New York Times Explains...The entrance of these big investors creates new risks for Bitcoin.Kevin Zhou, a longtime trader in the space, said that hedge funds were more likely than small investors to pull out a lot of money at once, and that Bitcoin was still small enough that a single funds cashing out could cause the price to drop sharply.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You could get a possible run on the bank if one large investor withdraws and that causes the price to tank, said Mr. Zhou, a co-founder of the trading firm Galois Capital.That could cause a cascade of withdrawals.The rising importance of Wall Street is an unexpected turn for a virtual currency that was invented in 2008 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to operate outside the traditional financial system.The Soaring Price of Bitcoin Since the beginning of the year, the value of Bitcoin has jumped over 600 percent.$6,000 4,000 2,000 0 $7,377 2017 April July Oct. (11/5) Bitcoins, even those held by hedge funds, are recorded and stored on a decentralized database known as the blockchain, kept on a network of computers around the world.The whole system is governed by so-called open source software that is maintained by a community of volunteer programmers.The lack of backing from any government or established institution has concerned many large banks.The chief executive of Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, said last week that he saw no inherent value in Bitcoin, joining the list of bankers who have called the market a bubble.But some financial leaders, including Goldman Sachss chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, have defended the idea that virtual currencies could one day play a role in the global financial system because they can be obtained by anyone with internet access.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The debate about Bitcoin has been part of a broader explosion of interest this year in the various technological concepts introduced by the virtual currency.Many banks, including JPMorgan, have been trying to find ways to create their own decentralized databases, like the Bitcoin blockchain, that could provide a more reliable and secure way to track information.In the technology industry, there has been a rush this year of so-called initial coin offerings, a way for entrepreneurs to raise money by creating and selling their own custom virtual currencies.Initial coin offerings have taken over $3 billion from investors this year after attracting almost no interest before.These coin offerings have created their own demand for Bitcoin because the new coins generally have to be bought with an existing virtual currency like Bitcoin.The interest in Bitcoin could be dampened in the coming weeks, however, by a debate among Bitcoin followers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bitcoin start-ups and programmers have been fighting for nearly three years about the best way to update the software that governs the currency and the network on which it lives.The battle is expected to come to a head this month when new Bitcoin software, backed by many of the biggest virtual currency start-ups, is released.The new software aims to double the number of transactions flowing through the network.Currently, the computers processing Bitcoin transactions are limited to about five transactions per second.Most of the programmers who maintain the Bitcoin software have opposed the changes because they say it would make it harder for individuals to track their own Bitcoins.Some of the computers on the network are likely to update to the new software while others stay with the existing rules, creating a split, or fork, in the network that would result in two separate Bitcoins.A Bitcoin fork could prove disruptive and drive away investors.But several signals suggest that the proposed rule changes are not likely to win enough support to survive for long, which would leave the status quo in place.Bitcoin has already survived past attempts to fork the software and create imitators.In August, a group of former Bitcoin supporters created Bitcoin Cash, a totally separate virtual currency that makes it easier to do small transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee.The price of Bitcoin temporarily wavered before Bitcoin Cash was introduced.All previous holders of Bitcoin were automatically granted the same number of Bitcoin Cash, and the value of those has also been rising, essentially doubling in the last month.Chris Burniske, a co-author of a book on virtual currency investing, Cryptoassets, said most of the new investors werent too concerned about the exact design of Bitcoin or the current debates.I dont think a lot of the new buyers are overly concerned about the long-term technical aspects of Bitcoin, he said.They are simply approaching it as a financial instrument.
Air Travelers Resisting the Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat:::::While low-cost airlines like Spirit have narrowed the distance between rows of seats to as little as 28 inches, most of the big American airlines have kept the distance whats known in the business as seat pitch at 30 inches.Anything less, the major airlines have found, pushes already beleaguered travelers to their limits.This year, the news leaked that American Airlines was considering a cabin redesign that would leave a few rows in its new Boeing 737 Max fleet with just 29 inches of pitch, plans the carrier quickly dropped after a rash of complaints.We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members, the airlines chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July.While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasnt worth it.The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats and, by definition, two middle seats rather than three.But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isnt enough space.The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight youre going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 no way can you do four-three, he said.Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding.But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.Weve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller, he said.Weve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems, leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space thats left over for the passenger, Mr. Pozzi said.Photo Or, as the case may be, for more passengers.Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two, said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com.The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldnt.Now, he added, youre cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space.It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.On American Airlines new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches.Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running.The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space, an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch.A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess todays newer seat designs.If you just go by inches, its kind of an old measure.Were kind of basing it on comfort level and the way weve engineered our seats, he said.While its only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like its about 30 inches, he said.But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort.One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch.The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A.in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as the incredible shrinking airline seat.Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns.Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Obviously, if youre squeezed into a very confined space, its going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency, Mr. Hudson said.The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds, he said.Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary.Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.It wont be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety, Mr.Counter said.Mr. Harteveldt agreed.There may be a legitimate issue around safety, he said.Thats why were now starting to see this topic bubble up.
Mountain of Debt Casts Shadow Over Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal:::::Photo Chip makers like Freescale Semiconductor and NXP Semiconductors took a high-profile role in the leveraged-buyout binge that preceded the financial crisis and the distress that followed it.That makes Broadcoms roughly $105 billion unsolicited offer for Qualcomm on Monday all the more edgy.The borrowing associated with a deal, if it happens, could be in record amounts and may send ratios of debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) uncomfortably high.Broadcoms chief executive, Hock Tan, is facing two sources of uncertainty.One is whether his counterpart, Steve Mollenkopf, is willing to engage over the deal, which offers a 28 percent premium over Qualcomms closing stock price on Thursday, before word of a potential bid began to spread.So far, Qualcomms response has been noncommittal.The other problem facing Mr. Tan is Qualcomms ongoing $38 billion bid to buy NXP which listed shakily in 2010 and bought Freescale in 2015.Mr. Tan said he would take Qualcomm with or without NXP.Then theres sheer scale.The bid, worth $130 billion including Qualcomm debt, according to Broadcom, would require nearly $90 billion in cash.The private-equity outfit Silver Lake is providing $5 billion in convertible debt, with the rest to be raised by Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.Add in the companies existing net debt, and the new groups total would be over $100 billion, even if more cash accumulates before the deal closes.Thats four or five times the $23 billion in combined Ebitda that Broadcom is expecting, including cost savings.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Consolidation among makers of chips for mobile phones, cars and the rest is all the rage, and Mr. Tan is an experienced deal maker with a record of quickly bringing debt down after acquisitions.But its still a cyclical industry.The merged company would have to keep big customers like Apple happy, which might mean cutting prices.Meanwhile, $3 billion in annual cost reductions, taxed and capitalized, are worth about the same as the roughly $22 billion premium, so Broadcom isnt keeping much for its own shareholders.At least one deal hurdle Washingtons examination of foreign acquirers has been pre-empted.The Singapore-domiciled Broadcom will move to the United States, Mr. Tan said last week in a news conference with President Trump.Investors seem to have caught the good feelings, pushing up the stock of both companies to the tune of more than $20 billion altogether since Thursday.As it happens, both Freescale and NXP survived a turn in the cycle despite excessive leverage.But the distress they went through should give pause for thought.
CDs, Not Streaming, Send Kenny Chesney to No. 1:::::Photo In the age of music streaming, sometimes the CD is still king.This week the country star Kenny Chesney reached No.1 on the Billboard album chart with his new concert release, Live in No Shoes Nation (Blue Chair/Columbia Nashville), which had the equivalent of 219,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen.But the digital portion of that total is only 5 percent, including a minuscule 1.6 million streams.By contrast, three other albums in the Top 5 this week had more than 50 million streams.The vast majority of the sales of Live in No Shoes Nation about 205,000 copies were for the CD version, which was bundled with the cost of tickets for Mr. Chesneys 2018 tour; people who bought tickets were sent an email that could be redeemed for the album.Billboard does not track sales this way, but said that 197,000 copies fit the magazines internet sales category, which includes these kinds of purchases.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.Five other new albums opened in the Top 10 this week, as the music industry begins to push its higher-profile releases.(This week will see the arrival of the highest: Taylor Swifts Reputation.)Kelly Clarkson is No.2 with Meaning of Life (Atlantic), Chris Brown opened at No.3 with Heartbreak on a Full Moon (RCA), and Without Warning (Epic), by the rappers 21 Savage and Offset with the producer Metro Boomin, started in fourth place.Yo Gottis I Still Am is No.6 and Big K.R.I.T.s 4Eva Is a Mighty Long Time is No.7.The rapper Post Malone, who has had a steady hit with Stoney, fell one spot to No.5 in that albums 47th week out, and Niall Horans Flicker, last weeks No.1 album, fell to No.20 in its second week, having lost 85 percent of its sales.
From Utah, Secretive Help for a Russian Oligarch and His Jet:::::A Request From Moscow Appleby, based in Bermuda, is one of the worlds largest offshore law firms.Its files offer a rare inside look at more than a dozen aircraft trusts structured by American financial institutions for privacy-seeking plane owners, primarily foreigners who otherwise would not be allowed to register with the F.A.A.There is a premium on American registration because it increases a planes resale value, the bureaucratic requirements are less costly and complex, and it is believed to draw less scrutiny as the aircraft moves around the world.Among the plane owners seeking Applebys services were Shaher Abdulhak, a Yemeni businessman worth an estimated $9 billion whose investments included a Coca-Cola distributor in the Middle East; UPL, an Indian producer of industrial chemicals and pesticides; and Rashid Sardarov, a Russian oil billionaire and longtime client of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm whose leaked records in 2015 became known as the Panama Papers.In serving these clients, files show, Appleby dealt with the two banks that are the most prolific creators of American aircraft trusts: Wells Fargo and Bank of Utah.It is easy to see how Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, with nearly $2 trillion in assets and offices in 42 countries, might find a lucrative niche catering to the wealthy elite.Less obvious is how Bank of Utah, with 18 branches confined to one state, took the same path.As it happens, a group of former Wells Fargo trust officers joined Bank of Utah about 10 years ago and created what would become a profitable part of the banks business.The bank collected $8.8 million in trust fees in 2016 an increase of $1.1 million from the previous year, according to its most recent annual report.Mr. Croasmun and Mr. Hansen took issue with the suggestion that they were exploiting a loophole to bypass restrictions on foreigners registering aircraft in the United States.By filling the role of U.S. citizen for registration purposes, the bank provided a valuable service for, say, multinational companies whose top executives might not be American, they said.The bank is clearly sensitive to concerns raised about the trusts.Its website carries a statement distancing itself from the planes it registers in its name, noting its only role is that of trustee.Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.In the case of Mr. Mikhelson, the trail leading from Russia to Utah began in September 2012, with an email to Appleby from the Moscow office of the accounting firm Ernst & Young.The firm wanted Appleby to set up a complex corporate structure for an unnamed client to purchase a Gulfstream jet, valued at roughly $65 million, and retain possession of it through a chain of companies in six countries.From the outset, the goal was clear: This structure, wrote Svetlana Yakushina of Ernst & Young, should allow registering the aircraft with the aviation authorities of the United States.How a Wealthy Foreigner Obtains U.S.Registration for a Private Jet The Russian oligarch Leonid Mikhelson wants to buy and register a private jet in the U.S., which requires American citizenship or residency.So a company he owns in Belize uses its company in the Cayman Islands, which uses its company in the British Virgin Islands to create a new company in Panama to buy the jet and record it in the Isle of Man for tax purposes, and to enter into a trusteeship with the Bank of Utah, which registers the jet in the U.S.The arrangement would also permit the owner to avoid certain taxes, most notably a value-added tax of 20 percent if the jet were registered and used in the European Union.A six-page memo prepared by Ernst & Young laid out a plan to exploit a tax loophole offered by the Isle of Man, where about 1,000 privately owned aircraft are recorded on a government registry for tax purposes.Appleby and other similar firms maintain offices there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Isle of Man allows owners to escape the value-added tax, or VAT, through a paper-shuffling scheme, wherein the jet is held by a company based there but leased to another company elsewhere, both controlled by the same owner.The tax is technically deferred into the future, through use of a special account managed by Ernst & Young, and then canceled out by the corporate structure.Research by the investigative journalists consortium suggests that Isle of Man-registered aircraft have escaped more than $1 billion in taxes.According to a flow chart created by Applebys Isle of Man office for the Mikhelson account, the ownership chain for his jet began in Panama, with a company called Golden Star Aviation, which registered on the Isle of Man and then leased the aircraft to a Cayman Islands company called SWGI Growth Fund.Both companies were controlled by Mr. Mikhelson.Mr. Mikhelson declined to answer questions about his plane.His representative released a statement saying, Mr. Mikhelson acts strictly within the boundaries of the law and in compliance with applicable legislation at all times.By June 2013, lawyers at Appleby still had not learned of Mr. Mikhelsons role, other than being told that the Gulfstreams owner was Russian.Once the lawyers were informed of his identity by a Swiss firm that manages Mr. Mikhelsons finances, they conducted a background check and concluded that, as with other clients from Russia, where the political and legal environment can be unstable, working for him would be high risk.But they decided to proceed.Photo Sanctions and Citizenship A due-diligence report by Appleby noted Mr. Mikhelsons source of wealth valued currently at about $18 billion from oil and gas investments, notably through Novatek, Russias largest nongovernment-owned gas company.Mr. Mikhelsons main business partner is Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Mr. Putins.The two businessmen are the primary investors in Sibur, a Russian gas-processing company.Included in the report was a list of questions to determine if Mr. Mikhelson had any connections to the United States, including whether he had assets or maintained an address there.The answer to all of them was no.Flight records show that the plane has rarely, if ever, flown to the United States and instead makes trips within Russia or occasionally to cities in Europe and China.Despite its lack of a connection to the United States, Mr. Mikhelsons private jet was soon on its way to securing a registration with the F.A.A., thanks to Bank of Utah.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is not clear if the bank was ever told, or inquired, about the identity of the owner of the aircraft.Mr. Croasmun said that files indicated the owner was Russian but that identifying details were missing.Whatever the case, the trust agreement for Mr. Mikhelsons Gulfstream, filed with the F.A.A., does not name him anywhere in the document.Instead, the owner is listed as Golden Star Aviation, the Panamanian company he used to buy the plane.Attached to it is an affidavit of citizenship signed by a bank officer, Brett King, attesting that the trustee Bank of Utah is a citizen of the United States.
After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits:::::Seeking the Holy Grail Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens.Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the worlds population.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senates investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apples tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared tax residency nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is managed and controlled abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax.By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there.The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.U.S. Profits

subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Irelands finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his countrys policies: I do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies.Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries.Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year.Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company

other senior partners.They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.In building Apples new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor.A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago.The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators.It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple.For Appleby, Mr.

also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: Are there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, As a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Applebys office in Jersey,

CVS Will Offer Next-Day Delivery of Prescription Drugs:::::Photo CVS Health said on Monday that it would begin offering next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities next year, reflecting the companys worries about potential competition from Amazon.CVS Health also said its retail sales declined in the third quarter of this year, a dip that the company said occurred because of the three major hurricanes that forced many stores to close.Amazons possible expansion into prescription drugs has set the pharmacy industry on edge in recent months, igniting fears that the online behemoth will upend the existing business in much the same way that it has disrupted other consumer markets, from books to household supplies to groceries.Amazon has not publicly announced its plans.But it has acquired several state-level permits to be a wholesale pharmacy distributor over the past year and recently hired a handful of executives from the drug industry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anxiety over such a market upheaval is said to have partly driven CVS to enter into talks with Aetna, the large health insurer, over a potential acquisition.Larry Merlo, the president and chief executive of CVS Health, did not discuss the potential deal in a call with analysts on Monday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Free delivery will be available within hours for prescription drug orders, as well as a curated selection of over-the-counter products in Manhattan beginning Dec. 4, the company said.Same-day delivery would expand to Miami, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco early next year.Next-day delivery, from local stores, would become available in the rest of the country.
The New York Fed Chief Is Stepping Down  but Not Quietly:::::We should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions of people losing their jobs and homes, Mr. Dudley said.We had a woefully inadequate regulatory regime in place, and while it is much better now, there is still work to do.Mr. Trump and his top economic advisers have made no secret that they believe many post-crisis financial regulations overreached and are now restricting banks from making loans and trading securities.By disposition and tradition, Fed officials are wary about criticizing administration policies.In recent months, however, as the administrations criticism of the Dodd-Frank law have increased, the Feds most senior leaders have become bolder in their defense of a tighter regulatory apparatus.Ms. Yellen gave a speech last summer defending regulations that she said made the financial system substantially safer.And Stanley Fischer, who announced his plans to step down as vice chairman of the Fed earlier this year, said in an interview with the Financial Times that any move to tamper with Dodd-Frank would be mind boggling and extremely dangerous.There has been a broad message from the leadership of the Fed that Dodd-Frank has been effective and that you have to leave it alone, said Chris Whalen, a financial consultant who worked at the New York Fed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Whalen said Mr. Dudley, more than any other Fed leader, was justified in arguing to keep a tight rein on banking activities.Dudley did really well considering the magnitude of the collapse that occurred, Mr. Whalen said.The Fed became a broker dealer overnight, and he had to oversee that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Dudley worked at Goldman Sachs for 20 years before joining the New York Fed in 2007.He became president of the New York Fed in 2009, where he played a critical role as both a firefighter overseeing the bailouts of financial institutions and as one of the architects of the rules and regulations that followed.By law, Mr. Dudley would have to step down as president of the New York Fed by January 2019, as that would have been 10 consecutive years in the job.But instead of finishing his term, the New York Fed said on Monday that he would leave his post in mid-2018 to ensure that a successor is identified before the end of his term.According to a person who was briefed on Mr. Dudleys thinking, his plan to leave the Fed six months early has been in the works for some time and was not related to Mr. Trumps bypassing Ms. Yellen for a second term as Fed chairwoman or the administrations more relaxed approach to financial regulation.The American economy is stronger and the financial system safer because of his many thoughtful contributions, Ms. Yellen said in a statement.Unlike the Fed chairman, regional Fed presidents such as Mr. Dudley are not chosen by the president.They are selected by a committee composed of members of the Feds board of directors who are not affiliated with financial institutions.The selection is subject to approval by the Fed board in Washington.Mr. Dudley called his time at the New York Fed a dream job in a statement on Monday, and he said he had every confidence in the institution.
Broadcom Targets Qualcomm in Largest-Ever Tech Deal:::::Mr. Tan has long been known as a savvy deal maker who led consolidation in the chip industry.If he pulls this deal off, his political maneuvering could be used as a sort of template for other executives.Complications are already adding up.Qualcomm is expected to reject the bid as opportunistic and too cheap.And analysts and investors have raised the prospect that a merger of the two companies might be blocked by government regulators, either on antitrust grounds or because Broadcom could still be considered a foreign company buying sensitive technology.Photo But Mr. Tan and his team have already made moves to address some of those issues.Publicly, Broadcom said the plan to move its legal headquarters to the United States was tied to Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, including the cutting of corporate tax rates.But getting on the good side of the Trump administration which will have a say in takeovers like the Qualcomm bid was another factor, according to a person briefed on the matter.In an interview, Mr. Tan, 65, played down any connection between his headquarters announcement at the White House and the Qualcomm bid, asserting that the timing had been coincidental.We think very long term, he said.What we perceive is that the business environment has steadily improved.As we want to grow our business in the long term, that makes it easier to choose to redomicile in the U.S. to sustain our growth trends.That Mr. Tan is in the drivers seat for consolidation in the chip industry reflects his unlikely rise in the technology world.At the White House last Thursday, he recounted being an 18-year-old skinny kid from Malaysia who had been able to attend M.I.T.only because he won a scholarship.He eventually jumped into the chip business, showing off a mastery of operations and an eye for high finance and deal making.Mr. Tan ended up at Broadcoms predecessor, Avago Technologies, in 2006, soon after the investment firms Silver Lake and KKR bought the company.Avagos corporate history can be traced back to Hewlett-Packard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of Mr. Tans tenure since then has been spent thinking about the long-term future of the semiconductor business.He has long been a proponent of consolidation, buying established chip franchises with healthy profit margins and selling off the parts that are not financially successful.Mr. Tans deal-making streak began in earnest in 2013, when Avago bought LSI, a maker of networking chips, for $6.6 billion.Two years later, Avago bought Emulex for $606 million, and then the much-bigger Broadcom for $37 billion.The deal for Qualcomm would be $130 billion including debt.Mr. Tan has for years pushed growth by acquisition.Underpinning the strategy is a recognition that the semiconductor business has largely matured.The rate of revolutionary change has slowed, and chip companies have focused more on price competition, leading to lower profit margins.His approach has been to gain scale by buying market leaders and then running those companies more efficiently while also investing in technologies that customers like Apple want.The Biggest Tech Deals If accepted, Broadcoms bid for Qualcomm would be the largest tech deal in history.Below are the 12 largest to date (values include debt).Broadcom-Qualcomm Dell-EMC Paypal Spinoff From eBay Qualcomm-NXP JDS-SDL Avago-Broadcom SoftBank-ARM HP Enterprise Spinoff E.D.S Spinoff From G.M.Microsoft-LinkedIn HP-Compaq Verisign-Network

better than anyone in the world, Kenneth Hao, a managing partner at Silver Lake who helped bring Mr. Tan to Avago, said in a statement.But consolidation has led to concerns that the chip industry could become concentrated in the hands of just a few big players.Qualcomm itself is in the midst of acquiring NXP Semiconductor for $38.5 billion, while Broadcom is still awaiting national security approval for its $5.5 billion takeover of Brocade Communications.Some analysts have wondered whether Broadcom, with Singapore as its legal headquarters, could face issues with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government group that examines takeovers for threats to national security.But while a deal could face such a review, neither company believes that it would be the main obstacle to a transaction getting done, according to several people briefed on the bid.Broadcoms operations are largely in the United States, and its legal base is in Singapore primarily because of that countrys low tax rate.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Antitrust approval may also be a concern.In January, the Federal Trade Commission brought charges against Qualcomm, accusing the company of abusing its monopoly in certain chips by charging unreasonable rates to partners like Apple, a company with which Qualcomm has a series of long-running legal fights.But Republican antitrust enforcers, picked by Mr. Trump, may take a more lenient approach to mergers.The biggest issue may simply be that Qualcomm believes the current offer, worth about $70 a share, is too low.Qualcomms trove of patents among the most formidable in the world of wireless networking remains a hugely valuable asset.And the company could also believe that closing the NXP acquisition and reaching either a victory over or a settlement with Apple would lift its stock price.But Qualcomm, the longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, has been grappling with a sagging stock price and investor wariness that the Apple fight will continue for some time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Monday, Qualcomm said that its board was weighing Broadcoms offer.Mr. Tan said in the interview that he believed that, should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, he could make peace with Apple.But to win over Qualcomm, Broadcom may need to do something it hasnt done before: wage a hostile takeover, including by replacing at least part of its quarrys board.Although Mr. Tan professed a desire to reach a consensual deal, he suggested that he was prepared to take whatever steps necessary to win.We really know what our options are, and we havent really eliminated them, he said.

Dont Nudge Me: The Limits of Behavioral Economics in Medicine:::::At first glance, behavioral economics the basis of Richard Thalers recent Nobel Prize in Economics seems like a rich field of potential solutions.People tend to do things, like donate organs, when its the default option as opposed to something they need to request.They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs.They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms.Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study.It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication.(Patients adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)Photo Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups.All had recently had heart attacks.One group received the usual care.The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients use of medication.Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.Thats not all.The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didnt take their pills so that they could receive social support.They were given access to special social work resources.There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.This was a kitchen-sink approach.It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management.It failed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups.The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same.So were the medical costs.Even medication adherence the process measure that might influence these outcomes was no different between the two groups.The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future.Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard.In the past, weve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes.That failed.Weve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance.That failed.Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care.There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss although these seemed to disappear over time.Weve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive.They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive.Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is that health has so many moving parts.The health care system has even more.Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse.Behavioral economics may offer us some fascinating theories to test in controlled trials, but we have a long way to go before we can assume its a cure for what ails Americans.
Nonprofits Give Disconnected Youths Another Chance:::::Almost all the people served by the nonprofits identified by the center are low-income.Many are already parents themselves, and a significant number have been in the foster care system their entire lives and are virtually on their own when they age out, typically at 18.Providing intensive guidance and training during this time can stop the descent into chronic homelessness and lifelong reliance on government services, Ms. Rosqueta said.Other factors make it tougher for these young people to succeed.Many have been tangled up in the criminal justice system and, with limited recourse to medical services, some struggle with mental illness, which often first makes an appearance in the late teens or early 20s.Who Helped You in Your Time of Need?Share Your Experience What do you do when you experience a tragedy and need help?Who did you ask?How did you get the help?For some it might be financial aid, others it might be food or lodging.At a time when philanthropic giving is focused on impact, The New York Times would like to hear from people who have received help after going through a personal loss, such as that of a friend or family member, or a natural disaster.Please share your story using the form below.Your comments may be published, but your contact information will not.We may contact you to hear more.Required fields are marked with an asterisk.Did you receive help after experiencing a personal loss?Please share your story.* Continue What is your name?* First and last preferred, please Continue Where do you live?* What is your email address?* We will not share your contact information.A reporter or editor may contact you.Do you have a photo you would like to share?Please upload it here.By submitting to us, you are promising that the content is original, does not plagiarize from anyone or infringe a copyright or trademark, does not violate anyones rights and is not libelous or otherwise unlawful or misleading.You are agreeing that we can use your submission in all manner and media of The New York Times and that we shall have the right to authorize third parties to do so.And you agree to our Terms of Service.Thank you for your submission.Even well-meaning people think that those in their late teens and early 20s are already beyond help, said David Abromowitz, chief public policy officer of YouthBuild USA.They say, I want to work with children.I say, Who do you think are the parents to those children?For example, he said, about 30 percent of those enrolled in YouthBuild have children.People need to understand something actually works with this population, Mr. Abromowitz said.Youth Villages helps emotionally and behaviorally troubled children succeed by working with them and their families; YVLifeset, a part of Youth Villages, is aimed at people 17 to 22 years old.It is an intensive six- to 12-month program to support, guide and encourage participants, most of whom grew up in the foster care system.The statistics for those who spent their childhood in foster care is dismal: At age 21, half are unemployed, one in five is homeless, and almost 70 percent have been involved in the criminal justice system.Since 1999, YVLifeset has served more than 11,000 young adults in seven states, and is beginning to partner with other nonprofits and state and local governments to replicate the model.The idea, said Patrick Lawler, the chief executive of Youth Villages, is for counselors, known as specialists, to offer the resources that other parents give their children every day.They have a small caseload only eight at a time and meet with their clients one to two times a week.Kelly Conlin, the educational and vocational coordinator for YVLifeset in Massachusetts, said part of her role was not to tell her clients what to do but to find out what goals they have for themselves.She often meets them at a local McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts, helping them to find the resources they need, whether it be signing up for food stamps, finding mental health care, learning a trade, finishing high school or getting into college.I get them set up for the next stage in life, she said.And just as important, or even more so, she offers them stability and support, something most have never experienced.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I say, I know you can do this a lot of them had adults who discouraged them, Ms. Conlin said.I show them how its attainable and help them build confidence.A lot feel their voices have never been heard.A five-year independent study by MDRC, a research organization, found that compared with a randomly selected control group, YVLifeset participants show decreases in homelessness and violent relationships and increases in earnings.Photo While such programs have been shown to do good work, social policy change is also needed, said Mark E. Courtney, a professor at the University of Chicago in the School of Social Service Administration, who has long studied child welfare policy and services.The nonprofits, no matter how good, are only able to serve a small proportion of the population who could benefit from them.But, said Professor Courtney, who was one of the authors of the independent study, the best organizations helping young adults are committed to learning what works and what doesnt.And they have found that just as important as offering their participants real-world skills is providing a place where they are welcomed rather than spurned.These programs do what good parents do: They have faith that we will do well in the world, he said, adding that those who participate in the programs generally say, I was welcome, they had faith in me, theyre not afraid of me.And thats really important, because the messages they get from society is the opposite.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Respect was something Taryn Canty-Reed, 20, felt instantly when she joined YouthBuild, a national yearlong program that helps those 16 to 24 years old earn a diploma or high-school equivalency certificate and learn a trade.She tried some other programs, but nothing clicked.YouthBuild, she said, makes me feel like a new and different Taryn.Its not only the skills shes acquiring, but also that the staff members acknowledge the good stuff.They dont down-talk, she said.They pay attention and listen.She started at YouthBuild Philadelphia two months ago and is working in the GreenBuild construction training track, learning to build solar panels and other sustainable energy products.Her goal is go on to a local community college, major in business and construction and then start her own business.The first YouthBuild program started in the 1970s as an experiment in East Harlem in New York City to get low-income youths to rebuild vacant and dilapidated homes in their own community.In 1992, Congress created the federal YouthBuild program and it is now part of the federal Department of Labor.It receives funding from AmeriCorps, as well as corporate, private and foundation grants.Photo Now, there are 230 YouthBuild programs in the United States and 80 internationally.Programs are often housed within a larger nonprofit, such as a YMCA or housing development.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Although the emphasis is on the construction trade at many YouthBuild programs, in Philadelphia, the largest YouthBuild program, students can get a certificate in one of four areas: construction building trades; customer service and business administration; child care; and health care.Nationally, 75 percent complete the program, 74 percent receive a high school diploma or certificate, and a little more than half go on to jobs or higher education.Some organizations are aimed at those young adults who have graduated from high school, but flounder when they are either unable or unwilling to go on to higher education.The goal of Year Up, a national nonprofit, is to get motivated 18- to 24-year-olds with high-school diplomas or equivalency certificates ready for corporate internships that often lead to jobs, said Gerald Chertavian, founder and chief executive of Year Up.The program, which started in 2000, provides a six-month course, where students must dress in professional attire, be respectful and be on time and ready every day for their classes from 8:30 to 3:30 or risk having their stipend docked or being kicked out of the program.It has 22 locations across the country, some within community colleges, and about 19,000 young adults have gone through the program; the students earn 20 to 30 college credits if they finish it.Almost 30 percent are homeless or dont have stable housing, Mr. Chertavian said.And almost half have been exposed to violence or trauma.But he also has a more cheerful statistic: Ninety-one percent of his graduates get a full-time job with an average salary of $40,000.Kerry Sullivan, president of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation, who also sits on Year Ups board, said that of the 470 interns the bank has hired through the program since 2004, 170 have gone on to full-time jobs.The journey began as a philanthropic one, but as time went on, were now looking at it as a pipeline, she said, Although not everyone succeeds, even with the help of such programs, those who do make it through often see them as lifesavers.If I hadnt gone there, I believe that I would have been part of the 97 percent who age out of foster care who dont graduate college, Jonathan, the student at Bridgewater State University, said of of Youth Villages.I would have lived paycheck to paycheck.Even more important, he said, they believed in me.he said.I never had anyone believe in me.

inclusive and kind, those metrics help attract great employees.They also help the companys marketing campaign.The numbers are so important, in fact, that Sandy Capell, the philanthropy and corporate responsibility manager for the company and the Subaru of America Foundation, said she had turned to a software system to track employees who volunteered, tally their time and measure the impact of what theyre doing.The software puts the efforts in perspective, Ms. Capell said.We used to report hours and nothing else.After awhile it loses impact.Now were able to put a true impact on those hours.To do that, Subaru reached out to Blackbaud, a cloud software company that measures the effect of philanthropic efforts.They come to us, and to the market in general, because they want to tell their impact story to individuals, said Kevin McDearis, executive vice president and chief products officer at Blackbaud.They realize part of this is about building their brand and enhancing their brand.That marketing may also mean as much to employees as to consumers.Its getting to be a very competitive market out there, and people will pick a job, and maybe not the highest paid offer, if they feel like theyre part of something bigger than themselves, he said.Photo In a study by CECP, which promotes corporate philanthropy, and the Conference Board this year, a third of employees, on average, participated in corporate volunteerism, and nearly two-third of companies offered paid time off for volunteering.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But there is no room to fake it.A study on corporate social responsibility found that 65 percent of consumers check to see if a company is being authentic when it takes a stand on a social or environmental issue.That number rises to 76 percent for millennials.The study also found that 78 percent of respondents wanted companies to take a stand.Thats a double-edge sword in a polarized time.While 87 percent of the people in the study said they would buy a product because of something the company advocated, 76 percent said they would not buy a product from a company they did not agree with.Everyone loves to feed the hungry and house the homeless, Mr. McDearis said.But companies taking a stand can also drive some interesting polarization.In the case of Subaru, it chose well-known, noncontroversial charities, like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Meals On Wheels.Money for these charities comes through the companys Share the Love campaign, in which it donates $250 from each vehicle bought or leased to various charities.(In nine years, the company said it had given $94 million to charity.Photo Ms. Capell said employees had volunteering goals each year, but that the company did not dictate where they could give their time.The hours get logged, and they get credit for them.However, if employees want to volunteer during the workday, they choose among events the company has organized, like Habitat for Humanity.She said about 1,000 employees gave 5,100 hours last year.And this is where impact measurement comes in.Advertisement Continue reading

in July to protect wild tigers by conserving land for them.The company, which produces programs like Shark Week, Deadliest Catch and American Chopper, aims to double the tiger population by 2022.It now stands at 4,000, compared with 400,000 for elephants.Tigers are apex predators, said Jessica Beatus, vice president of standards, practices and social good at Discovery Communications and the creator and program director of Project CAT, which stands for conserving acres for tigers.When you support them, you support their entire ecosystem, she said.If you have too many prey, you have destruction of the habitat.Photo She said the company had committed to support one million acres in India and Bhutan over six years.The company is looking to use impact metrics to see where viewers are most interested in this campaign.When we run a public-service announcement, does that translate to countries donating?she said.That was a big factor.Do people want to adopt a symbolic tiger?How many people participated?These campaigns are only as successful as you market them.And they do not all work.The company tested a similar donation scheme to help sharks in conjunction with Shark Week.It didnt have as many hits, she said.People go to the beach and hope not to see a shark.Other companies are offering customers what could be called a release valve for their giving.Last year, Evite, the online invitation service, created a system where people could give respondents a way to contribute to charities instead of bringing a gift to the party.We literally had a birthday party for my 4-year-old, and there was a stack of 30 presents that sat for probably a year, said Victor Cho, chief executive of Evite.She opened a few.But then we asked her why she didnt open all of them.She said, If I open it youre going to make me write a thank you card.Mr. Cho said that in less than two years of the charity option existing, the company would hit $5 million in donations.People can choose from 150,000 registered charities.Its not for everyone in the world, but the idea was if its gift 30 on top of other presents, lets direct that consumer spending to a cause.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Evite and Discovery efforts are supported by Pledgeling, which allows companies to set up charity pages and track their impact.Photo Cause marketing and corporate social responsibility are buzzwords that are web 2.0, said James Citron, chief executive of Pledgeling.The power of impact is to integrate charity into what youre doing and track the key performance indicators.He said Pledgelings strategy is about, What are you actually doing, and tell your customers the impact youre having.The company charges a fee for its service, but generally 97 percent of the money raised goes to the charity.The company also can track what and how the campaign is doing.There is yet another way for companies to have measurable impact.Companies like Warby Parker, which makes eyeglasses, and Toms, the shoe company, are pioneers among so-called give-back companies.Buy a pair of glasses or shoes, and they will give a pair to someone in need.In terms of measuring the impact, the tracking is fairly easy because it is generally one to one.It is simple for the company to do and simple for the individual to understand.Not all companies that want to do this have it so easy.A new subscription yoga clothes company, YogaClub, wanted to incorporate this giveback model.Just one problem: giving fancy yoga clothes to needy children is not the same feel-good story as giving them a pair of shoes so they can walk to school or eyeglasses so they can read and learn.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So the company came up with a different plan.Its box of yoga clothes, which cost from $49 to $79 a shipment,arrive monthly or quarterly like a wine club: You pick the quantity, and the company decides what you get.For every box purchased, YogaClub donates one yoga class to a student from a disadvantaged school in Los Angeles.Since July, the company said it had donated over 163,000 yoga classes to elementary school children in Los Angeles.Its teaching the fundamentals of how you use yoga and meditation to teach the kids how to deal with the stresses in their lives, said Lindsay McClelland, director of partnership and brand experience at the company.It makes our customers feel good, she added.They can see their purchase isnt just getting their two yoga pants.Its having an impact in the community.

BAE awarded $22M contract for work on USS Little Rock, USS Sioux City:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials on Monday announced a new modified deal with BAE Systems for post-shakedown availabilities for the USS Little Rock and USS Sioux City littoral combat ships.The deal is classified as a cost-plus-award fee worth more than $22.4 million to exercise options for post-shakedown availabilities, or PSA.PSA is an industrial term for correcting deficiencies found during the shakedown cruise or to accomplish other authorized improvements.Normally, PSAs occur after delivery and are complete prior to the Navy's deadline for completing Shipbuilding and Conversion work.Work will be performed on the USS Little Rock LCS-9 and USS Sioux City LCS-11 Freedom-class littoral combat ships.The Little Rock was delivered to the Navy in September and is scheduled to be commissioned alongside the original USS Little Rock CLG-4, in Buffalo, N.Y., in December.The Sioux City entered service earlier this year.BAE Systems will contribute all manpower, support services, material, non-standard equipment and associated technical data and documentation required to prepare for and accomplish the PSA, according to the Pentagon.Work on the contract will be performed in Jacksonville, Fla., and is expected to be completed by February 2019.Fiscal 2017 and 2012 shipbuilding and conversion, along with the Navy's fiscal 2017 other procurement funding in the amount of $14.5 million will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
General Atomics awarded $8.8M contract for low power laser demonstrator:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- The Department of Defense on Monday announced a new contract with General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems Group for the Low Power Laser Demonstrator Phase 1 effort.The deal, worth more than $8.8 million, is a competitive cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that will enable General Atomics to perform the "next step" for the development of the LPLD that addresses "laser power and aperture size by integrating and testing a low power laser on an unmanned aerial vehicle," the Pentagon said in a news release In June, the Missile Defense Agency started looking into acquiring and deploying a laser-armed drone to intercept and shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles.The MDA Advanced Technology Directorate has said it needs a high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle with sufficient payload capacity to carry a high-energy laser.It would be designed to intercept ICBMs during their boost phase.It has not ruled out a manned platform as well.Work on the contract will be performed in San Diego, Calif., and Poway, Calif., with an estimated completion date of July 31, 2018.Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and engineering funds in the amount of $2 million have been obligated at the time of award.
Raytheon receives $17M contract for missile targeting system:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced on Monday a contract deal between the U.S. Air Force and Raytheon for High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile Targeting System contractor logistics support and services.The deal is a modified contract worth more than $17 million, and calls for repairs and sustainment of the High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile Targeting System pod.The work will be performed in Tucson, Ariz., with an estimated completion date of November 2018, the Department of Defense said.Fiscal year 2018 operations and maintenance funds in the amount of $12.8 million was obligated to Raytheon at the time of award.Similarly, the U.S. Navy announced in October an award modification worth more than $18.2 million to convert high-speed, anti-radiation missiles into advanced medium-range air-to-ground guided missiles with counter-enemy shutdown capability for the Italian government.The October deal between the Pentagon and Orbital ATK Inc. included related supplies and services to manufacture and deploy the products to the government of Italy.The main difference between the AGM-88E HARM and the new AGM-88E AARGM is that the AARGM has an advanced guidance section and control abilities that use a multi-mode seeker to counter enemy shut-down capability.Additionally, the AARGM has an onboard Weapons Impact Assessment subsystem that supports battlefield commanders in conducting after-action battle damage assessments.The missile can relay impact assessment data prior to the impact on target.
Oil prices inch lower after Monday's massive rally:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Crude oil prices lingered slightly in negative territory in early Tuesday trading after OPEC said it saw demand increasing, but some deceleration ahead.Economists at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries painted a mixed picture on long-term trends in the energy market, but noted some of the shift is coming from an Asian pivot for economic growth.Short-term demand for oil, through 2022, was revised higher by 2.24 million barrels per day, compared with the organization's World Oil Outlook from last year."Global oil demand growth is forecast to decelerate steadily to a level of only 300,000 barrels per day every year between 2035 and 2040," the report added.Crude oil prices were relatively muted in early Tuesday trading.A rally Monday was triggered by lingering geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East.Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon are intensifying, and Riyadh is in the midst of a major crackdown that has spooked some investors.The price for Brent crude oil was down 0.28 percent to $64.09 per barrel as of 9:20 a.m. EST.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was down 0.17 percent to $57.25 per barrel.OPEC economists said they lowered their long-term forecast in part because of an expected decline in the global economy, structural shifts and "fuel switching, particularly in the road transportation sector."The fuel switching reflects trends toward electric and alternative vehicles, which still make up for a small fraction of the global transportation fleet.OPEC economists said alternative-fuel vehicles made up about 2 percent of the market last year and will increase to 16 percent by 2040.Through 2022, demand accelerates, but the pace of growth wanes as the decade draws to an end."It should be noted that global annual demand growth decelerates from 1.45 million barrels per day in 2017 to 810,000 barrels per day in 2022, as expected higher oil prices, efficiency improvements, lower population growth rates in the OECD and China, and the further penetration of alternative fuel vehicles limit growth potential," economists said.Traders may be erring on the side of caution and taking a short-term approach to the market ahead of data on U.S. oil and gasoline inventories.A survey of analysts from commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts found crude oil stocks may decline in the United States by another 2.7 million barrels, while gasoline stocks could drop 2.25 million barrels."If confirmed, it would mark the sixth draw in the last seven weeks, and further narrow the surplus to the five-year average, which equaled 14.6 percent in the week ended October 27, down from 25 percent in mid-September," the emailed market report read.The surplus matters for OPEC, which is working to drain the excess with managed production declines.Ministers are widely expected to call for an extension of an agreement to trim output through the end of 2018, though recent geopolitical tensions could make reaching a comprehensive decision complicated.
Lockheed contracted to modernize P-3B aircraft for Greece:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $260 million contract to modernize and upgrade four P-3B Orion aircraft for the government of Greece, the Department of Defense announced on Monday.Work on the aircraft -- structural mid-life upgrades, tailored phased depot maintenance, a country-specific designed mission integration and management system and new avionics -- is expected to extend the life of the aircraft by 15,000 flight hours each.More than 400 P-3B Orions are in service with 17 countries, providing air, surface and subsurface patrol and surveillance.Among the aircraft's missions are submarine hunting, targeting of strike points, relaying real-time video, scouting ahead to warn of possible dangers, and performing a range of missions against drug smuggling, pirates, illegal immigration and terrorism.The P-3B upgrade program involves the replacement of wing sections and improves the airframe to allow for the additional flight hours and takes about 11 months to install, according to Lockheed.Work on the four aircraft for Greece will mostly be conducted in Marietta, Ga., and Schimatari, Greece, with the rest spread among locations in Canada, Greece, Israel and the United States.Foreign military sales funds in the amount of $59 million has been obligated with the contract award, and work on the contract is expected to be completed by December 2023.
An Iranian benchmark for oil just topped $60 per barrel:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- After boasting of unprecedented economic growth, Iranian state media said the situation has improved after its benchmark for oil passed $60 per barrel.Iran Heavy crude breached $60 per barrel in early Tuesday trading, trading relatively on par with the basket of crude oil grades for OPEC members.Iran's benchmark was trading at a discount of about $1 per barrel against the Dubai benchmark, but about $3 per barrel more than the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate.The official Islamic Republic News Agency said oil prices are accelerating because of regional crises and the looming threat of violence in Nigeria."Iran's oil production is about 3.9 million barrels a day, including the 2.2 million barrels exported," the report read.The state-run National Iranian South Oil.Co, which accounts for about 80 percent of total Iranian oil production, said this week its total crude oil production is up more than 1 million barrels per day from last year.Sanctions on Iran before the landmark nuclear agreement in 2015 left the economy under pressure.IRNA said its heavy crude was around $45 per barrel in 2014, but hit the mid-$20 range when oil markets collapsed early last year.According to a country profile from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Iran's oil export grades, both heavy and light, were displaced under sanctions pressure by similar grades from follow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.EIA noted that Asian economies were the primary buyers of Iranian crude oil.The discount for WTI compared with rival grades, meanwhile, makes U.S. oil more competitive in the region.In October, the Central Bank of Iran told the representatives from the International Monetary Fund that a "new picture" of economic growth was emerging in the post-sanctions era."[The] Iranian economy experienced an unprecedented growth last year," Akbar Komijani, the bank's deputy governor said in a statement."Single-digit inflation and relative stability in the foreign exchange market testify to its potentials and predictability."
Oklahoma still scrambling with budget despite oil price trends:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- After a downgrade on its credit rating, Oklahoma's governor urged House leaders to move quickly to pass a measure meant to close a looming budget gap.House leaders in Oklahoma said last week they were leading the way in working in bipartisan fashion to address lingering budget strains.Though rich in oil and gas, the state's governor said looming pressures were addressed with only short-term solutions."I have warned lawmakers for the past three years that we need to address our budget's structural deficits instead of continuing to kick the can down the road by depleting available cash and using one-time funds," Gov.Mary Fallin said in a statement.Oklahoma is one of the most significant producers of crude oil in the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the nation's total.It hosts some of the largest deposits of shale oil and gas in the country and the trading hub in Cushing is considered the most significant entity of its kind in North America.Shale states like Oklahoma faced economic hardships last year because the low price of oil made it expensive to work in the cost-intensive basins in the state.Fallin in December said a decision by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit production was welcome news for her state.The OPEC move, which could last into 2018, helped support higher crude oil prices.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, hit its highest level in more than two years in Monday trading and is up nearly 10 percent since the start of the year.Still, Moody's Investors Service said Monday it issued a "credit-negative" rating to Oklahoma because of its inability to find lasting budget solutions.After six weeks in special session, the state Senate moved in favor of a budget measure, but the governor said "we will still have a budget hole" next year.The bill, which now heads back to the state House, would double the tax rate on oil and gas production at new wells, impose higher motor fuel taxes and introduce a new sin tax on cigarettes.Taxes on oil and gas production generated $52 million in October, a jump of 48.4 percent from last year.Compared with September, however, tax collections from oil and gas grew just 3.7 percent.
Norway's economy facing petroleum-related headwinds:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Norway, one of the largest oil and gas producers in the world, said the output from petroleum-related manufacturing turned lower in the third quarter."Norwegian manufacturing output went down 0.7 per cent from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2017, according to seasonally-adjusted figures," the government's statistics office reported Tuesday."Petroleum-related manufacturing contributed most to pull down the overall activity level, while food products contributed to dampen the decline."For the year ending in August, the government said total manufacturing output grew 0.2 percent, compared with a 4.4 percent gain over the same period in the European Union.Norge Bank, the nation's central bank, said earlier this year that oil and gas production for Norway peaked more than a decade ago, though the sector as a whole may have been underestimated.The bank in October said the Norwegian economy was struggling to pick up the pace, with inflation expected to stay below 2.5 percent over the next few years.Though the labor market is gaining strength, the value of the currency, the krone, is weaker than expected and the bank kept its key policy rate at 0.5 percent.The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the nation's energy regulator, reported lower sales and lower production, based on preliminary data for September.Preliminary data show oil production was 1.44 million barrels of oil per day, which was about 11 percent lower than expected.Statistics Norway said Tuesday that a production index covering extraction, mining, manufacturing and electricity supply posted a small gain of 0.8 percent in the third quarter."The growth is particularly due to a strong increase of 10.4 per cent within extraction of natural gas," the report read."Extraction of crude petroleum, on the other hand, fell by 5.6 percent."In its report from September, the central bank said growth in gross domestic product for the first half of the year was around 0.7 percent, but a slowdown was expected in the second half.Investments in petroleum, meanwhile, may bottom out this year.Norway is important to the European economy as an exporting nation.Nearly all of the oil and gas produced from Norwegian waters heads to the EU.
Tight markets, demand spike mean higher gas prices:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Unseasonably high demand pressures from U.S. consumers and a tightening oil market means higher gas prices, but the trend might not last, market analysts said.Federal estimates for gasoline demand hit a level last week not seen since October 2006.Jeanette Casselano, a spokeswoman for motor club AAA, said the demand strains came in part because of warmer weather this close to winter, when demand usually plummets."As consumers fill up their tanks more frequently, we are seeing supply levels tighten and gas prices increase," she said in a statement."However, we don't expect this increase to be long-term."AAA reports a national average retail price for gasoline at $2.53 per gallon for Tuesday, up about 3 percent from last week and 14 percent, or 32 cents per gallon, more than on this date last year.Last week, the federal government said gasoline inventories were at a seven-week low.Refineries were also producing less gasoline last week.Meanwhile, consumers in the Great Lakes region, usually one of the more expensive and most volatile markets, faced additional strains because of a leak on the 1,800-mile Explorer Pipeline, which sends consumer fuels from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest.Patrick DeHaan, a senior market analyst at GasBuddy, said repairs on the line were made last week, though it make take some time before consumers see some relief.AAA said four of the states in the region were among the most expensive in the country, with Illinois taking top honors with a state average price of $2.78 per gallon.Illinois gas prices are more than 25 percent higher than on this date last year.The West Coast market, typically the most expensive in the country, saw prices spike because of new taxes on gasoline.California added another 12 cents per gallon to fuel taxes, and the average price there is by far the highest in the Lower 48 at $3.21 per gallon.The overall U.S. market for oil and gasoline is getting tighter, suggesting gasoline prices in the low $2 range may be a thing of the past.Commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts said it expects U.S. exports will be around 7.7 million barrels per day, while imports will be closer to 7.5 million bpd.Gasoline inventories, meanwhile, continue to tighten and Platts said there's about a 1 percent surplus left based on the five-year average.
House takes up offshore drilling overhaul:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- As leaders in the U.S. House take up an offshore drilling bill, pressure has mounted on the U.S. government's lack of oversight for protection of public lands.The Accessing Strategic Resources Offshore Act, or ASTRO, would limit the presidential authority to put parts of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to oil and gas drillers and give the Interior Department the authority to move ahead with new lease sales "as soon as practicable," but no later than a year after the announcement of intent.House leaders scheduled a markup hearing on the measure for Wednesday.Miyoko Sakshita, the oceans project director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the ASTRO Act was a giveaway to the oil and gas industry."Bishop's bill is a truly shocking attack on our government's ability to protect America's public lands and oceans from dangerous drilling," she said in a statement.Rep.Rob Bishop, R-Utah, is the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which is reviewing the bill.The majority of Bishop's fundraising comes from the oil and gas industry.In his support of the bill, the chairman said the ASTRO Act would "make the U.S. energy dominant."The American Petroleum Institute estimates the oil and gas industry has added $1.3 trillion to the U.S. economy since 2015.Supporters of the measure said opening up more areas to drillers could create more than 800,000 new jobs and generate $200 billion in revenue.The federal government estimates about 90 billion barrels of oil have yet to be discovered in U.S. territorial waters.Energy policies under President Donald Trump have been decidedly pro-oil.His Interior Department, meanwhile, has moved to shrink national monuments and recently backed out of a transparency initiative meant to monitor oil and gas revenue.Apart from expanding access to drillers, the ASTRO Act would recombine the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management with the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which former BOEM Director Michael Bromwich said was "a profoundly bad idea."The BSEE was set up in response to failures with the former federal Minerals Management Service in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
Alberta's leader tours in support of Trans Mountain oil pipeline:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Support for the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia is support for the economy, the premier of oil-rich Alberta said.Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is touring the country in support of pipeline company Kinder Morgan's multibillion dollar expansion project, heading first to Toronto before taking her message to Vancouver.Canada is the fourth largest producer of oil and natural gas liquid in the world, but export capacity is constricted because pipeline capacity hasn't kept pace with production.Nearly all of Canada's oil exports head to the United States.The country's National Energy Board approved of Kinder Morgan's plans to triple the capacity of the network to around 890,000 barrels of oil per day in late 2016, though vetting is still under way for some aspects.The project is part of a national effort to tap into markets outside North America.Notley's office said the expansion project would create more than 50,000 new construction and operational jobs each year, but continues to face stiff opposition, especially in western Canada."Pipelines are just as critical for jobs and economies across the country as they are for Alberta, and to stifle the oil and gas industry would be economically negligent," she said in a statement.The regulatory National Energy Board in early September said it was satisfied with the environmental plans outlined by Kinder Morgan to expand a port in British Columbia to handle the new volumes from Trans Mountain.The project, however, continues to face stiff opposition from western Canadian leaders and members of the aboriginal community.When Kinder Morgan cleared project hurdles in late 2016, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said it was a "big step backward" for the environment and the economy.Last month, he said Vancouver was on pace to become powered entirely by renewable energy by 2050.Alberta's economy, meanwhile, bottomed out in the middle of 2016 after it was hammered by the dual strains from lower crude oil prices and wildfires that swept through the heart of the provincial oil sector.With markets improving, its government expects growth in terms of gross domestic product for 2017 at 3.1 percent, up from the budget forecast of 2.65 percent.Notley was on hand for a September ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the start of a $1.6 billion (USD) expansion project led by Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd.The project, one of the largest investments in Alberta in 40 years, is meant to improve oil production from the current rate of 1,000 barrels per day to 20,000 bpd by the middle of next year.
Lockheed contracted to develop airborne laser capability:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- A new contract that seems to be ripped from Star Wars calls for Lockheed Martin to design, develop and produce a high-power fiber laser for the U.S. Air Force Research Lab.The $26.3 million dollar contract, announced by Lockheed on Monday, calls for the laser to be mounted on a tactical fighter jet by 2021 and is part of the U.S. Air Force's Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator, or SHiELD, program."Lockheed Martin continues to rapidly advance laser weapon systems and the technologies that make them possible," said Dr.Rob Afzal, senior fellow of laser weapon systems at Lockheed Martin."We have demonstrated our ability to use directed energy to counter threats from the ground, and look forward to future tests from the air as part of the SHiELD system."The SHiELD program is comprised of three subsystems -- the beam control system, which directs the laser onto the target, is being designed by Northrop Grumman; a pod mounted on a tactical jet to power and cool the laser, which is being designed by Boeing; and the high energy laser itself, which is being developed by Lockheed."Earlier this year, we delivered a 60 kW-class laser to be installed on a U.S. Army ground vehicle.It's a completely new and different challenge to get a laser system into a smaller, airborne test platform.It's exciting to see this technology mature enough to embed in an aircraft," said Afzal."The development of high power laser systems like SHiELD show laser weapon system technologies are becoming real.The technologies are ready to be produced, tested and deployed on aircraft, ground vehicles and ships."The laser, which must be compact and highly efficient, also must work within "challenging" size, weight and power limits, is expected to be tested on a fighter aircraft by 2021, the Lockheed said.
General Electric receives $84M for Blackhawk, Apache engine overhauls:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- The Department of Defense has announced a new deal with General Electric for the overhaul and recapitalization of the T700 series of engine in support of Blackhawk and Apache helicopters.The deal is classified as a firm-fixed-price contract worth $84 million.In December 2016, GE was awarded an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract worth an estimated $1 billion for as many as 2,500 T700 engines.to support all four branches of the U.S. military, including the U.S. Coast Guard and foreign military sales, through 2019.Vice President and General Manager of GE Aviation's turboshaft and turboprop engines Harry Nahatis said in April that, "By consistently investing in upgrades that infuse GE's most advanced commercial and military technologies, GE's T700 has evolved through the years to meet or exceed our customers' performance expectations across a range of operating environments around the globe."The T700 engines were developed for the U.S. Army to overcome the many shortcomings of the 1960s-era helicopter engines used in Southeast Asia.The completion date for overhauls and upgrades is scheduled for November 2020.
Raytheon awarded $260M contract for Tomahawk missiles:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Raytheon Co., has been awarded $260 million for the procurement of 196 Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles in support of U.S. Navy operations and England.Pentagon officials announced the contract award late Friday, which modifies a December 2016 contract worth $303 million, which was for the procurement of 214 Tomahawk cruise missiles.The Tomahawk Block IV all-up-round vertical launch system missiles can be launched from surface naval ships or submerged submarines and can fly into heavily defended airspace more than 1,000 miles away and fly for hours, shift course on command and send a picture of the target back to the Joint Terminal Attack Controllers halfway around the world -- before striking with "pinpoint accuracy," according to Raytheon.Raytheon says that the modern day Tomahawks have been used in combat more than 2,000 times and flight-tested more than 500 times."In April 2017, U.S. Navy destroyers launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at targets on a Syrian air base," Raytheon said in a press statement."In 2014, a U.S. Navy destroyer and a guided missile cruiser launched 47 Tomahawk missiles in a strike on the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria."Work on the Tomahawks will occur across the country with more than 23 percent of the project taking place in Tucson, Ariz. Work under the contract is expected to be completed in Aug. 2019, with Navy fiscal years 2017 and 2018 funds obligated for the contract at the time of award.The Navy will be picking up the majority of the tab -- about $256 million -- with Britain shelling out $3.6 million.
Saudi crackdown adds jitter premium to oil prices:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Crude oil prices extended deeper into record territory on Monday as bullish sentiments set in and nerves rattled over a corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia."Oil bulls are alive and kicking," Tamas Varga, an analyst at London broker PVM, said in an emailed market fundamentals report.Oil prices have rallied for most of the third quarter on signs that an effort led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to balance an oversupplied market with production cuts is working.Though balanced somewhat by strong U.S. oil production, higher crude oil prices have been supported by signs that OPEC members will extend their agreement deep into 2018.An anti-corruption committee in Saudi Arabia detained four ministers and 11 princes as part of a widespread crackdown by royal order, adding to a sense of unease on the broader market."This is part of an overhaul to ensure transparency, openness and good governance," the government said in a weekend statement.David Ottaway, a Middle East Fellow at The Wilson Center, said in a weekend statement emailed to UPI that the move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could make investors nervous about the so-called Vision 2030, which aims to draw more out of the non-oil private sector in Saudi Arabia.That could be telling as ministers from OPEC sit down later this month to discuss the fate of their multilateral production deal, which helped pull oil prices from last year's historic lows.The price for Brent crude oil was up 0.53 percent at 9:10 a.m. EST to $62.40 per barrel, pushing deeper past a record last set in July 2015.The price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.38 percent to $55.85 per barrel.The spread, or difference, between Brent and WTI makes U.S. oil competitive in some foreign markets.Slight declines in U.S. oil production, but historically record-setting exports, are making for a tighter domestic situation, giving some additional support to crude oil prices.Vandana Hari, a market analyst and founder of Vanda Insights, said in a weekend report emailed to UPI that a slight dip in U.S. production, OPEC discipline and a steady rise in global demand means the floor price for Brent crude oil is probably now around $55 per barrel.If OPEC ministers delay or dilute a decision on the production cuts, that could reignite oversupply fears and shave as much as $5 per barrel off the price for Brent crude oil, she said.
Norway's big oil field, Johan Sverdrup, progressing as planned:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Only relatively minor issues were found in an assessment of operations planned for the Johan Sverdrup oil field, one of Norway's largest, a regulator said.The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway published results from an October audit of Statoil's plans for an export pipeline from the Johan Sverdrup field.The PSA said no regulatory issues were uncovered."We observed three areas with potential for improvement," it said in a statement."These are document handling, fabrication and technical issues relating to the delivery and long-term testing of polymers."Johan Sverdrup is one of Norway's five largest offshore oil fields, and contains an estimated 3 billion barrels of oil.Phase 1 of the field's development is currently underway, with the first deliveries expected to begin in late 2019.At peak capacity, the field should account for up to 25 percent of total Norwegian petroleum production.Contracts worth more than $5.7 billion have been awarded for the project so far and most of those have gone to companies in Norway.Norway is an important oil and natural gas exporter to the European economy, sending nearly all of its offshore production to the regional market.Statoil, which is partially owned by the government, reported adjusted earnings after tax for the third quarter at $2.3 billion, more than double the amount from the same period last year.President and CEO Eldar Stre said that, even as the price of oil during the quarter stayed near $50 per barrel, his company was still generating positive cash flow.Norge Bank, the country's central bank, said in late October the economy was struggling to pick up the pace, with inflation expected to stay below 2.5 percent over the next few years.Though the labor market is gaining strength, the value of the currency, the krone, is weaker than expected and the bank said it was keeping its key policy rate at 0.5 percent.
Iran boasts of oil production gains since last year:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- A state-run oil company in Iran, one of OPEC's largest producers, said its total crude oil production is up more than 1 million barrels per day from last year.The National Iranian South Oil Co., which accounts for about 80 percent of total Iranian oil production, said it supplied 2.9 million barrels of oil per day during the first half of the Iranian calendar year, which starts March 21.According to SHANA, total Iranian crude oil production is up more than 1 million barrels per day from last year.Abdolreza Dabiri, the director of production at the NISOC, said the gains were made possible by easing international sanctions and a stronger focus on domestic capabilities, as well as a skilled workforce at home.Economists at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said total member state production in September, the last full month for which data are available, was 32.75 million barrels per day, an increase of 88,000 barrels per day from the previous month.Most of September's growth came from Libya, Nigeria, Iraq and Gabon.Production from Iran, the third-largest producer behind Iraq, was 3.8 million barrels per day last month.That's about 300,000 barrels per day above last year's average, but close to 1 million barrels per day more than 2015.The differences in calendar years may explain some of the discrepancy.Iran's production claims are important because OPEC ministers are scheduled in Vienna later this month to consider the fate of a production agreement aimed at drawing on the surplus in the global average of crude oil inventories.Iranian Energy Minister Bijan Zangeneh in September said some producers were "prepared for any measure aimed at ensuring oil market stability."His comments echo sentiments expressed by Saudi Arabia in the middle of August.Officials from Riyadh said in a joint statement with Iraq it was keeping its "whatever it takes" stance on the effort to trim production until the markets reach a target level that would indicate balance.Zangeneh said late last year, however, that most deals managed by OPEC had fallen short of design, adding there were no guarantees the production agreement would be enforced.
U.S. withdrawal from energy transparency group called strategic:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Leaving a transparency initiative on fossil fuels was a mistake, advocates said, but Washington and a former Trump associate said the decision was strategic.The U.S.Interior Department last week withdrew from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a body that seeks to find how revenue tied to the oil, gas and mineral resources sectors makes its way through member-state governments and economies.In its letter of withdrawal, the department said it supports transparency mechanisms in principle, but had its own reporting standards that were the "new global standard in revenue governance transparency."Because EITI standards do not account for the U.S. legal framework, it was leaving the organization as an implementing country.The U.S. government endorsed the EITI in 2004 and committed to its standards in 2011.When the EITI boards approved the U.S. application in 2014, it became the first member of the Group of 8 industrialized nations to achieve candidacy.EITI Chairman Fredrik Reinfeldt said in a statement after the withdrawal notification that it was a step backward for the United States."Our work supports efforts to combat transnational crime and terrorist financing," he said."It's important that resource-rich countries like the United States lead by example."U.S. momentum as an oil and gas producer accelerated under former President Barack Obama.President Donald Trump has put fossil fuels at the top of his energy policies.Though Obama ended a ban on crude oil exports, the amount of U.S. oil leaving domestic shores has accelerated exponentially since Trump took office.Republican leaders who support Trump's energy strategy have said steps taken since Ryan Zinke became the secretary of the Interior have positioned the United States as "an energy dominant superpower."The four-week moving average for total U.S. oil production for the week ending Oct. 27 was 9.2 million barrels per day, up nearly 9 percent from the same period last year.U.S. crude oil exports for the same period are up 300 percent from last year.U.S. crude oil is competitive in Asia with the type of oil exported by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.Natural gas, in the form of a super-cooled liquid form, and coal have made their way to the ports of former Soviet republics during the Trump administration, to the frustration of the Kremlin.Healy E. Baumgardner, a global fossil fuel adviser at The 45 Group, former Trump campaign spokeswoman and the former press secretary for the Energy Department under President George W. Bush, told UPI the candidacy to EITI was short-sighted."Fossil fuels are critical to national security and energy independence, and pulling out of EITI smartly supports their expansion, competitiveness and ability to foster job growth and U.S. energy dominance at home and abroad," she said.Canada, the No.1 oil exporter to the United States, is not an EITI member, nor are most major OPEC members.The U.S. decision to leave EITI came two days before the release of the so-called Paradise Papers.The more than 13 million records, leaked by Bermuda-based law firm Appleby to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, allege to expose ties between world leaders and corporate giants.For the United States, the documents appear to show links between Trump Cabinet officials, donors and advisers, and offshore interests ranging from the Kremlin to foreign oil.The documents show Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross retains an interest in a shipping company, Navigator Holdings, which has business ties to Sibur, a Russian energy firm controlled by Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch subject to U.S. sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and other members of the Russian president's inner circle.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, documents show, was tied to Yemeni oil and gas interests, which later became the subject of dispute in the international courts."The opacity of this administration goes beyond energy policy," Stefanie Ostfeld, the deputy head of the U.S. office of Global Witness, told UPI."You can draw a direct line from the president and Secretary Tillerson refusing to release their tax returns to Exxon and Chevron refusing to declare their U.S. tax payments though EITI, which led the administration to pull out of a global anti-corruption program for oil and gas companies."Andrew Holland, a senior fellow for energy and climate at the American Security Project, added that U.S. oil companies are some of the best in the world and shouldn't have to "bribe their way" toward contracts.The EITI move, as well as similar actions, sets the industry up to look corrupt, he said.In its letter last week, the U.S.Interior Department said participating in EITI helped the government initiate open data on natural resources and their revenue streams.Despite leaving the initiative, the government said it was a strong supporter of good governance."While in concept preventing corruption in global fossil fuels is admirable, they are what determine power, politically and physically, across the globe," Baumgardner said.
Shale-rich Oklahoma sees economic gains:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- October tax receipts for shale-rich Oklahoma are up more than 10 percent from last year, though most of the recent gains came from vehicle taxes, data show.The Oklahoma State Treasury said October receipts of $980.2 million were up 10.6 percent from last year, marking the first time in more than four years that monthly receipts grew by more than 10 percent."Such strong revenue growth is encouraging, with all four major revenue sources in positive territory," State Treasurer Ken Miller said in a statement.Tax receipts come as the state works to close a budget gap.Oklahoma Gov.Mary Fallin called lawmakers to a special session in late September to address budget strains she said were critical.By her estimate, the state could face a $500 million shortfall next year because one-time funds were used to balance the books for the current fiscal year.Miller's office said almost $18 million in gross receipts last month came from new legislation.About 65 percent of the new revenue came from a 1.25 percent state sales tax on motor vehicles, while a $5 vehicle registration added $1.9 million."The amount of new revenue gained during the month by boosting the 1 percent horizontal drilling gross production tax rate to 4 percent is not yet available from the tax commission," Miller's office reported.Horizontal drilling is related to the energy sector.Taxes on oil and gas production generated $52 million in October, a jump of 48.4 percent from last year.Compared with September, however, tax collections from oil and gas grew just 3.7 percent.Oklahoma is home to about 4 percent of the total petroleum reserves in the country and accounts for as much as 5 percent of the total crude oil production.The state sits on the Anadarko shale reservoir.The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts oil production there will increase about 2 percent and gas production by about 0.6 percent from October.Drilling services company Baker Hughes last week reported exploration and production activity is slowing down.State data were released Friday.
Russia reaches Turkish waters with gas pipeline:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Construction for a pipeline slated to bring Russian gas through Turkish territory moved into official Turkish waters, Russian media reported.Russian news agency Tass reported construction vessel Pioneering Spring moved into the Turkish exclusive economic zone to lay sections of the so-called Turkish Stream pipeline during the weekend."The Pioneering Spirit laid one line to the [exclusive economic zone] border, and then returned to Anapa (Russia) to begin the deep-water laying of the second line," the report read.Russian energy company Gazprom said construction of a pipeline known variably as TurkStream or Turkish Stream started in May The pipeline's route would mirror the now-abandoned South Stream project and run under the Black Sea to Turkey and then to the European market.South Stream was scrapped because of concerns about Russian business practices expressed by some European countries.Turkey, meanwhile, aims to capitalize on its geographic position by becoming an energy bridge between Central Asian and Middle East suppliers and the European market.In September, the Central Bank of Turkey said gross domestic product grew 5.1 percent annually and 2.1 percent during the second quarter.Inflation rose 1.2 percent in August to 11 percent, driven by higher prices for durable goods and a slide in the value of the Turkish currency against the euro.Energy prices in Turkey increased by 2 percent because of gains in the oil market and annual energy inflation was 10.5 percent.Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said core growth has been higher than 5 percent for more than a decade, even as the country faces internal political and external security pressures.He highlighted trade with its European and Middle East neighbors as a critical component of economic success, adding Istanbul could be turning into a global financial center.For Russia, the link through Turkey is part of its growing ambition to add diversity to export arteries to the European market.Most of Russia's gas to Europe runs through Soviet-era pipelines in Ukraine, where geopolitical issues add a layer of risk.Gas could flow through the pipeline by late 2019.
Pakistan gets lift from new gas production:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Austrian energy company OMV said it started producing gas for Pakistan, years after the initial discovery and as the country copes with chronic energy issues.OMV, which its working alongside private and state-backed Pakistani energy companies, said it started producing gas from the Sofiya field, four years after the initial discovery."The Sofiya-2 well was successfully commissioned without any incident," the company stated.The well can produce as much as 15 million cubic feet of gas and 1,400 barrels of an ultra-light petroleum production called condensate per day.With about 27 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, Pakistan has enough on hand to address demand for about 20 years.Pakistan consumes most of the natural gas it produces and the country has faced power issues because of aging infrastructure.According to the Asian Development Bank, Pakistan's power sector has a gap between supply and demand of about 5,000 megawatts, which has put significant pressure on the prospects for economic growth.The ADB described the status of the energy sector in Pakistan as "crippling."Pipelines slated for future development may help address shortages, though many of those projects depend in part on Iran or Afghanistan, where geopolitical issues may inhibit development.The International Monetary Fund said regional growth is expected to slow down in part because of the spillover from the lack of oil exports from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.Regional growth last year was around 5 percent, expected to be about 2.6 percent this year and pick up to 3.3 percent in 2018.
State Department approves $1.1B contract for support of Qatari F-15QA aircraft:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- The State Department announced Wednesday a possible foreign military sale of F-15QA multi-role fighter aircraft program support services to Qatar for a total estimated cost of $1.1 billion.State Department officials said that the potential foreign military sale supports the "foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States," as "Qatar is an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Persian Gulf region."The $1.1 billion dollar contract is for multiple construction services, cybersecurity and force protection infrastructure in support of Qatar's McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle fleet.Ten U.S. government civilians will also work directly with Qatar to support construction, cybersecurity and force protection efforts there.The State Department anticipates that the contractor footprint for this effort is approximately 15 to 50 personnel, which may vary based on phases of construction and establishment of required services, according to a State Department press statement.
Swedish army to buy BONUS ammunition from BAE:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- A new contract awarded to BAE Systems calls for the delivery of 254 additional Bofors 155mm BONUS artillery rounds for the Swedish army, the company announced on Thursday.The additional artillery rounds are expected to strengthen Sweden's operational capabilities for its long range, indirect fire Archer artillery weapon systems.The Bofors 155mm BONUS artillery rounds are capable of detecting and striking heavily armored vehicles at a range slightly over 21 miles.When launched from any 155-millimeter artillery system, the BONUS carrier shell separates to deploy two sensor-fuzed munitions that then search for targets within a given footprint of up to 32,000 square meters.Each of the two expelled munitions independently seeks and neutralizes its own target.The army has used this smart munition since 2003."Because each BONUS shell carries two smart munitions, its mission success per round is far greater than with traditional ammunition, providing the Swedish army with clear advantages," Lena Gillstrm, managing director for BAE Systems' Weapon Systems business in Sweden, said in a press release."This order is part of a growing interest in BONUS around the globe and indicative of the system's reliability and success factor."Production on the contract will take place at BAE Systems' facility in Karlskoga, Sweden, and delivery is scheduled for sometime in 2019.
Decent labor figures, Nigerian oil threats, boost oil prices:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- Steady improvements in the U.S. labor market, coupled with militant threats against a major OPEC producer, helped support a soft rally in oil prices Friday.The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that total non-farm payrolls jumped 261,000 last month, with food services and restaurant employment offsetting any of the declines that came as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.That beats the estimate early this week from payroll processor ADP, which reported private-sector employment increased by 235,000 from September to October The federal government added that those employed part-time because of economic reasons declined by 369,000 in October, another indication of post-hurricane resilience.More jobs means growing demand for energy products, something traders are watching for in oil and consumer fuels.U.S. levels of oil and gasoline held in storage have been on a steady decline for most of the quarter, indicating demand is drawing somewhat on the surplus for the five-year average for global crude oil inventories.After a wobbly session Thursday, crude oil prices returned to a rally that's extended for nearly a month.The price for Brent crude oil was up 0.58 percent at 9:20 a.m. EDT to $60.97 per barrel.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.4 percent to $54.76 per barrel.Gains were supported elsewhere by a return to action from the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group that last year claimed several attacks on infrastructure in the oil-rich Niger Delta."Our next line of operation will not be like the 2016 campaign which we operated successfully without any casualties," spokesman Murdoch Agbinibo said in a statement."This outing will be brutish, brutal and bloody."Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but is exempt from the OPEC-led effort to balance the oversupplied market with coordinated production cuts.The Nigerian government lobbied for an exemption so it could steer oil revenue toward national security efforts.Nigeria's stance on the agreement matters as OPEC-ministers will consider extending the production agreement deep into 2018 during meetings later this month in Vienna.Elsewhere, U.S. labor figures may paint a mixed picture on economic momentum.Restaurant workers made up the bulk of the job gains, with industries like construction and mining showing little change in October.The average workweek for all sectors remains relatively unchanged, though those in the manufacturing sector were logging more in overtime.Wages, however, slipped in October by 1 cent per hour, after rising 12 cents in September.
Raytheon awarded $22.1M for Next Generation Jammer support:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- The Department of Defense on Thursday announced that Raytheon Co. has been awarded a $22.1 million contract for hardware and software requirements to support the Navy's Next Generation Jammer.The products provided by Raytheon will be installed on the Ground Power and Cooling System in support of the Next Generation Jammer.The modification was selected by the U.S. Navy in 2013 to replace the more than 40-year-old ALQ-99 jammer systems on the Boeing EA-18G Growler, an aircraft specifically designed for electronic warfare.In 2016, the U.S. Navy awarded Raytheon a $1 billion contract to develop and manufacture the Next Generation Jammer, according to Raytheon and Defense Department records.The Ground Power and Cooling System consists of "software changes to the pod operational flight program along with the following hardware; five ground power carts, five ground power kits, five ground cooling carts, five ground cooling kits, 12 common electronic unit connector kits, and four test access module kits," the Department of Defense said.Over 95 percent of the contract work will be performed in El Segundo, Calif., and is expected to be completed in December 2019.No funds are being obligated to Raytheon at time of award.
Trump administration opens door for states to impose Medicaid work requirements:::::States will soon be allowed to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, a major change in how the government health insurance program operates.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will start approving state proposals that "promote community engagement activities," Seema Verma, the agency's head, said Tuesday.This includes requiring able-bodied enrollees to work, volunteer, go to school or enter a job training program in order to qualify for benefits."One of the things that states have told us time and time again is that they want more flexibility to engage their working-age, able-bodied citizens on Medicaid," Verma told a conference of state Medicaid directors."They want to develop programs that will help them break the chains of poverty and live up to their fullest potential.We support this."Republicans have long wanted to add work requirements to the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 75 million low-income children, adults, elderly and disabled Americans.The broadening of Medicaid to able-bodied, working age adults under Obamacare -- roughly 11 million have gained coverage under the health reform law's Medicaid expansion provision -- further spurred GOP efforts.Related: Most Republicans in the U.S. like Medicaid.Who knew?States can currently seek waivers to make some changes to the Medicaid program.However, the Obama administration did not approve any state requests to impose work mandates.That will change under the Trump administration, said Verma, who penned a letter to state officials in March encouraging them to submit waiver applications that include work requirements."Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration," Verma said Tuesday."Those days are over."Eight states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Utah and Wisconsin -- have submitted waivers to CMS that include work-related provisions, according to Manatt Health, a consulting firm.Verma served as a Medicaid consultant for Indiana and Kentucky before joining the Trump administration.Related: Medicaid covers a lot more people than you might think While Republicans believe adding work requirements will help Medicaid recipients become independent, critics fear that it will strip away benefits from people in need.Having access to health care can help low-income adults get and keep jobs, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt.Taking away their access to coverage "is too high a price to pay," she said.Many Medicaid recipients already work.Nearly 60% of non-disabled, working-age adults have jobs, while nearly 80% live in families with at least one worker, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.
There's a loophole in GOP's plan to kill the state and local tax deduction:::::House Republicans want to kill the state and local income tax deduction.But apparently not for everyone.Their tax reform bill, being debated this week by the Ways and Means Committee, would repeal the federal tax deduction that people get for paying state and local income taxes, and it would curb how much they can deduct in property taxes.The tax break known as the SALT deduction is one of the most controversial revenue raisers because it is near and dear to taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- from highly taxed areas across the country.Today, just under 30% of filers claim the state and local tax deduction on their federal returns, according to the Government Finance Officers Association.But tax experts have spotted what appears to be a big exception to the repeal: The owners, shareholders and investors in so-called pass-through businesses would still be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes in full.The provision allows the deduction if the state and local taxes are "paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or a business ... [or on expenses related to] production of income."As for everyone else who currently takes the SALT deduction?Sorry, Charlie, no can do.Related: What's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses Pass-throughs make up the majority of U.S. businesses.They take the form of sole proprietorships, LLCs or S corps.And those with an ownership stake in them pay taxes on the entity's profits on their individual returns.So for them, under the House bill, state and local taxes could be treated as a business expense on their personal return.That would include President Trump, who typically structures his businesses as pass-throughs.But ordinary employees of such businesses would still be barred from taking the deduction against their wages.A spokesperson for the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to CNNMoney that "all" pass-through owners and investors "will continue to be able to deduct state and local taxes incurred in the conduct of a trade or business."But the provision as written raises big questions for tax policy watchers.A key one is whether professional service firms, which are often set up as pass-throughs, would qualify for the SALT deduction.Professional services include firms providing financial services, legal services and consulting.The SALT provision in the House bill doesn't explicitly say they're not eligible and the word from Ways and Means is that "all" pass-throughs could take the deduction.But -- and this is where it gets tricky -- another provision in the House bill flatly precludes professional service pass-throughs from taking advantage of the proposed new 25% rate on pass-through profits.Related from CNN: Some Republicans say fight isn't over for popular deduction When asked about this at a House Ways and Means hearing Monday, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, seemed to indicate professional service providers -- such as partners in a big law firm -- likely would not be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes because all their income would be taxed as ordinary income, and would not receive the special 25% pass-through profits rate.But other experts disagreed."There's nothing in the legislation providing that.[A professional services firm] is still a trade or business that's a pass-through," said New York University Tax Law Professor David Kamin, who formerly served as a special assistant to President Obama for economic policy.When asked to settle the issue, a spokesperson for Ways and Means wasn't immediately available for comment.Kamin believes the exception to the repeal -- if that's what the tax writers truly intended -- would result "in deep unfairness and plenty of gaming."-- CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report
People who switch jobs get paid more:::::Jumping ship at your job pays off.Teachers, nurses, construction workers and even hotel employees who switched jobs recently saw bigger wage increases than their former colleagues who stayed put, according to new research from ADP, the payment processor.The findings come as employers are scrambling to hold onto their workers because there's an abundance of job openings.There were 6.09 million job openings in September, according to Labor Department figures released Tuesday.That's a hair under the record high of 6.14 million in July.The government began counting job openings in 2000.Such a high number of job openings are a mix of good and bad news.The good: Employers are hiring and America's job market is strong.Unemployment is at 4.1%, the lowest in 17 years.Related: Can't find good workers?Pay up!The bad: Companies either can't find enough workers at a certain wage or candidates with the right job skills.Employers often say a lack of job skills is holding back the economy, and that America as a whole needs to invest more in job training that focuses on skills that are in demand.Another school of thought argues that companies should just pay more if they can't find anyone.In fact, despite the shortage of workers, U.S. wages overall aren't going up much.Wage growth in October was a sluggish 2.4%.Wages are going up significantly for workers leaving their jobs though.In construction, builders who moved onto new sites saw wages go up 5.8% compared to a year ago.Construction workers who stayed at their current gig saw wages rise less: 4.9%.The same is true in education and health services.Those who left for other jobs got a pay raise around 6.2% at their new gig.Those who stayed saw wages go up 3.9%.Related: Job training saved her life It makes sense that there's such a disparity in wage increases between teachers and nurses who stay versus those who move to other schools or hospitals.Of the total 6.09 million job openings in September, 1.17 million -- or about 20% -- were in education and health services.In other words, schools and hospitals are having a hard time filling openings so some feel forced to pay more to attract new talent.For all U.S. workers, those who switched jobs saw wages go up 4.9% on the year while workers who stayed at their jobs got a 4.3% pay bump.ADP's figures come from the third quarter -- July to September.The trend isn't true in all industries.Manufacturing, mining and transportation firms tend to pay workers more if they stay put than if they're applying from elsewhere, according to ADP.
These state exchanges are doing Obamacare open enrollment their own way:::::The Trump administration may be downplaying the start of Obamacare open enrollment, but the states that run their own exchanges are making sure residents know to sign up.More than a dozen states have their own marketplaces, which gives them more control over advertising, outreach and even enrollment in some cases.Many are taking advantage of this power to spread the word that the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land and federal assistance is still available.Open enrollment for 2018 began Wednesday and runs through December 15 in the more than three dozen states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov.In prior years, there was a bigger ad push and the enrollment period lasted at least until the end of January.The Trump administration has taken other steps that critics say undermine the health reform law.It is doing only one-tenth of the advertising for open enrollment that the Obama administration did last year.It's also cut the federal support for the non-profit agencies that help people sign up.Also, Trump has repeatedly pronounced that Obamacare is dead and has yanked the funding for a key Obamacare subsidy.All this has Obamacare advocates worried that fewer people will sign up.State-based exchanges are trying to counteract that messaging."They understand that the federal chaos will have a negative impact on enrollment," said Emily Curran, research fellow at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute."State marketplaces are really well-positioned to step up and do more for their consumers."Related: Obama wants you to know Obamacare open enrollment has begun Covered California, which has roughly 1.3 million enrollees, plans to increase its marketing and outreach budget by $12 million this enrollment season.It is spending a total of $111 million, with more than half going towards television, radio, print, digital and other advertising -- including a spot during the World Series Game 7 in Los Angeles.Also, it has allocated $33.5 million for enrollment assistance.Exchange officials are also hitting the road to promote enrollment, traveling 1,300 miles over seven days in a bus wrapped in the Covered California logo.Local artists will paint murals to attract attention to sign up locations across the state.Enrollment in the Golden State will last until Jan. 31.The #1 goal: Encourage people to check out the exchange's website, coveredca.com, and shop."If people shop and see the price, they'll sign up," said Peter Lee, Covered California's executive director, noting that 85% of consumers who get subsidies can find plans with lower premiums for 2018.In Connecticut, exchange officials ran public service announcements on local television stations and social media in October to make sure residents understood that the Affordable Care Act still exists, financial help is still available and the uninsured will still be penalized."It's never been this confusing for consumers," said Andrea Ravitz, director of marketing and sales for Access Health CT, which extended enrollment by a week to Dec. 22.Related: 5 changes for Obamacare open enrollment for 2018 Access Health CT is making it easier for people to sign up by staffing 10 enrollment locations -- up from two last year -- as well as holding five enrollment fairs, which it is promoting heavily.The exchange also debuted a mobile-friendly website to make it easier to shop on cell phones and tablets.And it is mining the data on its 95,000 enrollees to send them tailored messages by email, text, phone and mail.For instance, residents enrolled in unsubsidized silver plans this year will receive messages asking them to update their income on their applications to see whether they now qualify for help and letting them know that bronze and gold plans may be cheaper on the exchange than off it.Also, officials are advising them that if they buy an off-exchange policy, they won't be able to receive a subsidy even if their income drops during the year.Advertising is key to getting people to sign up for Obamacare, experts said.In Kentucky, for instance, each TV ad sparked nearly 8,000 page views of kynect, the state-based exchange, over the first four enrollment periods, according to researchers from the University of North Carolina, University of Michigan and the Wesleyan Media Project.Then, Republican Governor Matt Bevin took office in December 2015 and canceled television advertising for the final four weeks of the 2016 open enrollment period.Kentucky's enrollment dropped 19% between 2015 and 2016."Reductions in public outreach efforts could have negative effects on the individual market if consumers are uncertain about the continued availability of coverage and so-called 'healthy procrastinators' fail to enroll as a result, contributing to lower enrollment and potentially a worse risk pool for insurers," the researchers wrote.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less for policies next year Conscious of the importance of outreach, the Maryland state-exchange is tripling the number of emails, texts and mailings it is sending this year.Plus, it is pushing notifications through its mobile app.The top priorities are letting consumers know that they must enroll by Dec. 15 and that most can escape the big rate increases since they qualify for financial assistance."We realize it's a shorter period so we have to get people in the door quicker," said Andrew Ratner, chief marketing officer for Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the marketplace.Sign-ups have been brisk so far, with more than 5,000 people picking plans in the first two days, nearly twice as many as last year.The Maryland Health Connection website, which usually closes at 11 p.m., had to stay open an hour later on Wednesday because 300 people were still online.Maryland currently has about 120,000 Obamacare enrollees.While a lot of consumers are confused about the status of the Affordable Care Act, the news coverage has raised awareness of open enrollment, Ratner said."In some ways, all the attention to the reduction in advertising gets the message out in a different way," he said.
Here's the other small firm that won a big power contract in Puerto Rico:::::Whitefish Energy isn't the only young company to land a multimillion dollar deal to help restore power in Puerto Rico.Cobra Acquisitions, a subsidiary of Oklahoma City-based Mammoth Energy (TUSK) that's less than a year old, won a $200 million contract last month from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to help repair and reconstruct the crippled island's utility infrastructure over the next 120 days.The deal is one of two major contracts greenlighted by PREPA that have come under scrutiny on Capitol Hill since recovery efforts began on the island over a month ago.Public outrage and a series of government reviews forced Puerto Rico's state-owned utility to cancel a $300 million deal with Whitefish, a small Montana-based firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit.That deal is currently in the process of being unwound.PREPA, the embattled state-owned utility led by executive director Ricardo Ramos, has faced scrutiny over how these fledgling companies won such lucrative deals over larger, more established utilities.Many question whether PREPA followed the appropriate steps in awarding the contracts.Related: Puerto Rico is killing its $300 million Whitefish contract.Now what?And now PREPA's deal with Cobra is raising eyebrows."Did you or anyone at FEMA approve the Whitefish contract and or the Cobra contract?"Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, asked Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, at a House hearing last week."There's not a lawyer within FEMA that would have ever approved that contract," responded Long."The bottom line is, it was not our contract.And the other thing to be clear here is we don't approve contracts."To be sure, approval by FEMA on such deals isn't mandatory.The agency only requires a detailed audit of Puerto Rico's emergency spending.Mammoth CEO Arty Straehla told analysts on an Oct. 20 conference call that FEMA was "in the room" and involved in "every step of the way" when PREPA was crafting the deal with its Cobra division.FEMA declined to address whether it participated in the discussions.Instead, a FEMA spokeswoman told CNN that Cobra's contract was "solely between PREPA and the other party."Mammoth, an oilfield services company that provides hydraulic fracturing services, is just three years old itself.It bought Cobra for $8 million earlier this year to expand into the utility infrastructure business.As of Oct. 1, Cobra had 58 fleets and roughly 275 employees.It has also been involved in repairs in Texas and Florida following hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Currently, the company has 69 workers in Puerto Rico -- with plans to bring in over 500 more in the coming days, Cobra spokesman Matt Wagner told CNN.Barges with equipment and supplies, including accommodations, are also on their way to the island, he said.Related: Devastating hurricanes dealt corporate America a major blow As part of its deal with PREPA, Straehla said Cobra agreed to provide accommodations, freshwater generation and medical facilities for its workers.PREPA agreed to pay Cobra $15 million upfront to cover the costs of mobilizing forces to the island, he said.It's unclear how PREPA could afford that upfront payment.Only a few weeks earlier, the bankrupt utility, which is $9 billion in debt, said it picked Whitefish over another contender: PowerSecure, a subsidiary of Southern Co. (SO), because it couldn't afford to pay the $25 million down payment the firm required.Ramos said Whitefish's CEO Andrew Techmanski had agreed to take care of logistics, including lodging and food for the hundreds of journey linemen needed to restore power.Straehla reassured Mammoth's investors that the terms of the deal complied with FEMA's reimbursement requirements, signaling Cobra would be paid for its work."We will be paid, we will bill twice weekly," Straehla told analysts a day after announcing the contract."Quite honestly, we wouldn't have entered this contract if we didn't think we'd get paid, and we feel very, very strongly about that."Typically, agencies like PREPA will pay a contractor first as part of a disaster relief deal.Then it would submit a request for reimbursement to FEMA, which would then audit the expense and determine if it is eligible for repayment, an agency spokesperson told CNN.It's unclear how the disaster relief agency makes its assessment.But lawmakers have raised questions about whether the Cobra and Whitefish contracts would meet the agency's requirements."As I understand these contracts, there's a big question about whether you could find them eligible for reimbursement," DeFazio said to Long at the House hearing last week.Long assured a Senate panel earlier in the week that "not one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA" referring to the Whitefish contract.He did not say whether any FEMA money had gone to the Cobra contract.Cobra's spokesman told CNN the company received its full $15 million upfront payment on Oct. 20 from PREPA, the day after the deal was publicly announced.A PREPA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on FEMA's or its own involvement in the Cobra deal.To help restore power to millions on the island, PREPA has also been working with six other local companies, including Pro Energy, Electrical Mechanical Construction and Aireko Services Installation, a spokesman told CNN.The value of those contracts are unknown.Other contracts have also been awarded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including a six-month $240 million contract to Fluor Corp. (FLR), a $40 million deal to PowerSecure to help repair the power grid and a $35.1 million contract to Weston Solutions to provide two generators for temporary power to the city of San Juan.PREPA also plans to tap the mutual aid network, which provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossello turned to governors in New York and Florida for help following the cancellation of the Whitefish deal.Related: How Whitefish landed Puerto RIco's $300 million power deal On Tuesday, PREPA's Ramos, along with the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, and Natalie Jaresko, the head of financial oversight and management board for Puerto Rico, are set to appear before a House panel to discuss the ongoing recovery efforts on the island.A focus of Tuesday's hearing will be cooperation going forward to repair the island's electrical grid.Last week, Rep. Scott Perry, a Republican from Pennsylvania, asked FEMA's Long whether the U.S. government should be "on the hook indefinitely" when it comes to repairing Puerto Rico's electrical grid, especially given decades of lapsed repair of the island's utility infrastructure."I don't think we should be on the hook," Long responded."We've been put in a terribly complex situation as a result of deferred maintenance and a system that was allowed to decay.And unfortunately, everybody wants the power back on."--CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.
Fed's top 3 leaders are leaving their posts:::::The top three leaders at the Federal Reserve have either left or will leave their posts soon.New York Fed President William Dudley -- one of the most watched policymakers on Wall Street -- said Monday he will step down from his post in mid-2018, about six months before his term is set to end."Leading the New York Fed and being a member of the [Fed's committee] has been a dream job," Dudley said in a statement on Monday.Dudley's announcement comes four days after President Trump nominated Jerome Powell to become the next chairman of the Fed.Trump's nomination means current Chair Janet Yellen must step down from her post in February when her term ends.Yellen can remain at the Fed as a governor if she chooses, however doing so would be unprecedented.Related: U.S. unemployment drops to lowest in 17 years In September, former Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer announced his retirement.He officially stepped down in October.Since Trump only nominates governors at the Washington-based Fed, he'll be able to nominate at least three positions and potentially a fourth if Yellen leaves the Fed altogether.There are two open governor positions right now and Fischer's seat.Yellen would be the fourth.The Board of the New York Fed will choose its next president because the boards of each of the 12 regional banks choose their leaders, not Trump.It's a rapid pace of change in the Fed's ranks.Before joining the Washington-based Fed, Yellen had been San Francisco Fed President going back to 2004.Dudley joined the New York Fed in 2007 and played a critical role at the central bank as it devised a recovery plan after the financial crisis.The New York Fed is also one of the top regulators on Wall Street.Related: Trump nominates Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve chair Yellen, Fischer and Dudley will probably be most remembered for leading the central bank when it lifted interest rates in 2015 after the Fed kept them at 0% for years following the financial crisis and Great Recession.Since the initial rate hike in December 2015, Fed leaders have raised rates three more times.Another rate hike is expected this December.All three of them have had tremendous influence on the global economy and financial markets.Yellen, Dudley and Fischer essentially determined the Fed's monetary policy.Whichever way they voted -- raise or don't raise rates -- the Fed went with them.And what the Fed does matters to other countries too, since raising or lowering rates often affects the value of the U.S. dollar.Many nations take out debt that must be paid back in U.S. dollars.If the dollar goes up in value, that debt becomes harder to pay back.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful Other global central banks also moved in tandem with the Fed's low interest rate policy, which Wall Street dubbed "easy money."The European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan all slashed interest rates during the financial meltdown, and provided similar types of stimulus to their respective economies.Other banks, such as the Bank of Mexico, sometimes shifted their policy in response to the Fed.Since the Fed started lifting rates in 2015, its counterparts around the world have also raised rates or removed stimulus.
Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge:::::Saudi Arabia's dramatic anti-corruption purge took the business community by complete surprise.Saturday's arrest of princes, high-profile businessmen and government officials on suspicion of corruption was unprecedented.But the intended message was loud and clear: it's a new era for the kingdom."Nobody, a prince, minister or businessman can operate outside the law," said an aide close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is leading attempts to transform Saudi's economy, as well as the corruption probe."People should now realize there's a red-line when it comes to corruption," said the aide, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.The young crown prince wants to end what he once called an "addiction" to oil.Sweeping changes have already been introduced, including subsidy cuts, new taxes and the lifting of a controversial ban on women driving."If you are going to tax the average Saudi during this period of reform, then it's time to clean our own house, princes and all," said another aide to the crown prince, who also requested anonymity.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy At least 38 former, current or deputy ministers have been arrested on accusations of corruption.The list includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire businessman who owns 95% of Kingdom Holding, which has a global network of major investments including Citigroup (C), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Apple (AAPL, Tech30).Kingdom Holding's shares have fallen 12% in two days, wiping more than $1 billion off Alwaleed's fortune.The broader Saudi stock market fell initially on Sunday, before recovering to close slightly higher.It posted modest gains again Monday.The moves reflect uncertainty among investors about the fallout from the weekend's drama."It is surprisingly aggressive compared with what we have seen in the past," said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at London School of Economics and a specialist on finance in the Arab Gulf countries."There's been nothing like this in the past in any Arab Monarchy," he added.Among the detained are a former finance minister, and a former director of Saudi Airlines, as well as a top Saudi media mogul Waleed Al-Ibrahim.High stake moves The stakes are high.Saudi Arabia's economy is stagnating following the oil price crash, and it needs foreign investors to balance its books, help diversify its economy and buy shares in its massive oil company Aramco."The move against the princes makes sense," said Hertog."The move against the businessmen is riskier because it will affect the general confidence of the merchant class."Related: Trump to Saudi Arabia: Bring Aramco IPO to America Last month, Saudi Arabia hosted thousands of the world's top executives in a conference that was dubbed "Davos in the Desert."Cleaning up its act could help the country compete for business.The kingdom ranks well behind the United Arab Emirates and Qatar on the world's corruption index.It also need to build confidence among investors before selling a stake in its crown jewel, Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil company in the world.Officials have said they expect the IPO to value Aramco at around $2 trillion.In an exclusive interview with CNN, Saudi Foreign Minister al-Jubeir said investors have no reason to worry."I can assure you that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes very very seriously the issue of corruption, waste and mismanagement," he told CNN's Becky Anderson in Riyadh."We want companies to know that when they come to compete in Saudi Arabia they compete fair and square with any other company, and not be subject to people using their influence or position in order to extract better deals."

Trump wants Japan to build more cars in the U.S.:::::President Trump delivered a rebuke to Japan Inc. on Monday."Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over.Is that possible to ask?That's not rude.Is that rude?I don't think so," Trump told executives from local automakers during a trip to Japan.At the same time, Trump thanked Japanese automakers for "building new plants and doing expansions" of existing facilities in the United States.He praised Toyota (TM) and Mazda (MZDAF) for planning a new $1.6 billion manufacturing plant in the U.S. Trump has made reducing the $57 billion trade deficit with Japan a top priority.But Japan's big three car companies have huge factories in the U.S., and their production in the country is at a record high.Japanese automakers have been increasing their investment in the U.S. for decades.The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association estimates that its members built nearly 4 million vehicles in the U.S. last year.Exports from Japan to the U.S. have fallen from 3.5 million cars a year in 1986 to just over 1.5 million in 2016.It said that three out of four Japanese cars sold in the U.S. last year were built in North America, including Mexico and Canada."Many Japanese cars are made in the U.S. already and this request is not reflective of today's reality," said Stephen Nagy, a professor at Tokyo's International Christian University.Nissan (NSANF) says that it sold 1.5 million vehicles in the U.S. last year, and made 1 million in the country -- although some of those were for export.Honda (HMC) locally manufactured 70% of the 1.2 million vehicles it sold in the U.S. in 2016.Toyota (TM), meanwhile, built 2.1 million cars at its North American plants last year.It didn't respond to a request for more detailed statistics.Trade with Japan is a major flash point for Trump, who is on a lengthy tour of Asia."Our trade with Japan is not fair and it's not open," he said Monday.Related: Asia braces for Trump's trade trash talk Foreign firms have been eager to play up their investments in the U.S. following the election of Trump, who blames lopsided trade agreements for decimating American industry and killing blue-collar jobs.Toyota, for example, is spending $1.3 billion to upgrade a facility in Kentucky.It has also scaled back a planned $700 million investment in a new manufacturing plant in Mexico.The U.S. runs deficits with all five countries that Trump will visit in Asia, including a particularly big one with China.-- Correction: The original version of this article and its headline did not make clear that President Trump had praised Japanese automakers for expanding existing U.S. facilities and for making new investments in the U.S.The article and headline have been updated.

Who wins and loses under the House GOP tax bill: Let the wonkery begin:::::Get ready for a busy week on tax reform.The House Republican plan released last week will be tweaked and poked by lawmakers and experts.The House Ways and Means Committee meets Monday to start debating and amending the legislation.Meanwhile, think tanks and wonk shops will crunch the numbers to see who wins and who loses with every change.The first broad, independent analysis of the initial House bill came from the conservative Tax Foundation.It found that every income group would see a tax cut, but the top 1% of households would do considerably better than everyone else.The after-tax income of the top 1% would rise by 7.5% in 2018 under the bill's provisions.By contrast, groups in the bottom 80% of the income distribution would see their after-tax income increase by between 0.8% and 2.4%.By 2027, the very highest income households -- generally people earning at least in the high six figures -- still do best, with an average 3.3% bump in after-tax income.The bottom 90% of households, meanwhile, would see a small boost, of between 0.4% and 1.1%.These estimates are based on a conventional analysis of tax measures.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for people The results differed somewhat when the Tax Foundation did a so-called dynamic analysis, meaning they considered what the economic growth effects of the House GOP tax bill's provisions would be in addition to making assumptions about how people's behavior would change in response to the proposed measures.Those dynamic effects, according to the analysis, could create higher growth, higher wages and 975,000 more jobs.That assumes, in part, that workers would benefit greatly from the big corporate tax rate cut in the bill, even though that's an area of disagreement among economists.But if the premise is correct, the bill could lower everyone's tax burden by 2027, the analysis estimates.Those in the bottom 90% would see their after-tax incomes grow by between 4.1% and 4.8%.That's somewhat higher than the 3.6% to 3.9% of those at the top of the distribution.The one thing all that estimated new growth won't do?Pay for the full cost of the tax cuts being proposed in the House bill.The Tax Foundation estimates the bill's provisions could result in GDP that is 3.9% higher than it would otherwise be over the next decade.But even with that they would still add another $989 billion to deficits.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses Republicans have said they want tax reform signed into law by the end of the year.That's a very aggressive goal given how much work there is to do.The House bill first must be amended.Tax writers in the Senate will produce their own bill.If each chamber passes its own tax bill, the differences between them will need to be reconciled.And a final reconciled bill must be voted on again.If passed, President Trump then has to agree to it all.Christmas will be here before you know it.
House tax bill would scrap deduction for medical expenses:::::The tax bill unveiled by Republicans in the House on Thursday would not, as had been rumored, eliminate the tax penalty for failure to have health insurance.But it would eliminate a decades-old deduction for people with very high medical costs.The controversial bill is an effort by Republicans to revamp the nation's tax code and provide dramatic tax cuts for business and individuals.However, its future is not yet clear because Republicans, who control both the House and Senate, appear divided on key measures.The medical deduction, originally created in World War II, is available only to taxpayers whose expenses are above 10% of their adjusted gross income.Because of that threshold, and because it is available only to people who itemize their deductions, the medical expense deduction is not used by many people an estimated 8.8 million claimed it on their 2015 taxes, according to the IRS.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people But those 8.8 million tax filers claimed an estimated $87 billion in deductions; meaning that those who do qualify for the deduction have very high out-of-pocket health costs."For many people, this is a big deduction," said David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP, which opposes the change.AARP has calculated that about three-quarters of those who claim the medical expense deduction are 50 or older, and more than 70% have annual incomes of $75,000 or below.Many of those expenses are for long-term care, which is typically not covered by health insurance.Long-term care can cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars a year.Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who is a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, called the bill's elimination of the medical expense deduction "anti-senior."But defenders of the bill say the elimination of the deduction should not be seen in isolation.The House tax bill also proposes eliminating billions of dollars in corporate tax credits that have played a key role in the booming "orphan drug" industry.In an FAQ posted on the House Ways and Means Committee website, the bill's sponsors denied that the change would "be a financial burden.""Our bill lowers the tax rates and increases the standard deduction so people can immediately keep more of their paychecks -- instead of having to rely on a myriad of provisions that many will never use and others may use only once in their lifetime," the sponsors said.Getting rid of many current deductions "is being done to finance rate cuts and increase the standard deduction and child tax credit," said Nicole Kaeding, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation.So, for many tax filers, she said, "there will likely be offsetting tax cuts."On the other hand, those offsetting cuts almost by definition will not make up the difference for people with very large medical expenses, who are the only ones who qualify for the medical deduction."That's why tax reform is hard," Kaeding said.Related: These powerful groups hate the GOP tax plan Strikingly absent from the bill -- for now -- is any reference to the elimination of the tax penalty for failure to have health insurance.The so-called individual mandate is one of the most unpopular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans failed to change or repeal earlier this year.Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, is continuing to push language to add to the bill that would eliminate the penalty.President Donald Trump has added his endorsement via Twitter: "Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts," he wrote Wednesday.Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts..... Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 But while the president is correct that there would be savings from eliminating the mandate, the Congressional Budget Office has also estimated that millions more Americans would become uninsured as a result.Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Trump and his kids likely would do very well under House tax bill:::::Everyone's been wondering how they would do under the House Republicans' tax bill, should it ever become law.But there's good reason to think at least one tax filer and his family could make bank.President Trump has frequently asserted that he and his wealthy peers would not see much of a tax cut if Republicans pass tax legislation.But that seems unlikely under several provisions in the House bill released this week.In fact, a new study by the Tax Foundation showed the top 1% would do much better than everyone else in most scenarios.Here are just three ways Trump and his kids could benefit: 1.A lower rate on business income The House GOP's "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" would lower the top tax rate on the profits of so-called pass-through businesses to 25%, from 39.6% today.Pass-throughs include everything from Main Street shops to big accounting firms, medical practices, and private investment partnerships.They also happen to include many of the Trump family's vast financial portfolio -- from golf clubs to hotels to real estate developments to Trump-branded products and ventures.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for people Pass-throughs are not taxed under the corporate code.Instead, their profits flow through to the owners, partners and shareholders, who pay tax on them through their individual tax returns.2.Repeal of the estate tax The estate tax affects very, very few Americans.The Tax Policy Center estimates that this year only 11,310 estates will have to file a return, and just 5,460 of them will end up owing any federal tax after accounting for deductions and credits.Why?Because only those estates worth more than $5.49 million this year ($10.98 million for married couples) even have to file estate tax returns.Then only about half of those end up being taxable after factoring in deductions and credits.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses The House tax bill does two things with respect to the estate tax: It doubles the exemption amounts, and then repeals the estate tax entirely by 2024.Given how wealthy the Trump family is, they would certainly benefit from both provisions.And there's more: the House bill does not eliminate, as some suspected it might, a very sweet break for heirs, called a "step up in basis."The step-up rule basically lets people inherit, tax free, any asset with untaxed capital gains.Here's how: Say you bought shares in a company eons ago for $50 a pop.You never sold them and bequeath them to your children.When you die, the shares are trading at $150, for a gain of $100 per share.That gain will be tax-free forever because when your kids inherit them, they get a "step up" in their capital gains basis to $150, meaning the only tax they'll owe is on the appreciation in price over $150 should they ever choose to sell the shares.3.Repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax Tax filers are supposed to pay whichever is higher: their tax bill under the rules of the regular tax code or under the rules of the AMT, which disallows various tax breaks.The AMT would be repealed under the House bill.Normally very wealthy people like Trump aren't subject to the AMT because their tax liability ends up being higher under the regular code.But in Trump's case, based on what little is known of his taxes, he had to pay an additional $31 million on his 2005 return because of the AMT.That's most likely due to the outsized net operating loss ($916 million) that he reported in 1995 and was allowed to carry over from year to year.The AMT disallows some net operating losses.It's not known if Trump is still carrying such large losses.But if he is, a repeal of the AMT could further reduce his tax burden, said tax lawyer Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.In 2005, for instance, he would have had to pay only $5.3 million if it weren't for the AMT.
America's wealth gap is bigger than ever:::::America's wealth gap is getting even bigger.While wages for low- and middle-income workers have begun to recover, wealth inequality has still climbed to new heights, according to a new survey from the Federal Reserve which conducts a checkup of the nation's finances every three years.In 2016, median household net worth improved across all income brackets -- up 16% overall since 2013 -- but those on the higher end of the income spectrum did the best.The top 10% of earners saw their household net worth increase 40% over the three-year period, according to the Fed.Related: Americans still waiting for a bigger raise That has increased the nation's already large economic divide.Here's one way of understanding the difference that makes.The median upper-income family (those who make more than $127,600) now holds 75 times the wealth of the median low-income family (those who make less than $42,500), according to an analysis of the data by the Pew Research Center.In 2007, top earners were worth 40 times as much.In 1989, the multiple was 28.In real terms, families in that upper-income bracket are now worth $810,800, up about $70,000 since the eve of the recession in 2007 an increase fueled in part by rising real estate prices and the stock market, in which more wealthier people can afford to invest.The median lower-income family now has $10,800 in assets, which is down almost $8,000 since 2007, Pew found.Here's another way of understanding it: The Top 1% now holds 38.6% of the nation's wealth, up from 33.7% in 2007.The bottom 90% now holds only 22.8% of the nation's total wealth, down from 28.5% in 2007.There are also differences within those income brackets.Low-income white people have seen their wealth nearly cut in half since the recession, while the net worth of black and Hispanic families who make a similar amount of money remained basically stable.Although the overall disparity in assets between white people and non-white people remains enormous the median white family is worth nearly ten times as much as the median black family and about 8 times as much as the median Hispanic family the recession has narrowed that gap among lower-income earners.
These powerful business groups hate the GOP tax plan:::::President Trump argues the GOP tax overhaul will "create tremendous success for companies."Yet some of America's most powerful business alliances are already trying to kill the bill.The instant opposition of well-organized and deep-pocketed lobbying groups threatens to delay or even derail passage of the legislation, which House Republicans unveiled on Thursday.Three of the country's largest and most influential business groups have already come out against the GOP bill."These three groups aren't 'lean no' -- they are full-blown, burn-it-to-the ground 'no'," Chris Krueger, managing director of the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a report on Friday.This hostility underscores why it's so difficult to get tax reform done: entrenched interests will always fight tooth and nail to keep coveted tax breaks.Yet tax loopholes need to be closed to pay for the corporate and individual tax cuts promised.The GOP bill would permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, consolidate income tax brackets for individuals from seven to four and repeal or limits many deductions.Analysts believe business opposition, combined with concern from Republicans in high-tax states, will make it tough for the GOP to pass meaningful reform by year-end -- the party's latest self-imposed deadline.The initial reaction from "livid lobbyists" and others suggest it's "farcical" that Congress will enact tax legislation before 2018, Isaac Boltansky, senior policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a report.Here's why some business groups are voicing serious concern about Trump's effort to revamp the tax system: Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses Big problems for small business: Owners of mom-and-pop shops worry the tax bill doesn't fix a system they feel already favors big business.The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses in the U.S., wasted little time saying it can't support the tax legislation "in its current form.""This bill leaves too many small businesses behind," Juanita Duggan, the groups' president and CEO, said in a statement.Most small businesses are set up as "pass-throughs," meaning their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them through their personal returns.The GOP tax bill slashes the pass-through tax rate to 25%.However, small business owners fear this won't help the vast majority of them because most already pay taxes at a 25% rate or less."This proposal would primarily help wealthy individuals rather than small businesses," according to John Arensmeyer, CEO of the Small Business Majority, another advocacy group.Housing trouble: While Trump often brags about record highs on Wall Street, the tax plan he endorsed was greeted poorly by the homebuilding stocks.Toll Brothers (TOL), KB Home (KBH) and other builders tumbled this week because the tax bill would limit key tax breaks that favor homebuyers.Specifically, the legislation calls for capping the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000 instead of $1 million.It would also limit the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000.The fear, at least in the housing industry, is that these tax breaks could sap demand for pricey homes, especially in expensive markets.Many of those markets, such as San Francisco and Manhattan, are in high-tax states.That's a problem because the GOP tax plan would eliminate state income tax deductions altogether.The National Association of Home Builders warned the GOP tax plan "slams the middle class" by hurting home values.The group complained that Republicans didn't include its proposal to replace the mortgage deductions with a tax credit."This tax reform plan will put millions of home owners at risk," said Granger MacDonald, chairman of the NAHB.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people Realtors really mad: The GOP proposal to cap the mortgage interest deduction is also riling up the vast real estate industry.Echoing the arguments made by the home builders, the National Association of Realtors complained that the plan "threatens home values and takes money straight from the pockets of homeowners."The concern for realtors is that a slowdown in housing could hurt their income or even employment prospects.It's a major employer.There are about 2 million active real estate licensees in the U.S., according to the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials.The NAR alone represents 1.3 million realtors.The White House has argued that Americans don't buy homes for the tax breaks, they do it because they feel confident about the economy.Nonetheless, the tax bill "fundamentally alters the tax benefits of homeownership," according to Compass Point's Boltansky.Expect the "housing industrial complex fighting ferociously," he said.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.
Americans still waiting for a bigger raise:::::Many Americans are still waiting to see a bigger paycheck.They may have to keep waiting.The government said that average hourly earnings -- another way of saying wages -- rose 2.4% over the past 12 months.That's a slip from the 2.9% increase reported in September.And it remains below the 3% to 3.5% range that many agree is normal in a truly healthy economy.The last time wages were up more than 3% year-over-year was in April 2009, just as the economy was emerging from the depths of the global banking crisis that fueled the Great Recession.It's a bit puzzling though.Why have wages remained stagnant even though many other indicators of the job market and broader economy look healthy?Unemployment continues to drop.The housing market is vibrant.And stocks continue to soar.John Bellows, a portfolio manager at Western Asset, thinks there a couple of things at play.Bellows argues that the impact of globalization, more automation and an increased number of people working part-time (the so-called gig economy) are keeping wages in check.Related: U.S. unemployment rate drops to lowest level in 17 years He adds that this isn't something that the Federal Reserve can solve.The U.S. economy is already at what most would consider to be "full employment."And the Fed is now actually raising rates -- something that will likely continue if Jerome Powell, President Trump's nominee to replace Fed chair Janet Yellen early next year, is confirmed by the Senate.That's why Bellows and others think lawmakers and President Trump need to take action to improve American wages."I'm not sure how much the Fed can do to increase wages," Bellows said."But we shouldn't be defeatist about it.It's now just mostly up to Congress."Erik Weisman, chief economist at MFS, says that if tax reform passes and leads to lower corporate tax rates, big multinational U.S. companies may bring back to the U.S. cash that's sitting overseas, and use it to boost salaries and hire more workers.Related: Here's what's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses "Lower taxes could incentivize companies to keep profits onshore and invest more domestically," Weisman said."If multinationals felt they had better visibility for U.S. demand, then they would have a greater need for building out capacity, and that might necessitate higher wages."Just look at Apple, (AAPL, Tech30) for example.The iPhone maker reported Thursday it has nearly $269 billion in cash.CFO Luca Maestri said during the company's earnings call that $252 billion -- 94% of it -- is stashed overseas.But Weisman conceded that there is a bit of a chicken versus egg problem that lower taxes may not solve.Global growth will need to keep rebounding in order for companies to feel more confident and do more with their cash than just hoard it.Many companies may also choose to reward shareholders with bigger stock buybacks and dividend increases instead of investing in labor.Still, Matt Schreiber, president and chief investment strategist of WBI Investments, thinks there's another problem.Now that companies are hiring again, people who had been unemployed or underemployed may be returning to the workforce for lower salaries simply because they're excited to have a job."More people are getting jobs that underpay and are not making what they used to," Schreiber said.Related: Inequality among America's seniors is getting worse He added that businesses are still waiting to see if recent signs of U.S. economic improvement -- two consecutive quarters of annualized growth of at least 3% -- is sustainable."The real issue for companies is that we've still had relatively anemic growth.That makes it difficult to increase overhead," Schreiber said, adding that he is also hoping "corporate tax cuts could turbocharge the economy and wage growth."There are some hopeful signs though.Matt Toms, chief investment officer of fixed income for Voya Investment Management, said it is good to see that more states and cities are raising their minimum wages, as are giant American employers like Walmart (WMT) and McDonald's (MCD).But the average hourly workweek has remained relatively flat over the past few months, stuck around 34.4 hours.Toms suggests that some employers could be limiting worker hours in light of wage increases in order to keep labor costs in check."We'd be more encouraged if there was even more wage growth.It's needed at this part of the economic cycle," Toms said.
U.S. unemployment drops to lowest in 17 years:::::America's job market got back on its feet in October.The U.S. economy rebounded from the hurricanes and added 261,000 jobs, the best performance of the Trump administration.Unemployment inched down to 4.1%, the lowest since December 2000."This labor market is still really firing on all cylinders," says Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.But wages took a step back.They grew only 2.4% in October compared with a year earlier, behind September's number.The absence of better wage growth and inflation is one of the biggest mysteries in the economy.Related: Trump nominates Jerome Powell to lead Federal Reserve The United States has added jobs for 85 straight months, the longest streak on record.The government first estimated that the economy lost 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Revised figures show a gain of 18,000 instead.The job gains for October were across the board.Restaurants reopened after the storms, adding 89,000 jobs after losing roughly the same amount in September.Business services gained 50,000 positions.Health care firms hired 22,000 employees.Manufacturing kept growing.The industry gained 24,000 positions in October.Since the U.S. presidential election last year, manufacturing has gained a strong 156,000 jobs.Economists attribute those gains to the renewed strength of the global economy and a weak U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more affordable for foreigners to buy.Manufacturing firms rely heavily on shipping and selling abroad.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful woman Improved technology is persuading some U.S. companies to stay local, too, experts add."The cost differences are starting to make more sense for companies to produce more goods in America," says Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.There were some concerning figures in the report.More than 700,000 Americans left the labor market in October.Although the Labor Department didn't give a reason, that could be because Baby Boomers keep retiring.So the unemployment rate dropped for what economists think of as the wrong reason -- a shrinking labor force, not just more hiring.Some industries also registered minor job losses, such as mining, which lost 2,000 workers, and retail stores, which lost 8,000.Still, the overall picture is very good -- although getting to this point after the financial crisis has been a crawl, economists point out."You can look it at as a marathon or a sprint.Other expansions were more like a sprint.This is a marathon," says Robert Frick, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.Another way to put it: "The party can go on for a lot longer.It's just not a wild party."
Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore:::::Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro finally admitted his government can't afford to pay all of its mounting bills.Maduro said in a televised speech Thursday that Venezuela and its state-run oil company, PDVSA, will seek to restructure their debt payments.The oil company made a $1.1 billion payment on Thursday, he said, a sizable amount for a country with only $10 billion left in the bank."But after this payment, starting today, I decree a refinancing and a restructuring of the external debt," Maduro told the country.Venezuela is already deep into a humanitarian crisis, with people suffering from food and medical shortages.Many can't afford to buy basic items because prices are skyrocketing faster than wages.The country's currency, the bolivar, is worth less than a tenth of a U.S. penny.Related: Venezuela blames Trump for missed debt payments If Maduro's government can't reach a new agreement with bondholders over the debt restructuring -- which often means trying to pay less money -- it will end up defaulting.That would trigger a potentially ugly series of events.Investors in the U.S. and elsewhere could seize Venezuelan oil as collateral.Oil is the government's only significant source of external revenue and therefore its only way to buy food and medicine for its 30 million citizens.Because the government mismanaged vast swaths of farmland, it must import almost all food.Agreeing on a new payment schedule is no easy feat with Wall Street investors.Just ask Argentina.Its government fought in U.S. courts for 15 years to resolve its unpaid debts.Argentina's government was shut out of international debt markets over that time, which ultimately crippled its economy.Argentines called the investors "vulture funds" because they bought the bonds on the cheap and then sued the government to get much higher payments.The two sides reached a settlement in early 2016, shortly after a new Argentine government took office.Related: Venezuela tell citizens to eat rabbits amid food shortages Venezuela's experience at the negotiating table could actually be much worse.All told, Venezuela owes about $65 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currencies, mostly in dollars, according to research firm Capital Economics.Venezuela also owes debts to China, Russia, oil service providers, airlines and a slew of other entities.Its top negotiator also has a problem: He can't do business in the U.S. Maduro has appointed Vice President Tareck El Aissami to lead the debt restructuring efforts.In February, the U.S. Treasury Department accused El Aissami of drug trafficking and froze his assets in the U.S. El Aissami denies the accusations.Meanwhile, Maduro and others in his government have tried to pin the blame on President Trump for Venezuela's debt problems after Trump slapped stiff financial sanctions on the country in August.After the state oil company, PDVSA, made a large debt payment last week, it didn't mince its words.The company said it made the payment, "despite the economic war, unjustified imposition of sanctions by Donald Trump, and the sabotage, persecution and financial blockade to which the Republic and its institutions have been subjected by a significant portion of the international financial system as commanded by imperialism."
Trump passes over America's most powerful woman:::::President Trump just passed over America's most powerful woman.His decision to nominate Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve, rather than letting Janet Yellen keep the job for four more years, marks a loss of female leadership not just in economic circles but in the world.Yellen is the first woman to serve as Fed chair, and she is the only woman leading a major central bank anywhere on the globe.Only 10 other women run a nation's central bank, and none of them comes close to Yellen's influence.The others are the central bank chairs of Aruba, Belize, Cuba, Cyprus, Israel, Lesotho, Russia, Samoa, Serbia and Seychelles, according to Central Bank Directory, a publication that closely follows the world of monetary policy.Because she steers the world's biggest economy, trillions of dollars in global markets sway with Yellen's every word.She may be the second most powerful woman on the planet, behind only German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Her departure leaves men holding all the top jobs that guide the Trump economy.The treasury secretary, the commerce secretary, the labor secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the U.S. Trade Representative, the director of the National Economic Council and Trump's nominee for president of the Export-Import Bank are all men.(Most of those jobs were also held by men during the Obama administration, although he did appoint women as labor secretary and commerce secretary, and Yellen as Fed chair.)In Powell, Trump is appointing a man who holds many of the same beliefs as his history-making predecessor.Related: The biggest mystery in the U.S. economy Yellen and Powell work together because Powell is a Fed governor, and they always vote the same way on monetary policy.They differ on bank regulation, but only slightly.Powell supports many of the reforms in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, instituted after the financial crisis.Yellen staunchly defends it.They both recommend tweaking it to reduce the burden on small community banks."We've got kind of the same person, just in different clothes," says Chris Gaffney, president of Everbank World Markets.And Trump himself has praised Yellen, saying just this week that she's done an "excellent" job.(He sang a different tune on the campaign trail.As a candidate, Trump said that Yellen should be "ashamed of herself" for creating a "false stock market.")Ivanka Trump, who is an official White House adviser to her father, has praised Yellen and even had breakfast with her in July.Yellen and Powell were both nominated by President Barack Obama, though Powell is a Republican and Yellen a Democrat.Yellen is highly respected on Wall Street and in academic circles.It's also customary for the president, regardless of political party, to renominate the Fed chair.However, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business anchor Lou Dobbs last week that he wanted to put his own stamp on the Fed."We're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets," Trump said, speaking of Yellen.But he added: "In one way, I have to say, you like to make your own mark ... which is maybe one of things that she's got a little bit against her."Trump later asked Dobbs whom he would choose for Fed chair.Dobbs suggested Yellen.Yellen has been outspoken about the need for more female leadership and participation in the workforce.In May, she spoke at the Brown University to celebrate the 125th anniversary of its opening its doors to women."The rise in women's involvement in the workforce ... has contributed not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our country," Yellen said.Her term ends in February.
Notre Dame will stop covering birth control for students and employees:::::Less than a month after the Trump administration weakened Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, the University of Notre Dame announced it will stop covering birth control for students, faculty and staff.The Catholic institution, which had long battled the Obama administration over the mandate, will end coverage of contraceptives for employees after Dec. 31.Students, whose insurance follows the academic calendar, will lose the benefits after Aug. 14."The University of Notre Dame honors the moral teachings of the Catholic Church," the University Health Services director wrote to students in an email last week."To comply with federal law, Aetna Student Health has provided coverage, separate from University coverage, for additional women's health products or procedures that the University objects to based on its religious beliefs."Under Obamacare, insurance plans had to cover contraception for women without charging a co-pay.Over 55 million American women have had access to birth control coverage with zero out-of-pocket costs, according to the National Women's Law Center.Related: Trump administration deals major blow to Obamacare birth control mandate A fairly limited number of employers -- mainly churches and some other religious entities -- could get an exemption to the mandate.Some other employers, such as religious-based universities or hospitals, could seek accommodations so that they didn't have to provide coverage, but their workers could still obtain contraceptives paid for by the insurer or the employer's plan administrator.Notre Dame's students and workers received coverage this way.The Trump administration, however, issued new rules last month that would let a broad range of employers stop offering contraceptive coverage through their health insurance plans if they have a "sincerely held religious or moral objection."Notre Dame is one of the first employers to take advantage of the increased leeway.Its president, Rev.John Jenkins, applauded the administration's decision last month, saying "no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law."The university had filed lawsuits seeking relief from the contraceptive mandate in 2012 and then again 2013.The tables have now turned, with the American Civil Liberties Union filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration last month that challenges the new rules.One of its clients, Kate Rochat, is a law student at Notre Dame."While not surprising, Notre Dame's move to block access to affordable contraceptive coverage is deeply disappointing," said ACLU Staff Attorney Brigitte Amiri."We have already taken legal action against the Trump Administration because our client Kate Rochat and the thousands of other women affected by this decision should not have their access to basic health care services denied simply because of where they work or go to school."Related: Beyond just birth control: Rollback leaves some women fearful Some Notre Dame students are also protesting the university's decision.The Graduate Workers Collective of Notre Dame, an independent group of graduate students, held a rally last month and just started circulating an online petition demanding the administration re-examine the move."The health of people at Notre Dame who can become pregnant, especially those who are low-income, will be jeopardized by obstructed access to reproductive care," the petition reads."Meanwhile, University representatives are citing religious liberty as the rationale for a policy which is in fact discriminatory.The University's position is philosophically incoherent and morally untenable."Kate Bermingham, who is pursuing her PhD in political science at Notre Dame, said she depends on the free coverage for birth control pills and contraceptive counseling.The graduate student stipend is only $23,000 a year, she noted."We shouldn't be materially disadvantaged because we have women's bodies," said Bermingham, 28, who chose Notre Dame because of its strong political theory program.
Paradise Papers: Apple defends use of tax haven for overseas cash:::::Apple has defended its tax arrangements after reports revealed it had shifted its mountain of offshore cash from Ireland to a tax haven in the English Channel.A trove of documents known as the Paradise Papers have reportedly shed light on Apple's search for a new place to store the huge sums, after more than two decades of benefiting from artificially low taxes in Ireland.The company has resisted bringing the money back to the U.S. because of the massive tax bill it would face.Coverage of the documents is being coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which has shared them with major media outlets including The New York Times, The Guardian and the BBC.CNN hasn't independently reviewed the documents.Related: What you need to know about the Paradise Papers Apple (AAPL, Tech30) for years funneled most of its overseas profits through Ireland.Arrangements with the Irish government allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of just 0.005% in 2014 on the money it made selling its products to most of the world outside America, according to the European Commission.The ICIJ reports that the maker of the iPhone and iPad began hunting for a new jurisdiction to hold overseas profits after Ireland in 2014 came under pressure from the European Commission to close tax loopholes that allow companies to lower their tax below Ireland's 12.5% rate.Apple eventually opted for Jersey, a British Crown Dependency off the coast of France that doesn't usually charge tax on foreign companies' profits and mostly falls outside of EU jurisdiction.Jersey also has strong links to the U.K. banking system.The ICIJ reported that the documents in the Paradise Papers suggest Apple didn't want word of the Jersey move to get out.Apple, which currently has $252 billion of its cash outside the U.S., said in a statement Monday that it adjusted its corporate structure when Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015."As part of these changes, Apple's subsidiary which holds overseas cash became resident in the U.K. Crown dependency of Jersey, specifically to ensure that tax obligations and payments to the U.S. were not reduced," the company said.Related: Why big American companies stash cash overseas "Since then Apple has paid billions of dollars in U.S. tax on the investment income of this subsidiary," it added."There was no tax benefit for Apple from this change and, importantly, this did not reduce Apple's tax payments or tax liability in any country."The company said it "pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world," including tax in the U.S. at the standard rate of 35% and an effective rate of 21% on foreign earnings."This rate has been consistent for many years," it added.Related: These are the world's worst tax havens Apple CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend Apple's tax practices in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2013.There's no indication Apple has done anything illegal.The company didn't immediately respond to requests for further comment on its international tax arrangements.Apple isn't the only global tech firm to run international operations out of Ireland.Google (GOOGL, Tech30) also has its European HQ in the country.The European Union is currently trying to force Ireland to collect 13 billion ($15 billion) in unpaid taxes from Apple.The European Commission -- the EU's executive arm whose remit includes antitrust cases -- ruled last year that the Irish government had granted illegal aid to Apple by helping it keep its tax bill artificially low for more than 20 years.The Irish government said last month that while it has "never accepted the Commission's analysis" in the Apple case, it was working to recover the taxes.Cook has said the Commission's ruling has "no basis in fact or in law," calling it "obvious targeting of Apple."The Paradise Papers disclosures come as President Trump's administration seeks to overhaul the U.S. federal tax code.Under the House GOP tax bill, the main federal tax rate would be 20%, not 35%, and overseas profits would no longer be subject to U.S. tax.Instead they would be taxed by the country where the money is made.
Ad wars are killing Priceline and TripAdvisor:::::If you're looking to book a vacation, let's be honest.There's not too much of a difference between searching for flights and hotels on Priceline, TripAdvisor and Expedia.The companies seem to know that too.So does Wall Street.And investors are worried.Shares of Priceline (PCLN, Tech30) plunged 13% and TripAdvisor (TRIP) was down more than 20% on Tuesday after reporting their latest earnings and disappointing outlooks after the closing bell Monday.Both companies have had to ramp up their marketing and advertising spending to attract customers.That seems to be coming at the expense of future profits.Priceline spent more than $4 billion on various types of advertising and marketing in the first nine months of the year -- up more than 20% from the first three quarters of 2006.It spent $1.5 billion alone in the third quarter.The company has been aggressively promoting its Booking.com unit in particular.And TripAdvisor spent $683 million on selling and marketing expenses in the past nine months, a 17% increase from a year ago.Related: Confident Americans are rushing to book trips Both companies spent more than half their revenues on marketing and advertising in the first nine months of the year, a testament to how brutally competitive the business is.Just think about all the TV and online ads you see for Priceline and its subsidiaries as well as TripAdvisor and Expedia.Priceline lowered its profit outlook for the fourth quarter Monday, partly due to the increased competition.And TripAdvisor warned that it expects revenue growth to slow in the coming months.This news follows a disappointing earnings report from Expedia (EXPE) late last month.Expedia also is in the midst of a management transition after former CEO Dara Khosrowshahi left to take the top job at Uber.What's interesting to note is that while the travel search and booking business is having a rough time right now, the fundamentals for the overall leisure industry are actually strong.Hotel chains Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) have surged this year and are trading near record highs.Cruise line Carnival (CCL) has had a strong 2017 and its rival Royal Caribbean (RCL) posted strong earnings Tuesday as well.People are taking vacations.But all three online travel companies are dealing with tough competition from Google (GOOGL, Tech30) as well.The search giant bought travel software firm ITA in 2011 and Google has been ramping up its travel presence ever since.Related: New Uber CEO, formerly of Expedia, is an outspoken Trump critic In fact, travel research firm Skift recently estimated that Google's travel search business is worth $100 billion, which would make it the most valuable travel company.Priceline, which also owns Kayak, Cheapflights and OpenTable, is worth about $82 billion.Airbnb is increasingly viewed as a threat for the online travel giants too.Priceline CEO Glenn Fogel was asked on the earnings call about competition from "instantly bookable vacation rentals."And although the analyst and Fogel did not mention Airbnb by name, it seemed clear they were talking about the house and apartment sharing Silicon Valley unicorn, which is now worth nearly $30 billion."I'm not nave.I recognize we are not the leader in this space right now," Fogel said."We are the leader overall for accommodations of all types of properties, but there is a competitor who is a little bit bigger and doing a little bit better, I suspect, than we are in this area."Still, Wall Street seems to think that Priceline has a better chance of going toe to toe with Airbnb and Google than TripAdvisor or Expedia.Analysts at Piper Jaffray and Jefferies kept their favorable ratings on Priceline Tuesday, citing the strength of all the company's different brands and the fact that management is often overly conservative with its guidance.But the two analysts have negative opinions about the outlook for TripAdvisor, especially since the company said Monday that it may spend even more on TV advertising next year.
The Oprah effect is stronger than ever at Weight Watchers:::::Oprah can eat bread and still rake in major dough.Weight Watchers says more than 600,000 subscribers have joined in the past year, and they're committing to the program an average of one month longer.That combo drove up quarterly revenue and sent Weight Watchers (WTW) shares 18% higher on Tuesday.The stock has quadrupled in price this year.It's hard to argue with Oprah's results.In October 2015, Winfrey bought a 10% stake in the struggling company for $43 million and joined its board of directors.After two years and a high-profile television and Twitter campaign to tout her weight-loss success -- and her beloved, Weight Watchers-approved bread -- her stake is now worth $344 million.Related: Oprah is coming to supermarket shelves this fall Weight Watchers says it has 3.4 million members, compared with 2.5 million when Winfrey signed on.Members now stick with the program about nine months on average.That's been a key to the company's run this year.The company had a bumpy 2016 as competition from other diet services like Nutrisystem cut into profits.But it has surged ahead in 2017.Nutrisystem stock is up only 38% -- a strong year but nothing like the tear Weight Watchers is on.Winfrey will be front and center as Weight Watchers unveils its SmartPoints food plan to recruit more people during the New Year's diet season."There's a long runway for the company to keep growing," said Alex Fuhrman, an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital."They have a really bright future ahead of them."--CNNMoney's Paul R.

More Wells Fargo workers allege retaliation for whistleblowing:::::More former Wells Fargo employees allege they were fired after they tried to blow the whistle on shady activity at the bank.That's according to a new filing by Wells Fargo (WFC), which disclosed claims of "retaliation" by ex-employees.Wells Fargo has been at the center of a number of scandals over the past year.This filing addresses two in particular -- when the bank forced thousands of customers into car insurance they didn't need, and when it wrongly charged homebuyers to lock in mortgage rates.Wells Fargo said on Friday that one former employee "has alleged retaliation for raising concerns regarding automobile lending practices."The bank declined to give further information about this specific claim.The same Wells Fargo filing said several other former mortgage employees claim "they were terminated for raising concerns" about the improper mortgage rate fees.The bank didn't specify how many workers made these claims, but indicated that there is least one lawsuit pertaining to these issues.One suit was filed in July by former Wells Fargo mortgage consultant Mauricio Alaniz, and was previously reported by USA Today and the LA Times.In a statement, Wells Fargo said "we deny Mr. Alaniz's claims regarding the reasons for his termination."The bank declined to comment further due to the ongoing litigation.The Labor Department, which investigates retaliation matters, said in a statement that it "does not acknowledge or deny the existence of a complaint."Ex-employees shared similar claims of retaliation last fall with CNNMoney regarding the bank's infamous fake account scandal.At that time, several former employees said they were fired after reporting wrongdoing to the bank's ethics hotline.Taken together, the allegations speak to a common thread at Wells Fargo where scandals are often accompanied by worker retaliation claims.Related: Wells Fargo's legal headaches are hurting its profits Indeed, Wells Fargo said in the filing that it faces a "range of employment litigation," including pending class action lawsuits brought by former employees "who allege that they protested sales practice misconduct."The bank said it also faces multiple complaints and state law whistleblower actions filed with the Labor Department alleging retaliation.Earlier this year, Wells Fargo was ordered by the Labor Department to pay $5.4 million and rehire a whistleblower who was fired after calling the ethics hotline to report suspected fraud.Tim Sloan, who was promoted to CEO to clean up Wells Fargo's mess, has insisted employees won't face retribution for flagging unethical behavior."It is safe to call the ethics line," Sloan told CNN's Poppy Harlow in April.He added that "one instance of retaliation" is "completely unacceptable."Related: Wells Fargo sold dangerous investments it didn't understand, regulator says Wells Fargo's filing Friday also indicates that its auto insurance woes might be worse than previously disclosed.In July, Wells Fargo apologized for charging as many as 570,000 customers since 2012 for car insurance they didn't need.An internal review by the bank found that about 20,000 of those customers may had their cars repossessed in part due to this forced insurance.Unlike most big banks, Wells Fargo's auto loan contracts allowed the lender to obtain collateral protection insurance on a customer's behalf if they fail to buy liability coverage themselves.Wells Fargo conceded that it bought insurance for some customers -- and charged them for it -- even when they had their own.Wells Fargo said on Friday it will now accept refund requests for this matter dating back to October 15, 2005.The bank also raised its estimate for the cost of the auto insurance scandal to $130 million, up from $80 million previously.A spokesman for Wells Fargo said the expanded refund reflects the bank's desire to "make things right for our customers."
Fed's top 3 leaders are leaving their posts:::::The top three leaders at the Federal Reserve have either left or will leave their posts soon.New York Fed President William Dudley -- one of the most watched policymakers on Wall Street -- said Monday he will step down from his post in mid-2018, about six months before his term is set to end."Leading the New York Fed and being a member of the [Fed's committee] has been a dream job," Dudley said in a statement on Monday.Dudley's announcement comes four days after President Trump nominated Jerome Powell to become the next chairman of the Fed.Trump's nomination means current Chair Janet Yellen must step down from her post in February when her term ends.Yellen can remain at the Fed as a governor if she chooses, however doing so would be unprecedented.Related: U.S. unemployment drops to lowest in 17 years In September, former Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer announced his retirement.He officially stepped down in October.Since Trump only nominates governors at the Washington-based Fed, he'll be able to nominate at least three positions and potentially a fourth if Yellen leaves the Fed altogether.There are two open governor positions right now and Fischer's seat.Yellen would be the fourth.The Board of the New York Fed will choose its next president because the boards of each of the 12 regional banks choose their leaders, not Trump.It's a rapid pace of change in the Fed's ranks.Before joining the Washington-based Fed, Yellen had been San Francisco Fed President going back to 2004.Dudley joined the New York Fed in 2007 and played a critical role at the central bank as it devised a recovery plan after the financial crisis.The New York Fed is also one of the top regulators on Wall Street.Related: Trump nominates Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve chair Yellen, Fischer and Dudley will probably be most remembered for leading the central bank when it lifted interest rates in 2015 after the Fed kept them at 0% for years following the financial crisis and Great Recession.Since the initial rate hike in December 2015, Fed leaders have raised rates three more times.Another rate hike is expected this December.All three of them have had tremendous influence on the global economy and financial markets.Yellen, Dudley and Fischer essentially determined the Fed's monetary policy.Whichever way they voted -- raise or don't raise rates -- the Fed went with them.And what the Fed does matters to other countries too, since raising or lowering rates often affects the value of the U.S. dollar.Many nations take out debt that must be paid back in U.S. dollars.If the dollar goes up in value, that debt becomes harder to pay back.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful Other global central banks also moved in tandem with the Fed's low interest rate policy, which Wall Street dubbed "easy money."The European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan all slashed interest rates during the financial meltdown, and provided similar types of stimulus to their respective economies.Other banks, such as the Bank of Mexico, sometimes shifted their policy in response to the Fed.Since the Fed started lifting rates in 2015, its counterparts around the world have also raised rates or removed stimulus.
Arrested Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal built empire from Riyadh to Silicon Valley:::::It's a business that has plowed cash into everything from top American banks to Chinese tech startups.And now it could be in trouble.Shares in Kingdom Holding, the firm that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal built into a global power, have dropped 12% in two days after the prominent Saudi investor was arrested as part of an anti-corruption drive.In a statement Monday, the company's chief executive said its "experienced and seasoned team of senior executives ... are focused on their unwavering responsibilities."Still, the arrest of founder and chairman Alwaleed is bound to unsettle boardrooms across the globe.Kingdom Holding describes itself as a "prominent investor" in Citigroup (C), and its website features photos of Alwaleed meeting with bank CEO Mike Corbat as recently as March.The prince captured Wall Street's attention by becoming one of Citi's major shareholders in 1991.Later, when the global financial crisis caused the bank's shares to plummet, he increased his stake in a show of confidence.Alwaleed's holding company has poured money into the tech sector, accumulating stakes in Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30), Lyft and Chinese e-commerce startup JD.com, according to its most recent annual report.It does hotels, too: Kingdom Holding has bought into Four Seasons and French multinational Accor (ACCYY), as well as the luxury brands Hotel George V and Savoy.In 2015, the holding company announced that it was reducing its stake in Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp.It remains invested in another Murdoch firm -- 21st Century Fox (FOX) -- according to its website.Related: Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge Alwaleed, who is worth an estimated $17 billion, made his first investments in Saudi real estate and construction, and his company has maintained a focus on the sector.Kingdom Holdings has invested in the Jeddah Economic Company, the firm behind a project that includes plans for the world's tallest building.It has also backed ambitious property projects in Riyadh.Other domestic investments include budget airline Flynas.Saudi Arabia's Attorney General, Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, said over the weekend that "everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and everyone's legal rights will be preserved."In the case of Alwaleed, international investors will be watching closely.
CVS to offer next-day drug delivery:::::CVS hears the Amazon footsteps -- and the pharmacy giant is wasting no time trying to get ahead of any Jeff Bezos plan to disrupt the drug store business the way that he has the rest of retail.CVS said Monday that it plans to offer next day delivery of prescription drugs nationwide in 2018.In some urban markets, CVS will even deliver on the same day.A program to deliver both medications and a select offering of other CVS products from the front of the store will begin in Manhattan on December 4.CVS (CVS) CEO Larry Merlo made the announcements during the company's earnings conference call with analysts.The news comes just a few weeks after reports surfaced that Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) had received wholesale pharmacy licenses in a dozen states.That move would potentially allow Amazon to sell prescription medications online.Related: Amazon may be looking to do more in the drug store biz The speculation caused the shares of CVS and rival Walgreens (WBA) to fall, as did pharmacy benefits manager company Express Scripts (ESRX), a competitor of the CVS-owned PBM Caremark.The stocks of drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and McKesson (MCK) all fell too.This is because investors are worried that Amazon, which is already changing the dynamics of the grocery business thanks to its acquisition of Whole Foods, may look to do the same for drug stores.But Merlo said during the call with analysts Monday that he still sees Amazon as more of a potential ally than threat."You would never close the door on any type of partnership," Merlo said, when asked by an analyst about possibly working with Amazon.Still, CVS seems to recognize that the health care landscape is changing rapidly, and it needs to adjust.There have even been recent rumors that CVS may look to buy health insurer Aetna.Aetna (AET) scrapped plans to merge with rival Humana (HUM) earlier this year due to intense regulatory scrutiny.Another insurer merger proposed by Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) died as well.Since then, the lines between health insurers and the pharmacy giants have grown increasingly blurred and incestuous.Anthem recently started up its own PBM, called IngenioRX, and has partnered with CVS.And Walgreens has partnered with a Blue Cross-backed PBM Prime Therapeutics to form a new mail order pharmacy company.Merlo and other CVS executives did not address any of the Aetna chatter on the conference call.But if the rumors are true -- and if an Aetna deal passed antitrust scrutiny -- then CVS appears to be on its way towards building a formidable health care/retail giant that may avoid getting Amazon-ed.
China, Goldman Sachs to invest $5 billion in U.S. manufacturing:::::Here's a Wall Street alliance with China that is sure to make President Trump smile.China's richest sovereign wealth fund is teaming up with Goldman Sachs to invest at least $5 billion in mostly U.S. manufacturing, a person familiar with the matter told CNNMoney.Trump has vowed to rejuvenate America's manufacturing industry, a promise that propelled him to win the White House amid strong support from the Rust Belt.China Investment Corp., better known as CIC, asked Goldman Sachs (GS) to partner with it on the private-equity fund, which will deploy money into manufacturing, industrial, consumer, healthcare and other U.S. businesses, the source said.It's not clear how much each firm will contribute to the fund.Goldman declined to comment, while CIC was not immediately available.News of the partnership, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and other American business leaders join Trump this week in China and other Asian nations.CIC and Goldman could unveil the manufacturing fund this week.Trump is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Wednesday for a series of meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping.As a candidate and since taking office, Trump has criticized the U.S. trade deficit with China and other major countries.The White House said that while in Beijing, Trump plans to stress his "determination to defend America's economic interests" as well as the "unsustainability of China's unfair trade practices."Related: Trump's trade flashpoints in Asia CIC had a staggering $813 billion in assets at the end of 2016, making it one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world.By working with Goldman Sachs, China could be hoping for an easier path to secure regulatory approval to invest in U.S. businesses.National security concerns have caused some previous Chinese deals to get rejected by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investments, which reviews takeovers of American companies by foreign entities.In September, the Trump administration prevented the takeover of an American chip maker by a private-equity firm with ties to China.
Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge:::::Saudi Arabia's dramatic anti-corruption purge took the business community by complete surprise.Saturday's arrest of princes, high-profile businessmen and government officials on suspicion of corruption was unprecedented.But the intended message was loud and clear: it's a new era for the kingdom."Nobody, a prince, minister or businessman can operate outside the law," said an aide close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is leading attempts to transform Saudi's economy, as well as the corruption probe."People should now realize there's a red-line when it comes to corruption," said the aide, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.The young crown prince wants to end what he once called an "addiction" to oil.Sweeping changes have already been introduced, including subsidy cuts, new taxes and the lifting of a controversial ban on women driving."If you are going to tax the average Saudi during this period of reform, then it's time to clean our own house, princes and all," said another aide to the crown prince, who also requested anonymity.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy At least 38 former, current or deputy ministers have been arrested on accusations of corruption.The list includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire businessman who owns 95% of Kingdom Holding, which has a global network of major investments including Citigroup (C), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Apple (AAPL, Tech30).Kingdom Holding's shares have fallen 12% in two days, wiping more than $1 billion off Alwaleed's fortune.The broader Saudi stock market fell initially on Sunday, before recovering to close slightly higher.It posted modest gains again Monday.The moves reflect uncertainty among investors about the fallout from the weekend's drama."It is surprisingly aggressive compared with what we have seen in the past," said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at London School of Economics and a specialist on finance in the Arab Gulf countries."There's been nothing like this in the past in any Arab Monarchy," he added.Among the detained are a former finance minister, and a former director of Saudi Airlines, as well as a top Saudi media mogul Waleed Al-Ibrahim.High stake moves The stakes are high.Saudi Arabia's economy is stagnating following the oil price crash, and it needs foreign investors to balance its books, help diversify its economy and buy shares in its massive oil company Aramco."The move against the princes makes sense," said Hertog."The move against the businessmen is riskier because it will affect the general confidence of the merchant class."Related: Trump to Saudi Arabia: Bring Aramco IPO to America Last month, Saudi Arabia hosted thousands of the world's top executives in a conference that was dubbed "Davos in the Desert."Cleaning up its act could help the country compete for business.The kingdom ranks well behind the United Arab Emirates and Qatar on the world's corruption index.It also need to build confidence among investors before selling a stake in its crown jewel, Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil company in the world.Officials have said they expect the IPO to value Aramco at around $2 trillion.In an exclusive interview with CNN, Saudi Foreign Minister al-Jubeir said investors have no reason to worry."I can assure you that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes very very seriously the issue of corruption, waste and mismanagement," he told CNN's Becky Anderson in Riyadh."We want companies to know that when they come to compete in Saudi Arabia they compete fair and square with any other company, and not be subject to people using their influence or position in order to extract better deals."
Queen's estate invested $13 million in offshore tax havens:::::Leaked documents published on Sunday suggest that the private estate of Queen Elizabeth II invested in offshore funds.Revelations from the leak, which has been dubbed the Paradise Papers, were reported by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and outlets including The New York Times.In Britain, the BBC said it had seen documents that show the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income, had invested 10 million ($13.1 million) into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.The documents have not been reviewed by CNN.The Queen has not been accused of any wrongdoing.But the investments are potentially embarrassing for a royal family that closely guards its reputation."We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds.All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate," the Duchy of Lancaster said in a statement.The Duchy added that the Queen, who is officially exempt from U.K. tax laws, "voluntarily pays tax" on income she receives from the estate.The 519 million ($680 million) Duchy, which provides the Queen with an income to cover official expenses, says it invests primarily in commercial, agricultural and residential properties.In the most recent fiscal year, the Duchy generated 19.2 million ($25 million) in net income according to its website.Related: What you need to know about the Paradise Papers One of the Duchy's offshore investments has generated some controversy.The BBC reported that the Duchy invested $7.5 million in Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP in 2005.The fund, which invested in medical and tech companies, later put money into U.K. retailer BrightHouse.The Duchy said its investment in the company is worth 3,208 ($4,200).BrightHouse, which gave customers credit so they could buy its home furniture and appliances, was later forced to compensate consumers after the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority found it was not a responsible lender."We sincerely apologize to those customers who were affected," the company said in October."We're absolutely determined that this doesn't happen again and have made significant improvements over the last 18 months."The Duchy said in a statement that the investment in BrightHouse was made "through a third party," and equates to just 0.0006% of the Duchy's value.The ICIJ noted in its report that "there are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts," and it was not suggesting that any people or companies it named either broke the law or acted improperly.David Pitt Watson, an executive fellow at the London Business School who focuses on responsible investments, said he "very much" doubts that the Queen knew where her money was invested.Instead, she's like "so many others who have a pension, or an investment account," he said."We just don't know what is being done with it."The Paradise Papers reporting is similar to the Panama Papers, which in 2016 exposed cases involving celebrities and business executives who reportedly moved large chunks of their wealth into offshore tax havens.The new project, which is based on more than 13.4 million documents dated from 1950 to 2016, covers a large number of global corporations and prominent people and their use of offshore accounts.-- Max Foster contributed reporting.
Trump's trade flashpoints in Asia:::::President Trump hates trade deficits -- and he's visiting a region where the U.S. has a lot of them.The U.S. runs deficits with all five countries where Trump is spending time on his lengthy tour of Asia, including particularly big ones with China and Japan.Experts say Trump's fixation on trade balances as a way of viewing economic ties between countries is misplaced and risks undermining the broader relationships.But that's not stopping him from complaining about the issue during his Asia trip.Related: Asia braces for Trump's trade trash talk "Try

Qatar Airways is buying nearly 10% of Cathay Pacific:::::After its attempt to cozy up to American Airlines was rebuffed, Qatar Airways has turned its attentions elsewhere.Facing problems in some Middle Eastern markets, the state-owned Gulf carrier announced Monday it's buying almost 10% of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific (CPCAY) for $5.2 billion Hong Kong dollars ($662 million).The deal makes Qatar Airways the third-biggest shareholder in Cathay after Swire Pacific (SWRAY), a conglomerate that holds a majority stake, and Air China (AIRYY).It also gives the Middle Eastern airline a stronger link to China, which is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's largest aviation market within five years.The Cathay move comes three months after Qatar Airways dropped its efforts to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines (AAL), whose CEO Doug Parker publicly knocked back the interest.U.S. airlines have engaged in a public fight with their Gulf rivals in recent years, accusing them of unfairly benefiting from billions of dollars in government subsidies.Related: Qatar Airways nixes plan to buy 10% stake in American Airlines Qatar Airways has also suffered from the major diplomatic crisis that has roiled its home country.Powerful neighbors including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties and imposed a partial embargo on Qatar earlier this year, alleging Qatari support for terrorism.Qatar Airways is now banned from flying into those countries."Qatar Airways faces greater pressure to broaden its global footprint and a need to demonstrate its financial strength," said Corrine Png, an analyst at research firm Crucial Perspective.However, Cathay investors didn't take the news well.Shares plunged as much as 4.8% in Monday morning trading as the deal raises questions about the struggling Hong Kong airline's long-term strategy.The shares closed down 1.5%.The Qatar investment dampens speculation about a possible takeover of Cathay by Air China, wrote UBS analyst Eric Lin in a note to clients.That possibility has helped drive Cathay's share price up more than 25% so far this year.Png said that Qatar Airways is likely to be a vocal shareholder and will seek to influence Cathay's business strategy.That could complicate the Asian airline's turnaround efforts."Shareholder meetings are going to get complicated for Cathay," she said.The airline made a loss of 575 million Hong Kong dollars ($74 million) in its most recent financial year and is cutting hundreds of jobs in a bid to slash costs.It has struggled in recent years in the face of rising competition from mainland Chinese carriers.Qatar Airways' CEO Akbar Al Baker is known for his outspoken views on the industry.Earlier this year he described U.S. airlines as "crap."Related: Check out Singapore Airlines' new luxury suites Png added that Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific could both benefit from the tie-up by feeding traffic into each others' networks.A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific declined to comment on the deal beyond a stock market filing the company issued.Spokespeople for Qatar Airways and Air China didn't immediately respond to requests for additional information.The Cathay deal isn't the first foreign excursion for Qatar Airways.The airline already owns 20% of International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, and 20% of South America's LATAM Airlines (LTM).Qatar Airways is buying the Cathay stake from Hong Kong industrial firm Kingboard Chemicals, according to a stock market filing.
Trump wants Japan to build more cars in the U.S.:::::President Trump delivered a rebuke to Japan Inc. on Monday."Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over.Is that possible to ask?That's not rude.Is that rude?I don't think so," Trump told executives from local automakers during a trip to Japan.At the same time, Trump thanked Japanese automakers for "building new plants and doing expansions" of existing facilities in the United States.He praised Toyota (TM) and Mazda (MZDAF) for planning a new $1.6 billion manufacturing plant in the U.S. Trump has made reducing the $57 billion trade deficit with Japan a top priority.But Japan's big three car companies have huge factories in the U.S., and their production in the country is at a record high.Japanese automakers have been increasing their investment in the U.S. for decades.The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association estimates that its members built nearly 4 million vehicles in the U.S. last year.Exports from Japan to the U.S. have fallen from 3.5 million cars a year in 1986 to just over 1.5 million in 2016.It said that three out of four Japanese cars sold in the U.S. last year were built in North America, including Mexico and Canada."Many Japanese cars are made in the U.S. already and this request is not reflective of today's reality," said Stephen Nagy, a professor at Tokyo's International Christian University.Nissan (NSANF) says that it sold 1.5 million vehicles in the U.S. last year, and made 1 million in the country -- although some of those were for export.Honda (HMC) locally manufactured 70% of the 1.2 million vehicles it sold in the U.S. in 2016.Toyota (TM), meanwhile, built 2.1 million cars at its North American plants last year.It didn't respond to a request for more detailed statistics.Trade with Japan is a major flash point for Trump, who is on a lengthy tour of Asia."Our trade with Japan is not fair and it's not open," he said Monday.Related: Asia braces for Trump's trade trash talk Foreign firms have been eager to play up their investments in the U.S. following the election of Trump, who blames lopsided trade agreements for decimating American industry and killing blue-collar jobs.Toyota, for example, is spending $1.3 billion to upgrade a facility in Kentucky.It has also scaled back a planned $700 million investment in a new manufacturing plant in Mexico.The U.S. runs deficits with all five countries that Trump will visit in Asia, including a particularly big one with China.-- Correction: The original version of this article and its headline did not make clear that President Trump had praised Japanese automakers for expanding existing U.S. facilities and for making new investments in the U.S.The article and headline have been updated.
Russian billionaire linked to Paul Manafort eyes London IPO:::::The Russians are coming to London.EN+, a sprawling industrial firm that specializes in aluminum production and hydro-electric power, is preparing to go public in London.The holding company, which will sell stock in London and Moscow, has priced its shares at $14 ahead of the November 8 debut.The listing by EN+ is generating interest for two reasons: It could signal a return of Russian companies to London, and the firm is controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a business associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Manafort, who provided investment and consulting services to Deripaska, worked for the Russian billionaire about a decade ago, according to both men.Deripaska, a physicist by training, is a survivor.He emerged from the notoriously tumultuous Russian aluminum wars of the 1990s with a massive fortune, which Forbes estimated at $28 billion in 2008.Soon after, a sharp decline in commodities prices during the financial crisis would cause his net worth to plummet.Asked by the Financial Times in 2010 how close he came to going out of business, Deripaska said: "Very close."He has since recovered his footing.Forbes says the aluminum magnate is now worth about $6.5 billion, and the share price for his company's IPO implies a valuation of $8 billion.Related: Did Russia make this ship disappear?Deripaska is a subject of political intrigue in the United States because he has a longstanding relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.In an indictment unsealed this week, Manafort was charged with counts including money laundering and filing false foreign lobbying reports.The charges stem from an investigation into attempted Russian election meddling conducted by special counsel Bob Mueller.Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which are not related to Russian election meddling.The Associated Press reported in March that Manafort pitched Deripaska as early as 2005 with a plan that he said would benefit the Putin government.The AP said that Manafort was subsequently paid millions of dollars.Deripaska has published an open letter on his website in which he denies ever having seen the Manafort plan, and describes the AP story as an "easy conflation of truth, falsehood and anti-Russian innuendo.""I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments.My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests," Manafort said in a statement in March.Related: 'Kill them all' - Russian-linked Facebook accounts called for violence London was once a favorite destination for Russian companies seeking to raise cash, with company executives viewing the market as a prestige venue for listing their firms.It has fallen out of favor in recent years, however, after the U.S. and European Union sanctioned Russia following the annexation of Crimea.EN+, which is attempting to raise $1.5 billion, would be the first major listing since sanctions were imposed, according to Dealogic.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos just sold $1.1 billion worth of his stock:::::Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the newly minted richest person in the world, just sold more than $1 billion worth of his stock.The sale was made public in a filing posted Friday.In total, Bezos let go of one million shares for $1,097,803,365.Exactly how Bezos plans to spend those Benjamins wasn't clear.But it isn't unprecedented for him to sell such a large chunk.In May, he sold more than a million shares.A similar sale was executed in August 2016.Even after his most recent sell off, Bezos still personally owns about a 16% of Amazon, which he founded in 1994.Bezos's large ownership stake helped vault him past Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index.Related: Jeff Bezos just passed Bill Gates for world's richest person His wealth spiked last week when Amazon stock jumped 13.5% after a stellar earnings report.Thanks to the stock surge, Bezos's net worth climbed more than $10 billion to a total of more than $90 billion.For comparison, Bill Gates is currently worth about $88 billion.One possible destination for the cash Bezos just freed up is his commercial space company, Blue Origin.Earlier this year, Bezos told reporters at a space symposium that he sells about $1 billion per year worth of Amazon stock to fund the company, according to Reuters.Related: Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin test fires game-changing rocket engine Blue Origin was founded more than a decade ago, but has yet to complete its first mission.The outfit's initial goal is to send tourists to the edge of space on a sub-orbital rocket, called New Shepherd.So far, the company has conducted only unmanned test launches.Last month, Blue Origin Chief Executive Officer Bob Smith said he expects the first manned flight to take place by April 2019.Blue Origin may need cash for new endeavors in its pipeline.The firm is looking to build a much larger rocket, dubbed New Glenn, that will be capable of carrying satellites into orbit.That would allow Blue Origin to compete with the likes of SpaceX and United Launch Alliance for lucrative launch contracts.Another possible use for Bezos's cash is charity.The tech mogul said in June that he wants to start putting some cash behind philanthropic efforts, and he asked his Twitter followers for advice."I'm thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now -- short term -- at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact," he wrote.
Horror show just won't end for Macy's and Nordstrom:::::1.More trouble in mall land: Wall Street is bracing for more signs of the retail apocalypse this week when Macy's and Nordstrom JWN Worse than slumping sales, department stores are likely to paint a gloomy picture about their busiest and most critical time of the year.Morgan Stanley recently warned that sales will outright decline during the holiday quarter at both Macy's (M) and Nordstrom.The obvious reason for shrinking sales is that fewer and fewer Americans are heading to the malls to do their Christmas shopping.Instead of battling the crowds, they're finding great deals and more convenience on Amazon and elsewhere online.Not only is online shopping growing more popular, but Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is becoming an increasingly-powerful player, despite serious efforts by Walmart (WMT) and other traditional retailers to catch up.Boosted by innovations like Alexa and its Dash buttons, Amazon is expected to capture 35% of total e-commerce sales during the fourth quarter, according to Morgan Stanley.That's up from about 20% in early 2016.Amazon has become such a dominant player that Morgan Stanley estimates it accounts for half of all U.S. retail growth, up from just 17% in 2013.No wonder why investors are fleeing department stores and flocking to Amazon, whose stock is up 48% this year.Macy's stock is down by almost exactly the same amount, while Nordstrom is off by 20%.The environment is so bleak right now for brick-and-mortar retailers that Nordstrom has suspended its efforts to go private.The department store had hoped to reinvent itself to avoid the harsh scrutiny of Wall Street, but financing dried up following the Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy.Nearly 7,000 stores have already closed this year, taking out the previous record set during the 2008 financial crisis.That trend may not be done yet.2.Trump's tax bill goes under the microscope: The House Ways and Means Committee will begin its markup of the GOP tax plan on Monday.As it stands now, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, increase the standard deduction for individuals and households and eventually repeal the estate tax.The committee has its work cut out for it.President Trump promised that a tax reform bill would be completed by Christmas, but he noted that "there is much work left to do."And some Republicans have already voiced opposition -- Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York tweeted that he plans to vote against the bill in its current form because of its elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes, also known as SALT.Some business groups have also come out against the bill.The National Association of Home Builders called the plan "disappointing" because it doesn't do enough to support homeownership.3.Saudi arrests catch one of the world's richest men: Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has been arrested as part of an anti-corruption sweep in the kingdom.The billionaire businessman was among at least 17 Saudi princes and top officials detained on Saturday, according to a list obtained by CNN and cited by a senior royal court official.Prince Alwaleed owns major stakes in such companies as Apple, Twitter and Citigroup.Reports of his arrest saw $750 million wiped off his fortune Sunday.On Saturday, Saudi Arabia announced the formation of an anti-corruption committee by King Salman bin Abudlaziz Al-Saud.King Salman ordered the purge as part of an "active reform agenda aimed at tackling a persistent problem that has hindered development efforts in the Kingdom in recent decades," the Saudi Ministry of Communications said in a statement.4.Trump rally anniversary: Like the political pundits who wrongly called a Hillary Clinton victory, the market gurus got it wrong too.Many incorrectly warned a President Trump would mean a nosedive on Wall Street.Although stocks did initially freak out on election night, the losses vanished by morning and stocks started the Trump era with a burst of buying.(One guy who got it right: Former Trump adviser Carl Icahn, who literally left the election party early to place bullish bets on the market.)Early on, the Trump rally was a massive bet on his pro-business promises to slash corporate taxes, rip up regulation and unleash infrastructure spending.Investors largely ignored his market-unfriendly proposals on trade and immigration.Stocks continued to hit new heights as the economy gained steam and corporate profits are boomed -- even as Trump's legislative agenda largely faltered.All told, the S&P 500 has soared about 21% since Trump's election.That's its third-best performance under a new president, behind President George H.W.Bush and President John F. Kennedy, according to CFRA Research.Trump touched down in Japan Saturday as part of a 13-day trek through Asia.He hopes to consolidate support in Asia for his combative approach to North Korea and to lay out an assertive approach to negotiate trade agreements.5.Economic snapshot: The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to reveal job openings and labor turnover data for September 2017 on Tuesday, following the best jobs report of the Trump administration.The turnover rates have been fairly steady this summer.In August, there were 6.1 million open jobs and 5.4 million new hires.We'll also get a sense of how far people are willing to stretch their wallets with the release of the University of Michigan's monthly consumer survey.So far, American shoppers have been feeling good: Confidence ticked up by 5.9% from September to October, and increased 15.5% from October 2016 to the same period this year.Not a bad way to enter the holiday season.6.CVS, Disney and other earnings to watch: Several high-profile brands are set to discuss their earnings this week.A few are especially worth keeping an eye on: CVS (CVS) is set to report on Monday, and the pharmacy's executives could be grilled on news that CVS may buy Aetna in the largest American health insurance deal of all time.Etsy (ETSY) is also set to share financial results on Monday, soon after Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) announced a new handcrafted section that sent Etsy shares tumbling On Thursday, Disney (DIS) plans to share its fourth quarter financials.CEO Bob Iger warned in September that earnings could be flat this quarter.Investors fear that could be due in part to ESPN's poor performance -- the network has been shedding subscribers, and spent much of the fall embroiled in political controversy.7.Coming this week: Monday -- Ways and Means Committee begins markup of tax bill; CVS, Etsy and Weight Watchers (WTW) report earnings Tuesday -- Snap (SNAP) earnings; JOLTS report Wednesday -- First anniversary of the presidential election Thursday -- Nordstrom, Macy's, Disney and News Corp (NWS) earnings Friday -- Consumer confidence survey
Saudi Prince Alwaleed arrested in anti-corruption drive:::::Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has been arrested as part of an anti-corruption sweep in the kingdom.The billionaire businessman was among at least 17 Saudi princes and top officials detained on Saturday, according to a list obtained by CNN and cited by a senior royal court official.Reports of his arrest saw $750 million wiped off Alwaleed's fortune Sunday.Shares in the prince's Kingdom Holding company fell as much as 9.9%, before closing down 7.6% in Riyadh.Alwaleed owns 95% of Kingdom Holding, which holds stakes in global companies, including Citigroup, (C) Twitter, (TWTR, Tech30) Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and New York's Plaza Hotel.The remaining 5% is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange.Kingdom Holding was worth about $10 billion before Sunday's share price drop.Kingdom Holding released a statement after the market closed saying that while it was aware of media reports concerning Alwaleed, the firm would continue its normal operations.Related: Saudi Arabia says it has a new investor: Richard Branson Alwaleed is a grandson of the Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud.The prince does not hold a government position, but his investment portfolio has made him an influential voice inside his home country.His personal fortune is estimated at over $17 billion, according to Forbes.Alwaleed got his start in business in 1979, making investments in Saudi real estate and construction.But he quickly turned to banking.The prince captured Wall Street's attention by becoming one of Citi's major shareholders in 1991, a bet that would pay off handsomely.Later, when the global financial crisis caused the bank's shares to plummet, the prince increased his stake in a show of confidence.Citi survived.Alwaleed has also courted controversy on occasion, suing Forbes for libel in 2013 after it said he was worth only $20 billion.In 2015, he urged Donald Trump to drop out of the presidential race, calling him a "disgrace" over threats to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.In response, Trump called the prince "dopey."In Saudi Arabia, Alwaleed advocated for giving women more freedoms, including calling for an end to the country's ban on driving.The ban was lifted in September following a royal decree.Alwaleed wasn't the only prominent Saudi to be caught in the anti-corruption drive.Three ministers have been removed from their positions, and tens of former ministers were detained as part of the campaign initiated by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud.The arrest orders came from a committee, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that has the authority to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.The crown prince is pushing a ambitious reform plan, Vision 2030, that is aimed at reducing the country's dependence on oil over the next decade.Related: Saudi Arabia wants to build a $500 billion mega-city spanning 3 countries Saudi Arabia's Attorney General, Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, said the committee had begun a number of investigations in a bid to combat corruption."Everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and everyone's legal rights will be preserved," he said in a statement.King Salman ordered the anti-corruption purge as part of an "active reform agenda aimed at tackling a persistent problem that has hindered development efforts in the Kingdom in recent decades," the Saudi Ministry of Communications said in a statement.--Becky Anderson and Sarah El Sirgany contributed to this report.
These powerful business groups hate the GOP tax plan:::::President Trump argues the GOP tax overhaul will "create tremendous success for companies."Yet some of America's most powerful business alliances are already trying to kill the bill.The instant opposition of well-organized and deep-pocketed lobbying groups threatens to delay or even derail passage of the legislation, which House Republicans unveiled on Thursday.Three of the country's largest and most influential business groups have already come out against the GOP bill."These three groups aren't 'lean no' -- they are full-blown, burn-it-to-the ground 'no'," Chris Krueger, managing director of the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a report on Friday.This hostility underscores why it's so difficult to get tax reform done: entrenched interests will always fight tooth and nail to keep coveted tax breaks.Yet tax loopholes need to be closed to pay for the corporate and individual tax cuts promised.The GOP bill would permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, consolidate income tax brackets for individuals from seven to four and repeal or limits many deductions.Analysts believe business opposition, combined with concern from Republicans in high-tax states, will make it tough for the GOP to pass meaningful reform by year-end -- the party's latest self-imposed deadline.The initial reaction from "livid lobbyists" and others suggest it's "farcical" that Congress will enact tax legislation before 2018, Isaac Boltansky, senior policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a report.Here's why some business groups are voicing serious concern about Trump's effort to revamp the tax system: Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses Big problems for small business: Owners of mom-and-pop shops worry the tax bill doesn't fix a system they feel already favors big business.The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses in the U.S., wasted little time saying it can't support the tax legislation "in its current form.""This bill leaves too many small businesses behind," Juanita Duggan, the groups' president and CEO, said in a statement.Most small businesses are set up as "pass-throughs," meaning their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them through their personal returns.The GOP tax bill slashes the pass-through tax rate to 25%.However, small business owners fear this won't help the vast majority of them because most already pay taxes at a 25% rate or less."This proposal would primarily help wealthy individuals rather than small businesses," according to John Arensmeyer, CEO of the Small Business Majority, another advocacy group.Housing trouble: While Trump often brags about record highs on Wall Street, the tax plan he endorsed was greeted poorly by the homebuilding stocks.Toll Brothers (TOL), KB Home (KBH) and other builders tumbled this week because the tax bill would limit key tax breaks that favor homebuyers.Specifically, the legislation calls for capping the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000 instead of $1 million.It would also limit the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000.The fear, at least in the housing industry, is that these tax breaks could sap demand for pricey homes, especially in expensive markets.Many of those markets, such as San Francisco and Manhattan, are in high-tax states.That's a problem because the GOP tax plan would eliminate state income tax deductions altogether.The National Association of Home Builders warned the GOP tax plan "slams the middle class" by hurting home values.The group complained that Republicans didn't include its proposal to replace the mortgage deductions with a tax credit."This tax reform plan will put millions of home owners at risk," said Granger MacDonald, chairman of the NAHB.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people Realtors really mad: The GOP proposal to cap the mortgage interest deduction is also riling up the vast real estate industry.Echoing the arguments made by the home builders, the National Association of Realtors complained that the plan "threatens home values and takes money straight from the pockets of homeowners."The concern for realtors is that a slowdown in housing could hurt their income or even employment prospects.It's a major employer.There are about 2 million active real estate licensees in the U.S., according to the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials.The NAR alone represents 1.3 million realtors.The White House has argued that Americans don't buy homes for the tax breaks, they do it because they feel confident about the economy.Nonetheless, the tax bill "fundamentally alters the tax benefits of homeownership," according to Compass Point's Boltansky.Expect the "housing industrial complex fighting ferociously," he said.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.
Americans still waiting for a bigger raise:::::Many Americans are still waiting to see a bigger paycheck.They may have to keep waiting.The government said that average hourly earnings -- another way of saying wages -- rose 2.4% over the past 12 months.That's a slip from the 2.9% increase reported in September.And it remains below the 3% to 3.5% range that many agree is normal in a truly healthy economy.The last time wages were up more than 3% year-over-year was in April 2009, just as the economy was emerging from the depths of the global banking crisis that fueled the Great Recession.It's a bit puzzling though.Why have wages remained stagnant even though many other indicators of the job market and broader economy look healthy?Unemployment continues to drop.The housing market is vibrant.And stocks continue to soar.John Bellows, a portfolio manager at Western Asset, thinks there a couple of things at play.Bellows argues that the impact of globalization, more automation and an increased number of people working part-time (the so-called gig economy) are keeping wages in check.Related: U.S. unemployment rate drops to lowest level in 17 years He adds that this isn't something that the Federal Reserve can solve.The U.S. economy is already at what most would consider to be "full employment."And the Fed is now actually raising rates -- something that will likely continue if Jerome Powell, President Trump's nominee to replace Fed chair Janet Yellen early next year, is confirmed by the Senate.That's why Bellows and others think lawmakers and President Trump need to take action to improve American wages."I'm not sure how much the Fed can do to increase wages," Bellows said."But we shouldn't be defeatist about it.It's now just mostly up to Congress."Erik Weisman, chief economist at MFS, says that if tax reform passes and leads to lower corporate tax rates, big multinational U.S. companies may bring back to the U.S. cash that's sitting overseas, and use it to boost salaries and hire more workers.Related: Here's what's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses "Lower taxes could incentivize companies to keep profits onshore and invest more domestically," Weisman said."If multinationals felt they had better visibility for U.S. demand, then they would have a greater need for building out capacity, and that might necessitate higher wages."Just look at Apple, (AAPL, Tech30) for example.The iPhone maker reported Thursday it has nearly $269 billion in cash.CFO Luca Maestri said during the company's earnings call that $252 billion -- 94% of it -- is stashed overseas.But Weisman conceded that there is a bit of a chicken versus egg problem that lower taxes may not solve.Global growth will need to keep rebounding in order for companies to feel more confident and do more with their cash than just hoard it.Many companies may also choose to reward shareholders with bigger stock buybacks and dividend increases instead of investing in labor.Still, Matt Schreiber, president and chief investment strategist of WBI Investments, thinks there's another problem.Now that companies are hiring again, people who had been unemployed or underemployed may be returning to the workforce for lower salaries simply because they're excited to have a job."More people are getting jobs that underpay and are not making what they used to," Schreiber said.Related: Inequality among America's seniors is getting worse He added that businesses are still waiting to see if recent signs of U.S. economic improvement -- two consecutive quarters of annualized growth of at least 3% -- is sustainable."The real issue for companies is that we've still had relatively anemic growth.That makes it difficult to increase overhead," Schreiber said, adding that he is also hoping "corporate tax cuts could turbocharge the economy and wage growth."There are some hopeful signs though.Matt Toms, chief investment officer of fixed income for Voya Investment Management, said it is good to see that more states and cities are raising their minimum wages, as are giant American employers like Walmart (WMT) and McDonald's (MCD).But the average hourly workweek has remained relatively flat over the past few months, stuck around 34.4 hours.Toms suggests that some employers could be limiting worker hours in light of wage increases in order to keep labor costs in check."We'd be more encouraged if there was even more wage growth.It's needed at this part of the economic cycle," Toms said.
Apple crosses $900 billion. Next stop: $1 trillion?:::::Apple's market value on Friday briefly topped $900 billion for the first time.The company crossed that threshold after it reported strong sales and profits, and gave a healthy outlook thanks to solid demand for its new iPhone X.Is it on its way to becoming the first $1 trillion company in the U.S.?Apple would only have to go up another 11% or so to top the trillion dollar mark.Shares of Apple (AAPL, Tech30) rose 3% thanks to its blockbuster quarterly results.Investors are clearly pleased by the mostly good reviews for the iPhone X and the long lines of customers around the globe eager to get their hands on the new phone.Apple also wowed Wall Street with strong growth of its Mac computers, iPads and services division.And the company has more than $268 billion in cash that it can use for future investments, higher dividends and bigger stock buybacks.Apple's shares are now up nearly 50% this year, making it one of the best performers in the Dow.But it's not the only tech giant that's posting eye-popping numbers.Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) is up more than 30% this year.The company is now worth more than $715 billion.Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) has surged 35% and has a market value of nearly $650 billion.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has shot up 45% and is now worth more than $525 billion.Facebook (FB, Tech30) has soared 55% and has a market value of about $520 billion.And China's Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) has more than doubled this year and is approaching a half a trillion dollar market cap, too.
Asia stocks pause at peaks, ponder U.S. tax muddle:::::SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares paused at decade peaks and the dollar dipped on Wednesday amid concerns Republican plans for major U.S. tax cuts were running into headwinds even before the Senate releases its own version of the proposals.A man walks past an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, September 22, 2017.REUTERS/Toru Hanai Investors were also keeping a wary eye on Saudi Arabias sweeping anti-graft purge and an escalation of tensions with Iran, though oil prices did ease from their highs.Dealers said EMini futures for the S&P 500 ESc1 slipped 0.2 percent on a report by the Washington Post that Senate Republican leaders were considering a one-year delay in the implementation of a corporate tax cut, a centerpiece of the House plan.MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS eased 0.05 percent having hit its highest since November 2007 on Tuesday.Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 0.4 percent, though that followed a jump to its best close since 1992.The main event in Asia will be Chinese trade figures for October which will give a read on the state of global trade and on whether Chinese demand for commodities is holding up.Chinas exports are seen rising 7.2 percent on a year ago, with imports up a solid 16 percent.Investors will also keep an eye on President Donald Trump as he wraps up his visit to Seoul on Wednesday and then head to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang over the reclusive states belligerent pursuit of nuclear weapons.In the currency market, trading was described as a random walk by analysts at Citi with no clear trends to follow.The dollar was a slim 0.1 percent lower at 94.826 .DXY against a basket of currencies, having again failed to clear resistance around 95.150.It was 0.2 percent lower on the yen at 113.76 JPY=, but well within the 112.96/114.74 range of the past 12 sessions.The euro touched a four-month trough at $1.1552 overnight in the wake of disappointing German industrial data, but quickly steadied in Asia to around $1.1597 EUR=.Wall Street had taken a breather on Tuesday after again making record peaks.The Dow .DJI ended up 0.04 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.02 percent and the Nasdaq .IXIC 0.27 percent.The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY led decliners with a 1.33 percent fall, in part on concerns a flattening yield curve would crimp profits at banks that borrow short to lend long.The U.S. yield curve has flattened sharply in the last couple of weeks, with the gap between two- and 10-year yields shrinking to just 68 basis points, the smallest since 2007.The move largely reflects wagers the Fed is determined to hike in December, pushing up short-term yields.Such a move was likely to ensure inflation stays lower for longer, thus pulling down longer-dated yields and flattening the curve.Flatter curves are sometimes harbingers of slower economic growth, but can also signal excessive risk taking as investors lend for longer and longer in search of better returns.Oil markets were dominated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmans move to shore up his power base with the arrest of royals, ministers and investors, which an official described as part of phase one of a crackdown.Tensions also escalated between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran, which analysts said did more to rattle the oil market than the princes purge.[O/R] After reaching a two-and-a-half year top on Monday, Brent crude futures LCOc1 had pulled back a touch to $63.69 a barrel.U.S. crude CLc1 was off 14 cents at $57.06.
Snapchat launches redesign as growth disappoints Wall Street:::::(Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) is redesigning its disappearing-message app Snapchat in an attempt to reach a broader audience, going back to the drawing board after being clobbered by Wall Street for another quarter of slowing user growth.A woman stands in front of the logo of Snap Inc. on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while waiting for Snap Inc. to post their IPO, in New York City, NY, U.S. March 2, 2017.REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The Venice, California-based firm, which had the hottest debut of any tech stock in years in March, reported revenue and user growth for the third quarter well below Wall Street expectations as it struggles to compete with Facebook Incs (FB.O) Instagram.The disappointing financials and announcement of the redesign sent shares down as much as 20 percent in after-hours trading.They rebounded partially to $12.57, still well below the initial public offering price of $17 in March.Snaps user growth in the last three months was about half what investment analysts expected.Daily active users rose to 178 million in the third quarter from 173 million in the second quarter.Analysts had expected 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company was launching the redesign after hearing for years that Snapchat was difficult to understand or hard to use.We are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day, Spiegel, 27, said in written remarks prepared for a call with investment analysts.He said that there was a strong likelihood the redesign would be disruptive in the short term, but that Snap was willing to take the risk for long-term gain.Such a radical change so soon after an IPO is unusual.But Snap is not the only social media company looking to revive growth by changing its look.Microblogging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world, double the length of its iconic 140-character tweets.Asked on the analyst call what the redesign would look like, Spiegel offered no details but said the company had been studying the evolution of mobile content feeds such as Twitter streams and the Facebook News Feed.Theres a really exciting opportunity here for another evolution, he said.REVENUE MISS Revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertisements, rose to $207.9 million from $128.2 million.Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $236.9 million.Snaps average revenue per user rose to $1.17 in the latest quarter, from 84 cents a year earlier, but missed analysts average estimate of $1.30.Snap Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said revenue was affected by a shift toward a software-based auction system for selling ads - a method employed by Facebook and Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google - which has driven down the average price.The auction system hit revenue in the short term but builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue, Khan said in written remarks.The amount of ads in Snapchat compared to non-ad content, known as ad load, remains very low, Spiegel said.Snap recorded a $39.9 million charge in the quarter related to inventory of its hardware product Spectacles.The company said it misjudged strong early demand and ended up buying more of the product than it could sell.Snaps Spectacles, at $129.99 a pair, are sunglasses with a video camera on one corner.They allow users to take 10-second videos with the press of a button on the frame, which are then saved to users Snapchat account.INVESTORS SOUR In its third earnings report since the company went public in March with a $3.4 billion valuation, Snap posted a net loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $124.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.Wall Street had expected a loss of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Snapchat, popular among millennials for the bunny faces and floral tiaras that people can add to pictures, allows users to chat through a series of disappearing photos and videos.Users can also post images and videos as stories - ephemeral posts that can be viewed in chronological order and that disappear after 24 hours.Investors view of Snap has soured since its IPO.Before the quarterly release, Snaps share price was already down 39 percent from its close on March 2, its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Facebooks shares were up 32 percent over that time.Facebooks Instagram said in September that it had 500 million daily active users.As of June, Instagram Stories - a replica of Snapchats synonymous feature - had 250 million daily users, up from 200 million in April, according to the company.
Sky says it could shut Sky News if Fox takeover blocked:::::LONDON (Reuters) - British broadcaster Sky SKYB.L.has said that it could shut down Sky News if its ownership of the channel proves to be an obstruction to the companys 11.7 billion-pound ($15.4 billion) takeover by Rupert Murdochs Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O).FILE PHOTO: The Sky logo is seen outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017.REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo Foxs 10.75 pound-a-share bid to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own is being investigated by Britains Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is examining whether the takeover would have an adverse impact on the countrys plurality of media ownership and broadcasting standards.Murdoch-controlled News Corp (NWSA.O) also owns The Times and The Sun newspapers in Britain.In a submission made to the CMA last month but published by the regulator on Tuesday, Sky said it would likely be prompted to review its position in the event that the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Skys broader business.The Sky News logo is seen on the outside of offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017.REUTERS/Toby Melville The broadcaster said: The CMA should not in its assessment simply assume the continued provision of Sky News and its current contribution to plurality, absent the transaction.Foxs bid for full control of Sky has been beset by a series of obstacles, including the CMA investigation and opposition from some politicians.Sky shares slipped 1 percent to 930 pence on Tuesday after CNBC reported that Fox had recently held talks about selling to Walt Disney (DIS.N) some film and television assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, news that increased doubts over whether the Fox-Sky deal would get done.By threatening to shut down Sky News, the company has raised the prospect of closing an influential 24-hour, international channel that has been on air for 28 years.Sky says the channel reaches more than 107 million homes in 138 countries.Sky declined to say how many staff the channel employs.
Fox in the Mouse House could give Disney an edge in streaming wars:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) buys some Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) businesses, it could provide a quick path for the traditional media giant to create a substantial competitor to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in the battle for TV and movie viewers.FILE PHOTO: The Twenty-First Century Fox Studios flag flies over the company building in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson /File Photo The two companies reportedly held talks in recent weeks about a potential sale of Foxs FX and National Geographic channels, its movie studio and some other international assets to Disney, according to media reports.The discussions had stopped as of Monday but could restart, the reports said.Television viewers have been rapidly embracing online services like Netflix over traditional pay TV packages, a shift that is enticing deep-pocketed technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) into video offerings.Investors who have driven Netflix shares to record highs this year were selling on Tuesday, sending the companys stock down more than 2 percent.Disney and Fox shares rose roughly 1 percent each as analysts said a deal between the two media giants could benefit Disneys planned streaming push.It could be very formidable, said Bruce Tuchman, a media investor, entrepreneur and adviser to streaming services like iflix.They wouldnt have to leave the confines of their own company to build a competitive service.Disney announced in August it was pulling its first-run movies from Netflix starting in 2019 to put them on a Disney-branded service.With Fox, Disney in the future could yank Fox programming from Netflix and put shows like The Simpsons and movie franchises including Avatar alongside Disney classics such as Beauty and the Beast plus Star Wars and Marvel films.FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Disney store on the Champs Elysee is seen in Paris, France, March 3, 2016.REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo That would leave a hole in Netflix.Fox made up 17 percent of Netflixs top-rated shows by IMDb as of June, while Disney made up 7 percent, according to MoffettNathanson and YipitData.Disney and Fox also each own roughly 25 percent of streaming service Hulu, which could serve as another platform for content.Disney, Fox and Netflix had no comment.In August, Netflixs chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, told Reuters that his company was investing more in its own programming to counter moves by traditional media companies.Thats why we got into the originals business five years ago, anticipating it may be not as easy a conversation with studios and networks to license their programming, Sarandos said.Netflix plans to spend $8 billion on content next year, the company has said.Disney spent $13.5 billion on content in fiscal 2017, about half of it on sports programming, according to MoffettNathanson estimates.Disney will be starting its online service more than a decade after Netflix, which now boasts 109 million streaming customers around the world.Disney could expand its global reach if it acquires Fox TV channel Star India and the companys stake in European pay TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L), which already has made inroads in the streaming market.Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said Disney needs to buy a film library from Fox or another big company to compete directly with Netflix.Disneys libraries are very high quality, but they are very small, Martin said.They could not do it alone.
Alphabet's Waymo to launch robotaxis with no human in driver's seat:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Incs Waymo will launch a ride-hailing service with no human behind the steering wheel and has been testing the fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said on Tuesday.FILE PHOTO: Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The test without a human in the drivers seat is a first in the United States as large tech companies, big automakers and well-funded startups race to develop fully autonomous cars.While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the drivers seat ready to take over if the technology fails.Waymo said members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans without human drivers in a test run of the service in the next few months in certain areas of Phoenix, Arizona, which has dry, predictable weather.Developers are still grappling with vehicle performance in snow or heavy rain.Members of the public taking part in the companys trial in Phoenix will be its first customers, using a ride-hailing app.At first, those passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually they will travel alone, although they will be able to hit a button to stop the car.It will roll out the service to the wider public at a later date, although it did not say when.FILE PHOTO: Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The service will be free at first, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides, a potential way to earn revenue to help offset the steep costs involved in developing the technology.The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, unlike California and some other states.Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymos fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service, Krafcik said in prepared remarks after announcing the launch in Lisbon.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately comment on Tuesday but said in September last year that conventionally designed vehicles that can be operated autonomously faced no specific federal legal barrier.With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymos self-driving car operations.General Motors Co, which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year, has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in October the company aims to take the driver out of its self-driving vehicles in quarters, not years.The carmakers goal for its Cruise self-driving car unit is to safely develop and deploy self-driving cars at scale in dense, urban environments, not suburbs.
Online travel sites getting squeezed by Airbnb, hotel chains:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online travel booking sites Priceline Group and TripAdvisor took a beating from investors on Tuesday, highlighting how the companies once industry-disrupting model is under growing pressure from other competitors.A 3D printed people's models are seen in front of a displayed Airbnb logo in this illustration taken, June 8, 2016.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Shares of TripAdvisor (TRIP.O) fell 23 percent on Tuesday, while shares in Priceline (PCLN.O) declined 13.5 percent.Rival Expedia Incs (EXPE.O) shares skidded another 2.74 percent and are down 19 percent since Oct. 26, the day before the company reported weaker-than-expected third quarter results.Though the circumstances at the three companies vary, they all are encountering increased competition from sites such as Airbnb and others that offer alternatives to traditional hotels.Hotel chains also are putting up a tougher fight for the online sites business.Were a big business now, Priceline Chief Executive Officer Glenn Fogel said on the groups third-quarter call on Monday.And as one finds in large numbers, (growth) rates naturally slow down.TripAdvisor Chief Financial Officer Ernst J. Teunissen warned investors during its quarterly earnings call that its year-over-year revenue per shopper had fallen 11 percent in the third quarter.Companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT.N) have become more aggressive in drawing customers from the third-party sites, offering incentives including free wifi and discounted pricing to make it more attractive for consumers to book a room directly through their mobile apps or websites.Hilton has for the third time this year raised its full-year profit forecast and said business travel to its properties had improved in the months following the U.S. presidential election in November 2016.The highest growth that were seeing on a year-to-date basis continues to be in our direct channels.And I think well continue to see that if we do our job, said Hilton Chief Executive Officer Christopher Nassetta on the groups third-quarter earnings call late last month.He added that there was still value in third-party agencies as long as they operated on reasonable economic terms.Hotels are driving harder bargains in negotiations on commissions paid to third-party sites, analysts said.The hotels have been fairly effective at recapturing some of the share that would have gone to an online travel agent, Raymond James and Associates analyst Justin Patterson said in a telephone interview.To attract customers, the online travel sites said they were spending more on advertising, including television commercials.Priceline told investors it increased its brand advertising spending by 55 percent in the third quarter to build brand awareness and drive traffic to its websites.Privately held rental company Airbnb enjoyed another successful summer, Patterson said.It raised an additional $1 billion in its latest round of funding in March, putting the companys value at $31 billion.While traditional online travel agents have made efforts to attract vacation rental consumers - from Expedias acquisition of HomeAway to Pricelines growing portfolio of owned properties - Airbnb still dominates the market.
Twitter to roll out 280-character tweets worldwide:::::(Reuters) - Microblogging website Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), known for its iconic 140-character tweets, said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world.FILE PHOTO: People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken in Warsaw September 27, 2013.REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/File Photo Twitter said it ran a test on 280-character tweets in September that showed users spent less time editing their tweets and were less likely to abandon them.(bit.ly/2zkXZIj) User posting in languages including Japanese, Korean and Chinese, which do not face the issue of cramming, will continue to have a limit of 140 characters, Twitter said.The company did not say when it would start allowing users to post 280-character tweets.
Billionaire investor Ackman loses bitter ADP proxy battle:::::ROSELAND, N.J. (Reuters) - William Ackman got what Automatic Data Processing Incs (ADP.O) chief executive called an ass-whipping on Tuesday as the activist hedge fund manager lost an acrimonious fight to win seats on the payroll companys board.It was the latest in a string of public defeats for Ackman, who raised $500 million from investors to take a stake in ADP.Some of Ackmans backers have told Reuters they are considering pulling their money from his funds.Fewer than 25 percent of votes were cast in favor of Ackmans slate of three directors looking to shake up the company in the proxy contest, which became a three-month-long showdown between the billionaire investor and ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez.Ackman arrived at the companys annual shareholder meeting at its Roseland, New Jersey, headquarters looking relaxed.He helped himself to a pastry, then took a seat in the fourth row with his associates, a few feet away from an anxious-looking Rodriguez, seated alone.The mood changed after the vote tally was announced.Reading from prepared remarks, Ackman faulted the proxy voting system but accepted defeat.We came in peace, he began, later shaking Rodriguezs hand.Rodriguez got in the last word.This was an ass-whipping, he told Ackman and the assembled shareholders.BITTER BARBS Over the last few months, Ackman and ADP had traded increasingly bitter barbs through securities filings, television appearances, conference calls, webcasts and private meetings with investors.Ackman said management complacency had turned ADP into an inefficient corporate slugabed pushing outmoded products that even a top sales force could not sell.ADP countered that Ackman brought no new ideas to the table, risked disrupting the companys steady path to growth and behaved like a spoiled brat.ADPs stock was up 0.8 percent at $112.17 in early trading after the vote results were announced.Ackman launched the ADP proxy contest as an underdog, taking aim at a company engaged in the unglamorous business of providing human resources technology and largely backed by Wall Street.ADPs share price has more than doubled under Rodriguezs tenure, and the company has posted relatively solid earnings growth.Ackman had asked ADP shareholders to approve his proposal to seat three new directors, including himself, and oust three others, including Chairman John Jones.He has also suggested Rodriguez is the wrong person for the job, and called for the departure of ADPs technology chief, Stuart Sackman.INVESTOR UNREST William 'Bill' Ackman, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Several of Ackmans Pershing Square investors who spoke to Reuters in the run-up to the ADP vote said the outcome would affect their confidence in his investment ability.Ackman, 51, made a name for himself during the 2007-2009 financial crisis with a public and aggressive bet against bond insurer MBIA Inc (MBI.N).He has made similarly contentious investments in or against companies ranging from retailers Target Corp (TGT.N) and JC Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) to Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO).Although the average annual returns for Pershing Squares core fund are 15 percent since its inception in 2004, Ackman racked up double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 after a 37 percent gain in 2014.Bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Herbalife Ltd (HLF.N) and more recently Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) have all weighed on returns.So far this year, the fund is barely in the black, compared with a 15 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index and a roughly 6 percent gain for the average hedge fund.On Tuesday, Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, said the firm had cast about 1 million votes in favor of ADP management, and has since sold some shares based on their rising value.Walkush said Ackman deserved credit for pushing ADP to disclose more details on its margins and other areas.But the portfolio manager said the companys strategy was sound as it revamps its sales force and migrates to the cloud.He seemed late to the party, Walkush said of Ackman.His expectations to us seemed unrealistic.MORE AGITATING Among major investors, spokespeople for Vanguard Group and State Street Corp (STT.N) declined to comment on how they voted their ADP shares.A person familiar with the vote said funds run by BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) supported at least one of Ackmans nominees.Ackmans Pershing Square owns almost 2 percent of ADPs common shares, making it the seventh-largest voting shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.When counting unexercised options, the value of the stake is roughly $2.3 billion.After the meeting, Ackman said he was disappointed but felt he had accomplished a lot.He has said he will continue agitating for change.The company, in order to win, made a number of very significant commitments to shareholders about growth, he said.If they achieve those objectives and they exceed them, then I think shareholders will be happy, the stock will go up.If they dont, well be back next year.Rodriguez played down Ackmans influence and said he was insulted by how Ackman had characterized ADP and its employees.Despite having little knowledge of the company, he was able to get media attention with his remarks, the CEO told Reuters.This is all about who had the best narrative, who has the best hair, Rodriguez said.
U.S. senators press Allergan for details on patent deal with tribe:::::(Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators on Tuesday asked drugmaker Allergan Plc to produce documents relating to its agreement to transfer patents to a Native American tribe to shield them from review by an administrative court.FILE PHOTO: A sign marks Allergan's offices in Medford, Massachusetts, U.S., July 31, 2017.REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown, Maggie Hassan, Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken and Patty Murray made the request for documents in a letter to Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders.The letter was critical of Allergans deal with New Yorks Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, saying it is difficult to conceive of Allergans transaction as anything other than a sham to subvert the existing intellectual property system.Allergan contends the tribes status as a sovereign entity places the patents outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB.Allergan on Sept. 8 transferred patents on its dry eye medication Restasis to the tribe, which agreed to license them exclusively back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments.A federal court invalidated Allergans Restasis patents on Oct. 16, rendering the tribal deal mostly meaningless.Allergan has appealed that ruling.In Tuesdays letter, the senators said they were concerned that tribes could reach similar deals with other manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs.They asked Allergan to disclose the terms of its agreement with the tribe and explain whether it has plans for similar patent transactions.The lawmakers also demanded to see any legal briefs or memos prepared by Allergan regarding sovereign immunity, particularly memos on the question of whether Allergans agreement could immunize patents from review by federal courts.The lawmakers gave Allergan a December 1 deadline to produce the requested documents.A bipartisan group of representatives from the House Oversight and Government Committee made a similar request for documents from Allergan in October.Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the company welcomes the opportunity to continue to brief lawmakers about the deal.Marmur also defended Allergans bid to avoid PTAB review, saying experts across the legal, biopharmaceutical and business communities have raised concerns about the fairness of the administrative process.Allergan has said it does not object to its patents being reviewed in federal court, which it called a fair and time-tested process.
EU's Vestager seeking details on Apple's recent tax set-up:::::LISBON (Reuters) - European Union regulators have asked iPhone maker Apple for details of its recent tax structure following last years order to pay back taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($15 billion) to Ireland, Europes anti-trust chief said on Tuesday.FILE PHOTO: A man holds two boxes for the Apple's new iPhone X at the Apple Store in Regents Street in London, Britain, November 3, 2017.REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the blocs rules which ban unfair state aid.I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organized, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen, Vestager told a news briefing at an international tech summit in Lisbon.We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information, she said.Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the Paradise Papers which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate.Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland.We have no contact after the Paradise Papers.We are in the process.There is no particular need, she said.FILE PHOTO: The new iPhone X is pictured at the Apple Store Marche Saint-Germain in Paris, France, November 3, 2017.REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo The company had no further comment on Vestagers remarks on Tuesday.According to the August 2016 decision issued by the EU, Apple met with the European Commission in 2015 to explain its new corporate structure as well as submitting a summary with the key elements as a follow-up.Vestager also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any general investigations.That remains to be seen if we will open more cases after the Paradise Papers.The Commission last month sued Ireland for its tardiness in collecting the money from Apple.We have no indication when it comes to the time perspective of Apples recovery.We do have from the Irish government the progress made, she said.($1 = 0.8649 euros)
Virginia voter suppression tweets went undetected by Twitter for hours:::::A Twitter account misleading Democratic voters in Virginia by telling them they could cast their ballot by text message was active for almost three hours on Tuesday morning before Twitter suspended the account.The account, "MAGA Mike King," was suspended after it tweeted more than a dozen times a graphic purportedly instructing Virginians on how to vote by text and including the logos of the Democratic Party and its gubernatorial candidate, Ralph Northam.The account doesn't appear to have had much success spreading its message, with less than a handful of interactions on each of the offending tweets, but to some observers that's almost beside the point.Their concern is that the account remained active for almost three hours out of the 13 hours that polls are open in Virginia, despite the fact that Twitter knows these sorts of efforts are a potential problem on its platform, and has claimed success in fighting back against them.A similar voter suppression campaign, which attempted to convince supporters of Hillary Clinton that they could vote for her by text, went viral ahead of last year's presidential election.At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the role of social media in the 2016 election last week, Twitter touted its response to that voter suppression campaign as an example of how it works proactively to combat such efforts.Twitter said that it had deactivated 529 accounts that pushed the misinformation and that tweets refuting the "text-to-vote" campaign had eight times more impressions than the campaign itself.Tim Chambers, the founder of Discourse Intelligence, and co-founder of Dewey Square, a consultancy firm that traditionally works with Democratic causes, reported the account "MAGA Mike King" account to Twitter at 9 a.m. Tuesday morning, more than an hour before it was taken down, he told CNN."Ideally this would be something that Twitter would be catching very early and that it wouldn't take people like myself to spot and them reacting later," he said."It certainly shows that Twitter needs to be more focused on pre-emptively going after this sort of disinformation as early as possible in the process," he added."Asked for comment, Twitter said it does not comment on specific accounts but said, "We are concerned about violations of our Terms of Service and U.S. law with respect to interference in the exercise of voting rights.When we become aware of such activity we take appropriate and timely action."Twitter would not provide any details on any additional resources it might have devoted to monitoring misinformation on Election Day, saying it didn't want to tip off the trolls.But about an hour after the "MAGA Mike King" account was suspended, Twitter tweeted from its government and election team's account, "Remember: you cannot vote via text or Tweet."On Tuesday afternoon, five hours after the tweet was sent, it had amassed only 44 retweets and 28 likes.A source familiar with Twitter's election monitoring told CNN on Tuesday afternoon that the company had several teams monitoring misinformation around the day's elections.The source said the company had not detected any other voter suppression efforts like the one from "MAGA Mike King," and suggested the issue appeared isolated."MAGA Mike King" encouraged Virginians to vote by text using the same number that was pushed during the 2016 voter suppression effort.That number is operated by a California-based mobile marketing company, iVision Mobile.The firm responded to people who texted "Hillary" to the number last November with the message, "The ad you saw was not approved by iVisionMobile OR Hillary For America in any way."iVision Mobile told CNN on Tuesday that it would set up a similar message telling people who used the number on Tuesday that they were not actually casting a vote."Unfortunately, there is little recourse for us to control unscrupulous characters from using our short code without consent," the company said.
NPR CEO on medical leave amid Oreskes harassment scandal:::::NPR chief operating officer Loren Mayor will run the organization for at least the next month while embattled CEO Jarl Mohn is on a medical leave, Mohn said Tuesday.The news comes nearly one week after Mohn forced out Michael Oreskes, the public radio organization's senior vice president of news, amid a harassment scandal.Many staffers were disappointed that Mohn did not take action against Oreskes sooner.Mohn has repeatedly apologized to the staff and pledged to make improvements.Still, there has been open speculation about his future as NPR CEO.On Tuesday, Mohn wrote to the staff: "As many of you know, last March, I suffered a nearly fatal ruptured aorta.I returned to work with the blessing of my physician with one important caveat -- I cannot allow my blood pressure to rise.Regretfully, the hypertension has returned to a dangerous level, and I have been instructed to take medical leave until my health returns to normal, at a minimum of four weeks."Mohn said NPR's board of directors has tapped Mayor to "continue to manage" day-to-day operations during his absence."She will do so with the full support of, and with guidance from, the board," Mohn wrote.Any decision about a change in leadership would come from NPR's board, which includes the heads of local radio stations from across the country, plus outside executives and consultants.The board is expected to review Mohn's handling of the Oreskes matter with the help of an outside law firm.At issue is whether Mohn and his lieutenants took concerns about Oreskes' conduct seriously enough.Allegations of harassment were first shared with NPR in 2015.More accusers were motivated to come forward in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal last month.In interviews with CNN and other news outlets, women alleged that Oreskes used his leadership position to try to curry favor with young women.Multiple women who interacted with him at NPR described his behavior as "boorish" and "intimidating."Some said they felt that the human resources department was not responsive to their concerns.In late October, word spread within NPR about the allegations against Oreskes.CNN reported last week that Mayor was one of the senior managers who urged Mohn to take action, but Mohn pushed back.A Washington Post story on October 31, detailing two of the allegations in Oreskes' past, caused even more turmoil inside NPR and led to Oreskes' exit the next day.Since then, more accusers have come forward.David Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent, said on CNN's "Reliable Sources" on Sunday that he has "spoken to nine women, some of them still at NPR, from a reporter in her 20s to a producer in her 50s," who alleged misconduct.The incidents were "not as severe" as what Weinstein stands accused of, Folkenflik said, but "nonetheless add up to an insidious pattern -- an abusive, sort of hierarchal authority, using his position in journalism to try to get proximity to women who might be susceptible to his appeals."Oreskes said in a statement last week that "my behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility."Regarding the new complaints against Oreskes, Mohn said in Tuesday's memo, "we are taking each of them seriously," NPR initially sidestepped calls for an independent investigation by saying that Oreskes was no longer an employee.But that position changed on November 2.Mohn acknowledged the widespread dissatisfaction within NPR by saying "I am committed to fixing what is broken.As one step, I am hiring an outside law firm to conduct a review of how we handled the matter."His description of this review changed after a contentious town hall meeting with staffers on November 3.In a new memo on November 4, he said NPR's board "is engaging an outside law firm to undertake a thorough review of what happened, when, and how."He said "the results of that review will go to the board, and we will share with you a summary of that review and the recommendations that come out of it."His latest memo, on Tuesday, reiterated that the board, not his office, is working with the unnamed law firm to "review our handling of this situation."Mohn's message about his health also revealed new information about Orekses' conduct."Concerns were raised linked to inappropriate expenses," he wrote.Specifically, some accusers had said that Oreskes spent corporate money on meals that he treated as dates."We investigated and he recently reimbursed NPR for about $1,800 in invalid expenses," Mohn wrote, calling the spending another sign of Oreskes' "bad judgment."
Twitter trolls itself on new 280 character limit:::::Twitter rolled out a 280 character limit for most of its users Tuesday, and, predictably, lots of people are unhappy.That doubles the original 140 character limit that Twitter has maintained since it launched in 2006.Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) began testing longer tweets in late September, and found that once the novelty of tweeting longer wore off, most people in the test group didn't use all of the available characters.According to the company, only 5% of tweets sent by people in the 280-character test group were longer than 140 characters, and just 2% were over 190 characters.Many users complained about the initial tests.Now that just about everyone's got 280 characters to work with, more people say they're frustrated or confused by the decision.Others are using new characters to make jokes.In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous.In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.These are their stories.*DUN DUN* Law and Order: SVU (@nbcsvu) November 7, 2017 My eyes glaze over at every tweet over 140 characters.Calvin (@calvinstowell) November 7, 2017 In West Philadelphia, born and raised On the playground is where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood Adam Serwer (@AdamSerwer) November 7, 2017 why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why?Jonathan Kressaty (@kressaty) November 7, 2017 several folks in my timeline have used their newly found 280 characters to do this.this is twitter's worst update.https://t.co/7GNc1kj0co Polly Mosendz (@polly) November 7, 2017 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!Nick Riccardi (@NickRiccardi) November 7, 2017 So we can now send tweets with 280 characters instead of the old way of 140, I felt the need to test this new thing out.I was so used to 140, an upgrade to like 145 would have been huge!I feel the need to double space at end of sentences again...is that a thing anymore #280 David Mazza (@DavidNBC4) November 7, 2017 Other people were curious about how the new parameters will change the way people interact on the platform.I really hope someone is doing a longitudinal study of how the language in tweets changes as the character limit increases https://t.co/6gkMxJGDSc Gretchen McCulloch (@GretchenAMcC) November 7, 2017 The big question on everyone's mind is how President Donald Trump, an avid Twitter user, will use the expanded space.The president has not yet tweeted 280 characters.
Sky News could be shut down if U.K. regulator blocks Fox takeover:::::Sky Plc is warning U.K. media regulators it could shut down Sky News if 21st Century Fox's proposed takeover of the broadcaster is not approved.In comments released to and subsequently published by the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) on Tuesday, Sky said that the regulator "should not simply assume the continued provision of Sky News."Sky said that without the 21st Century Fox takeover, "Sky would likely be prompted to review the position in the event that the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded [the] merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky's broader business."Sky News' ratings often lag third behind other British news channels like the BBC and ITV.Though Sky News may not have as much of an impact as its competitors, other aspects of the company, including outlets such as Sky Sports are dominant in their field.The CMA is in the middle of a six-month investigation into how 21st Century Fox's proposed $15 billion takeover of Sky would impact that media market in the U.K.The government agency is also looking into whether the company would uphold the country's broadcasting standards.The CMA will send its findings to secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Karen Bradley, who will make the final decision on the takeover.Sky and 21st Century Fox urged the CMA to take into consideration that Sky has complied with U.K. broadcast regulations.They also suggested that the regulator place less weight on their evaluation of other 21st Century Fox properties that are not in the U.K. Sky's warning comes one day after CNBC reported that 21st Century Fox at one point held talks to sell most of its assets, including Sky, to Disney.
Snapchat plans major redesign as user growth stalls:::::Snapchat as you know it may soon disappear.Snap (SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, said Tuesday that it is planning to redesign the messaging application to make it easier to use after facing several consecutive quarters of anemic user growth."One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback," Evan Spiegel, Snap's CEO, said in prepared remarks for an earnings call Tuesday.Spiegel added that the redesign could be "disruptive" to Snap's business in the short term."We don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application," he said.No timetable was provided for the redesign.The goal is to make it easier to discover content on the social network and also to create more opportunities for content creators to make money.Related: Snapchat adds features as rivalry with Instagram intensifies Snap's decision to overhaul its core product is particularly startling as it comes barely eight months after Snap went public.Snap has struggled for much of its life as a public company, falling below its IPO price in July."There has been a ton of change in a very short period of time," Spiegel admitted on the call."That's been the case over the life of the business... We're not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business."The announcement followed yet another disappointing quarter for the company.Snapchat added just 4.5 million new daily active users in the third quarter, bringing its total audience to 178 million daily users.Instagram Stories, a Snapchat knockoff product, recently hit 300 million daily users.The company's losses more than tripled from the previous year to $443 million in the third quarter, while its sales fell well short of Wall Street estimates.Even Snap's first foray into hardware appears to be a failure.The company took a nearly $40 million writedown for excess inventory of Spectacles, its smart glasses."Unfortunately, we misjudged strong early demand for Spectacles and purchased more inventory than we now anticipate being able to sell," Drew Vollero, Snap's CFO, said on the call.Snap stock plunged as much as 20% in after hours trading Tuesday following the earnings report.
Forbes drops bombshell on Wilbur Ross -- and its own reporting:::::A story published by Forbes on Tuesday tracked what it portrayed as a web of deception spun by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.But the story also cast a critical shadow over Forbes' own reporting, and raises serious questions about the credibility of the magazine's widely-cited ranking of billionaires.The article, a 3,000-word feature written by Forbes reporter Dan Alexander, alleges that Ross repeatedly embellished his net worth by crediting himself with his investors' money.Alexander's digging apparently began last month, when the magazine told Ross that he was being taken off The Forbes 400, an annual ranking of the richest people in America.Financial disclosure forms filed after Ross' nomination to the Commerce Department showed he had less than $700 million in assets, far lower than the $2.9 billion Forbes had listed as his net worth a year earlier.And Alexander claims he ultimately found that Ross had been inflating his worth dating back to 2004, when he had first cracked The Forbes 400."It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004," Alexander wrote.Forbes bills the Forbes 400 as "the definitive list of wealth in America," and it has been cited by news outlets the world over.It's also a status symbol for the members of America's gilded class who are interested in such things.But Forbes wasn't alone in identifying Ross as a billionaire.At the time Alexander's story was published Tuesday morning, Bloomberg also had his worth listed at $2.9 billion.A Bloomberg spokesman said it has not yet changed its valuation of Ross, which the outlet said was based on "the performance of his WLR Recovery funds, disclosed terms of the 2006 sale of his investment firm to Invesco for $375 million and information provided directly by the private equity investor after his nomination to serve in the Trump administration."Forbes continued to list Ross' worth at $2.5 billion on a rankings page after the story was published Tuesday, before dropping it to $700 million.In a statement to CNNMoney, Forbes spokeswoman Christina Vega defended the magazine's reporting methods, but acknowledged that others have lied in an effort to crack the list."There have been rare instances in the history of the list in which people have blatantly lied to us in efforts to move their fortunes up or down.We try to spot those cases as soon as possible and report on them immediately to our readers.The reporting on Wilbur Ross shows how committed we are to uncovering new information year after year, and our willingness to set the record straight when we do get new information."In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Commerce said, "The Forbes cites employees, without full knowledge, and all but one anonymously -- we will not respond further."Secretary Ross's disclosure documents were compiled by legal counsel and accountants.The relevant rules were followed, and the documents were closely reviewed and approved by ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and the Office of Government Ethics.We regret any earlier miscommunication."Vega, however, pushed back on that."Wilbur Ross himself has confirmed in his disclosures that he now has $700 million or less in assets," Vega said in an email."The Forbes story is based on extensive reporting, including the financial disclosures that Ross filed this year, what Wilbur Ross told Forbes, and what former longtime employees told Forbes.Forbes has numerous sources who were next to Ross while he was making his money, who have run through, with specifics, how there is no way he accumulated even $1 billion, much less than the $3 billion he claimed."The precise worth of billionaires is often shrouded in mystery, especially when a substantial portion of their money comes -- as Ross' does -- from private companies that do not have to provide public accountings of their finances.Rankings like The Forbes 400 are often taken with more than a few heaps of salt as a result.President Trump's net worth, for example, has long been the subject of scrutiny, including at Forbes."There's been a rule at Forbes for the last 30 years," Forbes editor Randall Lane said in 2015."Take what Trump says and divide by three."The most recent edition of the Forbes 400 came out last month; it marked the 36th year the magazine has compiled the rankings.Each year, the list is accompanied by an explanation of the research that goes into the list."Our reporters dig deep.This year we started with a list of more than 600 individuals considered strong candidates," the magazine explained last month."When possible, we met with Forbes 400 members and candidates in person or spoke with them by phone.We also interviewed their employees, handlers, rivals, peers and attorneys.Uncovering their fortunes required us to pore over thousands of SEC documents, court records, probate records and Web and print stories.We took into account all types of assets: stakes in public and private companies, real estate, art, yachts, planes, ranches, vineyards, jewelry, car collections and more."The list also comes with caveats.As Forbes noted last month, there are inherent limitations to creating the list."Of course, we don't pretend to know what is listed on each billionaire's private balance sheet, although some candidates did provide paperwork to that effect," the explanation continued."Some billionaires presiding over private companies were happy to share their financial figures, but others were less forthcoming."The revelations about Ross on Tuesday reverberated around Washington and Wall Street, cable news and Twitter.But some viewed the story as an indictment of Forbes' much-ballyhooed rankings."The story also shows how fanciful the Forbes 400 list is," tweeted MarketWatch columnist Rex Nutting."The Forbes 400 is as phony as Ross's fortune."Others credited Forbes for writing candidly about its previous shortcomings."The @Forbes story on Wilbur Ross's non-billions is a fine example of how to come clean about past reporting errors," said Bloomberg columnist Justin Fox.Forbes also pointed to its own previous reporting failures as a factor behind Ross' inclusion in the elite club.In the story on Tuesday, Alexander described a credulous correspondence between an ex-Forbes reporter and Ross."I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion," the unnamed reporter wrote in his notes after speaking with Ross."And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.'" From there, Alexander reported, Forbes continued to tack on more to Ross' net worth
New app ScreenShop wants to be the Shazam for fashion:::::Molly Hurwitz looks to Instagram for fashion inspiration, but trying to find and buy those styles isn't always so easy.One method she tried was manually searching on Google with a description of the item she liked.But she said that process was cumbersome.A new app she's co-created aims to make shopping looks from your Instagram feed much easier.The app -- called ScreenShop -- launched on Tuesday and lets users purchase clothing and accessories they see on social media, online and on the street by taking a photo or screenshot on their phone.Here's how it works.Users upload a photo of an outfit they like to the app.Then, ScreenShop identifies the items in the picture using computer vision and suggests similar clothing options at various price points from different brands.Users can click on an item to buy it from the retailer's website without leaving the app."What we built is the Shazam for fashion," said fellow co-creator Jonathan Caras, referring to the popular app that tells you the name of a song that's playing.Related: Millennial fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff: 'Our consumer chose us' Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is an adviser for ScreenShop and has been with the company since its early stages.She will continue to be involved and will share information about the app on her social media channels, according to the company.While celebrities and fashion "influencers" on Instagram can already tag brands and items and even link to where to buy things in posts, Hurwitz didn't think this fully solved the issue."[With Instagram] you're limited to that specific item that people and brands are tagging, and it doesn't solve the overall problem," Hurwitz said.Hurwitz believes consumers want more options and diverse price points.They also may not want the exact item a user shares, but something similar to it."I don't want to spend $1,800 on a dress, but I do want the inspiration," she said."The idea [with ScreenShop] is to be able to take your inspiration from anywhere, from watching a movie or browsing online or a magazine."Related: Louise Linton's famous post and Instagram's celebrity problem However, ScreenShop isn't the only service utilizing visual search in fashion.Online fashion retailer Asos rolled out visual search earlier this year on its U.K. app.It also finds similar clothing items based on a photo, but only shows you products offered on Asos.ScreenShop says its biggest differentiator is that it works with a wide variety of brands and products.The app has partnerships with over 450 retailers such as Nordstrom, H&M and Topshop, and its catalog includes about 10 million items from a variety of seasons.When customers make purchases, ScreenShop gets a cut.The free app is available on iOS starting Tuesday.Android users can sign up for a beta version.
Navya unveils its self-driving taxi:::::The latest self-driving vehicle is making the steering wheel and the brake pedal a thing of the past.Navya, a French technology company, unveiled a self-driving sedan Tuesday, and it doesn't have the usual feature of a driver's seat.Production of the six-passenger electric vehicle will begin in early 2018, accelerating the arrival of autonomous vehicles onto streets around the world.Navya already makes a driverless shuttle, which is similar to a small bus and generally travels at the pace of a good jogger, making it ill-suited for most driving conditions.There are 50 of the shuttles in operation, according to Navya.The new sedan, called the Autonom Cab, is capable of speeds up to 55 mph.It will sell for 250,000 euros and is designed to be used in a ride-sharing service rather than sold to an individual."We're in the race for the robotaxi," Navya CEO Christophe Sapet told CNN Tech."It was disappointing to be seen as just as shuttle maker."Related: The case for rushing self-driving cars onto streets Experts forecast that the autonomous vehicle industry will be worth trillions.This has fueled an intense race, and $80 billion has been invested in autonomous vehicle research, according to a Brookings Institute report released this fall.Navya will be demonstrating the Autonom Cab at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this January.In April, it will begin testing the vehicle in France and the United States.Navya is hoping to test six vehicles in five different cities, according to Sapet.The Autonom Cab will still have to prove that it can drive safely on roads.They haven't announced a target date for broadly reaching consumers after the tests in April.It won't have a steering wheel or pedals, but a Navya employee will ride in the vehicle and be able to control it with a joystick.Navya is far from the only competitor looking to perfect the right vehicle for giving self-driving rides.Waymo, the self-driving company from Google's parent company, has transitioned from two-seat vehicles to roomier Chrysler Pacificas minivans.Cruise Automation, the self-driving arm of General Motors, uses its Chevy Bolt, an electric five-seat vehicle it has described as perfect for ride-sharing.Uber has tried Ford sedans and now a Volvo SUV.Experts forecast that autonomous vehicles will help save many of the 1.25 million lives lost each year in motor vehicle crashes.Navya was far from the only autonomous vehicle company making news this week.Waymo announced Tuesday that it is now testing vehicles with a test driver in the driver's seat.
New from Uber: 'We do the right thing. Period.':::::There are some new rules at Uber.First, employees should do the right thing.Period.That's one of the company's eight new "cultural norms," which CEO Dara Khosrowshahi unveiled publicly on Tuesday following an internal all-hands meeting.The CEO was charged with reformulating Uber's controversial company values after a months-long investigation into Uber's culture following sexual harassment allegations in February.Gone is the "win at all costs" mindset.In are the notions of persevering and valuing ideas over hierarchy.When Khosrowshahi took the company's helm in August, Uber's problematic values included Always Be Hustlin', Meritocracy, Superpumped and Toe-stepping."...'toe-stepping' was meant to encourage employees to share their ideas regardless of their seniority or position in the company, but too often it was used an excuse for being an asshole," said Khosrowshahi in a post.Related: Uber pledges $5 million to sexual assault prevention The eight new norms are purposefully not referred to as values.Khosrowshahi says that's because "we fully expect them to evolve as Uber continues to grow."Notably, there's no more mention of a meritocracy, a Silicon Valley aspiration that the best and brightest rise up based purely on their skills.Instead, Uber now says: "We celebrate differences.""We ensure people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome.We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build."Khosrowshahi said the new list was created with the help of employees.More than 1,200 staffers sent in submissions, and 22,000 votes were cast, Khosrowshahi wrote in his post.The company also said it held more than 20 focus groups with representatives from employee resource groups and Uber's international offices.Here's the full list of the company's new norms: We build globally, we live locally; We are customer obsessed; We celebrate differences; We do the right thing; We act like owners; We persevere; We value ideas over hierarchy; We make big bold bets.
Twitter will double its character count for most users:::::Twitter is about to get more words -- a lot more.The company announced on Tuesday it is doubling how many characters users can cram into a tweet.Most tweets will now fit 280 characters, up from 140.The new limit will roll out to Twitter users in almost all 40 languages Twitter supports.In late September, Twitter began a test of 280-character tweets with a small group of users.Like many Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) changes, some users complained about the move.Interestingly, Twitter said that after the novelty of tweeting more characters wore off, most people in the test stopped tweeting the full length.According to the company, only 5% of tweets sent from people in the 280-character test group were longer than 140 characters, and just 2% were over 190 characters.Related: Following backlash, Twitter clarifies what violates its policies The new character length won't apply to Japanese, Korean or Chinese-language tweets.Those languages can convey twice as much information in less space, so tweets will remain at 140 characters, Twitter said.Of course, the change means America's highest-profile Twitter user, President Trump, will have more space.Twitter cofounder Biz Stone had said the prolific Twitter user was not in the test group.The move modifies a fundamental aspect of Twitter.Aside from the test, the social network's character limit hasn't changed since the company launched in 2006.The 140-character length wasn't a random choice: Twitter's founders wanted tweets to fit in a text message, which can only hold 160 characters.So Twitter chose 140 characters for the tweet, and 20 characters for the user name.During the 280-character test, some users argued Twitter should focus less on the length of the tweets and more on the content.The platform continues to be rife with harassment and abuse, despite the company's efforts to better police it.Twitter recently updated its rules to be more explicit in its definitions and policies towards harassment, threats, and adult content.Everyone affected by the new length should have it by Tuesday evening.

Times ban following backlash from news outlets:::::Disney will no longer ban the Los Angeles Times from advance screenings of its movies following a backlash from critics groups, news outlets and journalists, who were boycotting those same screenings in protest."We've had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at The Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns, and as a result, we've agreed to restore access to advance screenings for their film critics," a Walt Disney Company spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.In a statement of its own released shortly afterward, the Times said, "The Los Angeles Times has covered the Walt Disney Company since its founding, here in Los Angeles, in 1923.We look forward to reporting on Disney well into the future."The lifting of the blackout follows an outpouring of solidarity for the Times after the paper's film coverage was blacked out by Disney due to a story that examined the business relationship between the company's flagship Californian theme park, Disneyland, and the city of Anaheim.Disney had said that the Times "showed a complete disregard for basic journalistic standards" with that story, though it has not publicly claimed there were any errors in the article.On Monday, entertainment sites like The A.V.Club and Flavorwire, as well as a pop culture writer for the Washington Post, said they would skip the screenings until the ban on the Times was lifted.Related: Journalists and critic groups boycott Disney films in solidarity with the L.A. Times The New York Times joined the growing boycott on Tuesday afternoon, not long before the reversal of the ban was announced."A powerful company punishing a news organization for a story they do not like is meant to have a chilling effect," the New York Times said in a statement."This is a dangerous precedent and not at all in the public interest."The NYT joins boycott of preview screenings for Disney movies in solidarity with the LAT, which was barred following investigative series.pic.twitter.com/S2RlGUfQjS Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 7, 2017 Critics groups like the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics also jointly denounced Disney's decision.They also voted to disqualify Disney's films from year-end awards consideration."It is admittedly extraordinary for a critics' group, let alone four critics' groups, to take any action that might penalize film artists for decisions beyond their control.But Disney brought forth this action when it chose to punish The Times' journalists rather than express its disagreement with a business story via ongoing public discussion," the groups said in a joint statement."Disney's response should gravely concern all who believe in the importance of a free press, artists included."
The end of 'House of Cards' would hammer Baltimore and wipe out 2,000 jobs:::::A couple thousand people in Maryland have a lot riding on "House of Cards."Michael Piekutowski, who has worked as an electrician on the series since Season 4, waits to see whether the hit Netflix drama will survive star Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct scandal."House of Cards," which for five seasons has been filmed in and around Baltimore, is one of the state's biggest productions.Piekutowski told CNN the show helps the city's economy, not just those who work on set."There are local businesses that are benefiting from a major studio production, like caterers, dry cleaners, transportation companies," he said.Last week, Netflix cut ties with Spacey, who was also an executive producer for the series, a day after CNN published new allegations of sexual harassment from several current and former members of the "House of Cards" production staff.One member of the production staff also accused Spacey of sexual assault.Spacey's representatives did not reply to a request for comment on the new allegations in CNN's report.They also did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story."Netflix will not be involved with any further production of 'House of Cards' that includes Kevin Spacey," a spokesperson for the network said."We will continue to work with [Media Rights Capital] during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show."Media Rights Capital is the production company behind "House of Cards."Actor Anthony Rapp first made allegations against Spacey in a story published by BuzzFeed last week in which he said Spacey made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986 when Rapp was 14 year old.Spacey issued a statement apologizing to Rapp, who appears on CBS's "Star Trek: Discovery."Spacey claimed he did not recall the incident, but offered "the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior."Netflix suspended production on Season 6 of "House of Cards" -- set to be the show's last -- as a result.Sources told CNN that the decision, while made public after the first accusation against Spacey, had been known by the production team for months.The Emmy-winning series has proved a boon to the state of Maryland, where recognizable landmarks have made their way into "House of Cards" episodes.Fans will recognize Patterson Park in Southeast Baltimore as the place where Spacey's character, Frank Underwood, likes to ride his bike.The Baltimore County Historic Courthouse in Towson has subbed for the halls of Congress and viewers can venture to the nearby caf, Cunningham's, to see the site where the character Seth Grayson takes a meeting in Season 5.For Season 4 alone, almost 2,700 cast, crew and extras were hired from Maryland, and the production bought or rented goods or services from almost 2,000 Maryland vendors, according to the Maryland Film Office.A final audit by the state found that Season 5 of "House of Cards" contributed $129 million to Maryland's economy in the form of purchased goods and services from more than 1,750 Maryland businesses and the hiring of more than 1,800 local actors, crew and extras.The state has awarded almost $60 million in tax credits to "House of Cards" over the years (which included a $7.5 million grant in Season 3).Making Hollywood magic is sometimes seasonal work, Piekutowski said, and some people depend on "House of Cards" to make it through."One of the nice things about 'House of Cards' is it shoots from fall till spring and fills in the gap for people through the winter," Piekutowski said."We are all like squirrels, in a way, throughout the year and try to get as much money in the spring and summer and live off that in the winter."Jena Richardson, a 28-year-old day player -- a backup crew member on heavy production days -- has worked on the show since Season 2.She says she will have to leave Maryland if "House of Cards" work runs dry because "people in the film industry go where the work is."Richardson considers Baltimore home and says it's where she wants to start a family."If the show leaves, that means that a lot of my friends who have become my set family will have to leave to find work as well," she said."So if we can keep the work here, then everybody can stay here and provide for themselves and their families throughout the holidays."Roger Voter says the loss of "House of Cards" would be a "huge detriment."The show provided staffers with opportunities to learn skills commonly found in jobs in Los Angeles."It's the most detailed TV show, more than what we have usually in the local Baltimore area, like unique small jobs like camera operators, operating booms, prop jobs," said the 27-year-old technology assistant, who worked on Season 5."Having Baltimore locals being trained in these jobs under the masters of LA is great for their careers."Legendary casting agent Pat Moran knows all about the importance of having and retaining such series in her hometown of Baltimore.Moran, who has three Emmys, including one for her work on HBO's hit comedy "Veep," told CNN that TV and film production has dropped off considerably from the days when she was casting for such series as HBO's "The Wire" and NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street.""We at one time were in the top five [production locations] in the country," Moran said."It seems that a lot of stuff that was shot here gained national recognition with big directors, big studios, big shows.That's nonexistent now because the industry is pretty much gone."Moran said her own son had to relocate from Baltimore to New Orleans to get work and a former assistant is thriving in the New Orleans and Atlanta markets.Moran's son is a prop master on "NCIS: New Orleans," she said.In 2015, "Veep" moved its production to Los Angeles after four years in Maryland."Maryland has been home to many vital HBO projects, from 'The Corner' to 'The Wire' to 'Game Change,' and the support has always been extraordinary," HBO said in a statement at the time."The producers and HBO would like to thank Maryland for making the last four seasons of 'Veep' such a success.We look forward to returning with another production in the future."Debbie Dorsey, director of the Baltimore Film Office, told the Baltimore Sun after the announcement that "Veep" leaving "hurts not only Baltimore's creative culture, but it hurts our economy as well."She said the show hired about 1,000 locals each season and created an economic windfall of $114 million over three seasons."Veep" also worked with 1,000 businesses each season, 400 of which were small businesses in Baltimore City, Dorsey said.Moran said her show simply received a better deal for tax incentives from California and opted to go."It's show business and it's all about the bottom line," she said."[Film and TV production] is basically nonexistent now [in Maryland], which I'm still scratching my head about because it is an industry and all states are looking for new industries, right?"
Russia eyes cryptocurrency dominance:::::In a former Soviet car factory in the southeast of Moscow, the scene is like one out of a science fiction movie.Tall shelves are stacked with computer processors jutting out into the middle of the space, spewing gusts of hot air.If you've ever observed your laptop fan kick in, multiply that by about a thousand.The 9,000 square meter warehouse is where boxy Soviet cars used to roll off the production line.Now, it hosts the work of Dmitry Marinichev, President Putin's internet ombudsman who heads his own IT solutions company RadiusGroup.In 2014, Dmitry Marinichev was appointed to the role designed to act as a liaison between internet companies and the government.He was also recently named one of four potential presidential candidates from Russia's "Party of Growth," a more Kremlin-friendly opposition party campaigning on a pro-business platform.Marinichev is currently building what's called the Russian Mining Center, a project he hopes will put Russia on the cryptocurrency map.Cryptocurrencies are virtual "coins" that are "mined" by computers completing complex algorithms.The most famous and widely used cryptocurrency is bitcoin.It exists on a shared data network called a "blockchain" and has no central bank or central authority, meaning transactions can be done between people and entities directly, without the need for banks or governments to be involved.So far, Marinichev and his partners have invested $10 million dollars into the project.They've also raised the equivalent of $43 million in an Initial Coin Offering -- the cryptocurrency equivalent of an IPO -- and plan to add around five times as many "mining computers" to their facility by the end of the year.The team manufactures the computers themselves.Playing host, Marinichev shows off a high-tech assembly line where 3D-modelled motherboards are stitched and soldered into life.Some will be used in this facility, others will be sold to other mining operations."First of all, it's business," Marinichev told CNN."But this is a new milestone in the development of mankind."Playing catch up Russia is still a laggard when it comes to the official acceptance of cryptocurrencies.Unlike the U.S. and much of Europe, it is currently illegal to pay for anything with cryptocurrencies in Russia or convert them into rubles.And the central bank is not budging.In September, it issued a warning that the anonymity of cryptocurrencies could lead to citizens being drawn into "illegal activities including laundering illegal funds, and the financing of terrorism."The central bank said it was "premature" to consider legalizing cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument.In October, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia said the bank was considering restrictions on websites that sell cryptocurrencies.Marinichev is hoping his project will prove to Russian authorities that cryptocurrencies, and the blockchain technology that powers them are a critical part of the country's future.He's already seeing signs of progress.In June, President Putin met with Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian inventor of Ethereum, the closest competitor to Bitcoin.The meeting sent a flutter of excitement through the cryptocurrency community in Russia.The Kremlin read-out of the meeting stated the following: "The President supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners."Putin recently held a high-level meeting with his finance minister and central bank chief on cryptocurrencies warning of "serious risks," and could be used by criminals.At the same time, however, he insisted Russia needs to come up with a way of regulating them.That job has fallen to a special working group in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament.And it's far from easy.Elina Sidorenko, a criminal law professor who heads up that group, said her biggest concern was initially the anonymity of transactions and the difficulty of applying anti-money laundering standards to cryptocurrency payments.But she told CNN new challenges keep appearing.Her group had been set to publish new legislation in October, but it had to delay it for a few months to try to factor in some new issues: the implications of China's crackdown on crytocurrency exchanges, as well as how to regulate ICO's and tokens.Still, Sidorenko is convinced Russia can't afford to ignore the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies to "advance the Russian economy.""In addition to oil and natural resources, we have IT specialists, technologists, developers and computer geniuses conquering the world, so we should make use of this resource," she said.Russia's 'Crypterati' Russian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are already making an impact.Alexander Ivanov is a former physicist, who now runs Waves, a blockchain platform that allows users to create tokens for things like loyalty programs and vouchers, trade in cryptocurrencies, and make payments.The company claims to have a market cap of around $400 million and says 80% of its business is actually done outside of Russia.Waves was recently behind a blockchain loyalty program from Burger King in Russia called "Whoppercoin," where customers could accumulate digital tokens to redeem in store.Ivanov said the attraction for him is the stability of the blockchain technology, and the fact that its decentralized so no one central authority can switch it off.He said there's still a "barrier of understanding" for some people but that won't be forever."I think blockchain will repeat the history of internet and probably even be bigger than the internet itself," he said.Ivanov and I visited a Moscow restaurant called Lavkalavka, which is part of a farming collective that uses local, organically grown products.It started accepting bitcoin in August.The meal cost about 0.02BTC ($100).The restaurant carried out a mirror transaction in rubles to avoid falling foul of the Russian legal system.Owner Boris Akimov said accepting bitcoin is a marketing initiative at the moment, and a way to help the company better understand cryptocurrencies.His business also set up its own cryptocurrency called Biocoin, which is used by farmers in their cooperative to trade in goods and equipment.Biocoins are also used as a loyalty system in Lavkalavka and other participating and restaurants.People are given a certain amount when they buy something, and can exchange them for future purchases.In from the cold There are many reasons Russia is drawn to cryptocurrencies.Akimov said the idea of a financial system not dominated by the U.S. dollar is part of the appeal."Cryptocurrency is a way to change the whole financial system in the world," Akimov said.The banking system is currently under the stranglehold of U.S. and EU sanctions, and unable to access to Western capital."I can't say that bitcoin will allow for dodging sanctions [because] that wouldn't be true," Marinichev said."Bitcoin can help the world change; it'll allow it to cleanse itself from the madness of some individuals, governments, parliaments."So far, experts say Russia only has about 3% of all bitcoin "nodes" -- or computers -- on the bitcoin network.Another advantage to growing Russia's share is the cold weather, according to Marinichev.This means the expense of cooling the mining equipment is dramatically reduced.Electricity is also cheap, and there's a lot of it available.For Sidorenko, cryptocurrencies are a bit like the Russian winter: difficult to manage but inevitable."We must live with this reality, and we must regulate this thing," she said."But we must minimize the risks involved in using it."
The Oprah effect is stronger than ever at Weight Watchers:::::Oprah can eat bread and still rake in major dough.Weight Watchers says more than 600,000 subscribers have joined in the past year, and they're committing to the program an average of one month longer.That combo drove up quarterly revenue and sent Weight Watchers (WTW) shares 18% higher on Tuesday.The stock has quadrupled in price this year.It's hard to argue with Oprah's results.In October 2015, Winfrey bought a 10% stake in the struggling company for $43 million and joined its board of directors.After two years and a high-profile television and Twitter campaign to tout her weight-loss success -- and her beloved, Weight Watchers-approved bread -- her stake is now worth $344 million.Related: Oprah is coming to supermarket shelves this fall Weight Watchers says it has 3.4 million members, compared with 2.5 million when Winfrey signed on.Members now stick with the program about nine months on average.That's been a key to the company's run this year.The company had a bumpy 2016 as competition from other diet services like Nutrisystem cut into profits.But it has surged ahead in 2017.Nutrisystem stock is up only 38% -- a strong year but nothing like the tear Weight Watchers is on.Winfrey will be front and center as Weight Watchers unveils its SmartPoints food plan to recruit more people during the New Year's diet season."There's a long runway for the company to keep growing," said Alex Fuhrman, an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital."They have a really bright future ahead of them."--CNNMoney's Paul R. La Monica and Matt Egan contributed to this story.
Trump administration opens door for states to impose Medicaid work requirements:::::States will soon be allowed to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, a major change in how the government health insurance program operates.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will start approving state proposals that "promote community engagement activities," Seema Verma, the agency's head, said Tuesday.This includes requiring able-bodied enrollees to work, volunteer, go to school or enter a job training program in order to qualify for benefits."One of the things that states have told us time and time again is that they want more flexibility to engage their working-age, able-bodied citizens on Medicaid," Verma told a conference of state Medicaid directors."They want to develop programs that will help them break the chains of poverty and live up to their fullest potential.We support this."Republicans have long wanted to add work requirements to the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 75 million low-income children, adults, elderly and disabled Americans.The broadening of Medicaid to able-bodied, working age adults under Obamacare -- roughly 11 million have gained coverage under the health reform law's Medicaid expansion provision -- further spurred GOP efforts.Related: Most Republicans in the U.S. like Medicaid.Who knew?States can currently seek waivers to make some changes to the Medicaid program.However, the Obama administration did not approve any state requests to impose work mandates.That will change under the Trump administration, said Verma, who penned a letter to state officials in March encouraging them to submit waiver applications that include work requirements."Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration," Verma said Tuesday."Those days are over."Eight states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Utah and Wisconsin -- have submitted waivers to CMS that include work-related provisions, according to Manatt Health, a consulting firm.Verma served as a Medicaid consultant for Indiana and Kentucky before joining the Trump administration.Related: Medicaid covers a lot more people than you might think While Republicans believe adding work requirements will help Medicaid recipients become independent, critics fear that it will strip away benefits from people in need.Having access to health care can help low-income adults get and keep jobs, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt.Taking away their access to coverage "is too high a price to pay," she said.Many Medicaid recipients already work.Nearly 60% of non-disabled, working-age adults have jobs, while nearly 80% live in families with at least one worker, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.
There's a loophole in GOP's plan to kill the state and local tax deduction:::::House Republicans want to kill the state and local income tax deduction.But apparently not for everyone.Their tax reform bill, being debated this week by the Ways and Means Committee, would repeal the federal tax deduction that people get for paying state and local income taxes, and it would curb how much they can deduct in property taxes.The tax break known as the SALT deduction is one of the most controversial revenue raisers because it is near and dear to taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- from highly taxed areas across the country.Today, just under 30% of filers claim the state and local tax deduction on their federal returns, according to the Government Finance Officers Association.But tax experts have spotted what appears to be a big exception to the repeal: The owners, shareholders and investors in so-called pass-through businesses would still be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes in full.The provision allows the deduction if the state and local taxes are "paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or a business ... [or on expenses related to] production of income."As for everyone else who currently takes the SALT deduction?Sorry, Charlie, no can do.Related: What's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses Pass-throughs make up the majority of U.S. businesses.They take the form of sole proprietorships, LLCs or S corps.And those with an ownership stake in them pay taxes on the entity's profits on their individual returns.So for them, under the House bill, state and local taxes could be treated as a business expense on their personal return.That would include President Trump, who typically structures his businesses as pass-throughs.But ordinary employees of such businesses would still be barred from taking the deduction against their wages.A spokesperson for the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to CNNMoney that "all" pass-through owners and investors "will continue to be able to deduct state and local taxes incurred in the conduct of a trade or business."But the provision as written raises big questions for tax policy watchers.A key one is whether professional service firms, which are often set up as pass-throughs, would qualify for the SALT deduction.Professional services include firms providing financial services, legal services and consulting.The SALT provision in the House bill doesn't explicitly say they're not eligible and the word from Ways and Means is that "all" pass-throughs could take the deduction.But -- and this is where it gets tricky -- another provision in the House bill flatly precludes professional service pass-throughs from taking advantage of the proposed new 25% rate on pass-through profits.Related from CNN: Some Republicans say fight isn't over for popular deduction When asked about this at a House Ways and Means hearing Monday, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, seemed to indicate professional service providers -- such as partners in a big law firm -- likely would not be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes because all their income would be taxed as ordinary income, and would not receive the special 25% pass-through profits rate.But other experts disagreed."There's nothing in the legislation providing that.[A professional services firm] is still a trade or business that's a pass-through," said New York University Tax Law Professor David Kamin, who formerly served as a special assistant to President Obama for economic policy.When asked to settle the issue, a spokesperson for Ways and Means wasn't immediately available for comment.Kamin believes the exception to the repeal -- if that's what the tax writers truly intended -- would result "in deep unfairness and plenty of gaming."-- CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report
Ad wars are killing Priceline and TripAdvisor:::::If you're looking to book a vacation, let's be honest.There's not too much of a difference between searching for flights and hotels on Priceline, TripAdvisor and Expedia.The companies seem to know that too.So does Wall Street.And investors are worried.Shares of Priceline (PCLN, Tech30) plunged 13% and TripAdvisor (TRIP) was down more than 20% on Tuesday after reporting their latest earnings and disappointing outlooks after the closing bell Monday.Both companies have had to ramp up their marketing and advertising spending to attract customers.That seems to be coming at the expense of future profits.Priceline spent more than $4 billion on various types of advertising and marketing in the first nine months of the year -- up more than 20% from the first three quarters of 2006.It spent $1.5 billion alone in the third quarter.The company has been aggressively promoting its Booking.com unit in particular.And TripAdvisor spent $683 million on selling and marketing expenses in the past nine months, a 17% increase from a year ago.Related: Confident Americans are rushing to book trips Both companies spent more than half their revenues on marketing and advertising in the first nine months of the year, a testament to how brutally competitive the business is.Just think about all the TV and online ads you see for Priceline and its subsidiaries as well as TripAdvisor and Expedia.Priceline lowered its profit outlook for the fourth quarter Monday, partly due to the increased competition.And TripAdvisor warned that it expects revenue growth to slow in the coming months.This news follows a disappointing earnings report from Expedia (EXPE) late last month.Expedia also is in the midst of a management transition after former CEO Dara Khosrowshahi left to take the top job at Uber.What's interesting to note is that while the travel search and booking business is having a rough time right now, the fundamentals for the overall leisure industry are actually strong.Hotel chains Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) have surged this year and are trading near record highs.Cruise line Carnival (CCL) has had a strong 2017 and its rival Royal Caribbean (RCL) posted strong earnings Tuesday as well.People are taking vacations.But all three online travel companies are dealing with tough competition from Google (GOOGL, Tech30) as well.The search giant bought travel software firm ITA in 2011 and Google has been ramping up its travel presence ever since.Related: New Uber CEO, formerly of Expedia, is an outspoken Trump critic In fact, travel research firm Skift recently estimated that Google's travel search business is worth $100 billion, which would make it the most valuable travel company.Priceline, which also owns Kayak, Cheapflights and OpenTable, is worth about $82 billion.Airbnb is increasingly viewed as a threat for the online travel giants too.Priceline CEO Glenn Fogel was asked on the earnings call about competition from "instantly bookable vacation rentals."And although the analyst and Fogel did not mention Airbnb by name, it seemed clear they were talking about the house and apartment sharing Silicon Valley unicorn, which is now worth nearly $30 billion."I'm not nave.I recognize we are not the leader in this space right now," Fogel said."We are the leader overall for accommodations of all types of properties, but there is a competitor who is a little bit bigger and doing a little bit better, I suspect, than we are in this area."Still, Wall Street seems to think that Priceline has a better chance of going toe to toe with Airbnb and Google than TripAdvisor or Expedia.Analysts at Piper Jaffray and Jefferies kept their favorable ratings on Priceline Tuesday, citing the strength of all the company's different brands and the fact that management is often overly conservative with its guidance.But the two analysts have negative opinions about the outlook for TripAdvisor, especially since the company said Monday that it may spend even more on TV advertising next year.
The case for rushing self-driving cars onto streets:::::In an ironic twist, the biggest roadblock to saving thousands of human lives will be humans.The Rand Corporation, a nonprofit institution with a history of analyzing futuristic technologies, released a report Tuesday outlining the risk of waiting to allow autonomous vehicles until they're far superior to human drivers.The report estimated that hundreds of thousands of lives could be lost to road fatalities over the next three decades if the U.S. is slow to embrace the emerging technology.The sooner these vehicles are commonplace, the faster they will master driving and improve road safety, the study suggested.Experts anticipate autonomous vehicles will help curtail the number of lives lost each year on U.S. roads.Car crashes are overwhelmingly caused by human error.But studies have shown that most Americans do not want to ride in autonomous vehicles and are concerned about their safety.The study highlighted how we're more comfortable with humans making mistakes than when machines do the same."We don't perceive risk very well," Rand Corporation senior information scientist Nidhi Kalra, who co-authored the report, told CNN Tech."There's a very real concrete cost of following our gut and emotion, rather than thinking through the logic of the problem."Related: How free self-driving car rides could change everything The report compared scenarios for deploying autonomous vehicles when they're slightly better than humans versus when the vehicles are overwhelmingly superior.The amount of projected saved lives in the next 30 years was highest when autonomous vehicles were deployed once they're only slightly better than the average human driver.Practice makes perfect, so the more experiences the vehicles have, the quicker they learn.The self-driving car industry has so far moved cautiously, generally keeping drivers behind the wheel during tests to take control of the vehicle if needed.But the authors note companies can not learn as much from small test fleets.If thousands of autonomous vehicles were put on roads and used to give rides without test drivers, the technology could be fine-tuned faster.Related: Waymo rolls out self-driving rides without test drivers One complication is that it's difficult to generalize the safety of an autonomous vehicle.A self-driving car might perform without a hitch in one city, but struggle in another city that introduces different elements, such as snow or more pedestrians."We don't know how to do proper regulation," Kalra said."There's a chance we may see this technology before we know how safe it is."
The controversy that could hold back some Amazon HQ2 contenders:::::Hundreds of cities are vying to be Amazon's second home.But a history of controversial legislation could hold some of them back.Amazon says 238 cities and regions across North America put in bids to become its second headquarters, the company's largest expansion outside Seattle.The winner gets tens of thousands of jobs and a lift for the local economy.Texas and Georgia are among the competition's heavy hitters.Several cities in each state were part of bids for HQ2, and Austin and Atlanta have been floated as top contenders by analytics firms and gambling sites.One potential snag: Both states recently tangled with bills that met fierce opposition from major corporations, including Amazon in one case.State officials in Texas this year considered a "bathroom bill" that would have required people to use school restrooms that match the sex on their birth certificates.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) was among dozens of companies that knocked the bill for discriminating against transgender people.One of the company's top executives, Jeff Wilke, signed onto a letter in May that called such laws "bad for our employees and bad for business."The company has supported protections for LGBT people.Last year, Amazon joined a coalition of other businesses backing a federal anti-discrimination bill.And at a dinner last month, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights organization, gave Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos its National Equality Award."Across the United States, more people now support gay and trans rights than ever before," Bezos said."I believe that the idea of equality is ingrained deeply within all of us.It is inalienable."Amazon did not respond to a request comment for this story.The Texas bill was eventually defeated.But some experts say it could have lingering effects."Even failed legislation is costly for a state's reputation and image," said Mark Jones, the political science fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy."Efforts like the 'bathroom bill' in Texas would make it difficult for Amazon to attract the best and the brightest in the Lone Star State."That's the fear for Byron Cook, a Republican state representative in Texas who opposed the bill.In an op-ed for the Austin American-Statesman in September, Cook suggested Amazon wouldn't take the state seriously until the governor shut down any chance that the bill might return."We heard universally from industries that they are opposed to discriminatory legislation, particularly when it solves no problems," Cook told CNNMoney."I don't think this company is going to take a risk with something being polarized."Cook's concerns aren't unique.In Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, vetoed a "religious liberty" bill last year that would have given religious organizations in Georgia the option to deny services and jobs to LGBT people.It was roundly criticized by companies like Disney, Salesforce and Coca-Cola, which considered it discriminatory.But Deal leaves office after next year.And some of his potential replacements have reportedly said they would support similar legislation.That led a top aide for Deal to warn that any future efforts to pass similar bills could hurt the state's chances with Amazon, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.The aide, Chris Riley, declined to comment to CNNMoney.Some of the cities that have bid for the Amazon site, like Austin and Dallas, have their own ordinances that prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity.But Jones, the public policy fellow, said even those measures might not be enough to assuage concerns.He pointed to the city's recent spat with Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing companies.After city residents voted last year to require such companies to fingerprint drivers, the two services pulled out of Austin.Austin moved on -- at least until state lawmakers overturned the local regulation."Austin is an island, but it's an island surrounded by the sea of Texas," Jones said."Austin can only do so much to buttress or hold back statewide policies."
Why you're hardwired to be bad at money:::::Why are money decisions so stressful?No, it's not because you're broke.It's because your brain is fundamentally challenged when it comes to financial choices, according to neuroscience.And going it alone only makes it worse."Our brains are really good at avoiding major risks and keeping ourselves alive," says Dr. Sam Barnett, a neuroscientist at Think Alike Labs and chief executive of SBB Research, a quantitative investment firm, who was the lead researcher."Our brains were not designed to make the kind of complex decisions our financial realities demand, the kind that have many correct answers."There isn't just one right way to save money, for example.You could put your money in a shoe box, a high-yield savings account or a money market fund and each is a correct solution.Figuring out the benefits and drawbacks of each, especially when you don't feel fully up to speed on the options, is where the stress arises, says Barnett.The researchers looked at the stress on brains that crowd-sourced information -- like reading finance articles, talking to co-workers, getting prompts from finance apps or meeting with a financial adviser -- and how that compared with brains that went DIY.Turns out, people really need help when it comes to making financial decisions.The study showed that neural signals associated with relaxation and recognition increased by 21% and 29%, respectively, for "assisted" scenarios compared to "unassisted" scenarios.When they had help, those brains were more relaxed and able to focus calmly and showed a stronger ability to recognize and understand the crucial concepts they were considering, compared to when they did not receive assistance.And the attention demands that cause stress were 20% less in assisted situations over unassisted.In other words, people like to have their hands held when it comes to their money."This research revealed that assisted and unassisted brains are strikingly different," said Dr. Barnett."Even a seemingly minor piece of advice or a more organized presentation of the same information significantly impacted the neural signals we studied."The stress is no joke.According to a study conducted earlier this year by Northwestern Mutual, at least eight in ten adults feel some anxiety due to the rising cost of health care, money emergencies, income and savings.What these findings suggest is that getting financial information can greatly improve the ease of making decisions, even if it means going out of our comfort zones and asking for help.Another finding in the research showed that people got bigger brain boosts on topics related to their own experience.For Millennials, the biggest boost came from getting help with budgeting tools and paying for college.Older age groups benefited most from getting assistance on home buying and retirement.The smallest boost for young people was when they got assistance on retirement -- it is hard to get something that far in the future to feel real to your life now.But the research showed that any outside assistance, even if you ultimately disagree with the advice, can give you a quick brain boost."It is important that people understand there is no bonus for going it alone financially," said Dr. Barnett."There's no extra credit.You're just disadvantaging yourself."
How one man says he grosses millions by reselling clearance items online:::::Buy low, sell high.Its a simple idea that a bored accountant used to create a multi-million dollar business, and one that he says you can replicate as a side-hustle.Ryan Grant, a 28 year-old former accountant from Minneapolis, Minnesota, started shopping for sales in popular retail stores.He would beeline for the clearance rack and buy items in bulk.But instead of purchasing what he liked, Grant came armed with a secret weapon: an Amazon seller account and his phone.Grant would find sale items in Walmart, Target and Toys R Us, then used the Amazon seller app to compare them to online prices.ABC Soon, Grant learned the basics of business by buying low, listing on Amazon, selling high and repeating.Using this plan, he left his accountant job and started a part-time gig that he says now generates almost $4 million dollars in revenue.I was able to get that to about $1,000 a month in profit working about 10 hours a week," Grant told "Good Morning America."Amazon has its own marketplace, not unlike eBay, where businesses and individuals can sell almost anything.The seller app lets users scan a barcode and see the going rate on Amazon.Grant realized that if the price online was 50 percent higher than the price in store, he could net a profit.Since this started as a side-hustle for Grant, I wanted to see what the learning curve was and try it myself.ABC A how-to on buying low, selling high on Amazon.It takes me a total of five minutes to create an Amazon seller account.It ties into your existing Amazon account, so all you really need to add is your Social Security number and bank information.The seller account I signed up for costs $39 a month.I download the seller app to my phone and head to a local superstore.I go straight to the clearance rack and fire up the app.I use the built-in barcode scanner to quickly check prices on all the items.I find a set of Sharpie pens marked down to $10.On Amazon, they are selling for $17.89.I also find a ninja toy marked down to $4 thats $9.49 online, and a set of snow tire chains on clearance for $25 but selling on Amazon for $59.99.Calculating my profit is not exactly simple, so let me try to explain: the app does a good job showing you what you will make after Amazon takes a percentage in fees.My tire chains had a $9 Amazon fee, $1.42 fee on the toy and $2.68 on the pens.ABC The issue of shipping.Since I have a short time-frame for this experiment, I choose mail to sellers directly.It's not terribly cost effective and it takes my total profit down to about $35.Grant, on the other hand, is working at a larger scale--but he says even a part-timer can do this.Grant buys as many of an item as he can and sends it all to an Amazon warehouse.They do the shipping to individual customers.Its what that phrase fulfillment by Amazon means next to an item.It saves him the hassle of shipping, but he factors 50 cents per pound in cost on every item he has to bulk-mail to the Amazon warehouse.Individual sellers like me can mail directly to customers, but theres a lot of postage costs that Amazon can even out at its scale.Its this fulfillment by Amazon that Grant says makes the business viable in ways it wasnt in the past by using eBay or Craigslist.ABC Grant's advice for profiting big.Grant says hes on track to gross nearly $4 million in total sales this year.He pays 11 employees including himself, and his salary is $60,000 a year.He says the company nets a profit of about 10 to 15 percent, but he is reinvesting that back into the business to grow it.ABCNews.com When asked if he thinks this is a viable side-hustle, he says, "Yes, but give yourself a few months to learn."Grant also noted that it takes one to two months to figure out a system, understand what sells and find good sale items.As for his two worst purchases along the learning curve: a Dremel-like dog nail trimmer and life-size Elsa dolls.But for a man whos figured out how to get paid to bargain hunt, it seems like they are lessons well learned.
Zero to 007: Bonding with Aston Martins new model:::::Aston Martins DB11 V8 may not come with an ejector seat, tire-slashing hubcaps or an invisibility cloak, but even James Bond would be hard pressed to find fault with the newest model from the luxury British automaker.The company, long synonymous with the fictional spy franchise, has been around since 1913 yet fewer than 100,000 Aston Martins have been produced.Of the 4,000 cars that Aston Martin hand builds at its Gaydon, England, factory each year, about a quarter or roughly 1,000 are shipped to U.S. customers.Its likely that the average Americans only interaction with an Aston Martin vehicle whether its a DB11, Vantage or a Rapide S happens every few years in a movie theater.IMDB The exclusivity and rarity of an Aston Martin are part of the brands appeal, Laura Schwab, president of Aston Martin the Americas, told ABC News last month in California.For the customers who can drop $200,000 (or more) on an Aston Martin, its an achievement in their world to have this vehicle, she said.[Our customers] dont want one on every street corner.There were no Aston Martins in Schwabs hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, when she was growing up.There still arent.The biggest U.S. markets for the brand are New York, Florida, Texas and California.When Schwab showed off the DB11 V8 to her parents, their reaction was unequivocal.My mom said, Damn, thats sexy, Schwab said with a laugh.My dad was like, Oh, hell yeah.Morgan Korn Schwab warned me that the DB11 V8 was an attention-getter, even though the brands customers tend not to be flashy with their wealth, according to Matt Clarke, Aston Martins general manager of marketing and communications.That seemed like a paradox -- many people drive rarefied vehicles to flaunt their status and induce envy.The DB11 V8 marked my first time driving an Aston Martin.A stunner of a car, it drew stares wherever I went with it.One California surfer dude stopped in his tracks upon laying eyes on it, documenting the car with photo after photo.Morgan Korn On the freeway, a man in a Maserati crossed multiple lanes to get up close, snapping away on his iPhone at 85 mph.At one endlessly long red light, I caught a teen boy and his father in an Audi slack-jawed.Do you like my ride?I asked them.Both shook their heads in approval.It was easy to lose sense of reality in the DB11 (and get points on my license).I rationalized the $220,000 sticker price: with its 5.2-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the DB11 delivered 503 bhp and 498 pounds of torque with a max speed of 187 mph.The cowhide from Scotland was entirely hand-stitched by one seamstress, who would take 25 hours to complete the task.The paint on the car seven coats was an additional 50 hours.Aston Martin Aston Martin All told, at least 200 hours were required to produce this exquisite specimen of a vehicle.Any shortcomings were quickly dismissed.No Apple CarPlay?No problem.Who needed a backseat anyway?I zoomed along the deserted streets of Borrego Springs, California, remembering what Clarke had told me in our interview: Its not what the car does but how it makes you feel.Never had I been so happy to sit in traffic.Driving for miles up Palomar Mountain was awe-inspiring instead of nerve-racking.Mundane county roads became exhilarating.The DB11 V8 was transfixing.Aston Martin The alliance between Aston Martin and James Bond may have introduced millions to the iconic brand, yet the company has bigger aspirations: an ambitious vehicle rollout that includes the much-anticipated DBX, Aston Martins first SUV.I want more people to get to fall in love with this brand and with these vehicles in addition to the relationship we have with Bond, Schwab said.She went on, Were not out there chasing volume.Were not going to change our process.It takes 250 hours to hand build one and that can never change for an Aston Martin.Aston Martin Clarke said he wants an Aston Martin poster to be taped to every 7-year-old girls and boys bedroom wall.I could see that.The cars personify beauty, power, intrigue.James Bond would have it no other way.
How to ride the red-hot stock market into 2018:::::Normally, when certain stock market sectors are flying high, its not a good idea to buy in.Tried and true investing wisdom generally holds that hot stocks probably wont be hot for long.Thats because of the statistical principle of reversion to the mean: A stocks performance in the near future is much more likely to resemble its long-term past average than its recent past.By this logic, buying shares of companies in the already overvalued sectors of tech, industrials, financials and health care might not seem like a smart move.But there are some good reasons to ignore this classic wisdomat least until early next year.The reasons are: 1.To please their boards, fund managers make sure they have abundant shares of the years winners in their portfolios, regardless of any signs of trouble around the bend.Even if theyre buying late in the year, these managers want to look sharp by having these sectors in their funds.Huge inflows of investment dollars to high-performing sectors result from this corporate window dressing, propelling values.Moreover, managers are especially averse to owning the years weaker performers, such as energy, around this time of year.As a result, the likely scenario for the rest of 2017 is strong sectors getting stronger and the weak getting punished.2.Sustained low interest rates and rising employment are boosting corporate earnings domestically, spurring growth.Meanwhile, vastly improving economies around the world, especially in Europe, are fueling U.S. as well as foreign markets.These positive global economic conditions will likely continue to benefit most of the domestic stock market for at least a few more months, if not years.3.Chicken Littles like to talk these days about Black Monday -- the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 23 percent.Yet the market today is completely different.For one thing, economic conditions are far different, with interest rates a small fraction of the nose-bleed rates of the late 1980s.In the days before the 1987 crash, the S&P 500 had been declining substantially, but that hasnt been happening lately.Instead, weve had meteoric ascent.However, now that were more than 100 months into a bull market, a market correction (a drop of 10 percent) could easily occur.But theres lots of money to be made while awaiting corrections, especially widely spaced ones.4.The widely-anticipated corporate tax cut may already be baked into share prices, and the market seems relatively patient about exactly when it would come, as values havent fallen over indications that legislation might not pass until next year.For all these reasons, the current bull market will probably continue to run hard into the new year.Any opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author.Dave Sheaff Gilreath is a founding principal of Sheaff Brock Investment Advisors LLC.He has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry.
What to know about the GOP tax plan if you have kids:::::American families may find themselves confused by the GOP tax proposal unveiled this week.Proponents say they win, critics say they lose and much of it may change when and if it becomes law.So what should you know if you have kids?The exact impact on your tax bill is going to be highly variable based on your income, family size and where you live, much like current law.There are provisions that may benefit some families: the standard deduction and the child tax credit are increased.The plan also creates a new family credit.President Donald Trump and a number of Republican leaders say that the bill provides numerous family-focused benefits, especially for low and middle-income families.But many tax experts say the gains for these families are offset by other proposed changes.For instance, key deductions for state income taxes, student loan interest and medical expenses would go away.And some perks are only temporary."It's as if Houdini was in the room designing tax reform and took away with one hand and made it appear in another," said Elaine Maag, senior research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Among the most notable changes in the plan is the near doubling of the standard deduction to $24,000 for families from $12,700.That helps some middle class families whose personal deductions wouldn't be greater than that.But other deductions and exemptions that adjusted the burden for families facing other financial pressures are disappearing.Another big selling point is that the plan increases the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600, which taxpayers can claim for children under the age of 17.The House says this increase was intended to help parents with the cost of raising children.More people will be eligible to claim the credit because the income level at which it phases out is being raised.However, the first $1,000 is refundable but the extra $600 is not.If it's refundable, once your tax liability hits zero, you get a check for the balance.So that increase does little for low-income families because they have little to no tax liability.The bill also establishes a $300 family credit for each parent and non-child dependent, such as an adult child with a disability or a family member under your care.This too has its limits it's only effective for five years and it's not refundable.But the biggest problem for many families could be the repeal of the personal exemption.Currently, taxpayers can claim a $4,050 personal exemption for themselves, their spouse and each dependent.That will no longer exist if this proposal moves forward.So even with the new benefits for families, some larger families may end up paying more The bill is long and its terms complex, so many are still reviewing the full impact.But most critics and tax experts agree any gains for low to middle income families pale in comparison to those for corporations and wealthy families.A number of changes would ease the tax burden on high-income families, such as the removal of the alternative minimum tax and repeal of the estate tax, which allows them to better pass wealth from one generation to the next."This tax plan does not deliver any significant benefits to lower and middle-income families," Maag said."High-income families win."Democrats have vowed to fight the bill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the bill is full of "hidden, devastating plans to raise taxes on families" and says millions of middle-class families will pay more.Conservative proponents say the proposal provides long overdue relief for working families.But even some Republicans, like Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee said that the bill didn't go far enough to help working families.They want the child tax credit to be raised to $2,000 and made permanent.Other changes that could hurt families include the repeal of a credit for child adoption expenses and the elimination of employer-provided dependent care assistance programs.These allow workers to save up to $5,000 of pretax income to pay for dependent care expenses, such as daycare, typically through a flexible spending account.House Republican proponents say that middle-class families can expect a tax break under the proposal and expect a wage increase as well, forecasting average households will see an extra $4,000 in take-home pay thanks to a cut in the corporate tax rate.But Joann Weiner, associate professor of economics at George Washington University, argues that it is unlikely these proposed tax cuts for business will cause economic growth that will benefit families.In fact, she worries if the bill were implemented as written, lawmakers would try to make up for the deficit down the road by making cuts to social program, such as food stamps, that do benefit many American families."Overall it's a big pulling the wool over working families' eyes that they are going to benefit," she said.This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of Weiner's first name.It's Joann, not Joanne.
Kansas City residents to vote on proposed $1B airport revamp:::::A nearly $1 billion remodel of Kansas City International Airport will either provide an important boost to the city's economy, air service and national reputation, or it will be colossal waste of money designed to line the pockets of airlines and contractors while making air travel less convenient.Those are the arguments swirling ahead a citywide vote Tuesday in a contentious, years-long fight in Kansas City, Missouri, about whether to replace the 45-year-old airport's three horseshoe-shaped terminals with a single terminal.City leaders say the project will be funded by user fees and the airlines, and no tax dollars will be required.Opponents scoff at the claim, saying taxpayers will eventually foot at least part of the bill and note that the city still doesn't have any final plans or signed contracts with the chosen developer, Maryland-based Edgemoor.The opposition, led by a grassroots group called Citizens for Responsible Government, argue the city-owned airport could be modernized at a much lower cost.Mayor Sly James and other supporters say revitalizing the airport is key to the city's economy and will improve security."Your airport is everything if a city wants to grow," said Kevin Burke, president and CEO of Airports Council International-North America, an organization that advocates on issues that affect airports."It attracts businesses, offers employment to locals.It builds up the tax base, the employee base.If your airport is a first-class airport, that is a good thing for that part of Missouri.Without it, it's going to be a challenge to compete," Burke said.The airport handled 5.3 million passenger boardings in 2016, ranking it the 39th busiest airport in the U.S.But it currently offers few restaurants, retail shops or bathrooms, with small waiting areas near the gates and few amenities, such as charging stations.Those things matter to travelers, said Jolie Justus, a member of the City Council and chairwoman of Kansas City's airport committee.She said companies and convention organizers have declined to come to the city because they say the airport's layout is too congested, doesn't offer convenient flights and offers few services."Our airport has served us well for 45 years, but it really is not meeting the needs the city has, not only as a front door but also our needs to provide an airport configuration to expand services and grow as a city," Justus said.Those arguments don't persuade opponents, who say the existing terminals could be improved for millions of dollars less while maintaining the current airport's convenience and offering amenities that modern travelers require.The fight has also been divided between local passengers who use the airport occasionally and those who travel extensively.Dan Coffey, treasurer of Citizens for Responsible Government, said Tuesday's vote is a way for the city to get around a 2014 ordinance his group pushed that prohibits the city from demolishing or starting a major renovation project at any airport owned by the city.The proposal on the ballot also would give almost complete control of the airport to airlines, with little or no input from city officials or citizens, Coffey said."The ballot language only says, 'Give us permission to destroy the terminals we have now, and then just trust us that we'll build something you like,'" he said."They've spent $2 million to convince people we need this, and that seems like a bad signal to me.We are just asking people to consider our arguments, get educated and use your best judgment."Polls commissioned by the opposing camps indicate the vote will be close.Justus, the city councilwoman, said it may come down to turnout for an election on a day with few other issues to draw out voters."I'm focused on it passing," Justus said."But if it doesn't, we'll do what we always do, get up the next day, roll up our sleeves and figure out what we can do to get a modern, safe airport to move us into the future."
Losses for banks and smaller companies take US stocks lower:::::U.S. stocks slipped Tuesday as smaller companies and banks took their worst losses in a few months.With stock indexes near record highs, investors moved some money into big-dividend stocks like real estate companies.Banks and other financial companies have been climbing over the last two months, but Tuesday they skidded as interest rates moved lower.Small, domestically-focused companies had their worst day since mid-August as House Republicans began making changes to their tax bill.Their Senate counterparts are expected to introduce their own bill soon.Smaller companies tend to pay higher tax rates than their bigger peers because they make more of their money in the U.S. and don't have as many ways to reduce their taxes."Financials would be a primary beneficiary of a 20 percent corporate tax rate because they're domestically based and they pay domestic taxes," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.While the pace of company earnings is slowing, they continued to hold sway over parts of the market.Travel booking companies TripAdvisor and Priceline both plunged while Weight Watchers continued to surge after it raised its forecasts for the year.The weight loss company has more than quadrupled in value this year.The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.49 points to 2,590.64.The Dow Jones industrial average added 8.81 points to 23,557.23, another record high.The Nasdaq composite fell 18.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,767.78.The Russell 2000 index tumbled 18.87 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,479.09.Banks fell along with bond yields and interest rates.Both have moved lower over the last few days, which reduces the profits banks make from lending.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.31 percent from 2.32 percent.JPMorgan Chase fell $2.03, or 2 percent, to $98.75 and U.S. Bancorp lost $1.40, or 2.6 percent, to $53.45.First Financial Bancshares, a smaller, Texas-based bank, fell $1.15, or 2.5 percent, to $44.40.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers plunged after it slashed its profit forecast.It pointed to higher labor costs and said it will temporarily stop opening new locations at the end of its next fiscal year.The stock lost $19.35, or 28.9 percent, to $47.70.Consumer products distributor Core-Mark fell $3.07, or 9.1 percent, to $30.63 after it cut its outlook.Household goods makers, utilities, and other companies that pay big dividends did better than the rest of the market.Drugstore and pharmacy benefits company CVS Health jumped $2.15, or 3.2 percent, to $68.95 to recover some of its recent losses.Shopping mall operator GGP soared $3.19, or 16.8 percent, to $22.20.Bloomberg reported that GGP is in talks with Brookfield Asset Management about potentially buying the rest of the company.Competitor Macerich jumped $4.57, or 8.4 percent, to $58.76.Real estate, household goods and phone companies have lagged far behind

Why debt from GOP tax cuts might impose a painful price:::::When House Republicans proposed their tax-cut plan last week, critics noted that it came with a towering price: It would swell the nation's debt by $1.5 trillion at a time when the economy is already faring well on its own and a vast generation of retiring baby boomers threatens to strain the Social Security and Medicare programs.President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress argue that their plan, which would shrink the corporate tax rate and end taxes for most wealthy estates, would accelerate economic growth.It would do so, they say, by leaving more after-tax money for businesses to invest and to increase pay for their employees, who would then spend more and help invigorate the economy.Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has contended that the proposal to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent could, by itself, enlarge the economy by up to $1.2 trillion over the long run and eventually add $4,000 a year to average household income.Those claims were promptly dismissed as wildly optimistic by Democrats and many economists.Adding to the government's debts poses risks, too: More debt could drive interest rates up as the government competes with private borrowers for credit.It could also eventually require cuts to popular spending programs.And it might leave policymakers with less ammunition the next time a recession strikes.For now, the American economy is already gliding along at a decent pace.Growth has come in at a solid annual rate of 3 percent or better in each of the past two quarters.Employers have added jobs for a record 85 straight months.Corporate profits are strong.And the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, its lowest level in nearly 17 years.All of which is why some analysts argue that big tax cuts aren't needed now even if they would help stimulate the economy, which is far from sure.Instead, policymakers and lawmakers could be capitalizing on good times to take a whack at the government's surging debt $14.8 trillion (or $20.5 trillion if you include including debts the government owes itself).In a report last month, the International Monetary Fund concluded that many wealthy countries could afford to pare their deficits by raising taxes on the wealthiest without jeopardizing economic growth."We should be running surpluses when the economy is strong," William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote in a blog post after the tax plan was released last week."The proposed tax cuts would add to an already unsustainable long-term fiscal situation."Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says the cost of the Republicans' proposed tax cuts would add considerably to the federal debt burden, which now equals 75 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.By 2027, Zandi says, that burden would equal 97 percent of GDP with the tax plan and 87 percent without it."It's an unsustainable debt path," Zandi says.The government runs a deficit when it spends more than it collects in taxes and a surplus when it takes in more than it spends.Government debts are the cumulative result of years of deficits and surpluses.The federal budget last recorded a surplus in 2001.Deficit spending returned when the dotcom bubble burst, knocking the economy into recession in 2001, and the administration of President George W. Bush pushed through tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.The Great Recession of 2007-2009 and the anemic recovery that followed drove deficits to new heights, shrinking tax collections and increasing government spending on such safety net programs as food stamps and unemployment aid.President Barack Obama's $862 billion emergency stimulus program in 2009, made up of spending increases and tax cuts, widened the budget imbalance.The federal deficit peaked at $1.4 trillion in the recession year of 2009 and began to decline as the economy strengthened.It dropped in 2015.Then it started rising again, hitting $666 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.Now, even though the economy is healthier, the budget is still under strain.A key reason is demographics.The baby boom generation is trudging into retirement and collecting Social Security and Medicare.Nearly 61 million Americans were enrolled in Social Security last year, up from 49 million a decade earlier.Social Security spending is projected to rise from 4.9 percent of GDP this year to 6 percent in 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Likewise, spending on big health care programs is expected to rise from 5.4 percent of GDP to 6.9 percent over the same period as more older Americans tap Medicare, the CBO says.Then there is the effect of interest rates: Decades of historically low rates have allowed the government to borrow cheaply.Those days may be fading.The Federal Reserve, which kept short-term rates near zero during and after the Great Recession, has reversed course as the economy has improved.Longer-term rates are also expected to rise as the government debts grow, thereby, worsening the problem.Treasury will likely have to pay higher rates to keep investors buying its expanding debt.The CBO foresees federal interest payments rising from 1.4 percent of GDP this year to 2.9 percent in 2027.Zandi warns that rising rates would offset any economic benefits from the GOP tax plans.Rising deficits could also intensify pressure on lawmakers to cut popular programs.Senate Republicans have passed a budget resolution that calls for $5 trillion in spending cuts over a decade, including $473 billion in cuts to Medicare and $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.Still, senators have no specific plans yet to carry out those politically toxic cuts.Another worry: Increasing the debt will leave policymakers less room to combat the next recession with tax cuts, spending increases or both.The current economic expansion is in its ninth year the third-longest in U.S. history and a downturn at some point is inevitable.AP Economics Writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAP
Man says he's grossing millions reselling clearance items from Walmart on Amazon Video:::::Transcript for Man says he's grossing millions reselling clearance items from Walmart on Amazon We have a surprising story about a man who turned what he called his side hustle reselling items from clearance racks into a successful company.Becky Worley has his secrets.She's going to tell them now.Reporter: Buy sale items and sell them at a profit but one savvy shopper turned that straightforward idea into big business and he says, you can too.This is Ryan grant.Former job accountant.I would say about six months into that job I realized this wasn't the path for me.Reporter: But he learned the basics of business, buy low, sell high.And with that idea started a part-time job that he says now generates almost $4 million in revenue.The 28-year-old who lives in Minneapolis found sale items in Walmart, target, toys "R" us then used the Amazon seller app to compare them to online prices.He'd buy low, list on Amazon, sell high and repeat.I was able to get that to about a thousand dollars a month in profit working about ten hours a week.Reporter: That made him confident enough to quit his accounting job.Now he says he has a warehouse full of boxes, a staff of 11 people and he says you can do it too.Okay.Let's try it.I've already installed the Amazon seller app.It took me like five minutes online.So now all I have to do is go into the store, find some clearance items and then take them home and sell them online hopefully at a profit.Sure enough, I fire up the Amazon seller app and then it has this camera.Using that I scan the bar code for this toy that cost 4 dis here in the store.Online it's selling for $9.49.That's a profit.These pens, buy it for $10, sell it online and make over $5 profit.Finally tire chains.$25 in store, but listed online for $59.Even after I take into account Amazon fees and shipping costs, I profit about $15.After a few months of learning what sells and how to factor in those shipping costs, Ryan thinks you could make $1,000 to $2,000 doing this part time.I do think it's something anyone can do if you're willing to put in the work.Ryan says he's making about 15% profit on sales of roughly $4 million.He only pays himself 60,000 in salary but I see how you could make money in this.I listed my items right from my phone.It took me 60 seconds per thing I'm selling.I tan to make 35 bucks in profit in my little small-scale test.It's not 4 million but it's a start.No, but it's something.Now, I guess it's this app must make all the difference.We've had craigslist and Ebay and people didn't seem to do it.It's all about that phrase you've read before fulfillment by Amazon.He buys in bulk and males everything to an Amazon warehouse.They deal with all the shipping to customers.Ebay and craigslist doesn't do that.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

guest, funny guy, Emmy nominated guy, a mission to make America laugh again, please welcome Denis Leary.???Welcome to my house ???Are you ready?Yes.Hi.Mwah.Hi.How are you?Mwah.Nice to see you.Hi, guys.Hello.Wow.Holy cow.I'm so excited.This is like -- I'm like an anchor on "Good morning America."Right?This is like -- Yeah.This is kind of official.This is it.Oh, my god.You don't have a tie on.George, I'm never wearing a tie again.So like I'm the main guy.I'm in the middle.That's true.Dr. Denis Leary here with "Good morning America."I'm here to announce that George Stephanopoulos is running for president in 2020.And we're not going to use the last name, it's going to be George 2020 and I'm taking over his slot so we're announcing that today.So -- Big news story.He's going to run for president and I'll be a "Good morning America" regular.How is that?Dr. Dennis leer which without a tie, thank you.I am a doctor.All rit.I'm ray celebrity -- are you a celebrity doctor, a fake doctor, celebrity -- I think I am.Really?I hate that.It's true.They give it to anybody, right?So I got one from my ALMA mater and Emerson college and I did well there and graduated with a degree in acting and writing then when I got famous they gave me a celebrity doctor at and it is real.You get it framed and everything, right?So -- Actually wear a white coat here.You're really taking it quite seriously.I take it seriously.I called a good friend, Michael J.Fox, Mike fox who's like -- yeah So I was so puffed up.At first I called my mom.She's like oh, my god.My son is finally going to be a doctor.My Irish immigrant mom.Big move and Mike, I said you're not going to believe this.I'm going to be a doctor.He said, welcome to the club.I go, what do you mean.Mike didn't even finish high school, okay.He was on "Family ties" when he was like 16.He said, I have eight doctorates because they just hand them out to famous people.Great.We'll get you another one.Now I'm upset.Spreeing of handing things out, no, but I'm going to give you a fruitcake.What do you think about that?I'll tell you what I think -- don't applaud.Please.This is -- I just want to say something about fruitcake.I'm Irish.I had aunts that used to make these things and I play hockey.They last longer than hockey.These are not food.You can throw this at somebody in an argument and hurt them, okay.This is the most thoughtless gift you could give to a person.This is like walking outside and going, hey, a rock, let me give it to robin.Merry Christmas.That was -- you just proved the point, fruitcakes are known as the most thoughtless gift.Horrible and have you ever tasted one.No, I have not.Just once.I have not.They're horrible.No, no.The reason I'm talking about this, target is actually trying to combat people receiving gifts they don't like and saying a feature called gift now, sends an e-mail to your recipient.They can either accept the gift you've chosen for them whether it be a fruitcake or choose an entirely different gift.What do you think about that?Before they ship it you can say, no, thanks, I don't want to fruitcake I'll take socks.I think it's brilliant.I'm tired of my kid, adult, 27 and 25.I know it's a cliche when they say what do you want.I say, this rancwrench.Then they buy me sog I don't want and don't get the socks or wrench.So now you can change it.I do like it.I think it's good.Is it already up and running for the holidays?But Dr. Denis Leary, this is his new book out right now and, you know what, we have been -- Can we say the title.You can say it.We can't say all of it.So I'll say it.So you won't get in trouble.Look, we blocked it out, the last word.It's called "Why we don't suck."Hang on and how all of us need to stop being such partisan little -- rhymes with stitches.What are you doing here?I can see it's on the book.Are you blurring it out.Blurring it out right there.You did start with a warning.I start the book with a warning.Listen, here's how I wrote the book because I -- I voted for Hillary Clinton but I didn't want to, okay.I thought she was a terrible candidate.They don't know what to clap for.[ Laughter That's like, Donald Trump, I didn't vote for Donald Trump obviously.I knew Donald Trump.He did a cameo on an ABC sitcom I did years ago called "The job."He also did a tinge on "The apprentice" for my foundation.He was a nice guy.He was generous.He was on time.He knew his lines when he had them memorized but he was a different color.He was white.He was actually -- he made me look like I was a dark skinned person.He was so white so it was a different guy.But he -- whatever you want to say about trump, he has changed the game.So after the election I did -- I do this concert every year for the cancer foundation at T.D.Garden.This year it's November 18th.Yeah.So four days after the election, I did a concert and what I basically did was go up and stage and vent against Hillary and against trump and the audience was explosive so people -- I could tell they had -- half voted for Hillary and half voted for trump so to me I thought I got to write ray book about it because it got more and more divisive and nothing is getting done.So in trump's world which he's changed the game, celebrities can now become president so I think we have to look at it that's why I said George 2020.Weed to to stop -- yeah, let's change the process.I want to have -- talk about so you think you can dance or "Dancing with the stars" we should have a reality show to elect the next president.Someone said we already did that.Right.I mean, because the debates suck.We don't learn anything at the debates so I say you have a 13-week reality show called "President idol" as Howard Stern was calling it or I call it "America's got leaders."Four celebrity judge answer have all these people that want to run for 1 week, give them tanks, make them dance, sing, whatever you want to do and on November 2nd or 7th we vote by phone.That's it.No electric tort college.That's it.The winner is the winner.I mean I think that's the future, you know.Something to think about.It's so scary.Nick lachey would be a great presidential candidate on that show.I'm telling you.Justin Timberlake could be president.I think we need a woman.I want Oprah.Yay.There we go.I want Oprah.There you go.Because --S if.Oprah would be so great because you know every three weeks she'd give us free stuff.You know what I mean.That wouldn't suck.That would be great.That would be awesome.So anyway the book is about -- it starts with the election and just want to remind I'm out to make people laugh their asses off but I want to talk about racism.All the stuff that was so divisive that's still happening, racism and sexism and all that stuff and make people laugh about how twisted we have been in the last couple of years.And that we don't suck.And we don't suck?That is nice and remind ourselves how great of a country we are and like my democratic friends have lost their sense of humor.My Republican friends have lost their sense of humor and nothing is getting done.Look at the carvilles.No, no, no.You don't want me to be president.I'd be impeached within four months.All I would do can just a free beer for everybody.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.But you can doesn't "Why we don't suck," it's out today.Out today.Are we done?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Forbes says Commerce head overstated wealth by $2 billion:::::Forbes reported Tuesday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross exaggerated his net worth to the magazine by $2 billion.The publication cited years of internal reporting notes and conversations with Ross, an investor who has been described as "the king of bankruptcy" for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliver profits.Forbes estimated Ross to be worth $2.9 billion in its 2016 list of the 400 richest people in the U.S.The magazine says it decided to remove Ross from the list after financial disclosure forms filed after his Cabinet nomination showed less than $700 million in assets.Forbes says Ross protested, claiming that he had transferred more than $2 billion to family trusts between the 2016 election and President Donald Trump's inauguration.But when that claim raised ethics and tax questions, the Department of Commerce issued a statement saying there was no such transfer.Forbes says it is now "confident that the money never existed.It seems clear that Ross lied to us."The Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment.Ross, the Trump administration's point man on trade and manufacturing policy, is also facing questions over leaked documents showing that he has a stake in a company that does business with a gas producer partly owned by the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Ross told Britain's Sky network that he disclosed his investment in Navigator Holdings, a shipping giant that counts Russian gas and petrochemical producer Sibur among its major customers.The commerce secretary says U.S. ethics officials who reviewed his finances did not ask him to sell his Navigator stock.
Gen Zers fueling growth in online shopping for holiday season, survey says:::::Gen Zers are becoming a larger part of the shopping scene and could be driving more sales online this holiday shopping season, a survey done by Deloitte reveals.Gen Zers and millenials are planning to spend 61 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of their budget online while Baby Boomers predict spending 48 percent of their budget online, according to the survey."Whats happening is more and more consumers are comfortable with shopping online.Millennials are becoming more important [in the retail industry] and even Gen Xers are getting their own spending power," Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at The NPD Group, a retail industry analyst firm, told ABC News.These numbers are relative to household incomes, but overall this holiday season is expected to see a boom in e-commerce unlike past years as online sales shift to becoming the preferred shopping destination, with 55 percent planning to shop online.Forty-four percent of respondents said they plan to shop in-store.Gabe Souza/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images The remaining respondents plan on shopping through print catalogs and direct mail promotions.Last year, Deloitte's survey showed an even split at 47 percent preference between the both online and store, making this year the first that online is seen as the preferred option to visiting a local mall or boutique.In past holiday retail surveys, we would point out that consumers were combing the internet for deals, comparing prices and looking for recommendations.But when it came time to make the transaction, shoppers would hit the stores, reported Deloitte in the 2017 survey results.This year, that may not be the case.Additionally, the timing of when consumers decide to buy also plays a role in where they are shopping, Cohen said.All the energy of the retail goes toward getting the consumer to shop sooner ... the retailer tries to move the holiday earlier, explained Cohen, citing that online shopping changes the way people view Black Friday, as it is not the only time of the year to get the lowest prices.For example, Amazon Prime Day falls in July and is full of a day of deals.Mohammed Elshamy/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Another reason Cohen said gives online shopping a competitive draw over in-store options is the lack of desire to spend time inside of those stores, but he said the products consumers are shopping for also dictate whether or not theyll want to go to stores.Electronics and toys are the largest product groups that are purchased online, while apparel, accessories and impulse items are not as strong in the online shopping sphere, said Cohen.
Business Highlights:::::___ How wealthy would gain at expense of others in GOP tax plan WASHINGTON (AP) The House Republicans' tax-cut plan springs from a core argument: What's good for big business and the moneyed elite is inevitably good for the economy and everyone else.Their plan would slash corporate tax rates, end inheritance taxes for the ultra-rich and create new tax advantages for business owners.To help pay for some of those breaks, the plan would end tax deductions for college loans, high medical bills, moving costs and state and local income taxes.Meadows: Tax bill won't quash individual mandate WASHINGTON (AP) An influential conservative congressman predicts "there's no way" the House tax bill will include a repeal of an "Obamacare" mandate that individuals buy health insurance.Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows says GOP leaders are concerned that mixing the tax overhaul measure and a key element of the party's failed health care bill could complicate the tax drive.But the North Carolina Republican says the House GOP would gladly embrace the idea if the Senate were to add it.Yellen says public trust in Fed ethics is critical WASHINGTON (AP) Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Tuesday that the Fed's effectiveness critically depends on the nation's confidence that the central bank is acting only in the public's interest.Yellen said it is important for Fed officials to "demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt."Yellen's comments were her first public remarks since President Donald Trump announced last week that he was by-passing her and nominating Fed board member Jerome Powell as the next Fed chairman.In Silicon Valley, the homeless illustrate a growing divide MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.

investors moved some money into big-dividend stocks like real estate companies.Banks and other financial companies have been climbing over the last two months, but Tuesday they skidded as interest rates moved lower.Small, domestically-focused companies had their worst day since mid-August as House Republicans began making changes to their tax bill.Their Senate counterparts are expected to introduce their own bill soon.Smaller companies tend to pay higher tax rates than their bigger peers because they make more of their money in the U.S. and don't have as many ways to reduce their taxes."Financials would be a primary beneficiary of a 20 percent corporate tax rate because they're domestically based and they pay domestic taxes," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.While the pace of company earnings is slowing, they continued to hold sway over parts of the market.Travel booking companies TripAdvisor and Priceline both plunged while Weight

the S&P 500 this year.The stocks are generally seen as cautious investments, and investors look for them when they are worried about market volatility.But investors have been betting on improved economic growth rather than looking for safety.Travel website TripAdvisor plunged after its third-quarter revenue fell short of analyst estimates.Booking service Priceline Group had a

Yellen says public trust in Fed ethics is critical:::::Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Tuesday that the Fed's effectiveness critically depends on the nation's confidence that the central bank is acting only in the public's interest.Yellen said it is important for Fed officials to "demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt."Yellen's remarks came at a ceremony where she and former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke were honored with this year's Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government, named for the late Illinois senator.Yellen and Bernanke were recognized for their efforts to increase transparency at the historically secretive Federal Reserve.Yellen's comments were her first public remarks since President Donald Trump announced last week that he was by-passing her and nominating Fed board member Jerome Powell as the next Fed chairman.Yellen did not mention her status at the Fed or the current state of the economy in her brief remarks.While her four-year term as Fed chairman ends on Feb. 3, her term as a Fed board member does not end until early 2024.Yellen has so far remained mum about whether she will stay on the seven-member board after her term as chairman ends.In her remarks, Yellen noted that in addition to having a long and distinguished career in Congress, Douglas had early in his political career had established high ethical standards.She said in 1939 he became one of the first public officials in America to publish a full accounting of his personal finances."He believed that the public's trust was so fundamental to the effectiveness of government that such steps were appropriate," Yellen said."As a senator, he continued to publish his finances and observed strict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from him as a public official."Yellen said he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the widespread requirement of finnacial disclosure and limits on public officials accepting gifts.
Paradise Papers: Prince Charles lobbied on climate policy after shares purchase:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: Prince Charles offshore investments revealed Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting, BBC Panorama has found.The Paradise Papers show the Duchy of Cornwall in 2007 secretly bought shares worth $113,500 in a Bermuda company that would benefit from a rule change.The prince was a friend of a director of Sustainable Forestry Management Ltd.The Duchy of Cornwall says he has no direct involvement in its investments.A Clarence House spokesman said the Prince of Wales had "certainly never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a company that it may have invested in."In the case of climate change his views are well known, indeed he has been warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years."Carbon markets are just one example that the prince has championed since the 1990s and which he continues to promote today."'Conflict of interest' He added Prince Charles was "free to offer thoughts and suggestions on a wide range of topics" and "cares deeply" about the issue of climate change but "it is for others to decide whether to take the advice".Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Prince Charles's actions amounted to a serious conflict of interest.He said: "There's a conflict of interest between his own investments of the Duchy of Cornwall and what he's trying to achieve publicly."And I think it's unfortunate that somebody of his importance, of his influence, becomes involved in such a serious conflict."The leaked documents held by law firm Appleby show the Duchy of Cornwall also made offshore investments totalling $3.9m in four funds in the Cayman Islands in 2007.This is legal and there is no suggestion of tax avoidance.A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said Prince Charles voluntarily pays income tax on any revenue from his estate.He added the estate's investments "do not derive any tax advantage whatsoever based on their location or any other aspect of their structure and there is no loss of revenue to HMRC as a result".Kept confidential The prince began campaigning for changes to two important environmental agreements weeks after Sustainable Forestry Management (SFM) sent his office lobbying documents.Prince Charles's estate almost tripled its money in just over a year although it is not clear what caused the rise in the share value.Despite his high profile campaign, the environmental agreements were not changed.The documents reveal the Duchy of Cornwall, an 896m private estate that provides Prince Charles with an income and which he is said to be "actively involved" in running, bought the shares in February 2007.At the time $113,500 was worth about 58,000.One of SFM's directors was the late Hugh van Cutsem, a millionaire banker and conservationist who has been described as the one of the Prince's closest friends.The minutes of a company board meeting that approved the Duchy's shareholding say: "The Chairman thanked Mr van Cutsem for his introduction of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Board unanimously agreed that the subscription by the Duchy of Cornwall be kept confidential except in respect of any disclosure required by law."Source document Change in policy SFM traded in carbon credits, a market created by international treaties to tackle global warming.It wanted to trade in credits from "tropical and subtropical forests" but was hampered by two important climate change agreements, the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the Kyoto Protocol, which largely excluded carbon credits from rainforests.When the Duchy bought its shares, SFM was lobbying for a "change in policy" on carbon credits, the documents show.It had hired the US former lead negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol, Stuart Eizenstat "to lobby for inclusion of forest carbon credits" in new US and EU laws and regulations.Board minutes from February 2007 show SFM was also taking "steps to influence events to support forest credits" ahead of Kyoto Protocol meetings at the end of the year.On 6 June 2007, four months after the Duchy bought its shares, Mr van Cutsem asked SFM's chairman to send lobbying documents to the office of the prince.Under the heading "public policy and advocacy", minutes of a board meeting held in Paris say "the chairman referred the committee to the bundle of materials which had been prepared by the company for various policymakers... Mr van Cutsem... asked that a set of documents be prepared for the Prince of Wales office.The chairman undertook to do so".Rainforests project Four weeks later, on 2 July, Prince Charles, made a speech that criticised the EU ETS and Kyoto Protocol for excluding carbon credits from rainforests, and called for change.Speaking at the Business in the Community Awards Dinner, the prince said: "As the Kyoto protocol now stands tropical rainforest nations have no way of earning credits from their standing forests other than by cutting them down and planting new ones," he said."The European Carbon Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forests from developing nations.This has got be wrong and we must urge the international community to work together to redress these failings urgently."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The campaigning was taking place ahead of meetings about the Kyoto Protocol In October 2007, he launched the Prince's Rainforests Project, which aimed to "increase global recognition of the contribution of tropical deforestation to climate change and to find ways to make the rainforests worth more alive than dead."In a speech to mark the launch, he said: "The Kyoto Protocol does not have a mechanism to protect standing rainforests."Credits are available for afforestation and reforestation projects, but not for maintaining an old growth forest.And the European Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forestry in developing nations altogether surely we have to accept that the pressing urgency of climate change requires a response that embraces rather than excludes primary tropical forests?"Panorama has been unable to find evidence of any speeches the prince made before 2008 about changing Kyoto and EU ETS to include carbon credits for rainforests.The programme asked the prince's office for any such speeches but they did not respond.'Helping hand' Over the next six months, the future king made further speeches and videos about rainforests.In a video released in January 2008, the prince said: "The immediate priority, I believe, is the need to develop a new credit market which will give a true value to carbon and the ecosystem services the rainforests provide the rest of the world."In February 2008, he reportedly discussed rainforests at a private meeting with the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown.Days later, he met with the then President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the EU's environment, energy, trade and agriculture commissioners.Image copyright European Parliament In a speech to 150 MEPs, he said: "I have great hopes that the next version of the European Emissions Trading scheme might extend the helping and very visible hand of a market approach to assist in keeping the rainforests standing the lives of billions of people depend on your response and none of us will be forgiven by our children and grandchildren if we falter and fail."On 18 June 2008, as the global financial crash was beginning, the Duchy sold its stake in SFM.The documents show it was paid $325,000 for the 50 shares.SFM is no longer in existence.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Alistair Graham says Prince Charles should be accountable to public scrutiny The Duchy was established in 1337 and uses the income to fund the public, private and charitable activities of the Prince of Wales and his children.Its accounts are independently audited and put before Parliament.A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said the estate followed a "responsible investment policy which governs the sectors that it may invest in".The Paradise Papers documents also showed about 10m of the Queen's private money was invested offshore in 2004-2005 in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Sky threatens to shut down Sky News to aid Fox takeover:::::Image copyright Reuters Sky has threatened to shut down Sky News if the news channel proves to be a major obstacle in its takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.Regulators are investigating the deal amid concerns that Mr Murdoch's media empire could become too powerful.Sky told the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that the regulator should not assume "the continued provision" of Sky News.BBC media editor Amol Rajan said it was a "credible threat".In a submission made to the CMA last month, but published by the regulator on Tuesday, Sky said it "would likely be prompted to review" its position if "the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky's broader business".This would particularly be the case if shareholders objected to the merger not happening, Sky said in its submission.The BBC understands that closing Sky News would only be an option of last resort, and that Sky would try to find a buyer for the media company before that eventuality.Losses But our media editor said Sky could go through with the closure due to "the sheer amount of time this proposed merger is taking to go through" - it is six years since Fox first put in a bid.He added that a second "and maybe more pertinent reason is the fact that Sky News loses an awful lot of money.""It employs hundreds of journalists, it produces world-class material, but it loses tens of millions of pounds, and I think the independent directors of Sky are sending a very clear message... that if they had to choose, maybe they'd prefer for commercial reasons to do the deal with 21st Century Fox rather than continue to fund the losses at Sky News."Probe into Murdoch's Sky bid confirmed What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal?The submission comes a day after reports that Fox has discussed selling "most" of its business, including its Sky stake, to Disney.Fox has faced a number of hurdles in its bid to buy Sky, including the CMA investigation and opposition from some politicians.Fox owns 39% of Sky but wants full control of the satellite broadcaster.But some fear it would give Rupert Murdoch's family too much control over the UK media.Mr Murdoch's News Corp owns The Times and The Sun newspapers.Sky News, which has been broadcasting for 28 years, is an influential, 24-hour, international channel.

Tax secrets of the ultra-rich Property deals Blackstone is one of the world's biggest private equity groups and its founder and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump.Leaked documents from the offshore law firm Appleby, seen by BBC Scotland, show for the first time how the group structured two major UK property deals.Top accountancy firms issued long documents to Blackstone outlining how it could use trusts in the tax haven of Jersey and a complex structure of companies in Luxembourg for the purchase of both Chiswick Park and the St Enoch Centre.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump There is no suggestion that the plans were illegal but campaigners the Tax Justice Network described the structures Blackstone used as an "economic fiction".They told the BBC it was clear from the data in the papers that the principal purpose of the structures, which are virtually identical, was to avoid tax.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The leaked documents show the tax structure was designed to "minimise" taxes 'Losing revenue' US tax expert Reuven Avi-Yonah, from the University of Michigan law school, said the documents gave a "rare" insight into company structures that even tax authorities did not often see."If HMRC becomes aware of the fact that this is a common type of structuring then they are more likely to challenge it because they will be aware they are losing a lot of revenue," he said.Chiswick Park Image caption Chiswick Business Park in west London is host to dozens of companies Blackstone purchased Chiswick Park, a 33-acre office development in west London, in 2011 for 480m.The majority of the site, which hosts the UK headquarters of companies such as Pokemon, Avon and shopping channel QVC, was sold to the Chinese government for 780m in 2014.The data suggests Blackstone's tax structures allowed it to avoid about 19m in stamp duty on the purchase.The tax structure also meant it could avoid tax of up to 30m annual rental income and capital gains tax on the sale of the business park, which could have been tens of millions of pounds.St Enoch Centre Image caption Blackstone still owns the St Enoch Centre In 2013, the private equity giant also bought the St Enoch Centre in Glasgow, a large city centre shopping complex housing almost 100 stores, for about 190m.Documents show it would have avoided stamp duty of 7.6m and corporate tax on up to 10m annual rental income.Source document Image caption The documents show the Jersey trusts allowed no Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) to be paid on St Enoch Virtually identical Both the St Enoch Centre, which Blackstone still owns, and Chiswick Park were already held in property trusts known as JPUTs, in the tax haven of Jersey, when it bought them.This allowed the firm to purchase the properties without paying millions of pounds in UK stamp duty.George Turner, from the Tax Justice Network, told the BBC: "What they are doing is buying into the trust so when the original owners sold the property to Blackstone, then they weren't selling the property itself."They were selling an interest in the trust that owns the property and because that trust is owned offshore, they can avoid stamp duty."Under the tax structure revealed in the leaked documents, the Jersey trusts were owned and funded by a series of companies that Blackstone registered in Luxembourg.Money for the purchase of the properties was filtered through the Luxembourg companies from central Blackstone funds in the form of inter-company loans.The interest payments on these loans, which were effectively passed from one Blackstone company to another, could be written off against the profits of the rental income, meaning that minimal tax was paid in Luxembourg.In the case of Chiswick Park, a 33-page document was provided by accountancy firm PwC outlining the structure to be used.Another of the "Big Four" accountancy firms, Deloitte, issued a 67-page document for a similar tax structure for the St Enoch Centre.The job of law firm Appleby, who held the documents seen by the BBC, was to implement the structures outlined by the accountants.The central purpose of which was to avoid: Stamp Duty - by holding the property in an offshore trust in Jersey, and maintain them as collective investment schemes Income Tax - on the rental income, by funding the acquisition through a series of inter-company loans and Profit Participating Loans (PPLs), the interest payments on which can be used to write off against profits Capital Gains Tax - on disposal, thanks again to the Jersey trust George Turner, from the Tax Justice Network, said: "The language really is quite shocking in places because it's so clear and blatant what the intention is."What you have here is a whole myriad of companies being set up, mostly in Luxembourg but also you have this trust structure in Jersey, and it seems to be to all intents and purposes an economic fiction."Inter-company loans Profit from rental income at the St Enoch Centre had normally been about 10m a year.The structure advised by Deloitte allowed Blackstone to turn that into tax free income, by writing it off against interest charges generated from the loans its companies had made to each other.In some years, just a few thousand pounds appears to have been paid by the Blackstone Luxembourg companies owning St Enoch and Chiswick.Mr Turner said: "What appears to be happening is that the rental income which is coming in, the companies receiving that are then borrowing huge amounts of money from other companies which are part of the Blackstone Group."Now when they borrow that money, they need to pay interest on it and those interest payments destroy any profitability in those companies."They're borrowing money from themselves and they can claim a tax deduction on that."Blackstone said: "Blackstone's investments are wholly compliant with UK and international tax laws and regulations."The property investment structures in question were acquired from institutional investors and are of a type commonly used for decades for investments in UK real estates, including by listed companies and a variety of institutional investors, and were adopted after appropriate advice was taken from leading tax and legal advisors."Deloitte, which advised on the St Enoch purchase, declined to comment.PwC, who advised on Chiswick Park, said "The advice we provide is given in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including proper disclosure to tax authorities."Reporting team: Mark Daly, Calum McKay, Ian Bendalow and Rachael Miller.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only) Watch Scotland's Paradise Papers on Tuesday at 19:00 on BBC One Scotland.
Snapchat owner plunges as losses continue:::::Image copyright Getty Images Snapchat owner Snap says it is working to overhaul its signature messaging app, as it struggles to attract users and turn a profit.Shares in the firm plunged after hours on Tuesday, after the firm reported losses of more than $400m (337m) in the quarter.It also had lower-than-expected revenue and user growth.Snapchat said the changes would make the app easier to use and more compatible with Android phones.However, it warned the transition could be rocky."We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business," said 27-year-old chief executive Evan Spiegel.Snapchat pioneered the craze for disappearing messages among teens.Self-inflicted problems Analysis - By Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco When you have to put out a statement denying rumours you're shutting down within a year that's when you know things aren't going particularly well.As well as denying it was going bust, in the past few months Snap has had to admit supplies of its Spectacles product, once the talk of the town, are piled high in warehouses.Revenues have been harder to come by than investors had hoped as the company struggles to turn around intense advertisers' interest - these are teenagers, after all - into a system that runs seamlessly and reliable ways to measure success.And just this week the network suffered a widespread outage.Some of Snap's problems are self-inflicted, others are inflicted by Facebook - a company that once tried to buy Snapchat, and which now relentlessly copies its best features.But it faces fierce competition from larger rival Facebook and Facebook's image-sharing network Instagram, which have introduced similar features.Learning from mistakes Snap said it had 178 million daily active users on average over the quarter, up 3% over the previous three months.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel, pictured left with his wife, model Miranda Kerr, became the youngest billionaire in the world two years ago The firm told investors it made almost $208m in revenue in the quarter, up 62% year-on-year.That represents about $1.17 in revenue per user, compared to Facebook's more than $5 in revenue per user.But Snapchat's ad prices have fallen.The firm also reported a nearly $40m loss stemming from excess inventory of its Spectacles product, sunglasses with recording capabilities, which proved less popular than hoped."We're learning from it and plan on avoiding a similar mistake in the future," Mr Spiegel said.Snapchat shares plunged more than 17% in after-hours trade, falling below $13.That extended the losses that started soon after Snapchat became a publicly traded company in March, when shares debuted at $17.The earnings report came less than a day after an outage on the service.Snapchat also had to address rumours it was shutting down.
Paradise Papers: Tycoon made $41m from 'people's fund':::::Image copyright Shutterstock An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angola was paid more than $41m in just 20 months, leaked documents reveal.The payments were made via a complex web of companies set up in the offshore jurisdiction of Mauritius.Jean-Claude Bastos also used his position to help set up large investment deals he stands to further profit from, the Paradise Papers show.All sides deny any wrongdoing.Like many oil rich countries, Angola set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest the proceeds of its natural resource wealth.Similar schemes have been used by other countries to help ensure a steady income for future generations.Angola is wracked by corruption, suffers extreme poverty and has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world.The fund, Fundo Soberano De Angola (FSDEA), which began with $5bn (3.75bn) in 2011, was mired in controversy from the start, after the then Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos' son, 39-year-old Jose Filomeno, was appointed to head it up.Jean-Claude Bastos, sometimes also known as Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, a Swiss-Angolan and close friend of the then president's son, was chosen as the fund's asset manager.Typically, a fund of this size would spread the risk of investment among several asset managers, along with the fees it pays, said one expert.Paradise Papers - Tax secrets of the ultra-rich However, Mr Bastos was given responsibility for investing almost all of the fund's money, and was paid accordingly.Today, his company Quantum Global Investments Africa Management, manages about 85% of it.One expert described the situation as "unusual".Andrew Bauer, an authority on sovereign wealth funds, told the BBC: "Funds want to hedge the risk.You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket."In a statement, the FSDEA told the BBC the appointment of Mr Bastos' company to manage the fund followed "an objective process".The firm was selected, it said, because of its "exemplary performance on previous mandates with the Angolan authorities".The fund also said giving near total control of investments to one asset manager was part of its policy for the first 18 months only.Documents seen by the BBC as part of the Paradise Papers investigation show the fund paid management fees of more than $90m (67.5m) to Mr Bastos' Mauritius-based QG Investments Africa Management.This occurred over a 20-month period between May 2014 and the end of 2015.Source document The leak offers an unprecedented view into what happened to the management fees after being paid into Mr Bastos' company.This money was split into two main chunks - with $41m declared as dividends, or pure profit, and deposited in a company in the British Virgin Islands, itself owned by a series of secretive offshore companies ultimately owned by Mr Bastos.A further $34m was paid in advisory fees to a Swiss firm majority owned by Mr Bastos.The rest, after minor expenses, was retained in the management company run by Mr Bastos.The BBC asked Mr Bastos whether secrecy was the reason for the series of companies registered offshore.He said it was entirely his personal choice how he receives dividends from his companies.He also said the dividends he receives "pale in comparison to the long term positive impact my projects will have in Angola".Both the fund and Mr Bastos said the management fees paid to Quantum Global Investments Africa Management are in line with global industry standards.Mr Bastos added that the level of work provided by the group is considerable to ensure projects are built for future success.Within months of receiving the money, a company in which Mr Bastos is a director purchased a 14-seater jet that had been priced at $31.75m.Mr Bastos told the BBC his is one of "many businesses that own an aircraft to more efficiently manage their travel requirements" and that travelling on commercial flights is "unproductive".The leaked documents also show Mr Bastos holds a personal stake in investments the fund made on his recommendation.In one, tens of millions were committed to a deal with another of Mr Bastos' companies, Afrique Imo Corporation, to build a hotel, office and a retail complex in the Angolan capital, Luanda.The deal represents a "very strong conflict of interest" according to Mr Bauer."This absolutely should not be happening."At the time, it sounded alarm bells in the compliance department of Appleby - the law firm that handled the investment, according to internal emails seen by the BBC.In one, sent from a regional compliance manager, a team member charged with making sure the deal was above board noted: "this poses issues of conflict of interest between the Manager, Fund and the Investee Company".However, an email from Appleby's director back to the compliance team notes Mr Bastos had "disclosed his interest" and, in a board meeting convened to agree the hotel deal, had "abstained from voting".Crucially, though, the director notes Mr Bastos "was still present in the meeting", before adding: "For the purpose of managing the conflict, Mr Bastos should refrain from attending any meeting."Source document On seeing the confidential emails of the exchange, Tom Keatinge, a specialist in financial crime, told the BBC he was "sure they are going to come to a conclusion that this is not a transaction that they should be approving".Appleby "provide[d] the client with the answer that he wanted", said Mr Keatinge."It's hard to believe that just because he abstained from the voting, his views were not well understood by the meeting.So it's a scurrilous approach in my view."As well as the Luanda complex, two other investments made for the fund in that period carried similar apparent conflicts of interest for Mr Bastos, according to the Appleby documents.Mr Bastos told the BBC that where he holds a stake in investments, he views these investments as "having aligned interests" and not being "conflicted".Political elite The FSDEA said its investment policy for the first 18 months encourages "close interrelation and synergies... to increase the speed of portfolio development and boost institutional reach".There are also questions about whether the hotel project represented a good investment for the fund.A former employee of Quantum Global with a direct knowledge of the Luanda deal said in 2016 the project was assessed as "economically unviable" because it would not bring good enough returns for the fund.The investment advisers' recommendation was to drop it.Mr Bastos insisted the investment was viable and said that "by developing what will become Angola's tallest building his group are demonstrating their belief in the long term potential of the Angolan economy".Image copyright STRINGER Image caption In Luanda in 2016, rubbish went uncollected after the refuse company was not paid The web of companies run by Mr Bastos would appear to be designed to "to enrich a particular individual or... group of people", said Mr Keatinge."Whoever has oversight of this structure... the political elite within Angola, there is either massive incompetence or there is complicity here."Appleby, which is the focus of much of the Paradise Papers investigation, didn't respond to specific questions about Mr Bastos - citing client confidentiality.The firm which denies any wrongdoing says it "advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business".Another document seen by the BBC raises questions for the authorities in Mauritius, after an internal report by another offshore regulator criticised Mr Bastos.The regulator in Jersey notified Mr Bastos that his application to run the asset management business was likely to be refused because it doubted his independence.It highlighted Mr Bastos' "close association" with the fund's chairman, Jose Filomeno Dos Santos, and a conviction in Switzerland for "qualified cases of misappropriation".Source document Mr Bastos told the BBC he withdrew the application before any formal decision was made by the Jersey regulator.A little more than a month later Mr Bastos applied successfully in Mauritius.He told the BBC he informed the Mauritian authorities about his conviction which in any case had expired and that his "criminal record is completely clean".The BBC asked the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius how it satisfied itself Mr Bastos was a fit and proper person to be licensed.It declined to comment on the case but said where there were "adverse" issues disclosed in an application, the handling law firm - in this case Appleby - would be responsible for checking.Again, Appleby declined to comment on individual cases.Additional reporting by Christian Bronnimann Listen to more on this story on File on 4, on Tuesday 7th November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 Watch more on this story on Newsnight, BBC Twoat 22:30 GMT Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Shopping choices shrink in Portas Pilot towns:::::Image copyright Getty Images Choices for shoppers in English town centres are shrinking, according to research for the BBC.A survey of 12 government-funded "Portas Pilot" towns found nearly 1,000 shops had disappeared in five years.The towns were awarded a share of a 1.2m fund, government support and access to retail guru Mary Portas.But Ms Portas was critical of the scheme, saying it was a "weighted PR campaign" that hadn't kick-started growth.The Department for Communities and Local Government said that following the pilot schemes, it was focused on "sharing the learning from successful areas".The government will support people as they try to adapt and make the most of their High Streets, the department added.Empty shops The "Portas Pilots" were created to showcase innovative ways of getting people back into local shops.The pilot areas are Bedford, Croydon, Dartford, Greater Bedminster, Liskeard, Margate, Market Rasen, Nelson, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Stockport, Stockton-on-Tees and Wolverhampton.Over five years there's been a net loss of nearly 1,000 shops in the towns, a drop of 17%.That equates to the loss of one shop every 22 days.The choice of shops also decreased.The number of shops selling big ticket items such as clothes and electrical goods declined in all but three of the towns.The research, carried out by the Local Data Company (LDC) for BBC Radio 4's You and Yours, found that in total there had been a net loss of 996 retail units.Matthew Hopkinson, LDC director, said: "This is very common up and down the country.Because there are more empty shops in town centres, businesses from the fringes of these towns are relocating into the heart of town centres."He added: "This leaves more redundant space on the edge of town centres".Regeneration Empty spaces both in and out of town centres can be re-purposed for other uses such as for housing and offices.Over the five years, vacancy rates in 10 of the 12 Portas town centres have fallen.This may be because different types of business move in, or because units are taken out of use.Mr Hopkinson said there are not more empty units, but there may be fewer shops in general.Some councils are changing the use of buildings, or even knocking them down, or focusing the retail offer on a smaller area in the town centre, he added.Ms Portas told the BBC she predicted five years ago that there would be less retail space on High Streets.At that time, she was asked by then Prime Minister David Cameron to review the state of UK High Street retail.She said there will be a continued contraction of town centre shopping in the years to come, adding: "There are areas of the country where people have cottoned onto this."We're spending our money on eating out, socialising and wellbeing.Therefore we should be building the right places and spaces for the future to cater for how people want to live."Despite being critical of the scheme, Ms Portas said she is proud of what her pilot towns have achieved."Never underestimate people-power because that is what it came down to," she said.But she told You and Yours that she had hoped her review would serve to highlight real issues facing the UK's town centres and that government would have taken more action."That didn't happen.It was a weighted PR campaign which looked like 'Hey, we're doing something' and I hoped it might kick start something - but it didn't".A DCLG spokesperson said: "High streets and town centres are at the heart of our local and regional economies - creating jobs, nurturing small businesses and injecting billions of pounds into our economy."Following the Portas Review, the previous government launched the 'Portas Pilots' and provided 3.35m to 335 High Streets... with local teams creating projects to meet their own needs."The focus now is sharing the learning from successful areas and making sure we support local people in realising the long-term potential of their High Streets and town centres."
SSE and Npower in energy merger talks:::::Image copyright Getty Images Energy supplier SSE says it has been in talks with the owner of rival Npower with a view to forming a new UK energy company.SSE said had been in discussions with Germany's Innogy about merging their UK gas and electricity supply businesses into an independent company.Such a merger would bring together two of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers.SSE, the UK's second-largest supplier, said the talks were "well-advanced".SSE, formerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, supplies energy to 7.77 million households while Npower serves 4.8 million.Any merger - if allowed - would see the new company nipping at the heels of the market leader British Gas, which currently has 27% of the gas and electricity supply market, according to energy consultancy Cornwall Insight.Analysis: BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz It's well known that Npower has been struggling to make money.And that its German parent, Innogy, is looking for a way to offload the business.Like all the major suppliers, Npower and SSE face growing competition, with hundreds of thousands of people switching suppliers each month.Plus they now have the prospect of the government capping their most important prices, their standard variable tariffs.Combining the two would mean they could cut costs, so there's a danger of job losses.However it's highly likely that the competition watchdog, the CMA, would want to check the deal before letting it through.Together they would have 22% of gas and electricity customers.Add in British Gas and the two biggest suppliers would have nearly half the market.Even so shares in SSE rose by nearly 3%.A combined SSE-Npower company would have a market share of 22.5%, with Germany's E.On trailing on 12%.The other members of the "big six" UK suppliers are Scottish Power - which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola - and France's EDF.Price cap pressure The merger talks take place against an intensifying debate about how well the big six companies are serving UK customers.Despite years of competition, many households do not switch supplier freely, leaving a large chunk on the most expensive Standard Variable Tariffs (SVTs).About 12 million households are on some form of default tariff, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year more than the cheapest deals.Last month, the government published draft legislation that would give energy regulator Ofgem the power to cap SVTs.Business Secretary Greg Clark has said Ofgem should use its powers to impose a wider cap on energy bills more quickly.But the watchdog has warned it could be sued by gas and electricity firms if it capped SVTs without the backing of new legislation.Competition approval Set against this, the established providers are losing market share to a growing band of small suppliers, with even local councils starting to sell their own energy packages.Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, said: "The problem - and arguably the rationale - is that the big six are losing customers at a record pace to smaller suppliers.Smaller suppliers now account for more than 8% of market share, up from 1% just three years ago, according to Ofgem data."Any merger deal between SSE and Innogy's Npower would need approval from competition authorities and shareholders.In a statement, SSE said: "In discussions, SSE is mindful of the requirements of customers and the concerns of employees.It will disclose the outcome of the discussions as soon as they are concluded."Innogy confirmed the two were in "advanced exclusive discussions".SSE shares were 3% higher on news of the talks.Energy regulator Ofgem said it would "advise relevant authorities if we were concerned that a merger would not be in consumers' interests."
'We had 300,000 taken in payment scam':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kate Blakeley: 'We lost 300,000 through payment scam' People who have been conned into authorising their bank to pay a fraudster could find it easier to get compensation, under plans being put together by the regulator.The Payment Systems Regulator is trying to devise a way to reimburse victims of authorised push payment (APP) scams.In the first half of this year, 19,000 victims lost 100m to APP scams.One such, Kate Blakeley, described the "sheer horror" of discovering the loss of almost 300,000 through such a scam.Ms Blakeley, who was in the process of buying a house with her partner, described her experience.She thought she was transferring money to the right account, but it was in fact one controlled by a fraudster."Everything had gone very smoothly," she said."Our conveyancing solicitor provided details by email of the bank accounts to make the money transfers on the day of completion."We transferred just under 300,000 on the day and within about three hours, we realised the money had gone missing."The moment of realising the money hadn't arrived as intended with the bank account we sent it to, or thought we'd sent it to, was just sheer horror."Ms Blakeley did get all the money back eventually, but lost thousands in solicitors' fees.The matter is still subject to a legal dispute.'No silver bullet' The PSR has been investigating APP scams following a super-complaint by consumer body Which?.The regulator said "good progress" was being made in a number of areas and it hoped a compensation system would be in place by September 2018.As well as starting to record and understand the scale of APP scams, the PSR will also introduce new standards for banks to follow when a victim reports such a scam, which should improve victims' experience and banks' response times.However, PSR managing director Hannah Nixon warned that not every scam could be prevented."There is no silver bullet for APP scams, and some people will still, unfortunately, lose out," she said."That's why we've continued to look for a solution that could reimburse those who are scammed, and today we begin consulting on an option that we think could work."She added that account holders also needed to take "an appropriate level of care" in protecting themselves.How to protect yourself against "push" fraud Image copyright Thinkstock When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information: the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code.However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank.So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money.Financial Fraud Action UK offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret 'Significant win' The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reviewed the way banks handle APP scams.It found banks' procedures were inconsistent, their existing fraud detection systems could not easily detect APP scams, and they did not collect enough data.However, the FCA considers the industry initiatives underway will help to tackle these issues.Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of Which?, said: "It's good to see the regulator coming down on the side of consumers.If this stops the huge amounts of money lost to bank transfer scams, it'll be a significant win."To make this a reality, the regulator must now ensure any reimbursement scheme properly compensates victims.Meanwhile, banks must move to quickly put in place better checks and protections to prevent these scams happening in the first place."
Retailers hit by worst non-food sales growth on record:::::Image copyright AFP Sales of non-food items grew at the slowest pace since records began as families chose days out over shopping, the British Retail Consortium has said.Non-food sales rose by just 0.2% in the year to October, the weakest growth since the BRC began measuring the category in January 2011.The retail body said the figures would give retailers "cause for concern" in the run up to Christmas.Clothing sales were "particularly hard hit", it said.Total retail sales, including food, rose just 0.2% last month, compared with 2.4% last year.On a like-for-like basis, which excludes new store openings, sales were down 1%.BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said "consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops".The figures - which were compiled with accountancy firm KPMG - come just seven weeks before Christmas, the key trading period for most retailers.Ms Dickinson said that the rise in inflation, which hit its highest for more than five years in September, was making shoppers "ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford".Lagging profits Several clothing chains have been struggling as the High Street faces tough competition from online retailers such as Asos.On Tuesday, fashion chain New Look reported a loss of 10.4m for the six months to 23 September, a marked reversal from the profit of 59.3m seen in the same period last year.UK like-for-like sales at the retailer fell 8.4%.Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent It's been a pretty dismal month for non-food retailers, especially fashion.The warm weather won't have helped, but even so, these figures will be a concern as the all-important Christmas trading gets into gear.With prices rising faster than wages, consumers have less money to spend on non-essential items.Retailers are also grappling with the effects of a weaker pound as well as other cost pressures.That's on top of all the structural challenges, with the continuing shift to online.It's clear that the going's really challenging right now for a number of retailers.Next has already warned of "extremely volatile" trading.The first real clue on how Christmas is shaping up will be Black Friday at the end of this month.Are shoppers merely holding back for a splurge and will some retailers now be forced to join the fray in order to shift stock at a discount to generate much-needed sales?"The results reflect another tough period of trading for the company amid a challenging retail environment on the UK High Street," said New Look executive chairman Alistair McGeorge, adding that "the retailer is not anticipating a reversal in fortunes overnight."Last week, Next reported that sales at its High Street stores had fallen by 7.7% in the year to 29 October, noting that "sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather".'Reversal of fortunes' Paul Martin, head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said that October marked a "reversal of fortunes for retailers".He said: "After a brief uptick, fashion sales reverted back to the dreary theme we have seen for a number of months this year.Unseasonably warm weather last month will not have helped, but this is unlikely to be the only reason the new ranges are proving unpopular."Mr Martin said that retailers will be hoping that consumers are saving up for Black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza in the US which has become a key date for retailers in the UK.This year it falls on 24 November, two days after the Budget.Ms Dickinson said that the Chancellor Philip Hammond should reflect on the "disappointing state of play" when he gives his speech on 22 November and "deliver a Budget that allays the risks of a further slowdown in consumer spending, by keeping down the cost of living.In other words, a shoppers' Budget."
WhatsApp: How the supermarket voucher scam works:::::Image copyright Reuters Scammers have used WhatsApp to trick people into handing over personal information by tempting them with bogus supermarket vouchers.The messenger app was used to send fake vouchers to people, purporting to be from trusted chains such as Asda, Tesco and Aldi.The messages claimed to offer hundreds of pounds in savings so long as the user followed a link to an online survey asking for personal details.The scam is a form of phishing, where fraudsters pose as reputable organisations to gain personal details.Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, suggests anyone who has fallen victim to this scam to report it online or call 0300 123 2040.So far, 33 people have come forward to report falling victim to the scam, although it is unclear how many people have received the message.How does it work?Image caption This message was sent to the WhatsApp number used by the public to contact the BBC The scam works by using a link which appears almost identical to a supermarket chain's legitimate website, but with one small difference.For example, in the screenshot above, the d in Aldi is actually a - a Latin character with a small dot underneath the recognisable letter.In the tweet below, the d in Asda has been replaced with - another character known as a crossed D. People who clicked the links contained in the WhatsApp messages are sent to a survey.According to Action Fraud, the survey urges victims to hand over their financial information.If, however, a person tries to visit the homepages for Aldi misspelled with the dotted character it sends them to an error page for a different website entirely.Image caption Attempting to visit the fake 'Ali' homepage sends the user to an error page for this website Meanwhile, at time of writing, attempting to access the misspelled Asda site brings up a warning in some browsers.Why did I get it?Upon completing the survey, the victim is urged to send the message to 20 other contacts in order to receive a 250 voucher.This helps legitimise the scam, says Action Fraud, as rather than being sent from a random number, the WhatsApp message comes from a trusted contact.However, it is unclear whether users may have been compromised simply by clicking on the link, as some on social media claimed that the message was shared without their contact's consent.A spokesperson for Action Fraud told the BBC, "from what we can see, you would have to put certain details in to be in trouble, but it would depend on the device as all the scams are different, and some can download malware on your device."Action Fraud advises people to avoid unsolicited links in messages, even if they appear to come from a trusted contact.By Tom Gerken, UGC and Social News
Grandparents help more UK mums get back to work:::::Image copyright Getty Images Grandparents are helping more mothers get back to work but the rising pension age means they may face a conflict over providing care in the future.A report from the University of Birmingham shows women's participation in the workforce rose by 26% when their parents or in-laws helped out.Dr Shireen Kanji said: "People arrive at the doorway of work, but a lot goes on behind them to get them there."However, she said grandparents could face more pressure to continue in work.The report states that "a competitive job market and expensive childcare options" mean mums rely heavily on their families.It looked 14,000 mothers in the UK who had a child in 2000.It examined who they named as their main source for after school and weekend care for children aged between four and five years old.Image copyright Getty Images It found that 36% of single working mothers primarily relied on their parents - usually their own mother - for childcare.That dipped slightly to 32% of women with a partner.The report said it was not just part-time work that mothers were returning to, it said that "full-time employment has also increased".The report's author, Dr Kanji, said: "Grandparents are providing a lot of care at the moment.It is having a causal affect - these women would not be in work if they could not get grandparents' care."The data found proximity played a key role in helping women, with 40% of working mums living within 15 minutes of their own parents.Hidden contribution Dr Kanji said it was important to recognise the contribution that grandparents were making: "Unpaid work is hidden but it is fundamental to the way that society functions."However, she said: "Grandparents themselves are under pressure to extend their paid working lives as a result of recent changes to the state pension age."The female pension age is in process of rising to 65 years old to match male retirement.The state pension age will then rise to 66 for both genders by 2020 and, under the Conservative government, will reach 67 by 2028.Life expectancy is also growing.According to insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson, a woman turning 65 in 2000 could expected to live to 86.3 while a man might live until he is 83.4.A woman reaching 65 in 2017 could live to 88.8 years old and a man could survive until 86.6.Dr Kanji said the rise is not necessarily something that will affect people who are grandparents now as "they might not have worked in the past".But she said: "For people working now, it will become an issue."She said that families would have to have a discussion about childcare in the future: "It is not an easy choice.They may feel a moral obligation to provide this care, but it will have an impact on them."Are you a grandparent who regularly cares for a grandchild?Have you returned to work and rely on your parents for childcare?Let us know about your experiences.Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your stories.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.You can also contact us in the following ways:
UK house prices continue to rise strongly, says Halifax:::::Image copyright Getty Images House prices across the UK are rising strongly and will continue to do so in the months ahead, the Halifax has reported.In the year to October, prices rose by 4.5%, up from 4% in September and the fastest rise since February.It brings the average price of a UK house to a new record high of 225,826.Cheap mortgages and high employment rates were likely to continue to support house prices over the coming months, the Halifax said.It said that last week's rise in base rates, which will affect more than four million people on variable rate mortgages, was unlikely to dampen the market."We do not anticipate the base rate rise will be a barrier to buying a house," said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank.Volatility However, some economists cast doubt on the Halifax data.Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Halifax measure was out of line with other indicators.Using a quarterly comparison, prices rose by 2.3%, according to the Halifax.On the same basis he said Nationwide had reported growth of just 0.8% in October, while Rightmove's online asking price index rose by just 0.2%."The Halifax data are particularly volatile, so we're inclined to place more weight on the Nationwide and Rightmove measures," he said.Public confidence in rising house prices has also fallen to its lowest level since December 2012, according to the Halifax Housing Market Confidence Tracker.Some 50% of those questioned in the survey believe house prices will rise over the next 12 months, the lowest level since 2013.By contrast, 20% believe that house prices will fall - the highest proportion for five years.Where can I afford to live?
The Rotherham High Street struggling to survive:::::Image caption Rotherham town centre's shop vacancy rate stands at about 23% As the latest retail industry figures show a sharp slowdown in non-food retail sales, we take a look at the problems one High Street in Rotherham is facing.There's an early morning bustle at Fitzwilliam & Hughes, a Rotherham cafe overlooking the Minster and its gardens.It's a corner plot in a listed building, it feels like a choice spot, but co-owner Matthew Leather is glum about the town."So many businesses have come and gone in the three or four years we've been here.There isn't the footfall or the attractions in Rotherham so they've not been able to last.If I didn't have a business in Rotherham I wouldn't come because there's nothing to attract you."Rotherham Borough Council says it's working on that.A masterplan includes a new area called Forge Island with bars, restaurants, apartments and a cinema down by the river and construction has started on a new university campus.The council's regeneration director Damien Wilson says it's aiming to bring "more investment and more people living, working and socialising in the town centre - it's a long-term plan".Image caption Jamie Oliver's Ministry of Food unit closed earlier this year Unemployment is higher than the national average at 5.6% and the town centre's shop vacancy rate stands at about 23% - that's nearly a quarter of the retail space.Non-food sales in slowest growth on record How a family shop has lasted 150 years The main pedestrianised retail area has the usual mix of national names, banks, bookies, vaping shops and "To Let" signs.There's even Jamie Oliver's Ministry of Food unit, which launched as a healthy eating project on the back of a TV series, but it closed this year and stands empty, next to another vacant unit.'We need the big retailers' The big retailers are conspicuous in their absence.Primark is leaving the High Street for the out-of-town Parkgate Shopping Park which is also home to M&S and Next.Chris Hamby, who sells shoes and antiques in the High Street and rents several other shops, is enthusiastic about Rotherham's potential but he says the town needs those big retail names."People like independent shops but you need a lot of crumbs to make a cake, you need a lot of people to come."As towns are evolving and changing you'll see a big store go and a shop will open selling a few candles, or a supermarket will go and someone will come selling dreamcatchers.That's not a town - we need the big retailers back."Independent shopkeepers have long since complained that pressure from business rates has left them on the edge.A revaluation in April pushed up bills in some parts of the country, but in Rotherham rateable values fell by 2% on average.Andrew Roddison is one of those who's benefitted.His Whistle Stop Sweet Shop and Temperance Bar in the Imperial Buildings now qualifies for full rates relief, and it's made a big difference."Some months the money wasn't there so for us - and a lot of businesses locally - it was a head scratching time as to whether you can afford to stay open.Now that pressure's gone it does make a difference, it allows you to invest and bring in new lines that will hopefully attract people."Image caption Yella owner Dannii Paston says some landlords are 'out of touch' with what shops are making Dannii Paston, who runs clothing and gift shop Yella Brick Road on the High Street, doesn't pay rates and is happy with her rent, but she thinks "ridiculous" rent demands from some landlords are the fundamental reason behind empty units."It's as if they're out of touch with what people are taking through the tills.In general the council-owned buildings are full and the ones that are empty are private landlords."A lot of them don't live around here so they've got no idea of the feeling, and the customers.They might live in London and think, 'I'm not reducing it from 20,000, that's cheap'."She's also noticed the impact of the Brexit vote."It was strange, like a switch.When Brexit was voted in, it just went down, I can't really explain why that might be."We lost a member of staff because of it, and three of our suppliers are in Europe so the exchange rate really affected us.For us it was the pound, I don't know what it could be with the customers.Maybe they were worrying and tightened their belts."Image caption Holy Ghost Tattoo Collective owner Emily Dawson says parking is too expensive It's Friday lunchtime and the Holy Ghost Tattoo Collective is busy with people getting tattoos and piercings."We're doing really well, I think we're probably one of the few that are thriving in Rotherham," says owner Emily Dawson.But she thinks some of the town's problems are linking to one perennial problem."They need to focus on parking, that's a big issue, because it's very expensive to park when there's not a lot to offer other than our independent shops, which are amazing."Many of the problems Rotherham's shops are facing are mirrored in towns across the UK and the solutions are not immediately obvious.As the council's regeneration director Damien Wilson says "change will not happen overnight".
Eurozone retail sales boosted by clothing and food:::::Image copyright Getty Images Eurozone retail sales grew in September, buoyed by sales of clothing, food and tobacco.Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, said retail sales in the region rose 0.7% month-on-month and 3.7% year-on-year.The figures eclipsed a 0.4% fall in car fuel sales in the month.The data indicates the area's economy is picking up amid stronger domestic demand.Economists expected less of an overall improvement.Eurostat attributed the increase in September retail sales to a rise of 0.5% for non-food products, which include clothing, furniture and electrical goods, and an advance of 1.3% for food, drinks and tobacco.Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg and France led the stronger retail volumes, while the UK, Croatia and Lithuania had the biggest decreases.Unofficial data showed sales of non-food items in the UK grew at the slowest pace since records began as families chose days out over shopping.The British Retail Consortium said the figures would give retailers "cause for concern" in the run-up to Christmas.Higher growth The European Central Bank in September raised its eurozone economic growth forecast for the year to 2.2%, the fastest pace in 10 years.The eurozone economy ended the third quarter of the year on a strong note, according to an IHS Markit survey released that month.The manufacturing sector observed the biggest rise in employment in over two decades, signalling that this quarter may also register strong manufacturing growth.
Primark owner Associated British Foods sees profits jump:::::Image copyright Press Association Associated British Foods (ABF) said its annual profits surged, buoyed by growth at its Primark clothing chain and a recovery in its sugar businesses.The food-to-fashion group said adjusted operating profit rose 22% to 1.36bn in the year to 16 September, with group revenues up 15% at 15.4bn.Primark's revenues rose 19% to 7.05bn as the chain continued to expand.ABF also said it welcomed the government's intention for a Brexit transition period beyond March 2019."In common with many other businesses, we share a concern about the risk of abrupt changes to the UK's customs procedures," it said.'Stealing share' Primark's sales come as other retailers have struggled to boost profits amid a challenging High Street environment.Even after opening 30 stores in nine countries with 1.5 million square feet of selling space, ABF said Primark still had room for "significant growth".The company said trading at Primark had been "excellent", particularly over the summer.In the UK, Primark "performed particularly well", ABF said, with sales up 10% from last year and its share of the total clothing market "increased significantly"."Primark has grown faster than any of the other top 10 clothing market players over the past five years", said Charlotte Pearce, a retail analyst at GlobalData."By providing value for money in its trend-led clothing, it has been able to steal share from midmarket retailers as shoppers trade down".Shares slip With more than 60% of ABF's sales and profits generated outside the UK, ABF's results were boosted by the weaker pound.AB Sugar, ABF's sugar unit, benefited from an increase in EU sugar prices as well as structural changes at the unit.However, ABF said it expected profits at the unit to fall in the current financial year, and these comments sent the company's shares down 3.5% in morning trade.The company expects "progress" in its grocery and ingredients businesses, whose brands include Twinings, Ovaltine, Kingsmill bread, Jordans, Dorset Cereals, Patak's and Blue Dragon.Grocery results in the past year "were held back by the trading environment faced by the UK bakeries," the company said.ABF, which spent 79m on business acquisitions in the past year, said it had completed the acquisition of Acetum, an Italian producer of high-quality balsamic vinegar.Chief executive George Weston said: "These results reflect our international diversity, and the strong underlying performance of our businesses was driven by management actions throughout the year".Brexit uncertainties ABF operates in 50 countries worldwide, with significant businesses in Europe, southern Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia.The UK's decision to leave the EU had an immediate impact on ABF's results last year due to its effect on currency markets, the company said."As the UK government continues its negotiations, uncertainty remains as to the extent to which our operations and financial performance will be affected in the longer term," ABF noted.The company said it had contributed to government-led consultations on potential changes and their potential impact on businesses "to help inform the exit strategy".
Nigeria targets recovery in record budget for 2018:::::Image copyright AFP Nigeria has set out its budget for 2018, aimed at helping the economy recover from its first recession in 25 years.President Muhammadu Buhari announced a record budget of 8.6 trillion naira (21.4bn) to modernise its infrastructure.Africa's largest oil producer climbed out of recession in 2017 after a sharp fall in energy prices.President Buhari pledged to lift output and keep peace in the Niger Delta.In his speech, he said that the country "cannot afford to go back to dark days of insecurity" in the oil-producing Niger Delta region.However, last week the militant group Niger Delta Avengers said it had ended a ceasefire and promised a "brutish, brutal and bloody" return to violence.President Buhari said: "Though we cannot control the price of crude oil, we are determined to get our production back to at least 2.2 million barrels per day."He added: "We will continue our engagement with the communities in the Niger Delta to ensure that there is minimum disruption to oil production."We must all come together to ensure peace reigns in the Niger Delta."The budget for 2018 is 16% higher than the previous year and will focus on critical sectors of the economy such as roads, health, housing and job creation.The country's deficit is forecast to hit of 2.005 trillion naira, down from last year's 2.36 trillion naira.
Brexit: Ministers publish post-EU trade legislation:::::Image copyright AFP Details of the government's post-Brexit trade policy have been published.Ministers say the Trade Bill includes provisions for the UK to implement existing EU trade agreements and help ensure firms can still access foreign government contracts worth 1.3tn.It will also create a new trade remedies body to defend UK businesses against injurious trade practices.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said firms needed "as much stability as possible" on the day the UK leaves.But Labour questioned why the bill was being published on the day Parliament rises for a week-long recess, suggesting ministers wanted to "minimise scrutiny".And unions said workers' rights must not be sacrificed on the altar of doing "dodgy deals" with countries with insufficient employment protections.The UK cannot sign or negotiate trade deals before its scheduled departure from the EU in March 2019.However, ministers say they can "scope" out future deals with key trade partners, such as the US, Australia and New Zealand.Despite its publication, the Trade Bill, one of nine pieces of new legislation in the pipeline to prepare the ground for Brexit, will not be debated by MPs until a later date.Mr Fox said the point of the bill was to "provide as much stability as possible" for businesses on the day Britain leaves the EU and to prevent market instability.But looking beyond that, the UK wanted to negotiate "more liberal" trade agreements to "provide even better market access than we have through our EU membership"."One of our worries is that global trade is not opening up," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and the UK wanted to "use its influence to get a more liberal global trading system" once it had left the EU.'Ramshackle' But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the "ramshackle bill" offered no protection for workers' rights and for public services like the NHS from foreign contractors."The Trade Bill must guarantee that the price of entry to a trade deal involving Britain is signing up to the strongest protections for workers and public services," she said.On the eve of the bill's publication, one of Donald Trump's leading allies said he was optimistic that the UK and US will sign a free trade deal after Brexit.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the BBC there had already been a "joint scoping exercise" in Washington in July on a free trade agreement and another similar meeting will be held in London next week."We're huge trading partners with each other and our economies are in many ways more similar to each other than either of us is to most of Europe," he said."So there's all the logic in the world for the US and the UK to be not only good trading partners, but FTA partners," he said.Mr Ross, who met Theresa May and other senior ministers during a two-day visit, identified continued "passporting" of financial services, compliance with EU food standards on GM crops and chlorine-washed chicken and future trade tariffs as areas that could pose problems in negotiations between the nations.
Toyota sees profits rise again:::::Image copyright Getty Images Japan's Toyota has reversed an earlier forecast of lower annual profits.It said it now expected profits for the full year to be 1.95 trillion yen ($17bn), after a previous forecast of 1.83tn yen of annual net income.The revised forecast is partly due to the weaker yen.Toyota is now assuming an exchange rate of 111 yen to the dollar, instead of 105 yen previously.The car giant's revision came with the release of six-month figures that showed profits up 13.2% at 1.07tn yen.Profits from Toyota's overseas sales fluctuate with the level of the yen against major market currencies.If the yen falls, foreign earnings buy more of the currency when brought back into Japan, giving a boost to reported profit numbers.Consolidated vehicle sales for the six months to September were 4,389,435, up by 25,898 units compared with the previous year.Sales in Japan were 1,087,354 units, up by 8,544.The key North America market saw a fall in sales of 4,211 to 1,396,158 units, while in Europe, vehicle sales were 469,503 units, a rise of 35,122 units.The company's previous yearly figures marked the first fall in profits in five years, which it blamed on the cost of customer incentives in its key US market.Toyota also said on Tuesday it would buy back another tranche of its shares, this time worth 250bn yen.Such a move typically will typically boost a company's share price, as it leaves fewer shares among which to share around the profits.
G4S leads FTSE 100 lower as growth outlook cut:::::Image copyright Getty Images Shares in the world's largest security group, G4S, dropped nearly 5% after it downgraded its revenue growth forecast.The company now expects revenue growth of 3-4% this year, compared with an earlier forecast of 4-6%, following a disappointing performance in the Middle East and India.G4S was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, with the index closing down 49.17 points at 7,513.11.Primark owner AB Foods fell more than 3.7% despite posting a rise in profits.The food-to-fashion group said adjusted operating profit rose 22% to 1.36bn in the year to 16 September, with group revenues up 15% at 15.4bn.However, AB Foods shares were hit after it said that profits at its sugar business were set to fall this year as a result of lower European Union prices.Outside the FTSE 100, shares in upmarket drinks maker Fevertree jumped nearly 15% after it said its full-year results were set to be "materially ahead" of current market expectations.It said UK trading had been "particularly impressive".On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3146 but it edged up 0.09% against the euro to 1.1356.Oil prices edged lower after having surged in the previous session.On Monday, prices had risen by the most for six weeks after Saudi Arabia's crown prince moved to tighten his grip on power at the weekend.Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest exporter of crude oil and the second-largest producer of the commodity.Brent crude slipped back below the $64-a-barrel mark to $63.81 on Tuesday, while US crude dropped 0.4% to $57.15 a barrel.
RHI scandal 'struck at the heart of NI democracy':::::Image caption There are about 2,000 boilers accredited to the RHI scheme The independent public inquiry into a flawed green energy scheme has been told that the scandal struck at the heart of Northern Ireland's democratic institutions.The claim was made at the opening of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme inquiry by David Scoffield QC.The government scheme, which started in 2012, helped collapse the Stormont Assembly in January.It encouraged businesses to switch from fossil fuels to biomass or woodchip.But a lack of cost controls meant it could have an overspend of 700m over 20 years.The inquiry, which is being led by retired appeal court judge Sir Patrick Coughlin, opened on Tuesday morning.He said that the inquiry would seek to be a "measured, objective, independent and publicly-transparent investigation".He added that the inquiry team had already examined one million pieces of documentary evidence.Image caption David Scoffield QC making his opening remarks to the inquiry on Tuesday morning Mr Scoffield, counsel for the inquiry, outlined some of the documentary evidence including text messages and emails written by politicians at the time of an "explosive" interview given by former DUP enterprise minister Jonathan Bell to the BBC.Mr Bell criticised his predecessor in the job, the DUP leader and former first minister, Arlene Foster, as well as some advisers.He was suspended from the party after the interview.Mr Scoffield added that both Mr Bell and Mrs Foster would give evidence to the inquiry voluntarily, along with five DUP special advisers: Timothy Cairns; Andrew Crawford; Stephen Brimstone; John Robinson and Timothy Johnston.Image copyright RHI inquiry Image caption Sir Patrick Coghlin is chairing the inquiry, which is expected to take several months He told the hearing that public concern had reached "fever pitch" as outcry over the scheme grew and that the inquiry would investigate a number of key allegations.This included what he described as "the most damning claim" - that politicians and their special advisers had interfered to keep the scheme open when it ought to have been closed, by delaying the introduction of cost controls.He said that the allegation of interference created the impression to the public of "improper patronage" and that it was claimed some had a "conflict of interest" because they personally, or their relatives, had an interest in the scheme.'More questions than answers' He said other claims that would be investigated by the inquiry include: Weaknesses in the scheme meant boiler owners had a "perverse incentive" to burn more fuel to earn more subsidy Allegations of fraud That the bill would have to be met by Northern Ireland's taxpayers That there were opportunities to fix flaws in the RHI scheme that were missed Mr Scoffield added that while there were "no obvious victims" of the debacle, it would be wrong to say there were no victims at all.He said many people were angry by how the scheme had panned out and it would be "hard to find a taxpayer" who did not have serious questions about the use of significant amounts of public money to pay "unplanned debt" over the scheme.Image caption RHI was a government scheme, started in 2012, which encouraged businesses to switch from fossil fuels to biomass or woodchip.He said only the final report would address issues of responsibility for problems in the scheme.Mr Scoffield said the inquiry would not address issues of civil or criminal liability, or whether individual applications were legitimate under the terms of the scheme's regulations.The inquiry team is investigating the non-domestic green energy scheme, the overspend from which might have to be paid out of Northern Ireland's block grant from Westminster.The row over the handling of the crisis contributed to the collapse of devolution in early 2017.The scheme was introduced in 2012 by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI).On Tuesday, a statement outlining the RHI scheme "from inception to the present day" was released online by the Department for the Economy, the department that replaced DETI.Image caption Many of the boilers, like this one, burn wood pellets The department later uploaded a series of documents onto the RHI inquiry website.They shed more light on the department's own take on what went wrong with the scheme.These documents refer to a handover note from an official at the then Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.The official was involved in the day-to-day running of the RHI scheme.When he left the department in 2014 - and there was a high turnover of staff in the department at that time - he left a detailed note that contained a number of priorities that required immediate attention.They included a review of RHI tariffs and consideration of cost controls to prevent excessive payments.The review never happened.And the Department for the Economy comments: "Unfortunately these points were not acted upon.The department commissioned consultants PwC to examine why this happened but the work was suspended before conclusions could be drawn."The department adds the concerns in the handover note were not escalated and RHI was not among the top issues raised in a briefing for the new permanent secretary in July 2014.Cost controls The inquiry will look at the introduction of the scheme, the oversight of it, the introduction of controls in 2015 and the suspension of the scheme the following year.In particular, it will consider why the Northern Ireland scheme did not contain the same cost controls from the outset as the one in Great Britain, which it mirrored.Key allegations it will address include that a spike of applications in Autumn 2015 was caused by firms being aware, in advance, of impending cuts to tariffs.Image caption Firms could legitimately earn sizeable subsidy by burning the fuel It will also investigate whether there was political interference by DUP special advisers to delay the introduction of cost controls.That has been denied by the special advisers.Fourteen witnesses will give evidence between now and Christmas.It is expected that Mrs Foster and Mr Bell will not give evidence until 2018.Image caption Many of the boilers are in agriculture businesses including poultry The RHI scheme was shut to new applicants in 2016.One year cost controls have been applied by the Department for the Economy that have drastically reduced the 2017/18 in-year overspend.But they expire at the end of the financial year.Image caption One-year cost controls are currently in place The department has announced plans to extend them for a year, but that will require assembly approval or the decision of a direct rule minister.The cost controls are also the subject of a legal action by boiler owners who claim the cuts in tariffs were illegal.They claim the projected overspend is vastly inflated and could be in the region of 160m, not 700m, over 20 years.Judgement in that case has been reserved.
Bombardier: US trade allies 'have to play by the rules':::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast The US has said it has been "fair and open" in its handling of a trade row that threatens jobs at Bombardier in Belfast.Wilbur Ross, the US Commerce Secretary, also said import tariffs on the C-Series jet could yet be lifted.He said Washington understood "the political sensitivity" around the dispute in Canada and the UK.However he added: "But the fundamentals remain: Even our best friends really have to play by the rules."Mr Ross was speaking in London during a five-day visit and has discussed the issue with UK officials.His commerce department has imposed preliminary import tariffs of 300% on the C-Series, after upholding a complaint brought by Boeing about unfair state aid.Image copyright Reuters Image caption US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross made his remarks during a five-day visit to London The decision can still be reversed.The row threatens jobs at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts of the C-Series jet, including the wings, are made.Bombardier employs more than 4,000 people in Northern Ireland.A quarter of that workforce is involved in making C-Series wings.The long-term future of the aircraft was given hope after Airbus took a 50.1% stake in the C-Series project.The trade union Unite said Mr Ross' remarks "offered no assurance to Northern Ireland workers".Regional co-ordinator Davy Thompson said: "If Wilbur Ross is genuine in his concern for Northern Ireland workers he should take the time to meet with their representatives in the course of the next five days."Boeing's case against Bombardier is entirely unmerited."
Prime Minister calls on UK firms to pump more into R&D:::::Image copyright Getty Images Prime Minister Theresa May has called on UK companies to invest more in research and development.At the CBI's conference she said the "economy fit for the future" would be "driven by science and innovation".But, she said, while the government was increasing support for R&D to "record levels", UK firms were not keeping pace with rivals in other countries.Later, Jeremy Corbyn reminded delegates that Labour had said it would increase R&D spending to 3% of GDP by 2030.Improving standards At last year's CBI conference, Mrs May said she had committed to increasing public spending on R&D by 2bn a year by 2021."So we are playing our part by increasing public sector support for R&D to record levels."However, she added: "Today, for every 1 of government support for R&D, British businesses invest around 1.70, but in America business invest around 2.70 and German businesses invest nearly 2.40."So I want you to work with us to drive up business investment to help develop the next generation of technologies here in the UK so that we can deliver more good jobs across the country and improve living standards for everyone."Mr Corbyn told bosses that as part of Labour's industrial strategy, which it unveiled earlier this year, it would "invest 1.3bn on research and development in our first two years in government, to galvanise private investment".But to pay for this and other measures, he said the party would "raise some taxes to pay for it... to ensure that our spending plans fit within the constraints of our fiscal credibility rule".However, he added, the party would be "clear and open" about its tax plans."We won't do it by stealth."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The government's industrial strategy will be published this month Mrs May told the conference the government would not protect the UK economy from market forces post-Brexit.She also said the government had to "make strategic decisions" about how best to support different sectors of the economy after Brexit."We believe in the free market and won't attempt to shield the economy from market forces," she said.The speech came ahead of the government industrial strategy report.The white paper, due to be published later this month, will set out ways in which the government can provide support to businesses by addressing regulatory barriers, agreeing trade deals and helping to establish institutions that encourage innovation and skills development.It will build on January's green paper which pledged to invest in science, research and innovation and upgrade infrastructure.The plan is aimed at boosting the post-Brexit UK economy.Mrs May told the conference in London that the government would avoid the "failed state interventionism of the 1970s".The prime minister also tried to reassure firms about the opportunities following the UK's exit from the EU, telling them the next decade would mark "a new chapter in the story of the British economy"."There are huge opportunities ahead," she said.And she also reiterated her support for a post-Brexit transitional period to prevent firms facing "a cliff-edge" scenario where the UK's EU exit leads to an abrupt change in rules."I have made clear that a strictly time-limited implementation period will be crucial to our future success," the prime minister said.Mrs May added that she wants to agree "the detailed arrangements for this period as early as possible".Image copyright Getty Images In his speech, Mr Corbyn said even though Brexit negotiations were underway "many of you feel no closer to having clarity about the direction of travel they desperately need".He added that "watching chaos and confusion grow at the heart of government and Brexit negotiations stuck in stalemate, many of you probably feel the situation is more uncertain and precarious than ever."We know as you do that firms are deciding now whether to continue to invest in the UK, and that guarantees in key areas are needed now to stop firms from cutting the UK out of their business models," he added.The Labour Party and business had "common ground on the need for transitional arrangements to be agreed immediately so that business know they won't face a cliff-edge Brexit when the two year negotiating period is up".They also had "common ground on the threat of 'no deal' which... is potentially a nightmare scenario", added Mr Corbyn."It is crucial that the final deal maintains the benefits of the common market and the customs union."

iPhone users fume over letter 'i' bug:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption The latest model of the iPhone was released this weekend Some iPhone users have been left frustrated after an update to the iOS operating system started inexplicably auto-correcting the letter "i" to a capital "a" and a question mark.The affected version of iOS, 11.1, is available on iPhones and iPads."I have a $1,150 [877] telephone that can't read the letter 'i'," wrote Mike Murphy, a technology reporter for news website Quartz, on Twitter.Apple has described a temporary fix for the problem on its website.The fix involves editing the keyboard settings in iOS so that the right character, either an upper or lower case "i", is used.Apple has said the issue will be fixed in a future software update.Not all iOS 11.1 users have been affected, though there are plenty of comments online from those who say they have experienced the problem.An online discussion forum on Apple's website includes comments from victims of the bug."This is super-annoying," wrote one.The BBC has contacted Apple for comment.
Perigord black truffle grown in Monmouthshire:::::Image copyright Getty Images An expensive truffle more commonly found in the Mediterranean has been grown in the UK for the first time.The Perigord black truffle, which can cost up to 1,700 per kilogram, was grown in Monmouthshire as part of a research project.A Mediterranean oak tree was treated to encourage truffle production and spores were inoculated in its root system.Researchers believe climate change enabled it to grow in Wales.Its natural habitat in the Mediterranean has been affected by drought and yields are falling while global demand for the product is rising.The truffle, which was harvested in March, has been preserved, but future produce will be distributed to restaurants.A study by truffle firm Mycorrhizal Systems (MSL), which ran the project, and Cambridge University has been published in the journal Climate Research and suggests that truffle cultivation may be possible in many parts of the UK.Dr Paul Thomas, from MSL and Stirling University, said: "This is one of the best flavoured truffle species in the world and the potential for industry is huge."We planted the trees just to monitor their survival, but we never thought this Mediterranean species could actually grow in the UK.It's an incredibly exciting development."
Have you got what it takes to be a secret shopper?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm transforming market research Meet 29-year-old Hakan Sevgin.He is helping to improve consumer products and shops around the world.A Turkish man who lives in Istanbul, Hakan doesn't work for any retail firm.Instead he is a stage lighting manager in a theatre.Yet he is continuing to help retail companies around the world improve the products they sell, and the shops in which we buy them.So what does Hakan do?In his spare time he is a secret shopper and product tester for a Turkish market research company called Twentify.Twentify has just 27 permanent employees, and has only been going for three years, but its global clients now include Coca-Cola, Danone, KFC, Philips, L'Oreal, Samsung, and Unilever.Image caption Hakan Sevgin earns money doing regular jobs via Twentify's Bounty app, such as photographing storefronts The firm is one of a new breed of market research companies that are transforming a global industry worth $44.3bn (33.4bn) in 2015.Instead of needing an army of employees to conduct interviews or tests, Twentify uses a crowdsourcing model to connect directly with tens of thousands of members of the public via its app, which is called Bounty.So anyone with a smartphone in the countries where Twentify operates can use the Bounty app to do some research for it, and get paid in return.For example, if a chocolate-maker in the US wants to make sure that its bars are being correctly positioned in the stores of a certain retailer, it can ask Twentify to get a mass of Bounty users to find out.Each would then be asked to go to a store, and surreptitiously take a photo, and the geo-locator function on their phone would confirm that they did indeed go to the right place.They simply upload the photo via the app, and get paid $15 for their troubles.Bounty users can be tasked with reviewing whether staff are sufficiently friendly and professional, for instance, or if the store is clean enough.Meanwhile, they can also get paid for testing products or carrying out surveys from their own home.A growing number of apps have very similar business models, such as Findyr, Eyes On, Gigwalk, and Field Agent.Image caption Twentify and its rivals are using apps to transform the market research industry Hakan started using Bounty in 2015, and says he has now made a total of $735.He admits to being very nervous the first time he was a secret shopper."My first attempt, I was excited and I was shy," he says."I was thinking it would seem like it would be difficult to do the task.In fact we are doing these things in our daily lives [testing products and stores].I realised that later on, which made it easier."Twentify is the brainchild of 27-year-old Turkish entrepreneur and the firm's chief executive, Ilker Inanc.Previously a software developer for an Instanbul marketing agency, he quit because he wanted to start his own company.The idea for Twentify was born when Ilker realised that carrying out market research via an app could get results more quickly and cheaply than carrying out more traditional surveys which need a team of staff going out with clipboards, or doing phone interviews.Image caption Ilker Inanc admits that running a business has its stressful moments To attract business customers from around the world the firm advertises on the internet, while most of the members of the public who use its Bounty app join after being told about it by friends.Twentify has now worked with more than 150 business clients in Canada, Turkey and the US.More than 330,000 people have downloaded its Bounty app to do market research in those three countries plus Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand, and Ukraine.The aim is to expand further internationally, but Ilker admits that it has not all been plain sailing since the firm was founded in 2014.A year and a half ago the company was not meeting the high growth targets he had set, so salaries and budgets had to be adjusted.Image caption People can earn money doing surveys for a number of firms via their mobile phones "I remember sitting in a meeting room in the office and going through all this stuff that I had to do, and suddenly I realised there were tears coming out of my eyes," he says."It was not because I was sad it was just the pressure, stress levels were high."The firm has also had to wrestle with the different banking systems across the world, to ensure that its users are promptly paid.This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Twentify has yet to make an annual profit as it instead invests to grow.This year it expects to see revenues reach $1.2m, with a loss of between 500,000-600,000.Backed by private investors, including Welsh-Canadian billionaire Terry Matthews, Twentify aims to increase its revenues to $10m by 2018.The company is also planning to relocate its headquarters to Toronto, Canada, but still maintain its existing office in Istanbul.Image copyright Chris McGrath Image caption Turkey does not have a large community of young start-up firms Ilker admits that being a young company in Turkey can be hard as the country doesn't have a large start-up community, so it can be difficult to gain investment, both in terms of finance and mentoring support.Can Selcuki, a board member of the Istanbul-based think tank Centre for Economic and Foreign Relations Research, agrees that this is an issue for Turkish start-ups.Image caption The global market research sector is huge If you have an investor you don't just need the money, you also need their business knowhow, their connections, their mentorship basically, and I think that is the biggest obstacle in Turkey that tech start-ups face."Ilker says that moving the head office to Canada is needed in order to expand worldwide.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twentify will soon be moving its main base to Toronto, but will keep its office in Turkey "Going global from North America is much easier for a tech start-up, you are closer to the capital, you are closer to big brands, big clients," he says."We have to make sure we are positioning ourselves not as a Turkish company, but as a global company."
Terror survivor's call for open speech on extremism:::::Image copyright One Young World Image caption Bjorn Ihler survived an attack and now wants to tackle extremist ideas Bjorn Ihler read Anders Breivik's book only a week after jumping into lake Tyrifjorden in Norway to escape the terrorist's bullets.Bjorn was one of the survivors on Utoya island where Breivik killed 77 people in July 2011.What Bjorn found in the far-right "manifesto" surprised him."His worldview was not purely driven by hatred," he says."It was much more about fear of what was happening to his society."This was a guy who grew up in the same city as me, we had similar backgrounds, we went to similar schools, but he saw the world in a completely different way."Since this experience, 26-year-old Bjorn devoted his life to trying to keep other young people from following a similar path to Breivik.Looking for extremists He has scoured the internet and seeks out extremists and former extremists to understand how they came to their views.He claims the unusual and unenviable record of meeting more reformed extremists than anyone else.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bjorn wanted to tackle the "mindset" of Anders Breivik And he is now one of the leaders in a project talking to students in UK schools about extremist ideas.Bjorn says that before Breivik appeared in court after the attack, people were describing him a "super-intellectual far-right monster".In an echo of Harry Potter's nemesis Lord Voldemort, some were calling Breivik "He Who Must Be Named".Image caption In 2012 Bjorn gave evidence of how he had escaped by jumping into the lake But when Bjorn saw Breivik in the dock, he realised he was no longer at risk from him."I decided that the problem to address right now is all the people who share his mindset," he says.Bjorn is part of an initiative called Extremely Together, a partnership involving the Kofi Annan Foundation, One Young World and the European Commission.Not shutting down debate Bjorn's main recommendation for schools is that they teach students that people are allowed to hold very different ideas and opinions."I would like to see a class teaching critical thinking or philosophy in every school," he says.Image caption Extremely Together visit schools with a message of open debate "Students need to learn to analyse the information they receive, and to understand that there are many ways to interpret information, rather than see the world as black and white."He is concerned that many education systems are "shutting down critical thinking and teaching propaganda".Bjorn says teachers should encourage students to share ideas in the classroom, however unpleasant some of the ideas might seem.He says the mentorship of his old philosophy teacher helped him get through a difficult year following the attack."I was all over the place, I couldn't make sense of anything, so I decided to call my old high school philosophy teacher," he says."He had taught me that people can see the world in different ways.If Breivik had had him as a teacher, I think things could have been very different."Against 'safe spaces' Bjorn says the trend towards safe spaces in educational institutions is "extremely destructive" because it means teachers are hesitant to allow discussion of sensitive subjects."I've probably met more former extremists than anyone else, and one thing they all shared was that no one outside of their group would listen to them," he says.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They never felt they were valued as human beings, they said no one would listen to their ideas."The only way to stop people from believing these ideas is to build a culture in the classroom where they can be discussed, analysed and criticised."Image copyright Reuters Image caption A memorial after Breivik's deadly attack on Utoya island He says this feeling of alienation is a "driving force" for why people turn violent."If they cannot promote their worldview through democratic means, they do it through violence."Countries around the world have been examining how to counter extremism in educational institutions.Bjorn warns that too much interference in schools could "backfire" - if students feel they are being unfairly targeted, they will feel targeted and be more prone to radicalisation.He argues that trying to ban access to extremist material online is "not a solution"."Educational institutions should be places where you are allowed to have weird ideas and discuss them without being reported to the police or have it show up on your record," he says."There is a difference between security and safety, and schools should not be places where ideas and opinions are policed."
How 'Asian Tiger cubs' are driving online shopping:::::Image copyright Post Office Bank of Singapore Image caption Children at Admiralty High School in Singapore show off their new payment wristbands Asia is driving the massive growth in online shopping, with youngsters in particular leading the charge.But why are they so keen and what are they spending their money on?In Admiralty Primary School, in Singapore's Woodlands neighbourhood, a group of students has just joined the e-commerce world."Now I don't need to think about losing my wallet," says Bosco Wong, a 10-year-old student, sporting a new wristband for making digital purchases while at school.The wearable band, called "Smart Buddy", is sponsored by the Post Office of Singapore Bank, and everyone at Admiralty has just received one.It is all part of Singapore's drive to go cashless, and the country's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung was at his school to launch them.Parents can track and manage their children's purchases online.Asia - its younger generations, in particular - has embraced online shopping and digital payments with remarkable enthusiasm.And given the UN's estimate that there are 720 million people aged 15-24 living there - dwarfing North America's 47 million and Europe's 82 million - it's no wonder Asia is driving the e-commerce explosion.China, which overtook the US in 2015 as the country with highest e-commerce spending, now accounts for 40% of the world's online commerce.Image copyright AFP Image caption Jack Ma founded Alibaba in 1999 Retail giant Alibaba, founded by billionaire Jack Ma, recently reported a 61% rise in quarterly revenues to 55.1bn yuan ($8.3bn; 6.4bn), thanks largely to the popularity of its online shopping platforms, Tmall and Taobao.Monthly active users of its Chinese retail marketplaces grew to 549 million in September, up 20 million from three months ago - that's an astonishing rate of growth.By 2020, 60% of all those aged 18-29 will live in Asia and will have a disposable income of $6tn (4.6tn), says consultancy firm Accenture - that's higher than any preceding generation.But why are Asia's youngsters so keen on buying online and what do they spend their money on?Well, this has clearly been a technology-driven phenomenon, with the smartphone as the key innovation changing consumer behaviour.About two-fifths of younger people in Asia have bought something online via their mobile, says Accenture."I do buy quite a lot of books online," says Theophi Kwek, 22, who recently finished university at Oxford and is now doing national service in Singapore's army.Books from overseas are cheaper than they are in Singapore, he says.He often uses UK sites and says shipping "usually takes a couple of weeks at most".Image copyright Theophi Kwek Image caption Singaporean Theophi Kwek likes buying books online from abroad But Yi Ying Ng, the 27-year-old founder of AllSome, a parcel tracking service, is part of a rising trend to connect other Asian markets to China's engine.The volume of packages from China to Malaysia has gone up from about one million a year in 2012, to about 73 million now, says Ms Ng.She takes goods from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, and delivers them to online buyers in Singapore and Malaysia, where she is originally from.She will be expanding next year to Indonesia, then Thailand, she says.When she started her company five years ago, posting a parcel from China cost $15-25 and took 30-50 days.She has found ways to lower this to $5, and shorten the delivery time to three days, she says.But her real innovation is helping small merchants to sell to friends and family through Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, she says."We're trying to help everyone become a merchant, a decentralised approach," she says.Image copyright Ng Yi Ying Image caption Yi Ying Ng wants to help everyone sell online Research from TMI Strategy suggests that worldwide, 62% of e-commerce users under 30 take their cues in purchases from influential users online, whether friends on social media or specialist bloggers.Ms Ng calls her approach "social commerce".Most of her merchants are between 24-28, she says, and most of their customers are in their early twenties.But while China increasingly sells online to the rest of Asia, younger people in its rising urban middle classes are buying goods and services online from further afield.Qiaoyun Zhang and Xiaochen Xu are parents in their thirties, and live in Beijing's prosperous business and embassy district, Chaoyang.Recently they started using a platform called VIPKid to buy live English lessons from teachers in North America, for their four-year-old daughter, Lu-Ke.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "My husband and I seldom use English in our daily life," says Ms Zhang, "and maybe our English is not that good.So we don't want to teach our children to speak English."The lessons last 25 minutes and their daughter takes four of them a week on an iPad."North American teachers, they are very patient compared with Chinese teachers," Ms Zhang says.Companies wanting to sell to these younger Asian audiences like Mrs Zhang should realise brand loyalty doesn't any more exist, says Michael Talbot, co-founder of 3radical, a brand engagement firm working in East Asia.His firm provided the technology behind Singapore's Smart Buddy."These young people, they're not disloyal, they're just using tools in a very competitive landscape.It's fundamentally different from having one high street with a Chinese, an Indian, and a couple of pubs," he says.Loyalty schemes accordingly tend not to work in China, Vietnam and Thailand, but games tied into a brand and incorporating an element of luck have cultural appeal there, says Mr Talbot.So how will the likes of 10-year-old Bosco Wong be shopping in future?Using his voice to authenticate a purchase perhaps?Tapping the side of his augmented reality glasses?Whatever the technological innovations, these Asian Tiger cubs are likely to be in the vanguard as e-commerce continues to sweep across the world.
The non-stop problem solver who loves to invent:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Uddhab Bharali epitomises India's "jugaad" spirit "I like to solve problems," says Uddhab Bharali."I like to make [people] a little more comfortable with themselves, or a little independent."This is what drives Uddhab Bharali to keep inventing.He started making things to sell more than 30 years ago in order to help pay off a large family debt.Today it is his life's passion.He has created more than 140 inventions, many of which are sold commercially with some winning international awards.He says his main motivation has always been to help people.Across India he is already well-known for his agricultural inventions but his new ideas are helping those with disabilities.He explains that because there is limited government support in India for people with physical disabilities it is up to people like him to come up with solutions.Image caption As well as complicated machines Uddhab invents simple small devices like this coconut cracker.Raj Rehman is 15-years-old and was born with congenital amputations and cerebral palsy.The simple device that Mr Bharali has made for him attaches to his forearm and is made from everyday items like Velcro fasteners and a spoon.It helps him to eat and to write.Mr Bharali has also adapted some footwear which means Raj is able to move around much more comfortably."I used to worry about myself before but now I feel stress free.I don't have to worry how I will cross the railway line to reach school as now I can walk without difficulty," he says."I am happy that I can take care of myself."Human ingenuity Initially, Mr Bharali recalls that people thought he was "worthless" and it took him 18 years to establish himself as "an innovator with class".Image caption Uddhab has become famous because of his inventions Most of his innovations are low cost and use locally available raw materials.This type of frugal innovation is known as "jugaad".It is a Hindi term which can also translate as "ingenious improvisation".Jaideep Prabhu is from Cambridge University's Judge Business School and has written a book about jugaad.He thinks it has a huge role to play in inspiring people to innovate: "This is mainly because it doesn't require much more than your innate human ingenuity."The whole approach is designed for you to find problems that surround you in your community - problems that affect you and people like you, and then to take resources that you have access to and solve those problems," he says.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.Mr Bharali makes an income from selling his inventions as well as designing technical solutions for businesses and government.But he is keen to help others make money and improve their own financial situation.He has set up a couple of centres to give people access to his machines.At one of these centres women from the local villages are able to come and use a rice-grinding machine that he has designed.The rice flour is then made into cakes and other edible items that can be sold.No shortcut According to the World Bank only 27% of women in India over the age of 15 are economically active."We have no facilities or employment to earn our livelihood in the villages," says Porbitta Dhutta, one of the women who comes to the centre."Here we can use innovations to change our lives to become self-sufficient and make respectable money for ourselves and our families."Men in rural areas have also benefitted from Mr Bharali's ingenuity.He has developed and sold over 200 cement-brick making machines.Each one requires five people to operate it and he estimates that over one thousand men are now employed because of it.Image caption Raj Rehman says he is happy that he can look after himself, thanks to Uddhab Bharali's inventions Although Mr Bharali says there is no shortcut to success, his hard work means his life is now comfortable and he is able to support 25 other families with the proceeds from his business.His engineering background has certainly helped Mr Bharali but he thinks that the fundamentals of innovation cannot be taught: "Any person with a restless mind, who is uncomfortable with things in the world, is an innovator."Innovation comes from inside you.No-one can make you an innovator, you have to feel it."Originally he would design his machines and then hope that they were commercially successful but such is his reputation now that people are commissioning him to make bespoke solutions and he has no intention of slowing down.For him the excitement of innovating continues: "I just enjoy the challenge.Always something fresh.And the joy of being the first person to do something new."Additional research and reporting by Priti Gupta.
How South Sudan refugees are boosting Ugandas economy:::::Image caption Penina used to have a salon in South Sudan Uganda is often called one of the best places in the world to be a refugee because of its welcoming policies.But how do you rebuild your life - and start making money - having left everything you knew and held dear?The BBC's John Murphy has been finding out."Starting any business is not easy because it's difficult to get money at the beginning," Penina tells me.Most entrepreneurs would tell you that.But imagine how much harder it is when you are living in a refugee settlement in northern Uganda, having escaped war."It's not easy for the refugees to even get money," she continues."You see, they sell their own things like beans, they pay you with [cooking] oil, because there's nothing, there's no money."Penina fled South Sudan with her four children.She didn't want to."I was not going to leave because I love my country, I love my home," she says."But the worst thing is when I saw a woman and a child being killed.How could I, as a woman, continue to stay in South Sudan when such things are happening, when women and children are being killed?"Her husband stayed behind.She says he refused to come and, for a short while, they communicated by phone.But his number no longer works and she doesn't know what has happened.'Use your brain' According to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, around 85% of the more than one million South Sudanese refugees now in Uganda are women and children.They do get some help from the UN, the international aid agencies and the Ugandan government.Image caption Penina says she finds it therapeutic to work in her salon They are given plots of land - wild bush land - which they have to clear and build shelters on and, when they can, grow vegetables in.They are also given plastic sheeting to construct their homes with, some cooking utensils and food rations.However, a lack of international help has meant that in the last year those monthly food hand-outs have been cut, and many refugees we met complained that the food does not actually last the month.That is where Penina has an advantage.She has a skill.She was a hairdresser back in Yei, in South Sudan, and she has brought that skill with her.She has also been a refugee in Uganda before, in the late 1990s, when there was fighting between north and south Sudan.It means she knows how things work in Uganda and she has a network of local friends.Uganda's refugee influx Uganda saw the largest number of refugees of any other country in 2016, UN figures show.The bulk of the new arrivals (489,000) came from South Sudan, with a smaller number (18,600) coming from Burundi More than a quarter of a million refugees are living in the Bidi Bidi camp alone More people arrived in Uganda in 2016 than crossed the Mediterranean into Europe 'Why I gave my land to a refugee' Is Uganda the best place to be a refugee?Uganda hosts 1m South Sudan refugees One in particular, who helped her set up her hair salon in Imvepi refugee settlement.The salon is, in fact, a shack made of wooden poles and UNHCR plastic sheeting.Hanging from the poles are pictures of hairstyles and an assortment of hair extensions.There is also a large poster of Jesus Christ.When I ask Penina where her energy comes from, she looks to the sky."That's God," she says.I point out that it is her too."Yes," she replies."But you have to use your brain.God has given me all this.I have to use my brain to do something, rather than stay idle."She says business is slow.Sometimes the only way for her to make money, so that she can buy the things she needs for her business, is to take those food rations the refugees give her in payment and to sell them, to get some cash."What can we do?It's the condition we are in."But her salon has proved therapeutic."It's good when you just chat together," she explains."You forget about the stresses and other things in South Sudan, the bad things people were doing."'Business is booming' Not far away, I come across a young man surrounded by piles of charcoal, which crunches underfoot.It is widely used by both refugees and Ugandans for cooking."Business is booming in the refugee camp," says Abdul Karim Ali, a lively 25-year-old Ugandan.He comes from the local town, Arua, which in the rainy season can be about an hour-and-a-half away, driving along muddy roads.He explains how the South Sudanese refugees "cure" the charcoal and he buys it from them, then transports it back to town to sell at a profit.Image caption "In business sometimes you win, sometimes you lose," says Abdul Karim Ali "Charcoal is very expensive in town.But, due to the conditions, they sell it cheaply," he says of the refugees."Some even sell their own stuff, the things given to them by the UN.We get a lot of profit from them."Yet that is a dangerous business, he tells me.The Ugandan government does not like people profiting from the goods handed out by the UN and the police could arrest you if they find you trading in refugee items."But we still buy," insists Mr Ali."In business sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."His positivity is infectious."Look around," he tells me."We are all mixed up in the market, South Sudanese and Ugandan, doing business so that we can survive better."It is true.Swathes of the north Ugandan countryside are being transformed.It is part of the reason why the Ugandan government has been so welcoming to the refugees.What was unproductive bush land in a poor region is being cleared, markets are sprouting up in the settlements and small businesses are growing roots.With little sign of peace returning to South Sudan anytime soon, the refugees have to make new lives for themselves.And some local Ugandans are benefiting too.
From berated blogger to beauty millionaire:::::Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Isabelle Lowengrip got into blogging in the late 2000s After finding fame with her lifestyle blog, Isabella Lowengrip went on to establish one of Sweden's best-known beauty companies.But it wasn't all plain sailing for the 27-year-old.When she started her blog at the age of 14, the mainstream media didn't take her seriously at all."Swedes, and particularly teenage girls, were very fast and early adopters," she says of the blogging boom that swept the country a decade ago."But I remember the Swedish media laughing at us and saying, 'look at those young women trying to do business with blogs'.We didn't give up though, and I'm very proud of it."Under the pen name Blondinbella, she quickly became one of the most-read bloggers in the Nordics, and today some 1.5 million people visit her site every week.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption The Lowengrip Care & Color range includes moisturisers, facial creams, mascara and shampoo Translated into English, German, and more recently French and Arabic, the blog focuses on fashion and beauty, Ms Lowengrip's business ventures, and her efforts to balance a busy career with bringing up two young children.It has also propelled her to becoming one of the Nordics' best known "social influencers", as well as being a launch-pad for a raft of successful spin-off businesses."I see myself more as an entrepreneur than a writer," she admits as we chat at her glitzy offices in Stockholm."I still think I write quite badly!"Ms Lowengrip first showed a flair for business as a teenager, when she secured numerous advertising and sponsorship deals for her blog.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip with her business partner Pingis Hadenius While some of her contemporaries partied away their earnings, the Swede chose to invest in new ventures.In 2012, she launched her own beauty brand, Lowengrip Care & Color (LCC), which was ranked as Sweden's fastest-growing beauty company last year.It markets itself as selling "gentle" products that offer fast results, including facial creams, mascara, shampoos and body lotions.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: LCC has expanded across the Nordics and into Switzerland and Estonia, and last year reported sales of 35m Swedish krona (3.3m)."Building a company is my passion," says Ms Lowengrip of her decision to try new business ventures beyond blogging."It's hard for me to just wear somebody else's make-up or clothes - I want to create everything."But LCC and the blog remain strongly intertwined.Both ventures share the same office space above the exclusive Stockholm mall Sturegallerian and together employ 40 employees in total.Image copyright Isabella Lowengrip Image caption A management meeting at Lowengrip's offices in Stockholm Ms Lowengrip's posts also frequently reference her work at LCC - from meetings with designers and toxicologists, to appearances at beauty fairs and major contract wins.She also often asks her readers' for their opinions on her products or projects.Ms Lowengrip's other business interests include a shoe brand, a clothing label, an investment company and personal finance workshops, and the whole group expects to report sales of 75m Swedish krona this year."When it turned out she had a talent for business, she was taken much more seriously," reflects Frasse Levinsson, a Stockholm-based media commentator and digital editor of popular culture magazine Nojesguiden."She knows which way the wind blows.For example, skincare has become a hot topic in the feminist movement in Sweden.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip at an LCC product launch "But it's almost like she predicted that because she released her own skincare products just beforehand."Ms Lowengrip puts her success down to a range of factors, from the sheer number of hours she's invested in educating herself on business matters, to collaborating with "smarter colleagues" in her ventures.However, she admits that the time and effort involved in building her career has put a strain on her personal life.She is also candid about projects that failed to blossom, including Egoboost, a traditional glossy magazine that never turned a profit, and Bellme, her first online store, which went bankrupt shortly after she sold the business."I learned so much during those years, so I am very grateful for all those mistakes.You have to just jump on the horse again and not be so afraid of what people are thinking."Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip sometimes models her own products The 27-year-old says she's accepted she's "not the best leader", arguing that she's better at coming up with ideas, and focusing on LCC's bigger vision "to become the next Estee Lauder".For this reason, her business partner, the economist and journalist Pingis Hadenius, has taken on chief executive duties at LCC.Ms Lowengrip's official title is creative director, but she also remains the brand's more public face.Dividing opinion Such a public persona continues to be a mixed blessing.Despite being an icon for hundreds of thousands of Swedish women who've grown up reading about her life, Ms Lowengrip, perhaps inevitably, divides opinion.She recently faced a backlash after divorcing from her husband and being vocal about subsequently buying in more home-help for cooking and cleaning - something of a taboo in Sweden's social democracy.But the mother-of-two says she refuses to be judged for her lifestyle."It's important for me to not have to choose between my business and my family life," she says."And if I'm a happier person by myself, then I am also a better mum, a better colleague and a better leader."
Could giving property rights to the world's poor unlock trillions?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What effect do property rights have on the economy?Some of the most important parts of our modern economy can't be seen - but they can be heard.That's what one Peruvian economist concluded while walking through the idyllic rice fields of Bali, Indonesia, in the 1990s.As he passed one farm, a dog would bark at his approach.Then, quite suddenly, the first animal would stop and a new guardian would begin to yap away.The boundary between farms was invisible to him - but the dogs knew exactly where it was.The economist, Hernando de Soto, returned to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, and met cabinet ministers to discuss setting up a formal register of property rights.They already knew everything they needed to know, he said, cheekily.They merely needed to ask the dogs of Bali who owned what.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Hernando de Soto is a big name in development economics.His energetic opposition to Peru's Maoist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, led to three assassination attempts.His big idea is to make sure that the legal system can see as much as the dogs of Bali.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hernando de Soto argues better property rights could make a big difference to the world's poor While the Indonesian government was trying to formalise property rights, others have tried to abolish them altogether.Daring plan In 1970s China, for example, where the Maoists weren't the rebels but the government, the very idea that anyone could own anything was seditious, bourgeois thinking.Farmers on collective farms were told by Communist Party officials that they didn't own a thing.Everything belonged to the collective.What about the teeth in my head, asked one farmer?As noted by NPR's Planet Money podcast, he was told that even his teeth were owned by the collective.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The land, its produce - and even the workers' teeth - belonged to the collective in 1970s China This approach worked terribly: if you don't own anything, why bother to look after it?Avoiding toothache is an incentive to brush your teeth.But collective ownership of land left farmers in desperate, gnawing poverty.So, in Xiaogang in 1978, a group of farmers secretly met and agreed a daring plan.Conspicuous success Instead of farming as a collective, they would informally divide up the land, and each keep whatever surplus they produced after meeting collective quotas.It was a treasonous agreement in Communist eyes: discovery risked execution.In fact, they were found out thanks to their conspicuous success: their farms produced more in one year than in the previous five years combined.But luck was on their side.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Deng Xiaoping, who became leader in 1978, laid the foundations for China's modern economy.China now had a new leader: Deng Xiaoping.And Deng let it be known that this was the sort of experiment that had his blessing.And 1978 was the beginning of China's breakneck transformation from utter poverty to, by some measures, the largest economy on the planet.Invisible web The experience in China shows that even informal property rights can be incredibly powerful.If you know your neighbours respect your boundaries, you can feel confident investing time in weeding your vegetable plot, or building a house.But in one critical way, it doesn't help me that my neighbours agree that I own my house.If I want a loan - to improve my house, or build a business - lenders need collateral.And land or buildings make particularly good collateral because they tend to increase in value, and it's hard to hide them from creditors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Banks will lend against property only if its ownership can be proven in law But the lender needs to be confident it could take the house away from me if I don't repay the loan.So, I need to prove that the house really is mine.That requires an invisible web of information that the legal system and the banking system can use.For Hernando de Soto, this invisible web is the difference between my house being an asset - something useful that I own - and being capital - an asset recognised by the financial system.'Dead capital' In poor countries, a lot of assets are informally held.Hernando de Soto calls them "dead capital", useless for securing a loan.His estimate was that at the start of the 21st Century there was almost $10tn (7.5tn) worth of dead capital across the developing world - more than $4,000 (3,200) for every person.Other researchers think that's an overestimate and the true figure is probably $3tn (2.2tn) or $4tn (2tn), but either way, it's a huge amount.More from Tim Harford: 'The devil's rope': How barbed wire changed America How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth Do passports restrict economic growth?The great intellectual property trade-off But how do assets become capital?How does the invisible web get woven?It needs a government.Enforcing property rights is one of the few things pretty much everyone on the political spectrum agrees a government should do, except perhaps the Maoists.It's not just an altruistic measure to make it easier to get a mortgage.When government knows who owns land, it can tax it.Napoleonic 'cadastres' Perhaps the first recognisably modern property registry was in Napoleonic France.Needing to fund his incessant wars, Napoleon decreed that all French properties would be carefully mapped, and their ownership registered.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Napoleon decreed that all properties in the territories he controlled would be mapped and registered Such a property map is called a "cadastre", and Napoleon proudly proclaimed that "a good cadastre of the parcels will be the complement of my civil code".After conquering Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, Napoleon introduced cadastral maps there, as well.Bold pioneers In the mid-1800s, the idea of the land registry spread quickly through the British Empire, too.The government drew up maps and allocated title deeds.Of course at that time, nobody with any power had much interest in the fact that indigenous people had their own claims on the land.The process doesn't have to be top-down.In the United States, there was a bottom-up approach.After decades of treating squatters as criminals, the state began to think of them as bold pioneers.Image copyright Chris Dorney / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption The 1862 Homestead Act set out the rules on who could own land in the US's western territories The US government tried to formalise informal property claims, using the Preemption Act of 1841 and the Homestead Act of 1862.Again, the rights of the native people who had been living there for thousands of years were not regarded as of much significance.It was hardly justice.But it was profitable.By turning a land-grab into a legally recognised property right, these land registries unlocked decades of investment and improvement.And some economists - most prominently Hernando de Soto himself - argue that a good way to create property registers for developing countries today is to use the same bottom-up process of recognising informal squatters' rights, coupled with modern databases.Do improved property registers really unlock what Hernando de Soto calls "dead capital"?Evidently, they can.In Ghana, for example, farmers with clearer property rights invested more in their land.Essential infrastructure But the answer, of course, is "it depends".It depends on whether there's a banking system capable of lending, and an economy worth borrowing money to invest in.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Philippines' labyrinthine property registration system involves 168 steps And it depends on how smoothly the property register works.Hernando de Soto found that in the Philippines, legally registering property took 168 procedures, 53 agencies and a waiting list of 13 to 25 years.Faced with such obstacles, even formally registered properties are likely to become informal again - the next time the property is traded, both the buyer and the seller may decide that formalising the deal is just too time consuming.But get it right, and the results can be impressive.The World Bank has found that after controlling for income and economic growth, the countries with simpler, quicker property registries also had less corruption, less grey-market activity, more credit and more private investment.Meanwhile, the property registry doesn't get much love: it's not a high-speed rail line or a gleaming new airport.It's an unfashionable, invisible piece of infrastructure.But without it, developed economies would go to the dogs.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Persuading would-be migrants to stay at home:::::Image caption Hassan Odjo says he is happy to be back in Senegal It is 10 o'clock at night, and outside the arrivals hall of Dakar's main airport, two Senegalese men are taking a moment to get used to their freedom.Hassan Odjo, 42 and Issa Ba, 23 have just stepped off a flight from Libya, where they had been trapped for months."I was praying every day to Allah to give me the chance to come home," says Hassan, a huge smile spread across his face."I saw people dying in front of my eyes.Every day I was praying to be back in my country.Today is the happiest day for me, it's like it's my birthday."Both Hassan and Issa have returned home under a voluntary repatriation programme run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).They had travelled through Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and ended up in Libya - where they became trapped, unable to go further.Dangerous route Hassan had attempted to cross the Mediterranean, but after his boat got into trouble he was picked up by local militia and held in detention.Image caption It can be hard for some to come back and say they failed to get to Europe, says Seydine Ken Hassan tells me of the suffering facing economic migrants in Libya, and describes being held in a room with 300 people, being given only bread twice a day, and bad water."When they catch you they lock you in prison, beat you or maltreat you, ask you to call your parents to send money."In Libya detaining migrants has become a business in itself, he says."They are selling black people like coffee, like a cup of coffee.Yes I'm telling you the truth!"Faced with this reality, it isn't surprising that more migrants are opting to return home.Returning home The International Organisation for Migration has access to the Libyan detention centres, and works with national consulates to offer people the choice to get out.So far this year, the IOM in Senegal alone has helped more than 2,000 people return home.Most of them have either been flown in from Libya, or bussed back from Niger.Others have been brought back from Morocco and Tunisia.Image caption Too many migrants don't realise the dangers they'll face, says the IOM's Senegal boss Jo-Lind Roberts Sene Sitting quietly next to Hassan is Issa Ba.He cuts a contrasting figure; he looks visibly shaken and for him the homecoming is bittersweet."I feel happy because I am going to see my parents again, but at the same time I'm very disappointed.It's a shame you know, it's a dishonour going back without getting to Europe."Listening to all this is Seydine Ken, the IOM case-worker who is at the airport to meet the two.He's used to seeing these kind of reactions from returnees.Seydine says: "The social pressure is really difficult because when they organise their trip, the family mobilises money, and sells their goods to pay for it."And it's very difficult for them to come back, and see what their family invested in the [failed] migration."Seydine is part of the government welcome party; and at the airport he provides pocket money and information to take care of immediate needs, and also questions the two about their migration experience.He's a regular at the airport and says he can be there twice a week to welcome returnees."They have not met their dream.They are very disappointed, physically they are very tired and psychologically they are very weak.These people need help - financial help, health and personal development."Returnees' role The IOM's chief of mission in Senegal is Jo-Lind Roberts Sene.Time and again she notices the serious lack of information about the realities of migrating."It's very frustrating when each time we have a charter flight, I get to the airport and have the same exchanges over and over again - they didn't have sufficient information, they knew the trip was dangerous but never knew to what extent."Image caption In rural Senegal, a lack of jobs is one reason many choose to try and reach Europe Jo-Lind says that around Dakar there is more awareness about the dangers, but that in the countryside and other areas - home to a lot of would-be migrants - there is not this awareness.Voluntary returnees like Hassan and Issa play a vital role in helping change people's views.One of the regions where young men are being re-absorbed is Tambacounda in eastern Senegal, close to the border with Mali.Being a poor, rural region, it is the lack of well-paying jobs for young people that encourages them to leave in the first place.So attempts are being made to reintegrate returned migrants into the community - giving them something to do and a way of earning a living.One project is a maize farm in the rural community of Jalakoto.It's run two European NGOs, Coopi and La Lumiere, along with the IOM, and helps around 100 young men in the surrounding villages.Image caption The maize farm is designed to help people earn a living - and for them to meet returning migrants For men like Mamadou Biagey, who came back from Libya three years ago, it's the only thing they have."Since I arrived I have lived in hardship because all the money I had I used to travel to Libya.For two years I stayed here without doing anything - it's only this year that I started doing something."The Jalakoto project is also designed to give young men thinking of leaving for Europe a reason to stay - not just by providing an income and a purpose, but also by encouraging them to rub shoulders with people who can talk of their experiences travelling to Europe."Sometimes in our debates there are young men who ask, 'what did you do and how did you do it to get to Libya?'," says Mamadou Biagey, "but I try to discourage from going."A quick show of hands among the 15 men working in one field reveals one man who says he initially intended to leave."In the beginning I only wanted to go and I saved enough money," he explains."Later on they brought us the project and explained what it was about and they convinced me.That's how I decided not to go."Competing narratives In Tambacounda and throughout Senegal there is a battle going on between two narratives of what migration to Europe actually entails.Image caption Warnings about the dangers of migrating are competing with individual success stories, says Issaga Cee Back in the town, Issaga Cee, a school principal for 13 years, explains how real-life accounts of the dangers of the journey compete for space with apparent success stories on social media."People communicate a lot through WhatsApp - its very easy to tell the story of someone who has succeeded," he explains."Most of those who return at least have an experience of all the difficulties in Libya, so they have become lecturers about that very difficult trip and its consequences."The IOM's Jo-Lind Roberts Sene says returning migrants have a crucial role to play: "If it's a message that comes from Europeans it won't go through."If it's someone who's tried it, and hasn't made it, and can really explain what it was they experienced along the way, then it will take time - but they really are the ones that can put the message across."A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
Spreading the word: How to promote your online business:::::Image copyright Gemma Day Image caption Nosh Detox founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb used bloggers to help promote her brand Online businesses now have a wealth of digital tools and techniques at their disposal to help them get noticed in the global marketplace.Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of juice and health food delivery service, Nosh Detox, was using social media to promote her business long before it became fashionable to do so.Ten years ago, in fact.On a tight budget and needing to convince a sceptical public, she tapped in to the power and reach of bloggers to promote her diet and wellbeing products."Juice fasts didn't really exist in the UK at the time," recalls the former corporate lawyer and single mum of three."In fact some people actually thought a detox could kill you.""We couldn't afford PR [public relations] agencies or expensive advertising campaigns, so we'd talk to pretty much anyone with an online presence and persuade them to take photos, film us on YouTube and write about us," she says.The bloggers would include a link to her website on their pages - occasionally in return for some Nosh Detox freebies Ms Sidhu-Robb admits.This helped push the business to the top of organic - not paid-for - search rankings.A 2m turnover and Hollywood A-list clientele followed, along with significant followings in Russia and Australia.It shows how, on social media, a little can go a very long way when it comes brand promotion.Image copyright EyeFitU Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus is a big believer in finding the right social media "influencer" for your brand Now social media marketing is a business in its own right.Convenient and low cost, with a potentially vast audience reach, the platforms have overtaken all other media for small businesses, says research firm BIA Kelsey.Former investment banker Isabelle Ohnemus has extensively used "influencers" to promote her Zurich-based fashion company EyeFitU, which is an online platform aimed at remedying some of the sizing inconsistencies across fashion brands.Usually young, fashion-conscious females with a prominent online presence act as "brand ambassadors" for EyeFitU, promoting the company to their followers on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.Big brands will sometimes pay in excess of $30,000 (23,000) to such influencers for a single post, but smaller companies with more modest budgets can still get in on the action."There is a trend for going with smaller-scale bloggers rather than those with million-plus followers," says Ms Ohnemus,."Having those kinds of numbers doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of conversions."In other words, it's the quality of the following not the size that matters.People who trust an influencer's opinion are more likely to buy the brand's goods, she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reality TV star Marnie Simpson fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority Of course, there are rules governing this sort of social media influencer marketing, so you have to be careful.Geordie Shore TV star Marnie Simpson recently got into trouble for uploading images of products from two firms she had business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts A spokeswoman for the UK's Advertising Standards Authority tells the BBC: "Our current codes state that if an advertiser gives payment to a social media influencer - this can be in the form of a monetary payment or a freebie - and there is control over the contents of the ad, the social media post would be considered an ad; thus the influencer must clearly indicate somewhere on the post that this is an advertisement."Know your customer One of the main advantages of an online business compared to a traditional bricks-and-mortar shop is the amount of data you can gather about your customers.You can find out which search words people use to find your business, for example, which images they respond to the most, and which website content they share on other platforms.This all helps to refine and target your marketing efforts.Free monitoring tools, like BuzzSumo and Metrixapp, not to mention Google Analytics, are all powerful helpers for the small business.Image copyright Gourmet Meat Club Image caption Gourmet Meat Club found that images of cooked food were more popular than raw ingredients Vikas Shah, visiting professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says: "You can easily start by using many free SEO [search engine optimisation] tools on platforms like Google and Twitter, and because this activity is very much results driven, you will see a fairly robust relationship between spend and return on investment."Gourmet Meat Club, an online provider of free range British meat, is one of the 54% of websites globally using Google Analytics to delve into customer quirks.Recent insights reveal that Android mobile users visit more web pages than those on an Apple phone, and images of cooked food generate more views in a digital ad campaign than images of raw ingredients.Furthermore, the technology tracks the most popular food searches online, giving Gourmet Meat Club the opportunity to create content based on the very latest trends.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "It's crucial to act fast," says Stuart Cordingley, the firm's managing director, "jumping onto popular searches as soon as they emerge to get ahead of the competition and be present where the public is discussing its new favourite food topics."This is the best way for the brand to get "ample exposure", he says.Data is now "central to the marketing mix".This up-to-the-minute content is sent to journalists and shared on the firm's own Facebook and Twitter pages.Social media marketing expert Andy Barr says it is an example of how online businesses are increasingly morphing into social media communities, creating content that positions them as authorities on particular topics.But he also advises supplementing this approach with social media advertising."As a general rule of thumb, it's worth spending between 7-12% of your total monthly revenue or income on social media promotion for the best results," he says.
Ever fancied joining a private members' club?:::::Image copyright Paul Winch-Furness Image caption The Hospital Club is one of a new breed of trendy private members' clubs A new breed of fashionable private members clubs are growing in popularity around the world, promising to be more inclusive and diverse than their stuffy older counterparts.Yet while the newer venues certainly have a far more youthful membership, and you certainly don't need to have gone to a posh school or university, they still have high joining fees and strict vetting processes.So how less elitist are they?And what are the benefits of getting your name on the list?"I like how organically relationships happen at Soho House," says tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre."You can't wear business suits, you can't hand out business cards, and you can't take phone calls."The 26-year-old joined Soho Beach House in Miami two years ago, after visiting with friends who were members."It's a laidback place to network but it's also given me the opportunity to try things I typically wouldn't do by myself, like wine tastings or a jam-making class.Image copyright Dave Burk Image caption Soho House New York has a rooftop pool "And sometimes I'll go to the sunset DJ parties by the pool, which are loud and pretty crazy."Welcome to the new breed of private members' club, which claim to be less restrictive and more diverse than the stuffy gentlemen's clubs of the past.These modern venues - with their co-working spaces, screening rooms and rooftop pools - are fast becoming the places where many of today's young creative class choose to work and play.Membership isn't cheap though, with some charging more than $2,000 (1,500) per annum, along with joining fees of $300.Image copyright Tyler McIntyre Image caption Tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre joined Soho House Miami two years ago "In the past, members' clubs were seen as being elitist and populated by people who went to the same public schools and universities," says Richard Cope, a senior trends consultant at Mintel."But these places are more for entrepreneurs and self-made people.The only thing you have to be able to do is pay the fee, and it can be fairly expensive."While trendy members' clubs have been around for years, they became much more common after the launch of Soho House in London in 1995.The trend has also gained a foothold in the US and other countries."We've see a huge jump in the number of the new types of club coming online, as compared to the traditional model," says Zack Bates of Private Club Marketing, a firm that promotes members' clubs.Image copyright Soho House Image caption Soho House Barcelona looks to attract creative entrepreneurs "In Los Angeles, you can't get into Soho House.So others are being built, the Hospital Club, Griffin House and Norwood, to keep up with the appetite for these spaces."Soho House itself now boasts 18 venues around the world, including in New York, Istanbul, Berlin, and soon Mumbai.Group revenue rose 3% in 2016 to 293.4m, while global membership jumped from 56,000 to 70,000.However, you have to do more than just fill out an application to join its venues.Membership costs between 400 to 1,580 per annum, depending on the club, although there are discounts for under-27s.Image copyright Soho House Barcelona Image caption The gym at Soho House Barcelona More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Image copyright The Hospital Club Image caption The Hospital Club has a TV and music studio on site And there's a tough background check to ensure potential members are part of the creative class - Soho House frowns on those who work in financial services, for instance.Once accepted, members enjoy a host of perks.Soho House Barcelona, for example, one of the chain's newest venues, boasts a retro-themed gym, pool and free classes like yoga.Members pay full price for food and drink but get discounts on the club's hotel rooms.Mr Cope says: "These clubs offer people a discreet place to network and wind down, typically in cities where personal space is at a premium."However, they are also about "showing off to a degree"."In an age of social media, people like to let others know where they hang out or which restaurants they eat at.So there's an element of satisfying those peacock tendencies."Image copyright Richard Booth Image caption The Hospital Club says it provides its members with networking opportunities The newer clubs do serve more practical functions, though, such as offering young entrepreneurs a place to work.Take London's Hospital Club, based in Covent Garden, which offers its own meeting and conference rooms, and even an in-house TV and music recording studio.Standard membership costs 865 plus a 250 joining fee.While some might find such fees high, it's still cheaper than forking out for your own office space, says Mr Bates."It suits today's digital nomads, who work remotely via their laptops.Paying for an office can be prohibitively expensive, especially in a major city."Members' clubs also offer vital networking opportunities that help further your career, says Zikki Munyao, 40.The remote IT worker joined Common House, a private member's club in Charlottesville, USA, largely for this purpose.Image copyright Andrea Hubbell Photography Image caption The co-working space at Common House "There are areas to socialise and meeting spaces where I can have privacy," he says of the club, where membership costs $150 (113) a month, plus a $600 joining fee."I even met my estate agent over a game of pool."The new breed of members' clubs does face challenges, though.Some warn that as clubs proliferate, their exclusivity is becoming diluted, and they struggle to attract the celebrities that once lent them cachet.The social commentator Peter York tells the BBC: "Traditionally private members' clubs have played on their exclusivity and being able to attract the 'magic people'."But as more and more of them pop up, you get blase.The magical people also can't be corralled in one place anymore."He adds that as clubs like Soho House keep on expanding, they seem to be "more about business", which further dilutes their brand."The danger is that a new challenger, which looks younger and groovier, arrives and steals your limelight."But Mr Cope believes the market for these new clubs is going to expand."Having somewhere where you can unwind and host friends in the centre of cities is useful.So there are a lot of practicalities around this."It is also about expressing your individuality, so I think the emotional need for this is only going to grow."
The new port trying to fulfil our shopping obsession:::::Image copyright DP World Image caption DP World London Gateway opened in November 2013 Just five years ago, DP World London Gateway was still being dredged from the Thames.Now the UK's newest port is trying to lure the world's biggest ships to its quayside to get us our shopping quicker.You browse online, click on something you fancy, and lo and behold often as little as 24 hours later it's on your front door step.This seemingly magical process - a relatively recent phenomenon - is being made possible by one of the oldest industries on the planet - shipping.Most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how what we buy gets to us.Yet most of the clothes you wear, much of the food you eat, the TV you watch, your phone and even the materials for the house you live in will have come to you via a ship."You can put anything in a box more or less," quips James Leeson, head of port commercial, at DP World London Gateway.The boxes here mostly contain frozen foods such as chicken and beef, and fruit such as bananas.Occasionally they may contain the lifelong belongings of a family moving overseas, expensive cars, or even, as was the case recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson's yacht.The port officially opened for business just four years ago.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Most of what we buy arrives by ship The windswept, vast space has literally redrawn the Essex landscape.Situated 20 miles down the River Thames from London, in Thurrock, Essex, the port sits on a bed of sand and silt dredged from the Thames on the site of a former oil refinery.The 1.5bn construction saw a staggering 350,000 animals moved off site into new habitats.At one stage DP World's office building on the site homed tanks of great crested newts before they were moved into newly created ponds.It was planned long before the financial crisis when the world economy was booming and ports were struggling to handle the sheer volumes of goods coming in.The two busiest container ports in the south east are Hutchison Whampoa's Felixstowe, in Suffolk, and DP World's other port in Southampton.And so far the number of containers London Gateway has handled in its short existence has been dwarfed by its rivals.Last year, Felixstowe handled almost six times as many containers as London Gateway.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of the port's processes are automated Mr Leeson is undeterred - saying the company is in it for the long term."It takes a bit of time to get moving.Shipping volumes are up and we've got big names signing up to leases in logistics park," he says.The port's deep channels means it can handle the latest biggest ships, the so called Neo-Panamaxes.These giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, are increasingly the way goods are shipped.Its other big advantage is that most of the port's operations are automated.In a space which is twice the size of the City of London just 500 people are employed.'Frictionless trade' This means faster "frictionless trade", says Mr Leeson.It is this that London Gateway believes will help it to gain more customers.Incoming trucks have to pre-register and are scanned on arrival, before being sent to a specific bay where an automated crane removes or adds their container, meaning they can be in and out in half an hour.The containers themselves are organised by huge cranes which stalk the landscape like Star Wars At-Ats.Like an oversized game of Jenga, where each container goes is carefully organised to make sure that the boxes which need to unloaded or loaded first are near the top.A sophisticated computer system continually tracks where the containers are in the port.Mr Leeson says this is crucial."It used to be that your box would arrive at port and you'd have no clue what happened.Now you can track it through port and see when it's ready for collection.Consumers are more and more demanding and we had to respond to that," he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Containers are continually tracked But it is the scale of its logistics park which DP World is betting on to be London Gateway's biggest lure.Currently most of the goods imported into the UK are taken by road, and some by rail, to big distribution centres in the Midlands, the traditional logistics hub for the country.This means shipped goods are often driven from the south, up north to be packaged or priced, and then driven back to the south where the majority of items are bought and sold.DP World believes the space it is offering will enable firms to process goods immediately after arrival, speeding up their deliveries to shops and to consumers increasingly used to Amazon Prime's 24-hour delivery promise.Environmentally it will cut carbon emissions, but crucially DP World also expects it to cut costs.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Consumers increasingly expect goods to arrive within 24 hours So far, parcel giant UPS and discount supermarket Lidl have taken space, with Dixons Carphone also reported to soon be opening up a warehouse.And fruit importer SH Pratt Group is getting ready to build a giant refrigerated facility for its new venture Halo, which will package chilled and frozen goods.Currently, the space is a muddy patch of wasteland, but Halo's managing director Gavin Knight says it will be up and running by next summer.He says the decision to choose London Gateway was "quite simple"."As soon as you put a container on wheels it adds cost.[This way] we're saving time, food miles and money," he says.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But Neil Davidson, shipping consultancy Drewry's senior analyst for ports and terminals, says firms will have to weigh up the advantages against the potentially higher cost of renting space and hiring staff in the south east.With the shipping market growing "steadily but not hugely", the only way for London Gateway to succeed will be to steal market share from its local rivals, Mr Davidson says.It's something that London Gateway has already started to do, albeit on a small scale.But Mr Leeson is confident its growth will continue, "We built London Gateway as a future proof model for future trade," he says.And its other big advantage as Brexit looms is that 99% of its trade comes from outside the EU."We are confident that whatever happens we will see an upturn in trade," he says.
Play it again: The firm saving vinyl:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How a small company in the Czech Republic became the world's largest maker of vinyl records Whether gathering dust in your loft or currently spinning on your turntable, it's a fair bet that at least some of your vinyl records came from a small factory in the Czech Republic.The facility in question is the headquarters of GZ Media, based in the small town of Lodenice, 25km (16 miles) west of the Czech capital, Prague.GZ is today the world's largest producer of vinyl records, of which it expects to press 30 million this year, for everyone from the Rolling Stones and U2, to Lady Gaga and Madonna.The success of the company is a far cry from the early 1990s, when vinyl records appeared to be on the way out, with music fans having switched en masse to compact discs.Back in the early 1970s more than three-quarters of album sales were on vinyl, but by the 1990s that had plunged to just 1.5%.Image caption Producing vinyl records is a multi-step process "In 1993 our output was at its lowest, vinyl was almost dead," says GZ's chief executive Michal Sterba."If we'd have stayed as a vinyl-only producer in the 90s, GZ would be no more."The operation had only become a private company two years earlier after the fall of communism.Prior to that it had been a state-run enterprise called Gramofonove Zavody (Gramophone Record Factory) which had started in 1951, and had pressed records for the world's largest music companies.With demand for vinyl having dwindled, GZ realised that it had to diversify to survive, so it branched out into printing and making packaging for consumer goods.Image caption Michal Sterba is now expanding GZ, with new sister factories in the US and Canada Crucially though, it kept pressing vinyl to satisfy what little demand there was.At the lowest point in 1993 it made just 350,000 discs."We wanted to be the last company standing in the field of vinyl record production," says Mr Sterba.So when the resurgence of vinyl began around 2010, GZ was in a position to take advantage of it.Unlike most rivals, GZ still had the vinyl-making equipment and the expertise.Its successful diversification also gave it the cash to invest.Image caption The company has also seen a rising demand for picture discs Mr Sterba says: "Our competitors could buy machinery and materials, but the know-how is very hard to acquire."The firm's printing and packing capabilities give it another advantage over its rivals, he adds: "As well as producing the actual vinyl discs, GZ also makes the packaging, prints the artwork and any extras such as posters or booklet."One particularly tough job, he recalls, was producing a real metal zip on the cover of the reissued Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album.How vinyl records are made The original music, on tape or a digital file, is transferred to a diamond-tipped cutter This cuts a groove of the music into a steel disc coated in a layer of copper just 100 microns thick This master disc is then placed into a solution of nickel salt though which an electric current flows.This forms a layer of nickel on top of the copper The nickel layer is then peeled off, and has ridges that are a mirror image of the grooves on the master disk.This nickel plate forms the "stamper" that will imprint the vinyl Next the vinyl compound (a type of plastic) is heated to 160C, and the stamper is pressed into it with the weight of more than 100 tonnes, to produce one side of a vinyl record To keep up with demand, GZ Media's Czech factory now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and employs 1,600 permanent workers.It's a fast-paced operation at every stage of the production process; from the initial stamping to the high-speed ballet of forklifts loading trucks for delivery.The company has invested $20m in equipment, building 12 new presses, but the old still runs alongside the new.Image caption GZ's Czech factory has a permanent workforce of 1,600 plus 400 seasonal workers Bright white, computer-controlled stations sit next to their huge, pale-green iron counterparts, still dripping oil into trays and buckets.GZ's revenues this year are expected to total $110m (83m), and are growing by 9-10% per year.Meanwhile, its vinyl output has tripled since 2010.For the industry as a whole, global sales of vinyl records are expected to reach $1bn in value this year.This may be just 6% of total music industry revenues but vinyl sales are now at a 25-year high.With most of its customers in North America, GZ recently bought a vinyl plant in Memphis, Tennessee, to supplement its Czech production.It has also opened a production facility in Ontario, Canada.Image caption Staff at the factory listen to the records to test them GZ still makes albums for small indie bands - the punk and metal bands that kept the company going in the 1990s, but now it also works with massive global stars."We'll still press 100 records for a small metal band," says Mr Sterba, "but we're also pressing 100,000 for U2.""As for the future," he says, "we're concentrating on making a success of our plants in North America.But in the longer term, we think manufacturing in Asia and preferably Japan [as well], is the right thing to do."This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Yet, while vinyl sales are growing, some who buy the records don't actually play them.Last year a BBC/ICM poll found 48% of those questioned said they'd never played the vinyl they'd bought and 7% said they didn't even own a turntable.These fans buy a vinyl album for the "feel" of owning a physical object and for the artwork that often comes with it - but they never actually play it.Image caption Staff at GZ had to add a real metal zip to the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers While vinyl sales are growing, they remain tiny compared with their 1980s heyday, says Paul Lee, a music industry expert at accountancy group Deloitte."Vinyl's first and biggest peak was back in the 80s when a billion records, just albums were sold per year.This year we're expecting about 40 million, so it's about one 25th... so it is nothing like that we had back in the 80s."Image caption The company can make vinyl records in any colour Mr Lee adds: "The reality is vinyl is a lovely product, it's also very difficult to consume compared to just tapping in the name of a song on a smart phone... so we would expect the market to be approaching a peak."Yet with music giant Sony announcing earlier this year that it was to re-open its vinyl manufacturing plant in Japan for the first time since 1989, it doesn't look like the vinyl revival is coming to an end any time soon.
The problem facing Trump's China probe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trade tensions will be top of mind during US President Donald Trump's visit to China When US President Donald Trump visits China, one subject high on the agenda will be the sweeping trade investigation of Chinese policies that he ordered in August.The White House said it would probe practices that encourage the theft of intellectual property from US businesses - a long-simmering source of tension in the US, Europe and elsewhere.The Chinese government has said the inquiry was a "serious concern" and has warned that it will not sit back if the US takes actions it deems unfair.But one of the biggest challenges for Mr Trump's investigation comes from his own country.Since the White House started its inquiry, a slew of US business groups have submitted formal comments describing their concerns.But just six companies have proved willing to come forward with complaints, according to the public record of comments.Many of them are smaller businesses describing already known incidents.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US could risk a trade war with one of its biggest trade partners Analysts say companies are hesitant to put at risk their access to one of the world's biggest markets by speaking out.But the decision to stay quiet has consequences: it is likely to limit the administration's ability to build a strong case against China.It may hurt the ability to identify effective remedies, while also making unilateral action more appealing to the White House."It's going to be a huge problem that companies are unwilling to provide specifics because it's going to be very difficult for the United States government to take effective action," says Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.Intellectual property The White House's focus on intellectual property theft in China follows years of concerns in the US, Europe and elsewhere over counterfeit goods, piracy, hacking, patent violations and other forms of theft.The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that the annual cost to the US economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225bn and $600bn.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption General Motors, which has opened factories in China, is among those working with local partners In recent years, the US says the Chinese government has encouraged some of those practices as part of its economic and national security strategies.Those involve state-backed enterprises and are focused on boosting certain industries such as aerospace, robotics and biotech.The US inquiry asked for information about topics including policies that pressure companies to share information with local business partners; opaque approval processes; and possible cyber espionage backed by the government.But previous US efforts to tackle the issue have been hindered by the hesitance of major companies to speak out, says Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs."This has been the problem," says Mr Levy, who served as a trade economist under former President George W Bush."If you want to say China has these violations and we are acting in response to that... you need to have that fairly well documented.And to do that you need to have the co-operation of the companies involved."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beijing has promoted renewable energy and US firms in the industry have been among the few to speak out Edwin Rogers is co-founder of Bonumose Biochem, a small Virginia-based start-up that was one of the six companies that shared its complaints.In his case, he says scientists in China filed a copycat patent for a process of making a healthy rare sugar - technology that he believes his company had purchased rights to after acquiring a firm last year.The scientists worked in the US for that firm, he says.They are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-backed entity, and have political connections.He says he felt a "duty" to come forward and hopes his story will help the White House craft a response.China's response The office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the inquiry, did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation.China maintains it has responded to concerns, pointing to laws that forbid intellectual property theft, success by western companies in Chinese courts, and its own efforts to address cyber crime.In September, after the Trump administration launched its investigation, it announced a four-month crackdown focused on intellectual property and foreign investors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China says it has made strides to prevent intellectual property theft In comments submitted to US investigators, Chinese organisations told the US that decisions to establish joint ventures and share technology are voluntary agreements between private companies.They cast government initiatives, such as Made in China 2025, as "promotional" - not mandatory - programmes.Some US businesses also defend China's approach.William Mansfield is the intellectual property director at Abro Industries, a 25-person company based in Indiana that makes products such as glue and tape for sale overseas.He says he has spent years fighting against counterfeiters in China - and has figured out successful ways of using China's system, like asking for help from local authorities instead of immediately pursuing a lawsuit.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has reportedly told advisors he wants "tariffs" He says US companies often don't understand how China works and unfairly blame problems on the government."I've just never seen anything that would lead me to believe it's anything other than individual counterfeiters acting to maximise their profit and not really caring about the rules," he says.What next?Many US analysts expect the White House to find fault with Beijing; pointing to the growing corporate involvement of the Communist Party and rules that require foreign companies in some sectors to use local partners.But it is unclear what the White House might do after that.The US could work with the Chinese government, collaborate with other countries to craft a response, bring a complaint in an international forum such as the World Trade Organisation, or take unilateral action.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has long had concerns over Chinese intellectual property theft and hacking That risks triggering a trade war but President Trump - who has repeatedly attacked China while dismissing international pacts - may be more open to that approach, Mr Levy says.The White House China's strategy remains unclear as different advisors appear to promote clashing approaches, he adds.Investigation of Chinese steel companies, for example, has not led to action.The White House also wants Chinese cooperation as it responds to missile tests from North Korea."It's hard to puzzle out what they're doing," Mr Levy says.Business concerns US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he expects addressing the issue to take time.But he says the US is looking for immediate deals, like ones struck between Boeing and Saudi Arabia, as a sign of good faith.Many businesses remain worried the White House could damage the US relationship with China to satisfy isolationists among President Trump's supporters.Erin Ennis, of the US China Business Council, says about 20% of its members have faced pressure in China to transfer key technology in recent years, but adds that they also report that the environment in China is improving.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a US Boeing plant in 2015.Aerospace is one of the industries the Chinese government has promoted She urges the administration to focus on specific changes in China, rather than simply imposing penalties, such as sanctions.For example, China could stop making a distinction between foreign and domestic companies, she says.Even without testimony from major companies, associations like hers have provided enough suggestions for the White House to work with the Chinese government, says Ms Ennis.But Prof Branstetter says the US will need to take stronger, more targeted action if it expects intellectual property thefts to stop.He says it doesn't have the information to do so now and he has doubts about this administration's abilities to craft an adroit response."It's easy to see this going badly," he says.
What happens to Mexicans returned from US?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were protests over the threats to deport undocumented young migrants from the US Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans are deported to their home country each year from the United States.The Trump administration's pressure on undocumented young migrants - the so-called "Dreamers" - could mean many more coming home.But what are so many returning people going to do?Starting a new life in Mexico has been harder than expected for Reyna del Rio, a 29 year old who spent most of her childhood in South Carolina before returning to Mexico.Like many returning bilingual Mexicans, she was able to get a job at a call centre.Tough returning But the long hours and angry customers started to take a toll on her.A new initiative by Mexico's public education ministry, known by the Spanish acronym SEP, could be her ticket to a stable career."If you work at a call centre you do things repeatedly.I don't see it as enjoying my job," said Ms del Rio.Image caption Reyna del Rio has returned to find work in Mexico, having left for the US as a young child "I would like to teach and learn new skills.I would like to pass on what I've learned because I think it will fulfil me more than just doing customer service."She is part of a group of young deportees and voluntary returnees who are in the process of applying for English teaching positions through SEP.It's a project trying to make the most of their English language skills.For more than 600 new teaching jobs, the education ministry adapted the application process to encourage repatriated Mexicans.There were changes to make the positions more accessible to returnees, who often face bureaucratic roadblocks related to their time outside of Mexico.The goal is twofold.It aims to provide employment for young deportees and help Mexico reach its goal of being bilingual - in Spanish and English - in 20 years."We made that clause flexible particularly for repatriated Mexicans, because the idea is that no one who might have the possibility of being an English teacher should be left without the chance of doing so," said Mario Chavez Campos, director of the general directorate of higher education for professionals in education, an office within SEP. 'Dreamers' sent back As well as those deported, there are others returning by their own choice, although often forced by the lack of higher education and job opportunities.This was the case for Ms del Rio, who left South Carolina at the age of 18, hoping to access better educational opportunities in Mexico, when she couldn't get financial aid as an undocumented student in the US.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prototypes for the proposed border wall between the US and Mexico When she arrived in 2009, she barely remembered the country she left when she was five years old.But she persevered."We have the culture of never giving up," Reyna said of her fellow "Dreamers"."We have always had to fight for many things."These undocumented young people, who might have come to the US as children, are feeling vulnerable.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Looking through from Mexico into New Mexico in the US President Donald Trump decided in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, known as DACA.This allowed young undocumented immigrants to work legally in the US and be temporarily shielded from deportation.About 800,000 youths received protected status under DACA, and more than 600,000 were from Mexico.Many could soon face deportation as their DACA permits expire in the upcoming months.Retraining as teachers Mexico has pledged to support returning deportees, with initiatives to help them access employment, health and education.But many of these still remain promises.So far 80% of the returned deportees trying to get a job as an English teacher through SEP have had difficulty meeting requirements, primarily for reasons related to their time spent outside of Mexico, according to Israel Concha, founder of the New Comienzos group which support people returning to Mexico.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They have to understand it's an emergency," said Mr Concha, a deportee himself."Tomorrow if thousands of people get deported because there is no immigration reform or there is nothing for DACA, we need to be ready and the federal government is not ready."To be eligible for teaching, all candidates must have their US schooling recognised in Mexico, pass a test in Spanish grammar and Mexican history, and earn a college degree.The scheme intends to break down the barriers returnees face in completing these steps, but there are still discussions about how to achieve this.Mexican dream Not all bilingual deportees have the training required to become a teacher, so the SEP is brainstorming other ways to incorporate Dreamers into English language lessons at public schools, such as through conversation clubs or as teacher's assistants."This call for English teachers is just the first step," said Mr Chavez Campos of the public education ministry."From there, we have a list of the dreamers and deportees who are interested in participating in the national English strategy."Image copyright Reuters Image caption What opportunities are there for those returning to Mexico?He says this is Mexico's "rapid response to the migration policies of the US".Working as an English teacher would mean a new start for many of Mexico's deportees.If selected to be an English teacher for SEP, Ms del Rio would receive much more than the minimum wage with a starting salary of about $1,100 (830) per month, plus benefits and holidays.Unlike working in a call centre, an English teaching position would provide a long-term career."We need more opportunities where we can have a job where we can retire," said Mr Concha."That's what we are looking for: the actual American dream in Mexico.""The Mexican government wants to make Mexico bilingual in 20 years," said Mr Concha."What better place to start than the dreamers that are coming back?"
What will Brexit mean for our bacon?:::::The United Kingdom imports the majority of the pork products we consume, from loins to bacon.With 17 months to go until we are due to leave the European Union, how will Brexit affect our pork?Denmark is the main supplier of the UK's imported pork.There are thousands of pig farms across the country and pork is the Danes' third most valuable export.And it is Jutland which is the heart of Danish pig country.At one farm, Baldershave, 35,000 pigs are born every year.Soren Sondergaard's farm has been in his family for five generations and the UK is one of their biggest markets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Denmark is the largest overseas supplier of pork products to the UK "We follow it a lot, and we keep an eye on what is happening in the UK at the moment," says Mr Sondergaard."We hope of course we can continue to do trading together, but we have 130 markets all over the world which we will be looking to instead if it will be a hard Brexit."The Danish port trade with the UK started 150 years ago, and now about 25% of all UK imported pork products come from Denmark.What might happen to food exports after Brexit?The single market has meant there are no tariffs on the food we import from this Nordic country.There have been warnings from the meat industry that if the UK adopts world trade tariffs then imported food could be more expensive.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said earlier this month that the UK would respond by: "Growing more here and buying more from around the world".Image caption Soren Sondergaard hopes that Brexit won't significantly affect Danish pork exports to the UK At the annual conference of the Danish pig industry, there is a positive mood about Denmark's future trading relationship with the UK.Brexit is one of the key issues on the agenda."The ideal situation for us would be that the UK would remain within the European Union, that unfortunately is not going to happen," says Christian Fink Hansen, from the Danish Agriculture and Food Council."So we hope that we will reach an agreement that will be as close as possible to the current situation."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rearing pigs is big business in Denmark Mr Hansen adds: "We have high levels of animal welfare, high veterinary standards."The alternatives for you would be to look to Brazil, to Canada, to the US, where they have lower standards of animal welfare."At its facility in the Danish city of Horsens, staff at Danish Crown - the world's largest pork exporter - are preparing pork loin which will be sent to the UK to be cured and made into back bacon."The only thing we know is uncertainty, and the one thing we know we don't like as a business is uncertainty," says Lars Albertsen, head of exports at Danish Crown.Image caption Lars Albertsen hopes that Denmark's close ties with the UK will limit the impact of Brexit on Danish pork exporters "We don't know what the trade agreement with the UK will be, but we know there is a need for imports [in the UK]."And we also think the affinity there is between Denmark and the UK, especially with food, will prevail.We need the UK and the UK needs us as well."The majority of the pork exported from Denmark to the UK travels via Esbjerg on the country's west coast.Daily shipments sail to Immingham in Lincolnshire, and currently there are not any border checks.Authorities at the port of Esbjerg are now closely watching what is happening across the North Sea."The UK is one of our top five export markets for Denmark," says Jesper Bank, the chief operating officer at the port.Image caption Jesper Bank says that Danish ports can cope with any extra Brexit paperwork "The total value of our exports [to the UK] is about 10bn euros ($12bn; 9bn) a year, so obviously we are concerned about what is going to happen [with Brexit]."Mostly our concerns are not about the practicalities of what will happen, we are quite sure that if we get administrative burdens we can sort some of those out with the technology."But some of our concern is what will happen in the UK.Will your economy slow down?Will the buying power of the British people slow down?".British hauliers have warned that the possible introduction of checks for goods coming into the UK could lead to queues at both British and continental ports.Mr Bank says that he and his team are confident about their ability to cope with the possible changes."We are aware that even small delays in times can have effects on ports due to custom clearance," he says."This will obviously create some sort of line in this port we have the capacity to cope with that, but I'm aware that some of our colleagues in the UK will have raised this issue."
How solar-powered suitcases are helping babies in Nepal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The solar suitcase was the brainchild of obstetrician Dr Laura Stachel and husband Hal Aronson, co-founders of We Care Solar Hari Sunar is a 24 year-old mum whose second child is due in a few days.She walked from her home in the remote Nepalese village Pandavkhani for her final antenatal check up at her local birthing centre through shuddering thunder, a drenching rainstorm and one of the village's frequent power cuts.These power cuts can last up to two weeks and used to cause the birthing centre significant problems.But now it has its own power solution.The light in the birthing centre stays on and she smiles."I am really happy," the young mum says."Because we have a solar light at the birthing centre."That light is powered by a bright yellow suitcase bolted to the delivery room wall.This is a solar suitcase.Image caption Hari Sunar's final antenatal check at Pandavkhani health post in Nepal Connected to a solar panel on the roof, the device is a miniature power station that provides light, heat and battery charging and a baby monitor.Life saving For local midwife, Hima Shirish, the solar suitcase has been a lifesaver.She was determined find a solar solution for her health centre's energy problems.A charity called One-Heart Worldwide sourced the solar suitcase and installed it in Pandavkhani in 2014.Since then there have been no maternal or baby deaths here."Pregnant mothers used to be afraid of the dark when they came to give birth at the health post," Hima says.Image caption Midwife Hima Shirish switches on the solar suitcase to power life-saving medical equipment "They feared losing their babies.But now the fear is gone and they are relieved that they are going to have a baby using the solar light."Off-grid solution The solar suitcase is the brainchild of California-based obstetrician-gynaecologist Dr Laura Stachel of We Care Solar.While in Nigeria in 2008, she witnessed complications and even deaths when babies were delivered at night without reliable light or power.Dr Stachel devised a suitcase-sized, off-grid, solar electric system with her husband, solar engineer, Hal Aronson.The prototype was so successful in Nigeria, they decided to bring the innovation to clinics and health stations in other countries with high rates of maternal and new-born baby mortality.Earthquake challenge In Nepal, the 2015 earthquake destroyed many of its hospitals and left most of the remaining facilities without reliable power.Weighing just 16kg (35lbs) solar suitcases were ideal for deployment over tough terrain.They provided life-saving power to makeshift medical and birthing tents in the immediate aftermath of the quake.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have

able to generate the electricity its people need."There are a lot of maternity or small clinics in rural areas where they have no electricity at all."Up to a third of rural areas have no reliable power, says Raj Kumar Thapa, managing director of Solar Solutions Private Limited.Government schemes to increase small-scale power generation using solar, wind or hydro have had limited success, he says, because it is difficult for private companies to install and maintain systems in remote areas while still making a profit."So as long as the users are provided with proper training on the operation of the system I think there is a bigger role to play for solar energy especially on a charitable basis in Nepal."Before the birthing centre was built in Pandavkhani in 2013, most babies were delivered at home, sometimes by torchlight or in total darkness.Image copyright We Care Solar Image caption The 16kg solar suitcase was light enough to be deployed to remote earthquake zones in Nepal In difficult cases, mothers in labour would be taken on a 65km (40-mile) mountainous trek over mud and rocks to the hospital in the nearest town, Baglung."Some babies were in the wrong position and we did not have the equipment to help them," Hima recalls."Mothers used to die from haemorrhaging."Now Hima and her staff are also able to charge their mobile phones, another vital piece of kit in this remote part of the world."Sometimes the power cuts can last for 15 days," Hima explains."We used to be completely out of contact because we could not charge our mobile phones."Mrs Sunar is just one of 175 mothers who have already given birth at the centre at least once.As she waits to deliver her second child, she is reassured by her experience during the birth of her daughter."When I was in labour with my first child I arrived at the health post and the light had just been cut.But the health worker said they had a solar suitcase so I didn't need to worry."
Somalia's 'touch and feel' e-commerce hit:::::Image copyright Innovate Ventures Image caption Muraadso co-founders Abdiqani Ibrahim, Hamse Musa and Saed Mohamed When Saed Mohamed, a young entrepreneur from Somalia, pitched his online shopping business Muraadso as part of an East African start-up competition in 2015, he was prepared for rejection.And rejection is what he got.Abdigani Diriye, head of the Somalia-based accelerator, Innovate Ventures, which oversaw the competition, was not impressed."We had a few applications from e-commerce start-ups and they just weren't really doing it for me," he told the BBC.But Mr Mohamed and his team were not about to give up."We have had a lot of rejections and we have learned to be persistent.We wouldn't take no for an answer," he says.They did eventually get on the programme and ended up winning it."The irony is they went on to become the most successful start-up we took on," joked Mr Diriye.But the business they were pitching - a online store selling mainly electronics - "failed miserably" at first, admits Mr Mohamed.Image copyright Muraadso Image caption Users can see goods before they buy by visiting one of Muraadso's three offline stores It seemed Somalia wasn't ready yet for online only.Perhaps this isn't surprising given that less than a third of its 14 million people are able to access the internet and few have bank accounts.It's an uphill struggle to get any online business off the ground.So he looked to how Western retailers were combining offline and online sales to revive the flagging brand."The hybrid model is the thing right now.Amazon has opened a physical store and Walmart and other traditional retailers are acquiring e-commerce sites," he told the BBC.Muraadso did the same and "sales sky-rocketed," he said.Opening bricks and mortar stores in three different cities meant that potential buyers could go and touch the goods first before committing to buying them.The site offers traditional home deliveries and flexible ways to pay, including cash on delivery.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon opened a physical bookstore in Seattle in November, 2015 Many purchase are made via mobile money transfer service, Zaad, which operates in a similar way to Kenya's famous M-Pesa platform.Zaad has an 80% market share in Somalia, charging no fees to send or withdraw money, but making its money instead from offering extra services and mobile airtime."The hybrid model wasn't a concept that I was familiar with, but Muraadso started implementing it late last year and they have been growing ever since, going from a three-man team to employing dozens and looking to raise another round of funding," says Mr Diriye.E-commerce in Somalia is nascent, and across Africa generally, online shopping remains niche, says Matthew Reed, a consultant at research firm Ovum."Many people are still living on desperately low incomes, so e-commerce is really just for the middle classes.And there are other big challenges for e-commerce firms, not just in Somalia," he says.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Terrorism, drought and famine have hampered Somalia's technological progress Chief among them is lack of infrastructure - both decent roads that enable quick and efficient deliveries, and the telecoms infrastructure that allows people to access the platforms in the first place.But things are changing.Millions in Africa have bypassed traditional telephone landlines and leapt straight to mobile - the oft-quoted "leapfrog" effect.According to mobile body the GSMA, there will be 725 million unique mobile subscribers on the continent by 2020.And Somalia is benefiting from this improved connectivity.In 2013, fibre optic firm Liquid Telecom connected the East African country to its network of cables, which now spreads 50,000km (31,000 miles) across 11 other African countries."There is increasing connectivity, mobile is increasingly widely available, and more of that is data-enabled with the increase of 3G and 4G networks," says Mr Reed.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Devices are also becoming more affordable."Changing social and cultural patterns of behaviour, an increasingly youthful population, and urbanisation, mean the stage is set for e-commerce to thrive, he believes.According to Mr Mohamed, Facebook is "huge" in Somalia among younger people, so Muraadso is aggressively exploiting the platform to market its products, gaining 25,000 likes along the way.It aims to have 100,000 by the end of the year.Perhaps unsurprisingly, South Africa has the most mature e-commerce market in Africa, with others such as Kenya and Nigeria gaining user quickly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jumia delivers goods via scooter and offers a variety of payment options Online retailer Jumia is in all three countries and, while it offers a very similar set of services to global market leader Amazon, there is one crucial difference."They realised that they couldn't just copy-and-paste the approach and methodology of Amazon because of factors such as infrastructure, access to couriers and cultural preferences," explains Dr Diriye.So Jumia pioneered the idea of letting customers see the goods before they paid for them.Safari.com, Kenya's leading communications firm, recently announced that it would be launching its own online shopping offering by the end of the year and it plans to expand that service beyond Kenya.Muraadso is still small - its turnover is at around $40,000 (30,000) a month - but already it has a rival - Samionline - and Dr Diriye predicts more will follow."Every day another one pops up in Somalia as the digital wave starts to flow," he says."People are getting online, becoming more tech-savvy and the cost of owning a smartphone is falling."The benefits to the people of Somalia go beyond access to better quality goods and more choice, he adds."It also saves them time as they don't have to travel to town, and it saves them money because they don't have to pay for a bus."People are more productive with their time, and when you multiply that to a whole city or country, the impact can be very significant."
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Managing the managers: The rise of the business 'philosopher-kings':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Are the new ideas and approaches pioneered by management consultants worth their fees?The place: a textile plant near Mumbai, India.The time: 2008.The scene?Chaos.Rubbish is piled up outside the building - with almost as much inside.There are piles of flammable junk, and open chemical containers.The yarn is at least bundled up in white plastic bags, but the inventory is scattered around the plant in unmarked piles.Such shambolic conditions are typical in the Indian textile industry, and that presents an opportunity.A team of researchers from Stanford University and the World Bank is conducting a novel experiment.They're going to send in a team of management consultants to tidy up some of these companies - but not others.Then they'll track what happens to their profits as part of a rigorous, randomised controlled trial.It will tell us conclusively whether the management consultants are worth their fees.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.That question has often been raised over the years.If managers often have bad reputations, what should we make of the people who tell managers how to manage?Picture a management consultant.What comes to mind?A young, sharp-suited graduate, earnestly gesturing to a bulleted PowerPoint presentation that reads something like "holistically envisioneer client-centric deliverables"?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some management consultants are criticised for their reliance on business jargon Okay, I got that from an online random buzzword generator.But you get the idea.The industry battles a stereotype of charging exorbitant fees for advice that, on close inspection, turns out to be either meaningless or common sense.Managers who bring in consultants are often accused of being blinded by jargon, implicitly admitting their own incompetence, or seeking someone else to blame for unpopular decisions.Still, it's big business.The year after Stanford and the World Bank started their Indian study, the UK government alone spent well over $2bn (1.5bn) on management consultants.Globally, consulting firms charge their clients a total of about $125bn (94bn).'Noble' origins Where did this strange industry begin?There's a noble way to frame its origins: economic change creates a new challenge, and visionary men of business provide a solution.In the late 19th century the US economy was expanding fast, and thanks to the railway and telegraph it was also becoming more of a national market and less a collection of local ones.Company owners began to realise that there were huge rewards to be had for companies that could bestride this new national stage.So began an unprecedented wave of mergers and consolidations.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Heinz, which dates back to 1869, grew substantially at the beginning of the 20th century Companies swallowed each other up, creating giant household names: US Steel, General Electric, Heinz, AT&T.Some employed more than 100,000 people.And that was the challenge: nobody had ever tried to manage such vast organisations before.Enter a young professor of accountancy by the name of James McKinsey.His breakthrough was a book published in 1922, with the not-entirely-thrilling title Budgetary Control.Accounting for the future But for corporate America, Budgetary Control was revolutionary.Rather than using traditional historical accounts to provide a picture of how a business had been doing over the past year, McKinsey proposed drawing up accounts for an imaginary corporate future.These future accounts would set out a business's plans and goals, broken down department by department.And later, when the actual accounts were drawn up they could be compared to the plan, which could then be revised.McKinsey's method helped managers take control, setting out a vision for the future rather than simply reviewing the past.Image copyright McKinsey & Company Image caption James McKinsey saw the potential of setting out a corporate vision of the future McKinsey was a big character - tall, and fond of chomping cigars, ignoring his doctor's advice.His ideas caught on with remarkable speed: by the mid-1930s he was hiring himself out at $500 (380) a day - about $25,000 (19,000) in today's money.And as his own time was limited, he took on employees.If he didn't like a report they wrote, he'd hurl it in the bin."I have to be diplomatic with our clients," he told them."But I don't have to be diplomatic with you bastards!"Aged just 48, James McKinsey died of pneumonia.But under his lieutenant, Marvin Bower, McKinsey & Company thrived.Bower was a particular man.He insisted that employees wore a dark suit, a starched white shirt, and, until the 1960s, a hat.McKinsey & Co, he said, was not a business but a "practice".It didn't take on jobs, but "engagements".It was not a company, but a "firm".Eventually it simply became known as "The Firm".'Business philosopher-kings' Duff McDonald wrote a history of The Firm, arguing that its advocacy of scientific approaches to management transformed the business world.It acquired a reputation as perhaps the world's most elite employer.The New Yorker once described McKinsey's young Ivy League hires parachuting into companies around the world as a "Swat team of business philosopher-kings".But hold on.Why don't company owners simply employ managers who've studied those scientific approaches themselves?There aren't many situations where you'd hire someone to do a job, and also hire expensive consultants to advise them how to do it.What accounts for why companies like McKinsey gained such a foothold in the economy?Part of the explanation is surprising: government regulation.The Glass-Steagall act of 1933 was a far-reaching piece of American financial legislation.Image copyright Alamy Image caption The Glass-Steagall act - signed by Franklin Roosevelt in June 1933 - was meant to limit conflicts of interest Among many provisions, Glass-Steagall made it compulsory for investment banks to commission independent financial research into the deals they were brokering.Fearing conflicts of interest, Glass-Steagall forbade law firms, accountancy businesses and the banks themselves from conducting this work.Effectively, the act made it a legal requirement for banks to hire management consultants.In 1956 the Justice Department banned the emerging computer giant IBM from providing advice about how to install or use computers.Another business opportunity for the management consultants.More from Tim Harford: How market research revolutionised advertising and shopping How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth How much wealth is hidden offshore?The great intellectual property trade-off Minimising conflicts of interest was a noble aim, but it hasn't always worked out well.Some time after McKinsey's long-serving boss, Rajat Gupta, left the firm, he managed to get himself convicted and imprisoned for insider trading.McKinsey also employed Enron's Jeff Skilling, and then was paid for advising him, before quietly fading into the background while Enron collapsed and Skilling went to jail.Here's another argument for employing management consultants: ideas on management evolve all the time, so maybe it's worth getting outsiders in periodically for a burst of fresh thinking.'Land and expand' But often it doesn't work like that: the consultants continually find new problems to justify their continued employment.Some use the analogy of leeches, attaching themselves and never letting go.It's a strategy known as "land and expand".One UK government ministry recently admitted that 80% of its supposedly temporary consultants had been working there for more than a year - some for up to nine years.Needless to say, it would have been much cheaper to employ them as civil servants.No doubt the consultancy firms will claim that their expertise is giving the taxpayer value for money.Which brings us back to India, and that randomised controlled trial.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Management consultants saw an opportunity in the often shambolic Indian textile industry The World Bank hired a global consulting firm to put some structure into these jumbled Mumbai textile factories, instituting preventive maintenance, proper records, systematic storing of spares and inventory, and the recording of quality defects.It worked.Productivity jumped by 17% - easily enough to pay the consulting fees.We shouldn't conclude from this study that cynicism about management consulting is always misplaced.These factories were, after all, what a jargon-filled PowerPoint presentation might call "low-hanging fruit".But it's scientific proof of one thing, at least.As so often in life, when an idea is used simply, and humbly, it can pay dividends.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
The woman who won the lottery and used it to do good:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Rachel Lapierre set up Le Book Humanitaire after winning the lottery What would you do if you won the lottery?Buy a new house, a sports car, or travel the world perhaps?But how many of us would use our winnings to set up a charity?That is exactly what Rachel Lapierre, a former Miss Quebec, did back in 2013.The Canadian always loved volunteering, and after running her own modelling agency and working as a nurse, she was looking for a way to follow her idol, Mother Teresa, and dedicate her life to charity.Then fate came knocking when she won a lifetime salary of C$1,000 (605) a week in the Quebecois lottery "Gagnant vie", or "winner for life".Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption Ms Lapierre meets a family of Congolese refugees living in Quebec "At first I couldn't believe it, but I didn't celebrate or shout it from the rooftop because I had made a promise to the universe and I was determined to keep it."I wanted to do something I loved for the rest of my life.I wanted to help others," she says.It took Ms Lapierre only two months to quit her nursing job and launch her own charity, Le Book Humanitaire.Her non-profit organisation, which is located in Saint-Jerome, about 60km north west of Montreal, uses social media to connect those in need with people who can help.Image copyright Rachel Lapierre Image caption Ms Lapierre became Miss Quebec in 1982 On its Facebook page, which has 22,000 followers, those who are struggling can let the community know about their plight.At the same time, members of the public can advertise services or goods they want to donate."Let's say that you have clothes to give away.We will put you in contact with a family that needs those clothes and will allow you to go give them yourself," Ms Lapierre explains."It's not only about material things.You might end up driving a cancer patient to a doctor's appointment."It's a far cry from Ms Lapierre's former career in the more glamorous, and some might argue consumerist, world of modelling.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: In the early 1980s she joined a local modelling school where she was encouraged to enter the Miss Quebec beauty pageant.To her surprise, the then-21-year-old won the contest."I thought modelling was for tall blondes with blue eyes and I was short and brunette...But I am so glad I entered, it was a great experience."The following year she toured Canada as Miss Quebec and even got to meet Rene Levesque, the then-premier of Quebec.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption Ms Lapierre meets with a family of Syrian refugees in Saint-Jerome It inspired her to set up her own modelling school in 1984, to teach young women how to build careers in the industry.It had about 10 staff."Running my own business taught me about accounting and how to manage employees," Ms Lapierre says.She closed the business in the late 1980s to focus on bringing up her four children, but also dedicated herself to voluntary work - making numerous trips with humanitarian organisations to places like India and Haiti.It was this passion that led her to set up Le Book Humanitaire four years ago.This year, the charity has made 15,000 "direct actions" in Quebec, ranging from furnishing an apartment for a family of Syrian refugees, to finding a home for a homeless mother who had just given birth.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption The charity donates food to those in need She has also funded the organisation - which has 10 full-time volunteers and its own board - entirely by herself, investing $70,000 to date."This weekly C$1,000 I get from the lottery allows me to not go to work anymore and finance my organisation," she says."I pay for things such as our office rent and other administrative costs."There are limits to Ms Lapierre's budget, though.After she was interviewed by a popular Quebecois television station earlier this year, Le Book Humanitaire saw a huge increase in its Facebook followers, from around 4,000 to more than 20,000.It led to an influx of requests for help, as well as donations, and the charity has struggled to keep up.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption A volunteer, Ms Lapierre and her sister Guylaine discussing strategy at the charity's offices It needs to open several new facilities to store donated items, but Ms Lapierre can't afford to do this alone."We are counting on municipalities to lend us offices and make donations," she says."But there are always ways to make things work."Growing pains Jean-Pierre Tchang, the founder of IRIS Mundial, a non-profit group that works to improve visual health in developing countries, says that building a successful charity is not easy."The main difficulty is money and getting funding," says Mr Tchang, who worked with Ms Lapierre earlier in her volunteering career."You also have to know your limits.You can start feeling overwhelmed by all the work and forget oneself...I am sure Rachel's nights must be very short."Despite the challenges, Ms Lapierre shows no sign of slowing down.She is also taking a workshop class on managing non-profit organisations to get better at what she does.She continues to get joy from her work, which, she says "is nothing like running a regular business" and instead "feeds her soul"."Volunteering work represents billions of unrecorded dollars across the world.Without it, the world would not function."
How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and grey so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
Are too many tourists visiting Iceland?:::::Image copyright Getty Images An explosion in tourism saved Iceland's economy.But in a country of just 300,000 people, how much tourism is too much?It's a cold, overcast and blustery day in Iceland, but that hasn't put off the busloads of tourists at the Blue Lagoon - one of the country's most popular attractions.The lagoon is a pool of geothermally heated water.It is rich in minerals and is said to be good for your skin.Its creation is something of an accident.Locals noticed the run-off from a local geothermal power plant was a strange shade of blue and started bathing in it.Located between Reykjavik and the airport, it's now become a "must-do"' on tourist itineraries."In our first year in 1994 we had about 50,000 guests, and this year we will be welcoming 1.3 million," says Grimur Smundsen, the Blue Lagoon's chief executive.That success reflects the astonishing growth of tourism in Iceland as a whole.Last year 1.7 million people visited Iceland - more than triple the number that came in 2010, when the small island nation of just 330,000 was still reeling from a catastrophic banking crisis and the eruption of Eyjafjallajkull - a volcano that grounded air traffic across Europe for a week.Image caption This year 1.3 million tourists will visit the Blue Lagoon, says Grimur Smundsen At the time the eruption was seen as a disaster for tourism, but that pessimism proved ill-founded."In the long term it had a tremendous positive effect because Eyjafjallajkull was one of the things that put Iceland on the map."Mr Smundsen says."Maybe tourists heard of Iceland for the first time in the various airports when they were stranded."The sudden interest from travellers could not have come at a better time.When Iceland's three major banks collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, there were fears they would take the rest of the economy with them.Nine years later the economy is growing at more than 7% a year, unemployment is less than 3% and foreign currency is rolling in.The tourism boom is leading to a construction boom and the creation of tens of thousands of jobs."Tourism really helped us take off," says Gylfi Magnusson, a professor at University of Iceland and a former minister for economic affairs after the banking crisis."Certainly the recovery would have taken considerably longer if it hadn't been for this unexpected boom."But the sudden influx of foreign visitors has not come without problems.Some sites lack the infrastructure to cope with the rising numbers.Image caption "We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson In summer Reykjavik's restaurants are filled to capacity.There is a shortage of hotel rooms, meaning that AirBnB has flourished, and Reykjavik's main shopping streets have been turned into a stream of tourist shops selling Icelandic wool jumpers and soft toy puffins."We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Benony Aegesson, who has lived in downtown Reykjavik since the 1970s.He says virtually all the flats around his home are now rented out to tourists."It was very fashionable for young people to live here, but the prices are getting so high that the young people can't afford it anymore."Speculators have come here and bought up apartments and stores and we're worried about its future as a residential area.If it's only old people and tourists here, there is a danger it will die."Is there a limit to the number of tourists a small nation like Iceland can accommodate?Inga Hln Plsdttir is the director of Visit Iceland, and has been in charge of promoting Iceland as a tourist destination for the past decade.She says the question is a difficult one to answer.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Areas outside the capital Reykjavik are looking for more travellers to come and visit, says Inga Hln Plsdttir "If you said there would be five million people coming to Iceland in five years and you told me they would all be coming to Reykjavik, i would really worry," she tells me."But we've been putting the focus on the other regions of Iceland.If you get numbers like that spreading around Iceland, visiting other communities then you have a completely different scenario."At this point I don't think we have an overflow - if you talk to someone just outside Reykjavik they're complaining that they want more travellers to come and visit them."I asked long-time Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson if he would ask people not to come to Iceland on holiday."No, I wouldn't do that," he says: "We're not against tourists per se, but nobody wants to come to a ghost city.Of course they saved us from our financial crisis - that we are grateful for."
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Analysts believe the strong appetite for Asian stocks can continue Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs."Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time," says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors."Now we've moved on from there".Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks."Markets seem impervious to events," says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy."Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent".And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many markets in Asia are trading at historic or multi-year highs Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.Regional growth Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive.Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street.At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been underpinning the broader region for some time.The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates.Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore."China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia," says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.Image copyright AFP Image caption Asia is home to two of the world's three largest economies, China and Japan Japan's economy is also gathering steam.Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher."Japan has a long way to go.There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines," he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds."There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China," Mr Rogers says.Earnings bump That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world.Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost.For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter.CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.It's got a lot to do with memory chips.Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.Which brings us back to North Korea.Image copyright AFP Image caption North Korea insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk.Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as "kind of overblown".That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action.Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.'Unknown' threat Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.Mr Rogers says political risk and "unpredictability" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies.The threat of the "unknown" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region."The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast," says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street.Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump.But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street.History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world."If the US blows up, most things will come off.[Asia] won't be immune," says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors."Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful.Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."
The US and Iranian battle over the pistachio nut trade:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Relations between the US and Iran have an outsized impact on the global trade in pistachios There are lots of casualties in international conflicts but this one is nuts, you might say - although strictly speaking the pistachio is a seed.The international pistachio trade has faced unexpected headwinds due to the tensions between Iran and the US.The global pistachio industry is a multi-billion dollar a year sector that is continuing to grow in value as its popularity as a foodstuff grows.The US and Iran dominate the world's trade in pistachios - collectively controlling between 70% and 80% of yearly output for the last decade.Over the last forty years, Iran's growers have faced pressures from sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on their ability to access international financial tools.Although pistachios themselves were not on the list of sanctioned products, restrictions on global banking made trade difficult for Iranian farmers.All that changed in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal, officially The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).This agreement with the US and its allies removed sanctions.It wasn't just Iranian oil that came flowing back onto the international market, pistachio exports began gaining overseas markets.Trump's threat That progress could face challenges though.US President Donald Trump called the agreement created under his predecessor the "worst" deal the US has ever made.In October he decertified the agreement.The move passes responsibility to the US Congress to evaluate and determine whether it believes Iran is compliant with the terms and if the US should remain in the deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Over 90% of US pistachios are grown in California President Trump said in the speech announcing his decision that the agreement "threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline," but had failed to prevent Iran's "sprint" towards nuclear weapon development.For Iran's pistachio industry the threat of losing the deal and reinstating sanctions could mean the return of what Hojat Hassani Sadi, deputy director of the Iran Pistachio Association calls "unfair and unequal competition".Ancient roots The pistachio industry in Iran dates back thousands of years.By contrast, pistachio farming in the US started in the 1930s with Persian seeds.The boom in commercial pistachio cultivation came after the US severed ties with Iran following the 1979 hostage crisis, after which the US and its allies placed sanctions on Iran.Over the next several decades, even in countries where Iranian pistachios were welcomed, restrictions on its companies' ability to access international financing made it hard for the industry to flourish.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Archaeological evidence suggests pistachios were first grown in what is now Iraq in 7,000BC During that time the US market expanded, with farmers - mainly across California - planting the crop.But in 2014. hot and dry weather conditions across the western US cost the industry nearly half its crop and cut profits for 2015 - the year those nuts were sold - by close to $1.4bn (1bn).Globally, pistachio prices rose, but for Iran's growers it was also an opportunity.Price competition The price of pistachios has been on the rise since 2002.Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers (APG) trade association, attributes this to increased awareness of their health properties and global demand for healthy snacks."The industry has been pushing the products with advertising," he says, adding that middle-class demand in developing markets has also boosted exports.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Increased demand in China has been key to sector growth.Between 2008 and 2013 Chinese imports of US pistachios rose 146% according to APG.But the 2014 drought saw the price of California's nuts rocket from $3/lb (453g) to over $5/lb.By contrast Iran's pistachio yield that year was strong.In markets like China, they were able to undercut American prices by close to $0.20/lb.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pistachio plants grow best in arid climates but that leave crops vulnerable to water shortages A strong growing year in 2016 has helped the US market recover and led to a moderation in price.But Iran has another advantage that helps it in global trade - its location."Iran has a transportation advantage.They can certainly take markets away and China is an example of that," says Mr Matoian.Uphill march The advantages and disadvantages for Iran are not only linked to sanctions.Iran claims its pistachios have a better taste, as do several large European distributors, though the US and Iran mainly grow the same strain.(Turkish pistachios, for example, are a different variety.)The US also imposes a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios meaning even without sanctions the US market has been all but cut off for Iran.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aging water infrastructure in Iran is a major difficultly for Iran's farmers Water shortages are another problem for Iran.According to Mr Sadi it is the "major obstacle to growth" for his industry.Iran's pistachio sector is second in the world following the strong 2016 season in the US.And with the two countries dominating so much of the global market, Iran isn't in dire need of a comeback.But for the growing number of pistachio fans around the world increased access to Iran's pistachio exports and decreasing prices would be a sweet outcome.
The 350 million people who dont officially exist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Whenever any report has a "global" subject matter it's never long before there's a massive, global-size statistic, counting people by the millions and billions.News reports on global problems like to gesture to devastation and deprivation on an epic scale, counting out the suffering in numbers so big that they almost lose meaning.And maybe they actually do go astray.Because the annual monitoring report on education from the United Nations education agency, Unesco, makes the point that global figures on access to education could be out by a factor of 350 million.That's not a minor gap in the headcount.That's the equivalent of the combined populations of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Undocumented and invisible These "invisible" people, below the demographic radar, are described as "the poorest of the poorest".These are families growing up in places where censuses and administrators do not reach.These are millions of unregistered lives in sprawling slums around some cities in the developing world, or in families living illegally and undocumented as migrants.Unesco's report says that the conventional means of gathering information - such as household surveys, censuses and records of birth and death - are only likely to be accurate for populations that are settled, visible and accessing services.Image copyright EPA Image caption How accurate are international figures on education targets?Shifting and excluded populations, even in their tens of millions, are harder to identify and can slip away from the spreadsheets and the data gatherers.Children living on the streets might not show up in the numbers not making it to school.They won't even count enough to be absences.The homeless or nomadic are missing from population studies going from house to house.Unwanted refugees driven over borders by political violence can be left uncounted and unrecognised by reluctant hosts.The UN agency estimates an undercount of 250 million in household surveys used in developing countries and says another 100 million are likely to be outside the reach of official statistics, including those living as illegal immigrants in wealthier countries.Taking account This year's education monitoring report focuses on accountability.But the Unesco study highlights that holding governments accountable for failing to deliver education services depends on knowing how many people need to be supported.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.International goals to cut illiteracy and increase access to school places need to recognise that some of the most disadvantaged are not even part of the target.Unesco says that it raises the question of who is responsible for people who don't even appear in national figures.Such discrepancies appear in the UN agency's own range of figures.Unesco says that its annual statistics for children without access to school include an estimate for those hard to reach communities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More pupils are getting access to school - but 264 million are still missing out But in comparisons for inequalities in access and public spending on education, Unesco says these "invisible" millions are not included.The UN agency makes the point that if the "mantra" of the current development goals is that "no one is left behind", for hundreds of millions, they never even get as far as being recognised as existing.As such, "no one is ultimately held to account for protecting their rights".Missing school This year's newly-released figures show 264 million young people without access to primary or secondary school.The report warns of six successive years in which education has received a declining share of aid budgets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Undocumented migrants and the homeless can go below the radar of official figures And an international group of former education ministers, the Atlantis Group, including former UK education secretary Nicky Morgan and US education secretary Arne Duncan, has called for a greater commitment to aid for education.Last month, another UN agency, Unicef, reported there had been "nearly zero progress" in the past decade on improving access to school in the poorest countries.And earlier this month, Unesco's Institute for Statistics warned of a "staggering" problem in lack of quality in schools, with more than 600 million young people who have been to school but are lacking basic skills in literacy and numeracy.Counting in education and making education count remain a challenge.
Why businesses are saving the humble text message:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm that sends two billion text messages per year If you think that WhatsApp is killing the humble text message you may need to think again.A growing number of us are sending far fewer text messages than we used to.Armed with our fancy smartphones, in recent years we have instead switched to the likes of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, and of course WhatsApp for our chats.As a result, the number of text (or SMS, as they are officially known) messages being sent per day around the world has now fallen far behind the more hi-tech rivals.At WhatsApp alone, 55 billion messages are now sent globally every day, more than twice the 22 billion figure for SMS messages.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are switching from texts to the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Yet while the number of text messages being sent by people in the developed world has fallen since 2011, there continues to be one big growth area - notification SMS messages sent from businesses to customers.Most of us are now increasingly receiving such text messages on a regular basis, such as when you are being reminded of an opticians' appointment, when an engineer will come to repair your boiler, or when a delivery is going to arrive.One company at the forefront of this business text messaging industry is a small English firm Esendex, based in Nottingham, in the East Midlands.With just 200 employees, it now sends out two billion text messages per year, on behalf of 30,000 businesses and other organisations, up from 100 million texts in 2010.Image caption Businesses are now increasingly sending text messages to their customers Esendex is already the biggest player in the UK, France and Italy; it is growing strongly in Germany, Spain and Australia.And it is a lucrative business.Esendex has annual revenues of 23m a year, as firms pay it a fee for every text sent.Meanwhile, a report earlier this year predicted that the global business text message industry would be worth $70bn by 2020, up from $55bn in 2014, as more and more texts are sent out to customers.Geoff Love, Esendex's chief executive, says while friends may like to chat over Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, there are a number of key reasons why businesses prefer to send out text messages instead."SMS is the only app that's on every phone in the world, so no matter who you are trying to communicate with, you know they can receive a text message."Test messaging facts SMS stands for Short Message Service The first text was sent in 1992 by British software engineer Neil Papworth.It read simply "Merry Christmas" 15.2 million texts are sent globally every minute Text messages are read, on average, within five minutes of being received Text messages are up to 160 characters in length Google is working on a new version of text messaging called RCS or Rich Communication Services, which aims to make it more similar to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger "That's not the same with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or any of the other applications.SMS is simply ubiquitous," he says."SMS is also very powerful - people read text messages.95% of text messages are read within five seconds, so you know your message will get there quickly and cheaply."And with SMS we know that the text message has been delivered to the person's phone."Image caption Geoff Love says firms use SMS because it is on every mobile phone in the world Majority-owned by a private equity firm, Esendex is continuing to quickly expand overseas through a determined acquisitions policy.Given that the global marketplace is a crowded one, with a large number of firms touting to help businesses send out text messages to their customers, mobile phone industry expert Ben Wood, says Esendex is right to have wanted to grow quickly."It is a cutthroat business, down to fractions of a penny in terms of margins," says Mr Wood, who works for research group CCS Insight."So scale is all important, companies need to be growing in the space in order to make sure that they're able to buy messages at scale, and therefore compete when they're tendering for business."Image caption Esendex's head office is in Nottingham With its main overseas offices in Barcelona, Spain, and Melbourne, Australia, plus others in France and Italy, Mr Love says an attempt to break into the US market failed."Melbourne and Barcelona grew quickly, [but] things were tougher in America, and we ended up closing down our American operation."Not all of the [US] mobile telephone networks could communicate with each other, so you'd be in a situation where you might send a message and it wasn't received because the two networks didn't have any kind of agreement between them to receive messages, which was crazy."This is the second story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.The first feature in the series, looked at a Canadian winemaker who has to battle winter temperatures of less than -25C."In Europe, whilst it appears to be more complicated because people speak different languages, in reality they are far more similar," says Mr Love.Yet there are some differences in Europe, he adds, with companies in Germany demanding far more stringent tests on the software and technology.Image caption The global mobile phone market is taking over the world Entering the Australian market also brought an unforeseen issue - due to the time difference it can't shut down its UK head office computer systems overnight for maintenance, because it is daytime in Australia."It forced us to become a 24/7 business," says Mr Love."That was quite hard to begin with because it meant changing the way we operated... but in the end it turned into quite an advantage because the companies we are working with are using us for mission-critical stuff 24/7 anyway."Our customers are in every single industry you can think of, it could be a very small business or a massive enterprise.But typically it's organisations who really need to communicate with a large number of people very quickly."
Could this 10-year-old fix Pakistan's waste problem?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zymal Umer has discovered there is money to be made in recycling "If people just thought for a moment before dumping their rubbish then maybe they wouldn't do it as it harms our environment."Zymal Umer, 10, sighs as she takes in the view of a makeshift rubbish dump on the outskirts of her hometown Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan.But could the girl dubbed the country's "youngest social entrepreneur" by many have a solution?For now, there are colourful piles of plastic bags, metal and general waste as far as the eye can see.Wafts of smoke fill the air with a putrid and toxic stench as much of the refuse is set on fire.What's in front of Zymal is just the tip of the iceberg that is Pakistan's problem with waste.According to the country's environment protection department, 20m tonnes of solid waste is generated a year and the figure is growing by 2.4% annually.Landfill issues "This is a situation you can find across all of Pakistan - these bags are not biodegradable and people carelessly discard them.They don't really think about recycling," Zymal says.Image caption Zymal turns old newspapers into gift bags Proper solid waste management has never been practiced in the country; only half of the rubbish generated is collected by the government and there is a severe lack of adequate landfill sites.Dumping and burning remain the most common methods of disposal and much of the uncollected waste poses serious risks to public health.Beautiful bags Zeebags is Zymal's bid to try to reduce pollution and increase awareness about the environment.The schoolgirl turns old newspapers into bright and beautifully decorated gift bags which are then sold to family and friends and most of the profits distributed to various local charities.In the space of just three years she has gone from selling a few bags to selling hundreds - worth $4-5,000.Image caption Pakistan has a real problem with waste "I learnt to make the bags by watching YouTube."It is hard to balance my schoolwork with running Zeebags, so I make them at the weekend or during the holidays with my cousins."My father and grandfather pay for my raw materials and if they didn't help me, it would be very hard to keep my project going," she says.One charity Zymal's money goes to is called SOS Children's Villages, which helps orphaned and destitute children across Pakistan.Image caption Zymal has used the money she has raised to help other children "Through my income I've been able to pay for water coolers, washing machines, batteries and the type of things they need for daily life," Zymal explains."To see the happiness on their faces gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to carry on."Her innovative and charitable enterprise has attracted a fair bit of attention with TV and newspaper coverage labelling Zymal as "Pakistan's youngest social entrepreneur".Award winner Zeebags has also won a number of awards in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA."I was very excited to get some international recognition for my work and proud to get some positive exposure for my country and parents."Image caption Zymal believes her business has the potential to grow much larger Selling online has opened up her business to a new world of possibilities."In Pakistan it's thought girls cannot work independently but I haven't faced any difficulties and my aim is to continue my work."I want to become a businesswoman in the future and expand Zeebags through my website and showcase other people's products, too."The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."My biggest ambition is to grow my project not just in Pakistan but also globally," she says.Kalsoom Lakhani is founder of Invest2Innovate, an organisation that helps start-up companies in Pakistan grow and attract funding.She says the country needs to think about the future for entrepreneurs."While we have this enormous potential we need to be always thinking, how we enable that potential and how we continue to not only allow young people to start a business but allow them to grow businesses."Pakistan has already begun to tackle its environmental problems through legislation, establishing government agencies and accepting technical help from international donors.But the response is still fragmented and not a particularly high priority in a country racked with more pressing security and political issues.Image caption Zymal has to balance her social enterprise with her schoolwork This gives Zymal's work even more urgency.She hopes her success will start to change people's minds about the seriousness of taking care of their environment."It is important so future generations can live in a clean and safe world," she says."I want to be able to say I've played my part but it's up to others to do something themselves, too."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music:::::Image caption Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth.She's promoting her new children's album "I Believe in You" and is in top, self-deprecating form, talking to the BBC."It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear.If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone," she tells me.Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them.She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills.At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: "Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business.Image caption Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m "He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.'So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same."As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.It claims Dolly earned $37m (28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.Image copyright Jason Davis Image caption Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (379m) but says this is conservative."We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset."On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."Mr Warner says "I will always love you", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total.He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, "as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%".Image copyright Wes Ramey for Dollywood Image caption The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of "I Will Always Love You" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982.Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard.It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US.The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The proceeds from Dolly's latest album won't be adding to her fortune, though; instead they'll be going to the Imagination Library.Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.Image copyright Keystone Image caption Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general."Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money.She has "always realised the value of a dollar", too."Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item.I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience.So what's the secret of her longevity?"I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family.I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin.I've been around so long I'm part of their family."Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire.The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is "doing well" and she is thinking of franchising it.She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes."I've still got a lot to do...I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!"Dolly Parton is a force of nature and a tremendously successful one at that; it's hard to imagine her ever stopping.
Is this the most influential work in the history of capitalism?:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Renaissance mathematician Luca Pacioli is seen as the father of double-entry bookkeeping In 1495 or thereabouts, Leonardo da Vinci himself, the genius's genius, noted down a list of things to do in one of his famous notebooks.These to-do lists, written in mirror-writing and interspersed with sketches, are magnificent."Find a master of hydraulics and get him to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner.""Draw Milan.""Learn multiplication from the root from Maestro Luca."Leonardo was a big fan of Maestro Luca, better known today as Luca Pacioli.Pacioli was, appropriately enough, a Renaissance Man: - educated for a life in commerce, but also a conjuror, a chess master, a lover of puzzles, a Franciscan Friar, and a professor of mathematics.Today he is celebrated as the most famous accountant who ever lived.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Pacioli is often called the father of double-entry bookkeeping, but he didn't invent it.The double-entry system - known in its day as "bookkeeping alla Veneziana," or "in the Venetian style" - was being used two centuries earlier, around 1300.The Venetians had abandoned as impractical the Roman system of writing numbers, and were instead embracing Arabic numerals.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venice in the 1300s - when Marco Polo set off on his famous travels to the Far East - was already a sophisticated crossroads of trade and ideas They may have also taken the idea of double-entry book keeping from the Islamic world, or even from India, where there are tantalising hints that double-entry bookkeeping techniques date back thousands of years.Or it may have been a local Venetian invention, repurposing the new Arabic mathematics for commercial ends.Intricate transactions Before the Venetian style caught on, accounts were rather basic.Early medieval merchants were little more than travelling salesmen.They had no need to keep accounts - they could simply check whether their purse was full or empty.But as the commercial enterprises of the Italian city states grew larger, and became more dependent on financial instruments such as loans and currency trades, the need for a more careful reckoning became painfully clear.We have a remarkable record of the business affairs of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato, near Florence, who kept accounts for nearly half a century, from 1366 to 1410.They begin as little more than a financial diary, but as his business grew more complex, he needed something more sophisticated.Image copyright Alamy Image caption We can see how Datini tracked his increasingly intricate financial transactions Late in 1394, Datini orders wool from Mallorca.Six months later the sheep are shorn.Several months after that, 29 sacks of wool arrive in Pisa, via Barcelona.The wool is coiled into 39 bales.Of these, 21 go to a customer in Florence and 18 go to Datini's warehouse, arriving in 1396, over a year after the initial order.They are then processed by more than 100 separate subcontractors.Eventually, six long cloths go back to Mallorca via Venice, but don't sell, so are hawked in Valencia and North Africa instead.The last cloth is sold in 1398, nearly four years after Datini's original order.Fortunately, he had been using bookkeeping alla Veneziana for more than a decade, so was able to keep track of this extraordinarily intricate web of transactions.Enormous influence So what, a century later, did the much lauded Luca Pacioli add to the discipline of bookkeeping?Quite simply, in 1494, he wrote the book."Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" was an enormous survey of everything that was known about mathematics - 615 large and densely typeset pages.Image copyright Stockholm University Library Amidst this colossal textbook, Pacioli included 27 pages that are regarded by many as the most influential work in the history of capitalism.It was the first description of double-entry bookkeeping to be set out clearly, in detail and with plenty of examples.Pacioli's book was sped on its way by a new technology: half a century after Gutenberg developed the movable type printing press, Venice was a centre of the printing industry.Symmetry and balance His book enjoyed a long print run of 2,000 copies, and was widely translated, copied, and plagiarised across Europe.Double-entry bookkeeping was slow to catch on, perhaps because it was technically demanding and unnecessary for simple businesses.But after Pacioli it was always regarded as the pinnacle of the art.Image copyright Alamy Image caption This 1585 woodcut shows a German merchant's accountant doing double-entry bookkeeping As the industrial revolution unfolded, the ideas that Pacioli had set out came to be seen as fundamental to business life.The system used across the world today is essentially the one that Pacioli described.Pacioli's system has two key elements.First, he describes a method for taking an inventory, and then keeping on top of day-to-day transactions using two books - a rough memorandum and a tidier, more organised journal.Then he uses a third book - the ledger - as the foundation of the system, the double-entries themselves.Every transaction was recorded twice in the ledger.If you sell cloth for a ducat, you must account for both the cloth and the ducat.The double-entry system helps to catch errors, because every entry should be balanced by a counterpart, a divine-like symmetry which appealed to a Renaissance Man.Practical tool It was during the industrial revolution that double-entry bookkeeping became seen not just as an exercise for mathematical perfectionists, but as a tool to guide practical business decisions.One of the first to see this was Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery entrepreneur.At first, Wedgwood, flush with success and fat margins, didn't bother with detailed accounts.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Josiah Wedgwood used the insight gleaned from detailed accounts to weather a severe recession But in 1772, Europe faced a severe recession and demand for Wedgwood's ornate crockery collapsed.His warehouses began to fill with unsold stock and workers stood idle.Wedgwood turned to double-entry bookkeeping to understand where in his business the profits were, and how to expand them.He realised how much each piece of work was costing him - a deceptively simple-sounding question - and calculated that he should actually expand production and cut prices to boost business.Others followed, and the discipline of "management accounting" was born - an ever-growing system of metrics and benchmarks and targets, that has led us inexorably to the modern world.More from Tim Harford: How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform What tally sticks tell us about how money works But in that modern world, accounting does have another role.It's about ensuring that shareholders in a business receive a fair share of corporate profits - when only the accountants can say what those profits really are.Here the track record is not encouraging.Image copyright AFP Image caption Enron's collapse in 2001 was the biggest in US corporate history A string of 21st century scandals - Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, and the financial crisis of 2008 - have shown us that audited accounts do not completely protect investors.A business may, through fraud or mismanagement, be on the verge of collapse.Yet we cannot guarantee that the accounts will warn us of this.Complacency Accounting fraud is not a new game.The first companies to require major capital investment were the British railways of the 1830s and 1840s, which needed vast upfront investment before they could earn anything from customers.Investors poured in, and when railway magnates could not pay the dividends that the investors expected, they simply faked their accounts.The entire railway bubble had collapsed in ignominy by 1850.Perhaps the railway investors should have read up on their Geoffrey Chaucer, writing around the same time as Francesco Datini, the merchant of Prato.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Accountancy did not protect Chaucer's Shipman character from an audacious con In Chaucer's Shipman's Tale, a rich merchant is too tied up with his accounts to notice his wife being wooed by a clergyman.Nor do those accounts rescue him from an audacious con.The clergyman borrows the merchant's money, gives it to the merchant's wife - buying his way into her bed with her own husband's cash - and then tells the merchant he's repaid the debt, and to ask his wife where the money is.Accountancy is a powerful financial technology - but it does not protect us from outright fraud, and it may well lure us into complacency.As the neglected wife tells her rich husband, his nose buried in his accounts: "the devil take all such reckonings!"Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Will Australia's 'miracle economy' keep on winning?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It was the year Australia went to war in the Gulf, when Monica Seles and Boris Becker won tennis grand slams in Melbourne, and The Simpsons was first shown on Aussie television, while a swooning Bryan Adams was a hit with love-struck teenagers ("Look into your heart, baby").It was 1991, and the last time Australia tasted the bitter economic taste of recession, defined in these parts, at least, as two or more back-to-back quarters of negative growth in real gross domestic product, or the value of all services and goods.Since then, Australia has sidestepped the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and its more destructive big brother that hammered global markets a decade or so later.Australia's economy - the "wonder down under" - has somehow dodged the unstoppable forces that sent other wealthy countries tumbling into reverse.For this, a nation of 24 million people must thank not only sound judgement by those in charge but also good fortune, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist at financial services company AMP in Sydney."I certainly don't see Australia as being a miracle," he says."It has had a bit of good luck and good management, but it would be dangerous to assume that it is never going to have a recession again."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coal production helped the Australian economy stay afloat The economy is growing by about 1.9% per year, according to the Reserve Bank.In 2012, that figure was 3.7%.Weaker growth means that pay packets are shrinking for many workers when adjusted for the rising cost of living, and near-record levels of underemployment are stifling wage increases.In August, retail sales posted their biggest retreat in about four-and-a-half years, falling by 0.6%, with cafes and restaurants reporting declining turnovers.Period of transition?Rocks, coal and demand from China insulated this country from the global financial meltdown in 2008, as a red-hot mining industry delivered unprecedented wealth.Surging commodity prices fuelled the bonanza in Western Australia and Queensland, which propped up under-performing states in the south-east, where most Australians live.Shane Oliver says the situation has now "been turned on its head" and Australia is once again in transition.The mining boom has faded, but areas that once struggled have bounced back in part because of record low interest rates that have unleashed a frenzy into the housing market.Image copyright Getty Images Meanwhile, eye-watering wads of public money have poured into infrastructure projects, which are redefining parts of New South Wales, the most populous state.There was another critical factor that helped Australia to largely avoid the ravages of the global financial crisis - unprecedented spending by the Labor government that boosted public expenditure by a whopping 13% in an attempt to stimulate growth.It was a classic Keynesian economic manoeuvre to use billions of dollars to sustain household spending, demand and employment.Australia loves to win.Here international cricket matches are akin to "wars" and Olympic gold medals - or a lack thereof - are greeted with congratulatory back-slapping - or hand-wringing.If there was a podium for economic success, this is a country that would be bending forward to accept the award.More than 25 years of uninterrupted growth is a remarkable achievement, although there is debate about the competition.Some commentators believe the recent economic prosperity enjoyed by the Netherlands lasted for (only) 22 years, putting it firmly into silver medal position behind the Aussies.Right place, right time Tim Harcourt, an economics fellow at the University of New South Wales, believes Australia deserves the plaudits."This time the 'lucky country' made its own luck."The Hawke-Keating [government] reforms of the 1980s and 1990s - the currency float, tariff changes, and embrace of Asia - set up us up for a quarter of a century of growth."Australia found itself in the right place at the right time and embraced the Asia century," he argues.Image copyright Getty Images But as the economy has soared, some Australians have been left behind.At almost 13%, youth unemployment is more than twice the national average.Labouring work had left 21-year-old Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the son of an Iranian refugee, with endless back pain and homelessness soon followed."I was just trying to apply for jobs online, and then people were just putting me down saying 'you are never going to get that job', so I just stopped trying," he says.'Muddling along' Mohammad is now employed by a hire car company in Sydney, and has ambitions to one day be the boss.He works with Shiv Dhingra, an Indian migrant from Punjab.They are proof that much of Australia's economic might is down to immigration."I am the only one working in my family," Shiv explained."I am the main financial support they have.I am working seven days a week for the last year.I've got plans for my own business."Image copyright Charity Bounce Image caption Charity Bounce runs sessions in partnership with professional athletes Both young men were helped by Charity Bounce, a Sydney-based non-profit organisation that uses basketball to reach out to the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, who, according to chief executive, Ian Heininger, also deserve a slice of Australia's prosperity."We find a lot of the young people are desperate to find work," he says, "desperate to find an opportunity that is going to get them into a place where they are contributing back to the world."But will they be part of an ever-expanding economy?Mr Oliver thinks Australia's luck will eventually run out, but not for a while."The Aussie economy is probably going to continue muddling along, not fantastically strong as housing slows and consumer spending remains a bit weak," he predicts."We are probably going to go for at least another few years before we have that recession some people say is inevitable."
How can you help your local online business go global?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward."One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains."In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges."Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says."Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees."Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time."Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using."You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
Milwaukee Bucks aim to bounce back on and off NBA court:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is an emerging star in the NBA What has historically made Milwaukee famous has been its beer and its motorcycles, but now NBA basketball side, the Bucks, is also hoping to fly the flag for the US city.Although the team situated on the western shore of Lake Michigan has picked up just one NBA national title, in 1971, in its 50th season it is now hoping to transform its fortunes.The club has wealthy owners in the shape of New York hedge fund billionaires, and has one of the top young players in Giannis Antetokounmpo.It has also signed a groundbreaking shirt sponsorship deal with Harley-Davidson, and as the current regular season gets under way it is moving into a new stadium.As well as being specifically designed for basketball and offering a better fan experience, the Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium will also host music and entertainment events.And the playing season has got off to a bright start, with victory in the opening game over Boston Celtics.Championship dream "Our aims are sporting and financial," Bucks president Peter Feigin, who has previously worked in the theme park and executive jet industries, tells me.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption The Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium is due to open in August 2018 "Our owners are very motivated about the team winning on the court, and also about growing the business to be one of the best in US sport."At present the club is closer to breaking-even financially rather than making a profit, but it is hoped playing success can bring wider brand exposure and enhanced commercial revenues.Meanwhile, the new venue where the club will be the main leaseholder will also bring in increased match day income through executive boxes and improved catering.The team has high hopes for the season ahead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks (green) won their opening match against the Boston Celtics 108-100 "There are four rounds of play-offs, we got to the first round last year and the expectation is to go at least one round better this time," says Mr Feigin, a former head of marketing for the New York Knicks NBA team."It is achievable - we are in the Eastern Division, which is not as strong as the Western Division, and if we are healthy for the season and have no injuries we will do great."He adds: "We are in these games to win a championship; it is all directed towards ultimately winning a championship."'International appeal' Central to any playing success is up-and-coming star Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 22-year-old born in Athens to Nigerian immigrant parents."We have the most-emerging star in the NBA, he is already in the top seven of uniform sales, and had tens of millions of video views," says Mr Feigin."He has gone from 'recognised' to superstar in less than 12 months.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Giannis Antetokounmpo sports a shirt with the fans' chant: Fear the deer "We have been able to grow our European appeal and our Asian appeal via Giannis."And the potentially exciting nature of the team has seen the Bucks double the number of live TV games they will be involved in this season, from nine to 18."That will be big for us not only on viewing impressions, but big for the brand too," adds Mr Feigin, who prior to joining the Bucks three years ago worked for Six Flags Theme Parks in the US.He was also previously president and chief operating officer of Marquis Jet, where he was the driving force behind Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's NetJets acquisition of Marquis in 2010.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption NBA rules allow teams to sign shirt sponsors for three years Mr Feigin says Milwaukee as at a city is at an "inflection point" between its industrial heritage past and a newly-modernised future, something which also applies to its shirt sponsors for the next three years - local motorbike brand Harley-Davidson."Harley are trying to reposition themselves for the next generations, and the NBA can help them do that," he says."They want to reach a young, diverse, more international market."Public funding Mr Feigin has been in London this month meeting to publicise the new stadium, pitching it as "a must-play for sports and entertainment" which will host 200 major events a year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Post-industrial Milwaukee is in the midst of regeneration The $524m (395m) arena is a public-private partnership, with just over half the cash coming from hedge-fund club owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, as well as $250m in public funding."It was very challenging to get this approved; especially at at time when there have been questions about the economy, and debates around healthcare and education," admits Mr Feigin."But a professional sports team can bring in much more than the stadium outlay, through income tax and sales tax."Image copyright Alamy Image caption Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led Milwaukee to their only title success in 1971 He says in return for that $250m outlay, the venue will help bring in more than $1bn over 15 years for the state."The stadium will also create a ripple effect in increasing nearby commercial and residential values," he adds.Bucks season-ticket holders and members will be offered deals on entertainment tickets.Conversely, it's hoped music fans will enjoy the stadium experience enough to come back for a Bucks game.Naming rights Building work began on the new stadium last June, with the club due to move into its new home on Labor Day weekend next year - the first weekend of September."The current venue was not built around basketball as the lead sport, but for ice hockey," says Raj Saha, the arena's general manager, and formerly on the management team of the O2 in London.Image caption Mr Feigin and Mr Saha have been in London to get support for the new stadium "The viewing sight lines where we currently play are not ideal for basketball," says Mr Saha, with only one third of the seats close to the action.The club is looking for six to eight long-term founding commercial partners for the new stadium, paying around $2m a year.Those who have signed up include multi-industrial firm Johnson Controls and bank BMO Harris.The search is on for a stadium naming rights partner, which would pay about $7m a year for 20 years."We are still looking for a naming rights partner.We would have loved to have finalised it by now but are in negotiations with a number of potential partners," says Mr Saha.Image copyright Populous Image caption The new stadium will host a variety of non-basketball entertainment As well as music acts, the arena will also host attractions such as UFC martial arts, boxing, Disney on Ice, and other events."We have an idea of how the first four weeks will look," says Mr Saha."Opening night is important and we'll go big for that, but the first 100 days will also be very important, too, to creating a success story."
The Chinese blockage in the global waste disposal system:::::Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day Imagine the world as a global waste disposal system.Now imagine it with a blockage.And what if that waste is backing up around the world, reappearing in places where you really don't want it to be.That blockage is about to happen in China and the flood is going to start seeping out into waste disposal operations around the world.Three months ago, China decided to ban 24 different grades of rubbish as part of its "National Sword" campaign against foreign garbage.Until now China has been importing millions of tonnes of the world's waste every year to feed its recycling industry.The Bureau of International Recycling China estimates that China last year imported 7.3 million tonnes of plastic scrap from Europe, Japan and USA, and 27 million tonnes of waste paper.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's action in halting various categories of waste imports will hit recycling around the world Robin Wiener, president of the US-based Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said: "More than 155,000 direct jobs are supported by the US industry's export activities, earning an average wage of almost $76,000 and contributing more than $3bn to federal, state, and local taxes."A ban on imports of scrap commodities into China would be catastrophic to the recycling industry."The new restrictions have yet to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and China could still change its mind, but the waste is already starting to back up.In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day.Easy option For China the problem is simply one of pollution.Its submission to the WTO reads: "We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials.This polluted China's environment seriously."Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Mike Baxter says sending waste overseas was the easy option Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry.In theory the rubbish from your recycling rubbish bin is meant to be treated or sorted before it goes in the container overseas, but the rules have too often been ignored and rarely enforced.Mike Baxter, external affairs director at the recycler RPC Group, says: "The easiest option for years has been put it into a container and send it overseas where the labour is cheaper and it can be sorted by hand."But with the ban expected to come into full effect by the new year, if not before, the UK industry has written urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help with the expected overflow.Even so, Robin Latchem, editor of the recycling industry magazine MRW believes the recyclers are not spelling out the problems loudly enough, and says: "Why no mention of growing domestic stockpiles of waste and the danger of more fires or incidents of waste crime?"I don't think it is scare-mongering to set out such fears, along with concern that public perception of the recycling industry in its widest sense will be heavily scarred by greater fly-tipping, larger-scale dumping and more plumes of heavy black smoke crossing housing estates."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry No minister from Defra was available for comment, but a spokesman told the BBC: "We are aware of this situation and are looking into the potential implications."Opportunities But there is flip side to the problem - an opportunity for the recycling industry.In the UK for example, a lot of the waste is high quality, such as off-cuts from plastic manufacturing and plastic bottles that have failed quality tests but can be reprocessed.That presents "a great opportunity", says David Wilson commercial manager of Vanden Recycling, a Hong Kong-based company with a new plastics recycling operation in Peterborough, in the UK."China has voluntarily given up a six million tonne a year industry.We'll be selective about it and we'll go for materials we understand and markets we understand, but some of that lost capacity will be rebuilt here," he says.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Vanden Recycling's David Wilson says the China ban creates new opportunities Low quality waste is a different matter, however, and it requires some drastic rethinking of the whole supply chain.As waste begins to back up through the system, like any commodity in oversupply, it loses value.In the UK, for example, local authorities have been able to generate useful income from selling that waste on to the recyclers.That income is going to fall sharply.Andrew Bird, chairman of the UK's Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee (LARAC) says as demand from China disappears, other markets are emerging, especially in India and wider Asia.Nevertheless, "there is going to be a little bit of pinch point, to say the least, and that will have an effect on price - that's the biggest risk for local authorities".New technologies One answer to tackling the global oversupply of low quality waste is the development of new technologies.Recycling Technologies has developed a method of recycling the most unappetising mix of dirty plastic into something it calls Plaxx, a fuel oil which can be used for myriad applications, including as a source for new recycled plastic.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Adopting new technologies is one long-term solution, says Adrian Griffiths Adrian Griffiths, the company's chief executive, admits there's no shortage of "feedstock" - the term for all the raw material that feeds the process."We chemically recycle plastic.We take it back to the original material so it can become more plastic again: plastic, back to oil, and back to plastic again.Anything that goes to landfill currently is feedstock for us, and since the recycling figures are so low the vast majority of the plastic we want is not in recycling use anyway."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But tackling the global back-up of waste after China's changes will require investment.Surprisingly, it is waste paper recycling that can cost the most.A plastics recycling plant could require a 5m ($6.5m) investment to get it up and running, says Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association.But a paper mill could cost up to 500m.However, RCP's Mr Baxter says investors are not going to step in unless there is a market for recycled goods, and he believes governments have a role to play."It's not just a case of recycling the material.It's having markets for the recyclates that are produced, and this is where government could come in."In the UK, he would like to see the government push local authorities and all government institutions to purchase recycled products.For Mr Bird, from LARAC, responsibility for tackling the long term problems of waste must lie throughout the global product supply chain, but especially with manufacturers.And he says one particular change could have a dramatic effect - the widespread adoption of Extended Producers' Responsibility."It means producers having to pay to ensure the products they are manufacturing can be dealt with in an effective, and environmentally cost-effective way."Meanwhile, the waste is piling up and the clock is ticking.Listen to Jamie Robertson's report on China's ban on waste imports here on BBC World Service's World Business Report programme.
The winemaker who battles temperatures as low as -25C:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the wines of Canadian winemaker Norman Hardie are winning fans around the world.With winter temperatures regularly dipping below -25C at his vineyard, winemaker Norman Hardie definitely didn't choose an easy place to grow his grapes."Minus 25 is the absolute death knell for vitis vinifera [the common grape vine], we actually have to bury our vines in the winter [to protect them].It's a huge job," says the 51-year-old."And then we can get snap spring frosts that can quickly ruin a crop.We lost more than 80% in 2015."While most of us associate winemaking with warm countries, Mr Hardie has since 2004 been making wine in Canada.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie Winery is currently continuing with its 2017 harvest Based in picturesque Prince Edward County, Ontario, a two-hour drive east of Toronto alongside Lake Ontario, the summers are more often glorious.The winters, on the other hand, are harsh, which means that the team at Norman Hardie Winery face a race against the cold weather every November."I have 80,000 plants today, so that is almost a quarter of a million canes [the vine's branches] that we have to tie down by hand, and then cover with a mound of earth," says Norman."Before we then carefully open up and untie in the spring."If that wasn't labour intensive enough, come April and May Norman and his team have to light fires and position wind turbines to try to drive away late frosts.But sometimes, such as in 2015, they just aren't that successful.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie says that Canada's cool weather helps him to make excellent wine Up against such challenges, you might question why Norman ever chose to plant vineyards and build a winery in Ontario.He says that despite the challenges, the combination of cool weather and the clay and limestone soil of Prince Edward County allow him to make world class wines."The great wines are always made on the edge, and we're certainly on the edge," says South African-born Norman, who prior to going into winemaking had been a sommelier (wine waiter) in Toronto."I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world because the flavours we get out of these soils are unique."Image copyright Norman Hardie Winery Image caption While many wine regions around the world have cold winters, they aren't as cold as Canada's Primarily making white wines from chardonnay and red wines from pinot noir, Norman Hardie's wines now have a cult following in Canada, and are even said to be the favourite tipples of Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau.But from day one, Norman - who studied winemaking in Burgundy, Oregon, California, South Africa, and New Zealand prior to establishing his own winery - wanted his wines to be sold internationally.This brought his next big challenge - how to persuade a sceptical world to take Canadian wine seriously, when even Norman admits that 30 years ago the country made "terrible wine".Image caption Canadian wine production remains a drop in the global ocean Norman's solution was to turn himself into a travelling salesman, and build up his wine's global reputation "one top sommelier one top buyer, and one top wine journalist, at a time flying around the world, pounding the pavement, speaking to people, changing people's ideas about Canada".So attending wine fairs, visiting wine importers, and knocking on the doors of Michelin-star restaurants, he started to slowly build up export orders.This is the first feature of a new 20-week series called Connected Commerce, which highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Focusing particularly on the UK and New York, Norman says his personal, face-to-face approach enabled him to let some of the most influential people in the global wine world "understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we are doing it".He adds: "You can only do that with face time, and once you have them they are your evangelists."From selling 6,000 bottles in 2004, Norman Hardy Winery produced 240,000 in 2016.From that 6,804 bottles were exported across eight countries - China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.And he still is regularly overseas promoting his wines, including spending five to six days every year in the UK.Back at the winery, there are now six year-round employees, rising to 50 in the busy summer months and at harvest time in late September and October.The business now has annual revenues of 4.1m Canadian dollars ($3.3m; 2.5m).John Downes, a London-based wine expert, who has the top master of wine qualification, says that Norman was right to recognise the fact that as Canada is such a little known wine region he had to do a lot of marketing work to "stand out" on the global stage.Image caption Prince Edward County is now home to 40 wineries Mr Downes adds: "A lot of people in wine don't tell stories, they say 'here's my wine what do you think about it?'."But they don't tell the story behind the wine, and that gives the picture of the wine to the consumer.Norman does that very well."While exporting wine is not without its challenges, such as the need to produce different labels for each country, Norman says that building up a vibrant export business has also boosted his sales in Canada.Now preparing to bury the vines for another winter, Norman says: "That credibility, that international credibility, says you're doing something right."
The human cost of China's economic reforms:::::Image copyright AFP Luo Yanli is worried about the bad smell from the electric car factory over the road and what the fumes might be doing to her baby and toddler.Mr Yu is worried that millions of workers the Chinese government plans to lay off from failing state owned companies will be "abandoned" like he says he was 15 years ago.Mark Weinberger is worried about China's mountain of national debt, the possibility of bankruptcies and - ultimately - what it might mean for the thousands his multinational firm employs in China.All three tell me they support reforms to overhaul China's mammoth economy; but their stories, from three very different parts of China, reveal the consequences and anxieties associated with the changes.Health fears Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What has China's president achieved so far?The early autumn nights are still warm and humid in Shenzhen where Yanli lives in the south of China.But she doesn't open the windows in her apartment because of the strong smell from the sprawling BYD electric car factory."Before we bought the apartment the developer told us the plant would move elsewhere" she says."After we moved here little seems to have changed."The factory was inspected last year after protests.Airtight seals were installed to contain the fumes.When we visited locals told us some production had been moved to another site.With her baby boy on her lap and her daughter playing with a plastic fork beside her, Yanli says: "The smell is very strong and it has severely affected out lives".They don't know if it's dangerous but, like most of their neighbours, they have plants in their apartment in the hope they'll absorb the smell seeping in.Image caption Luo Yanli has concerns about fumes from a local factory The complex is home to the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars.BYD is a global leader in a technology that China hopes it can dominate; electric vehicles, and specifically the batteries that power them.The big push towards electric isn't just about industrial strategy, it's about trying to tackle China's immense pollution problems - the most obvious of which is dirty air.With incentives for infrastructure and aggressive quota demands for, mostly foreign, manufacturers, this is part and parcel of Beijing's effort to make China's economy less focused on government investment and cheap exports - and instead to one that is technologically advanced, with a sustainable base and driven by consumer spending.So is a bad smell and worries about fumes a price worth paying for this progress, I ask Yanli?Yes it is, she intimates.The windows are firmly shut, though.Survival of the fittest Almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) away in Shenyang, taxi driver Mr Yu points to where the lead smelting plant used to stand, where he worked.It's long gone, replaced by car dealerships and apartment blocks.You can buy a Cadillac where he used to walk through the now demolished main gate.It's 15 years since he was laid off in the wave of liberalising economic reforms with compensation of just over a year's salary - about $5,000 (3,700).Despite the years he gets visibly emotional when I ask if there's any part of the city that's still recognisable from his time as a steel worker.He says he was "abandoned" by the government.There was no training for a new job, no support aside from the pay-off.But two children and a taxi licence later he's a believer in reforms that bring competition to the market place.Image caption Mr Yu was laid off from his job as a worker and now drives a taxi "I think the rule 'survival of the fittest' should apply", he says as we drive around, "baggage should be cast aside" he adds.But there is also this, "isn't it true that the people should be properly settled?"They know a lot about "settling" workers in Shenyang.It's the capital city in China's weakest performing province.Liaoning was once the manufacturing heartland.Now it's trying to rescue the towns and cities around the coal mines and steel plants that help make up this country's "rust belt" and is about to get its first privately owned bank, called the "revitalisation" bank.Away from car dealerships and the mega malls we go to Linsheng on Shenyang's outskirts.Food and rubbish is dumped in piles on its main street.One ground floor apartment in a housing estate has a home-made pigeon coop in a bay window.Parts of the building are decaying.It's home for the workers at the nearby coal mine.As China tries to tackle chronic over-capacity in its traditional industries it's also moving away from dirty coal to heat homes and power its economy.Many mines are being mothballed.A bus driver outside Linsheng's pink-painted community hospital tells me he used to do 17 trips to the mine every day, now it's just seven."A lot of people have retired but the company is not able to hire new employees - nobody wants to come because the salary is low."Image copyright AFP Image caption A construction site in Shenyang, the capital of China's weakest performing economic province As the sun goes down a woman who runs a fruit stall says her business had taken a 30% hit in the last two years, which she puts down to workers' salaries falling.The market boss claims people are buying pork and making it last for two or three days instead of buying daily.A retired miner, who like most of the people we talk to in Linsheng doesn't want to go in front of a microphone, says income for some is down 50%.Still growing So what of taxi driver Mr Yu's call for "survival of the fittest"?President Xi Jinping shows little sign of going that far.It looks like his government's early pledge to enhance market forces - giving them a "decisive role" has remained just that, a pledge.Thousands of factories have been closed but that's as much about their polluting effect than their productive inefficiency.There have been consolidations in various sectors of the myriad state-owned enterprises.The (almost all state-owned) banks have come in with debt for equity deals - something close to a bail out - for the most troubled companies.But there hasn't been a wave of bankruptcies.Preserving social stability is likely to be the main reason for this.A wave of concentrated unemployment could see protests that could threaten order.Indeed 2016 actually saw increased cheap credit and a boost in government spending.Rather than an assault on inefficient state-owned entities, many going, only with increased - and cheaper - debt.Still, the world's second largest economy continues to grow, at rates many in the developed world would envy; 6.7% last year, but the rate of growth is slowing, a plateau is approaching.Debt bubble?Debt and risk are the two things that some think will combine to produce an economic catastrophe in China - but not Mark Weinberger, the CEO of EY, one of the big four accountancy firms."I don't see an impending catastrophe," he says, when we met in Shanghai: "The growth is still there to be able to pay off debt".Such optimism is perhaps not surprising from a man who advises the mayor of China's second city.But Mr Weinberger warns nobody should be complacent: "When the debt gets so large it crowds out growth because of the cost of that debt - that becomes a problem".And China's debt is huge; it is currently about 260% of annual economic output and is predicted to rise.What makes it particularly worrisome is that the bulk of this is held by state-owned corporate entities.Risky practice has been growing too, particularly around the so called "shadow banking" sector.So much so that Beijing cracked down on the insurance market in particular, and went after some of China's best known private firms who were deemed too risky in the way they raised money.Image caption EY chief executive Mark Weinberger says he doesn't see "an impending catastrophe" Firms who owned or had stakes in New York's Waldorf Astoria, Deutsche Bank, Club Med and Wolves FC were all targeted.It's steadied the boat, but that appears all.Other far more significant reforms have not yet happened; financial market reforms, substantial rural land reform, changes to the internal passport-like hukou welfare system.One thing that is happening though is a deepening of the role of "the party" at the top of China's state firms.There were reports this summer that foreign owned firms or joint ventures have been asked to give the Communist Party equal say over their major corporate decisions.Xi Jinping faces a multitude of challenges in his country's economy as he embarks on his second term at the top.Strengthening the party's hold on the means of production is one of Beijing's responses.
From torture victim to human rights student:::::Image caption Noura Al Jizawi has come to study in Toronto after escaping Syria's civil war Noura Al Jizawi has survived more than a decade of extreme risk.Now she's going back to her interrupted life as a student.Growing up in Homs in Syria, the 29 year old has been a student activist, experienced imprisonment and exile and has been a leader in Syria's opposition.Now eight months pregnant, she has gone back to her studies, beginning a master's degree at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.Noura's first awareness of human rights - and of their absence - came early: "I remember when I was just a kid, I was angry because we couldn't choose our notebooks."We could have only one type of notebook - one with a photo of Assad's father on it."Missing persons She soon learned that other, much worse things were wrong with her country.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "Many of the students, a couple of years older than me, were mentioning their missing fathers.I became aware we had missing persons in Syria."While I was growing up, I remember hearing mothers supporting each other... they were the mothers of missing persons."Those guys were the detainees arrested by Assad's father in the 1980s.Some of them are still until this moment missing there were no bodies, there was nothing, just silence."Activism and arrests Noura came up against the regime as an undergraduate at the University of Homs - and reading books such as George Orwell's Animal Farm chimed deeply with her own experience.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.Noura's increasing activism, her work as a blogger, publishing imaginative allegorical fiction, and her readiness to speak out, led to two early arrests.Nevertheless she continued this dangerous work, accessing forbidden websites to distribute anti-regime articles, disseminating ideas of democracy and non-violent protest."We never believed there would be a real revolution in our lifetimes," she said.And then, in December 2010, the Arab Spring began in Tunisia, and spread rapidly, arriving in Syria with a demonstration in Damascus in March 2011.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A mother in Homs with a locket of her lost son "For me it was like a dream.We have a revolution."Noura was still in Homs, but was in touch with activists around the country, and abroad.She became an organiser of demonstrations and an advocate for the rapidly rising numbers of detainees.Social media In the response that followed, many of her friends were killed, many others imprisoned and tortured."To be honest we were not shocked, we knew too well that this regime would not allow people to demand their rights."They were more shocked, she said, by the lack of any effective response from the international community."We were saying, back in the 70s and 80s, when there were great massacres in Syria, there was no internet, there no media channels."But we thought, now we have the social media channels, hopefully this would protect us.But it did not protect us."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Noura's young life has been against a background of war: A fighter in Homs Noura moved from city to city, organising, motivating, dodging the authorities - until in May 2012, she was ordered off a bus in Damascus by armed men and bundled into a car."It was not an arrest, it was abduction, a kidnapping," she said.Tortured in prison Noura emerged seven months later.During that time she was detained in some of Syria's most notorious prisons, and said she had been tortured with electric shocks and beatings.She plays this down, saying that so many have endured - and are still enduring - far worse.For her the hardest experience to bear was hearing the sounds of her fellow-prisoners being tortured.Her captors realised this psychological torture would be more effective in her case - but still she remained silent.Noura explained how she survived: "I was not afraid for myself, I didn't care about myself...I cared only about the revolution I cared about the people who were still continuing this revolution outside."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "We were still a non-violent movement on the ground... and I kept thinking about them...I wanted to make sure that in the questioning I would not speak about any one of those activists.I would pray to my body not to break down."Noura was released late in 2012, and believes that an international campaign played a part in this: "For sure, all of those activities protected me.That is why we need this advocacy, all the time, for all detainees and for missing persons."For Noura, the torment continued, as her younger sister, Alaa, had also been imprisoned and was suffering even worse: "They tortured her harder than me, many times, because of me."Alaa was released in a terrible physical state; the family decided they had to leave Syria, and fled to Turkey to get urgent medical treatment."She was my only reason to leave Syria," said Noura."Otherwise I would still be there."Image caption Noura became a representative in peace talks in Geneva In four years of exile in Turkey, she joined the coalition of Syrian opposition forces, (SNC) and became its vice-president in 2014, as well as being elected to sit on its negotiation panel in Geneva.She joined because she realised this much-criticised group of mainly male, middle-aged "hotel revolutionaries" needed "the blood of youth" and also a strong female voice.Geneva was a real challenge for Noura: "I felt I had to be calm and clever, I had do everything I could do, to interact."She worked hard to get an agreement to break the two-year siege of Homs.Many of its surviving citizens were dying of starvation.'Scholars at risk' Noura resigned from the coalition in 2016, but continued working for an NGO she had created, Start Point, which provides advocacy and psychological support to Syrian women who have suffered torture and sexual violence in detention.She had also met her husband in Turkey, another Syrian activist in exile, who was one of a network of cyber-security experts working for the Munk School's Citizen Lab; hence the Toronto connection.Noura came to Canada as one of 24 international students with scholarships in the university's "scholars at risk" programme.With her daughter due to be born next month, Noura is aware of how this might change her activism.But she's determined not to give up the fight.She sees the master's degree as another step to help her continue her work to bring democracy to Syria."I feel also that being a mother makes me closer to the future... this baby is the future, and maybe will not have to live as our generation live."
From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online:::::Image copyright Geoff Pugh Image caption Lavinia Davolio says selling her luxury sweets on Amazon Marketplace has been good for business What are the best ways to sell online?And how do you make sure you have a website that really works?Part one in our eight-part series exploring all things e-commerce.Lavinia Davolio makes luxury handmade sweets inspired by her Italian heritage.She says her business received a boost when she opened a store on Amazon's Marketplace."It's easy for clients to discover something unique and handmade if it's available through such a trusted online platform," she says."And it means we can offer convenient next day delivery at a competitive price and give our boutique confectionary an incredible reach and visibility."Lavinia is one of thousands of small businesses who've decided to set up shop on an e-commerce marketplace - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba's Taobao, Rakuten to name some of the largest - rather than go through the hassles of setting up their own websites.Amazon charges retailers a 15% commission, but in return even the very smallest entrepreneurs can get a slice of the retail titan's global pulling power just by uploading images and descriptions of their products and then setting their pricing.For an additional fee, Amazon will store and dispatch your goods - the kind of one-stop convenience that is ideal for newbies, suggests Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Despite the convenience of online shopping, people still love the physical store "Something like Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer," he says."Entry costs are very low and straightaway you have a very wide marketplace at your fingertips."When you're starting out with your own website you're having to attract the traffic, which means a lot of search engine optimisation [SEO].This can be complicated and mean extra costs if you need outside help."Some e-tailers want more creative control over their online shops, however -

Can these beads stop 'history's biggest mass poisoning'?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A handful of these resin beads can save lives The beads of resin may not look like much but they could save hundreds of thousands of at-risk people in Bangladesh and parts of India.Human Rights Watch says up to 20 million people are at risk from arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh.Millions have already suffered from what the World Health Organisation calls "the biggest mass poisoning in human history".Millions of "tube-wells" have been dug across Bangladesh since the 1940s.The simple pumps were rolled out across the country by the government and NGOs from the 1970s onwards as a way of delivering cost-effective bacteria-free water.However during the 1980s cases of arsenic poisoning began to emerge.Arsenic can not be seen or smelt; the first signs of its impact are skin lesions which only emerge once the poisoning has taken place.The poisoning can set off a range of heart diseases and cancer and the external symptoms look a lot like leprosy, which can lead to victims and their families being shunned by the local community.A heavy price Image caption Siaton Nessa says arsenic poisoning has ruined her life and affected her family as well Siaton Nessa Meherpur has lesions on her skin from arsenic poisoning.She's in her mid-50s and she says the disease has blighted her entire family."Because of this well my whole skin is filled with black patches," she says."I am worried about my children because no one is prepared to marry them."While the government has made efforts to replace the wells, in many rural areas they are still the primary source of water especially as many families have dug their own tube wells.Human Rights Watch estimate 43,000 people die each year in Bangladesh from illnesses caused by arsenic poisoning.New solutions Image caption Minhaj Chowdhury's Drinkwell is offering an "entrepreneurial solution" to the water crisis Minhaj Chowdhury, 28, was raised in the United States but visited family in Bangladesh during school holidays."It shocked and deeply saddened me to think how we never had to worry about water being fatal in the US but here in Bangladesh one in every five deaths was associated with unsafe drinking water," Mr Chowdhury says.After his grandfather died due to a disease linked to water he decided to take action.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.In 2013 he founded Drinkwell, in partnership with Dr Arup K SenGupta who invented a particular type of resin technology and had already been active in implementing it in India.The resin removes arsenic and other harmful substances from water and once it has been used Drinkwell filters the water through a series of other tanks to take out other harmful substances.The water is sold locally by "Drinkwell" entrepreneurs and the money raised is used to maintain the system.The pricing is set depending on location but a monthly subscription costs anywhere between $0.05 (4p) and $0.12 for 20 litres (4.4 gallons) a day.Entrepreneurial opportunity According to the United Nations, 30% to 50% of all water projects fail after huge investments because of a failure to maintain the facilities.Image caption Drinkwell entrepreneur Habibur Rehman's plant in Manikganj, Bangladesh sells 150,000 litres a day Dr Khairul Islam, the country director for the charity Water Aid in Bangladesh' believes that social entrepreneurs have a role to play in tackling the arsenic poisoning.Dr Islam told the BBC that the main problem so far has been operation and maintenance.Because Drinkwell includes operational and maintenance costs at the centre of its model he says it is the kind of model "this country needs".The first Drinkwell plant began dispensing water in the Manikganj district in 2015.Today that one plant alone has 750 daily customers and dispenses 150,000 litres a day.The network has grown across the country, often by going into schools to deliver safe drinking water for students' meals, from there the word spreads across communities.There are now 30 Drinkwell filtration plants in India and Bangladesh serving more than 100,000 people.Mr Chowdhury believes this is just the start for Drinkwell.He hopes to eventually reach hundreds of millions of people across Asia.He is already talking to the Bangladesh government about rolling out the technology across the country.By involving the communities in the maintenance through their entrepreneur network Mr Chowdhury believes the system can provide clean water "forever".
The 'working class boy' who built a 1bn business:::::Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's wife recently treated him to a new Harley Davidson Paresh Davdra is thrilled about the brand new Harley Davidson waiting for him in a friend's garage.It's not a sign of a mid-life crisis, he insists, but a wedding present from his wife who he married in August.He just has one more test to pass to get his motorcycle licence, then he can hop on the bike and whizz around London for meetings.The boss and co-founder of money exchange firm Rational FX, which reported revenues of more than 1bn ($1.3bn) last year, has a life that's worlds apart from his parents and grandparents.They were forced to flee Uganda in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin gave the Asian population just 90 days to leave the country."They came to the UK with just 50 between them," says the softly-spoken Mr Davdra."My grandfather had his own tailoring shop, but they had to leave everything behind."His family pulled together and bought a house in Harrow, north London, with his dad securing a job as clerk, and later as a financial controller, at a foreign exchange broker.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Paresh Davdra co-founded RationalFX in 2005 Their fighting spirit rubbed off on the younger Davdra."We were never really given anything - if I wanted something, I had to earn it."From the age of 16, he spent the school holidays holding jobs in a mobile phone shop and in telesales, while out of term at Middlesex University, he worked at his dad's firm, taking up roles from filing to working in compliance.He studied marketing and computer science at university, but tells me that technology does not come naturally to him."If you told my team I had this degree, they wouldn't believe you.I'm always the one calling IT to connect the laptop to the printer," he laughs.As soon as Mr Davdra graduated, in 2003, he joined his dad's company as a foreign exchange dealer, helping clients to buy and sell large quantities of foreign currencies.He was in the role for just over a year, working with Indian-born Rajesh Agrawal, a friend of his father's who had arrived in the UK in 2001.But two factors would spur him to quit."I'd tried to buy a property with my dad but the bank rejected the mortgage application," Mr Davdra says."It deflated me."Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX is based in Canary Wharf, London At the same time, Mr Agrawal resigned from his IT manager role."When he decided to quit, I badgered him.I asked him to tell me what he was doing," Mr Davdra says.The two met for coffee and quickly agreed they wanted to set up a company together.The idea was to support customers buying property abroad with their currency needs."Everything we were doing at the old firm was manual, but we thought we could offer the same service online," Mr Davdra says.However, the duo faced a serious challenge: money.Mr Davdra was only a year out of university and had already taken out a personal loan to buy a BMW.When Mr Agrawal took their business plan to the bank and asked to borrow 10,000, he was swiftly rejected.But he returned a few days later and asked for 20,000 to buy a car.The bank said yes."I then sold my BMW and we were set," says 37-year-old Mr Davdra, who also moved into Mr Agrawal's home to save on rent.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's grandfather had to flee Uganda in 1972 With just 32,000 between them, the pair launched their foreign exchange brokerage, RationalFX, in 2005.Like many start-ups, the next difficult task was signing up customers."We got on the phones and started pitching to estate agents and attended every property industry event there was," recalls Mr Davdra."We'd be in the office all day from 8am, then we'd just be at it in the evenings."Their big breakthrough came when they signed a number of estate agents who were selling properties in Dubai.However, just two years after launching, the financial crisis hit.Mr Davdra reflects candidly on how it changed his young mindset.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: "I was 27 at the time and the business was doing great guns, and I was well on my way to being rich.That's all I thought about it."It wasn't really about building a business - that comes with time and maturity.But the crash brought that along.It was a good learning curve."Rational FX also felt the fall-out from the crash, with its growth slowing.But it weathered the storm and went on to diversify.Today, its clients range from high-net worth individuals, either buying property or making investments, to medium-sized businesses, such as firms exporting cars or importing textiles.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX employs 110 people It reported revenues of 1.3bn in 2016, up from 1.1bn the year before, and pre-tax profits of 2.3m - largely because the firm reinvested heavily in its business, Mr Davdra says.After enjoying success with Rational FX, the founders had an idea for an offshoot company - an online money transfer platform aimed at individuals sending lower sums to family overseas."We felt that Rational FX was driving revenues, but Xendpay [the new company] was more of a social initiative, to try and bring the costs of remittance down for people working hard to bring their families out of poverty."Xendpay has a "pay what you want" model, although it does suggest a minimum commission of 0.3-0.4% of the transaction.Mr Davdra says that more than 70% of users pay the suggested fee, 10% hand over more, and the rest pay nothing.The platform isn't profitable yet, although Mr Davdra expects it to break even next year."It was a bit of gamble but a risk we were willing to take."'Still growing' Last year Mr Agrawal stepped down from the firm after he was appointed Deputy Mayor of London for Business.He still owns 70% of the business, and is a non-executive director, while Mr Davdra holds the remaining shares.Mr Davdra says he "misses him"."Apart from business, over the last 12 years we have developed a good relationship.He's a very very close friend."For now, there are no plans to sell RationalFX, although private equity firms approach the firm "an average of twice a day"."Our brands are still growing and are quite young.It's all about the right opportunity," Mr Davdra says.Headquartered at Canary Wharf, RationalFX and Xendpay together employ 110 members of staff.Despite his penchant for expensive bikes and cars, Mr Davdra - who still lives in Harrow - has his feet firmly on the ground."I think we're pretty humble.We're working class, and we just do normal stuff.It's the way we've been brought up."
How the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible:::::Image copyright Alamy "Gentility of speech is at an end," thundered an editorial in London's City Press, in 1858."It stinks!"The stink in question was partly metaphorical: politicians were failing to tackle an obvious problem.As its population grew, London's system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate.To relieve pressure on cess pits - which were prone to leaking, overflowing, and belching explosive methane - the authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies.However, this created a different issue: the gullies were originally intended for only rainwater, and emptied directly into the River Thames.That was the literal stink - the Thames became an open sewer.Image copyright Alamy Cholera was rife.One outbreak killed 14,000 Londoners - nearly one in every 100.Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette drew up plans for new, closed sewers to pump the waste far from the city.It was this project that politicians came under pressure to approve.The sweltering-hot summer of 1858 had made London's malodorous river impossible to politely ignore, or to discuss obliquely with "gentility of speech".The heatwave became popularly known as the "Great Stink".Unlikely figure If you live in a city with modern sanitation, it's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with the suffocating stench of human excrement.For that, we have a number of people to thank - but perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure of Alexander Cumming.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.A watchmaker in London a century before the Great Stink, Cumming won renown for his mastery of intricate mechanics.King George III commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure, and he pioneered the microtome, a device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood for microscopic analysis.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Alexander Cumming's S-bend was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet But Cumming's world-changing invention owed nothing to precision engineering.It was a bit of pipe with a curve in it.In 1775, Cumming patented the S-bend.This became the missing ingredient to create the flushing toilet - and, with it, public sanitation as we know it.Simplicity Flushing toilets had previously foundered on the problem of smell: the pipe that connects the toilet to the sewer, allowing urine and faeces to be flushed away, will also also let sewer odours waft back up - unless you can create some kind of airtight seal.Cumming's solution was simplicity itself: bend the pipe.Water settles in the dip, stopping smells coming up; flushing the toilet replenishes the water.While we've moved on alphabetically from the S-bend to the U-bend, flushing toilets still deploy the same insight.Image copyright Alamy Rollout, however, came slowly: by 1851, flushing toilets remained novel enough in London to cause mass excitement when introduced at the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace.Use of the facilities cost one penny, giving the English language one of its enduring euphemisms for emptying one's bladder, "to spend a penny".Hundreds of thousands of Londoners queued for the opportunity to relieve themselves while marvelling at the miracles of modern plumbing.If the Great Exhibition gave Londoners a vision of how public sanitation could be - clean, and smell-free - no doubt that added to the weight of popular discontent as politicians dragged their heels over finding the funds for Joseph Bazalgette's planned sewers.More than 170 years later, about two-thirds of the world's people have access to what's called "improved sanitation", according to the World Health Organization, up from about a quarter in 1980.That's a big step forward.Economic cost But that still means two and a half billion people don't have access to it, and "improved sanitation" itself is a relatively low bar.It "hygienically separates human excreta from human contact", but it doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself.Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that.More from Tim Harford: What the dynamo reveals about technological revolution Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How air conditioning changed the world The economic costs of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation are many and varied, from health care for diarrhoeal diseases to foregone revenue from hygiene-conscious tourists.The World Bank's Economics of Sanitation Initiative has tried to tot up the price tag.Across various African countries, for example, it reckons inadequate sanitation lops one or two percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP), in India and Bangladesh over 6%, and in Cambodia 7%.That soon adds up.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Open sewers are a common sight in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya The challenge is that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provides.Toilets cost money, but defecating in the street is free.'Positive externality' If I install a toilet, I bear all the costs, while the benefits of the cleaner street are felt by everyone.In economic parlance, that's a "positive externality" - and goods that have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower pace than society, as a whole, would prefer.The most striking example is the "flying toilet" system of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya.The flying toilet works like this: you defecate into a plastic bag, and then in the middle of the night, whirl the bag around your head and hurl it as far away as possible.Replacing a flying toilet with a flushing toilet provides benefits to the toilet owner - but you can bet that the neighbours would appreciate it, too.Contrast, say, the mobile phone.That also costs money, but its benefits accrue largely to me.That's one reason why, although the S-bend has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone, many more people already own a mobile phone than a flushing toilet.If you want to buy a flushing toilet, it also helps if there's a system of sewers to plumb it into, and creating one is a major undertaking - financially and logistically.Image copyright Otto Herschan Image caption Joseph Bazalgette, standing top right, views the Northern Outfall sewer being built below the Abbey Mills pumping station in 1862 When Joseph Bazalgette finally got the cash to build London's sewers, they took 10 years to complete and necessitated digging up 2.5 million cubic metres (88 million cubic ft) of earth.Because of the externality problem, such a project might not appeal to private investors: it tends to require determined politicians, willing taxpayers and well-functioning municipal governments.And those, it seems, are in short supply.According to a study published in 2011, just 6% of India's towns and cities have succeeded in building even a partial network of sewers.The capacity for delay seems almost unlimited.Geographical quirk London's lawmakers likewise procrastinated- but when they finally acted, they didn't hang about.As Stephen Halliday recounts in his book The Great Stink of London, it took just 18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bazalgette's plans.What explains this sudden, impressive alacrity?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Houses of Parliament, photographed in 1858, the year of the Great Stink A quirk of geography: London's Parliament building is located right next to the River Thames.Officials tried to shield lawmakers from the Great Stink, soaking the curtains in chloride of lime in a bid to mask the stench.But it was no use.Try as they might, the politicians couldn't ignore it.The Times described, with a note of grim satisfaction, how MPs had been seen abandoning the building's library, "each gentleman with a handkerchief to his nose".If only concentrating politicians' minds was always that easy.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
What is happening with Japan Inc?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan's reputation for precision manufacturing is coming under more pressure Japan has long been held up as a shining example of integrity, assured quality and reliable products.But the deepening scandal at Kobe Steel over falsified figures could further tarnish the Made in Japan brand.Kobe's troubles started when it admitted last weekend to faking data about the quality, strength and durability of some of the materials it delivered to more than 200 companies including Boeing, Nissan and Toyota.On Friday it said the number of firms involved had risen to 500.The news has wiped out about $1.8bn (1.3bn) off Kobe Steel's market value this week.But with at least half a dozen major Japanese companies admitting to fraud and misconduct in as many years, questions are being raised over why this keeps happening and if there's a systemic problem in Japan.'Cutting corners' Experts say the long term slowdown in economic growth from the 1990s onwards has been a major contributing factor.It has forced Japanese firms to change their business models, and this appears to have taken its toll."Large corporations used to live in a stable, predictable and growing market, but things have changed and some companies may have resorted to cutting corners," says Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, in Tokyo.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel's Hiroya Kawasaki apologised for the "tremendous trouble" the firm had caused Until two decades ago, Japanese firms were focussed on growth strategies but the realisation that their economy would no longer grow as strongly anymore meant companies had to concentrate on restructuring, cost-cutting and extreme efficiency.Speaking to the BBC, Martin Schulz, senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo says these painful adjustments have seen some companies struggle "to adjust to the new rules of the game".The push to improve efficiencies made management desperate to show positive results, sometimes even testing the limits of quality control, he says.Mr Schulz adds core-employees and managers have been stretched to the limit, which in some cases, resulted in overwork and misconduct.But the need to open up new markets overseas to boost profits has created other problems for Japanese firms, especially at their subsidiaries abroad.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel is Japan's third largest steelmaker Florian Kohlbacher, director of the Economist Corporate Network for North Asia, says some companies tried to grow too quickly by expanding overseas without having enough experienced managers to supervise operations.Detecting fraud The misconduct at Kobe Steel follows scandals at carmakers Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, as well as car airbag-maker Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after a global recall sparked by 16 deaths and many injuries.Just two weeks ago, Nissan Motor recalled 1.2m vehicles that had been certified by unauthorised technicians.And the electronics giant Toshiba Corporation is still reeling from the consequences of an accounting scandal in which its profits were inflated.Despite the prevalence of such high profile cases, experts say quality and compliance remain paramount in Japan.But they still expect more scandals involving fraud and misconduct to be uncovered in future.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers of cars, trains and planes are checking if they used sub-standard Kobe Steel materials Mr Kohlbacher says this is partly because new technology such as the internet of things and sensors have made it easier to detect wrongdoing, errors and fraud, while digitisation has helped to spread information about problems and improve transparency.While it is still unclear how the data tampering at Kobe Steel was uncovered, "in a more transparent corporate environment, companies have to come clean on mistakes and misconduct much earlier," says Mr Schulz.Expect more scandals Furthermore, more fraud and misconduct scandals are also expected to be uncovered as a result of laws to protect whistleblowers that came into effect in 2006.The most explosive case came to light five years later when Michael Woodford, the British president of Olympus, became the most senior corporate figure in history to blow the whistle on his own company.His revelations uncovered a $1.4bn (880m) accounting fraud scandal in which the Japanese medical and equipment firm hid investment losses dating back to the 1990s.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quality control questions at Kobe Steel could further erode trust in Japanese firms Mr Kohlbacher says more people have reported wrongdoings since the laws were enacted but it is difficult to confirm exactly how many people have been able to use the legislation to raise the alarm about wrongdoing in their companies.And debate still rages in Japan on whether whistleblowers are adequately protected because the laws do not provide for penalties against companies that punish staff by dismissing or demoting them.Some argue there are further safeguards from wrongdoing provided by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency, which opened in 2009.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The news has wiped out about $1.8bn off Kobe Steel's market value It was created following several accidents caused by substandard products and a number of food poisoning scandals including a case involving Chinese dumplings."Any manufacturer that had a defective product would once have been dealt with by a government ministry but the Consumer Affairs Agency took over these responsibilities," says Keith Henry from the consultancy firm Asia Strategy.Mr Henry adds that the new reporting system focuses much more on the consumer rather than the manufacturer, with regulatory authorities willing to investigate and prosecute cases of misconduct.Rebuilding the brand Some people believe the unwanted spotlight on Japanese firms could actually have a positive effect."There seems to be wide agreement now that just focusing on costs and increasing profitability won't be sufficient as future strategies," says Mr Schulz.Mr Kohlbacher says he now expects "companies to have a close look at their operations and make sure they amend any problems before they turn into something major".But some warn tougher penalties are needed for companies that fail to meet government standards because self-regulation does not always appear to work.Citing the recent Dentsu case last week in which the Japanese advertising giant was only fined 500,000 yen (US$4,400; 3,321) for breaching labour regulations, Mr Okubo says "I think there's something very wrong here."But rather than highlighting a systemic problem in Japan, Mr Okubo says the prevalence of misconduct cases was evidence that "corporate governance in Japan is working" because firms are reporting internal problems so that they can be dealt with.As for companies that want to distance themselves from the fraud and misconduct, he says: "It is about time that each manufacturer stops branding itself as 'Japanese' and instead starts to build their own brand".
Formula One teams' costs rocket after rules changes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewis Hamilton during the Japan F1 Grand Prix Next weekend Britain's Lewis Hamilton could secure his fourth Formula One title at the United States Grand Prix.His Mercedes team is a staggering 145 points ahead of arch-rivals Ferrari despite the sport introducing rules this year which aimed to put the brakes on the dominance of a single outfit.They came at a hefty cost.The new regulations were designed to make for closer racing by increasing aerodynamic and mechanical grip through the introduction of wider tyres and wings.According to one of the teams it has "rewritten" the rulebook and the impact is just as noticeable off track as on it.But if some had hoped the rules might stop Mercedes from running away with the F1 championship they will have been disappointed.Ironically, they have also forced up its rivals' costs.Only the frontrunners have had the resources to foot the bill from their cashflow whilst one of the outfits lower down the grid even had to get a driver to cover the cost.Research has revealed that new regulations fuelled a 167.6m increase in the F1 teams' costs in 2016.They rose 14.5% to hit a combined 1.3bn - the highest-ever total recorded in the sport.F1 cars are designed the year before they race so the bulk of the investment in them is paid for then, too.It means that the cost of this year's campaign is reflected in the teams' 2016 accounts and the final one of them was filed last week.Eight of F1's ten teams have to file publicly-available accounts - the only exceptions are Ferrari as its outfit is run by the car manufacturer itself, and Swiss-based Sauber where firms don't have to release their finances.The costs of the teams' operating companies came to an average of 165.9m in 2016, topped by Northamptonshire-based Mercedes which spent 274.9m excluding the investment in its engines.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption F1 teams' costs rose 14.5% to hit 1.3bn last year It is the highest ever total recorded on the accounts of a British F1 team and even eclipses the turbocharged spending levels before the 2008 economic crash which drove Toyota and Honda out of the sport.At the other end of the spectrum is last year's new entrant Haas F1 which spent a third as much as the championship leaders.Haas has managed to keep its costs down by taking advantage of a new rule allowing teams to buy in more parts than before.Haas uses a Ferrari engine with a chassis created by Italian manufacturer Dallara which also makes the cars for the F2 junior series.Relying on suppliers reduces research and development expenditure which, along with staffing and engine costs, is one of their biggest costs - it rose across the board in 2016 as teams had to design cars to meet the new regulations.They were introduced by F1's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to address criticism that the outcome of races was clear before they started due to the dominance of Mercedes.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Haas has kept costs down by buying in more parts than before With Hamilton at the wheel it has won both the constructors' and the drivers' championship for the past three years running.This year is set to be no different but there has been a far higher price to pay.Writing in the introduction to its accounts Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff notes that there has been "an increase of 27.9m in operating costs mainly due to the impact of technical regulation changes and movement in foreign exchange rates".The 2016 accounts for Force India, also based in Northamptonshire, give more insight into the effort required to meet the new rules.It says that combined with the change in tyre-sizes "our traditional method of retaining 50% of the previous season's car and updating the remaining 50% is not possible for 2017".Over 90% of Force India's car this year is completely new.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Force India has helped cover its increased costs with cash from driver Nikita Mazepin The team planned to cover its increased costs with income from an unlikely source: a driver contract signed with Russian youngster, Nikita Mazepin, "secured a cash injection ahead of significant regulation changes ahead of the 2017 season", said Force India.Mazepin was just 16 when he signed up last year and he has tested for the team twice since then, most recently in July after the Hungarian Grand Prix.He has ample resources to pay as his father Dmitry became a billionaire through owning the mineral fertiliser producer Uralchem.Despite this, Force India still chalked up a net loss of 11.6m - the largest of any team in 2016.The regulation changes even dented the bottom line of British manufacturing giant McLaren.Its went from a net 3.4m profit in 2015 to an after-tax loss of 3.2m the following year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For F1 teams, victory on the track is more important than making a profit Overall the teams made a combined net loss of 2m last year.Perhaps surprisingly this is nothing new as unlike most businesses, profit is not the barometer of success in F1.Instead teams judge their performance on racing results and tend to spend all of their income on this in a bid for victory.Some even pump in more than they make, with additional funds usually coming from owners' pockets or debt.The theory is that it is better to win and make no profit than make money and finish low in the standings.Victory on track increases a team's ability to bring in more sponsorship,, as brands are prepared to pay more to be associated with a winner.The teams' revenue generally comes from three sources with two providing the lion's share.They are fuelled by F1's huge television audience (390m viewers last year).The first key revenue source is sponsorship which comprises around a third of the teams' revenue, Another third comes from prize money.F1's parent company, which is owned by American investment firm Liberty Media, pays the teams around 66% of its annual profits as prize money and it came to $985.5m (742m) in 2016.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite numerous failed attempts there are new proposals to introduce a budget cap for F1 teams Payments from owners represent around half of the teams' remaining revenue and the marketing benefit from the exposure on TV compensates for this investment.If costs increase these payments often rise to compensate and last year Red Bull poured in four times more money into its flagship team.Its investment into Red Bull Racing hit 40.6m as costs surged 9.2% to 197m.As its owner has deep pockets Red Bull Racing doesn't need to rely on drivers who pay but income from them is the remaining source of revenue for F1 teams.They are a hallmark of teams at the bottom of the grid but their days could be numbered.Despite numerous failed attempts F1 hasn't given up on introducing a budget cap and recent reports suggest that Liberty Media will shortly present plans to the teams for introduction in 2021 when their current race contracts expire.But it will be the sport's governing body, the FIA, that will ultimately decide on any changes A limit of 114m has been suggested and this would level the playing field as the smallest teams are already below this whilst the frontrunners would have to scale back.Although it may seem like a logical direction for the sport to go in it would make the recent boost in spending seem all the more pointless.
Paradise Papers: Isle of Man says tax laws 'transparent':::::Image caption The island's government has invited the UK Treasury to investigate its aircraft importation practices The Isle of Man has said it does not welcome those "seeking to evade or aggressively avoid taxes", following the Paradise Papers revelations.Its tax practices have come under scrutiny after documents showed Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his 16.5m luxury jet by importing it via the island in 2013.Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the Isle of Man was "open and transparent".The UK Treasury is now investigating the importation of jets to the island.On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme said Hamilton was given a 3.3m VAT refund after he imported a Bombardier Challenger 605 into the Isle of Man.While the 32-year-old F1 driver's planned use of the jet was predominantly for business purposes, the programme saw documents which suggested he intended to make private flights about a third of the time - with his social media accounts showing evidence of this.To try and get round EU and UK rules banning VAT refunds on aircraft used by private individuals, Hamilton's advisers formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man, the leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby suggest.The jet was then leased back to Hamilton.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: How Lewis Hamilton got a 3.3m VAT refund In an emergency statement to the Isle of Man government, Mr Quayle said an internal review of the practice found no evidence of wrongdoing and he said he had no reason to believe its Customs and Excise Division had been involved in the mistaken refunding of VAT.In October, the Manx government invited the Treasury to conduct an assessment of the practice of importing business jets via the island into the EU, and promised "all appropriate action" would be taken against individuals or companies if there was any evidence of wrongdoing.Mr Quayle confirmed that the assessment had begun, with the "scoping" of it due to be published this month and work to be completed in 2018."The VAT treatment of the importation of aircraft into the EU is a highly technical and complex area in which the Isle of Man follows the same policy, laws and rules as the United Kingdom," he said."However, we acted swiftly and decisively and have taken action to demonstrate that the Isle of Man is a well-regulated, open and transparent member of the international community."'We will not be complacent' Panorama also raised questions about a law passed by the Isle of Man government in 2005 - before the European Savings Directive (EUSD) began.The EUSD was introduced to stop people from one part of Europe putting assets in an account in another country without declaring it.Most of the people targeted by EUSD were therefore already evading tax.Tax adviser Mark Morris claimed an Isle of Man regulator was aware the new law would help tax evaders.Image caption Chief Minister Howard Quayle said he was proud of how the island had taken the international tax agenda foward Mr Quayle said the law was never utilised on the island and tried to distance his administration from the decision to enact it."It is difficult for any administration today to understand or attempt to justify the thinking made by an administration nearly 13 years ago," he said."We are considering all the allegations made to determine next steps and what action can be taken in relation to the past."Mr Quayle added that "where the Isle of Man's integrity is challenged we will not be complacent", and he was "proud of the role" the island had taken "in moving the international tax agenda forward"."However it cannot - and should not - be overlooked that to truly combat evasion and abuse, action not only needs to be global but it also needs to be implemented consistently and effectively."
Paradise Papers: The professionals' responsibility:::::Image copyright Getty Images In the controversy over the Paradise Papers, questions have been raised about the role, responsibilities and liability of professionals in the creation and facilitation of tax avoidance schemes.There are multiple measures in place already to prevent lawyers and accountants establishing and marketing such schemes.But are they making an impact?The disclosure of tax avoidance schemes (DOTAS) regime came into force over a decade ago, which makes anyone marketing a scheme disclose it to HMRC.HMRC then issue a scheme number, which the tax payer has to put on his or her tax return.When that number is seen, the revenue will raise enquiries.The fine for failing to disclose a scheme is severe - up to 1m - for the professional who devises it or advises that is lawful, whilst for users who don't report it, the penalties start at 5,000 per offence.HMRC also now has the power to ask for the disputed tax up front under what are known as Accelerated Payment Notices.This means that the taxpayer has "skin in the game" rather than getting an automatic deferral of his tax liability.If a court then rules that the scheme is unlawful, HMRC can attach a "follower" notice to it, meaning others in the same scheme receive the same treatment.'Ethical foundations' The Solicitors Regulatory Authority requires solicitors in England and Wales to comply with their principles, meaning they must "uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice", and "act with integrity".It is an ethical foundation of practice as a lawyer that you must uphold the rule of law, rather than tell people how to defeat it, so it goes without saying that solicitors should not give advice to help clients commit crime, such as tax evasion.So far, so obvious.However, solicitors advising people about how to structure their assets to minimise their tax are able to do so, provided they give advice within the law.This means as a lawyer is required to act in the best interest of their client, they must advise on the best way to reduce their tax bill if their client wants to have more money and pay less tax.But acting in the best interest of your client probably now includes providing advice about the moral outrage that comes with reducing a tax bill substantially.A likely question to a client would be: "How would you feel if this appears on the front page of a national newspaper?"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption HMRC are rolling out new criminal offences to target professionals involved in tax evasion There is, or certainly should be, a strict ethical dividing line between tax avoidance and tax evasion.If a client asks a solicitor for advice which involves breaking the law - which amounts to evasion - a solicitor must not give that advice or arrange a transaction which helps the client evade tax.New criminal offences are being rolled out by HMRC which will criminalise professionals involved in tax evasion.They include the somewhat convoluted "failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion", which came into force in September.These offences are not retrospective."However, that is not to say they won't make a difference," says Jessica Parker, a partner at the solicitors Corker Binning."They reflect the rising tide of moral opprobrium directed at the offshore tax industry."Advisors will now tread extremely carefully so as to avoid falling onto the wrong side of the notoriously blurred line between legitimate tax avoidance and illegitimate tax evasion."Are things getting better or worse?There are a raft of laws to ensure that people or companies who are resident in the UK pay the correct tax.There has been tax information exchange agreements for years, under which, for example, Switzerland and the Channel Islands send information directly to HMRC.That transparency is likely to be increased as the Common Reporting Standard - a multilateral agreement for automatic exchange of financial information to prevent cross border tax evasion and hiding assets - takes effect.According to Clare Munro, a tax partner at accountants Lubbock Fine, things are improving."Whilst the global tax system is not perfect, much has been done to provide people with incentives to pay what is due," she said."There will always be those who push the boundaries, but there's been a sea change in public attitude to tax avoidance similar to public attitudes to smoking which, along with HMRC's greater focus on tackling avoidance, is making artificial and aggressive structures a thing of the past."
Paradise Papers: Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: Apples secret tax bolthole revealed The world's most profitable firm has a secretive new structure that would enable it to continue avoiding billions in taxes, the Paradise Papers show.They reveal how Apple sidestepped a 2013 crackdown on its controversial Irish tax practices by actively shopping around for a tax haven.It then moved the firm holding most of its untaxed offshore cash, now $252bn, to the Channel Island of Jersey.Apple said the new structure had not lowered its taxes.It said it remained the world's largest taxpayer, paying about $35bn (26bn) in corporation tax over the past three years, that it had followed the law and its changes "did not reduce our tax payments in any country".In a further statement the company stressed that no operations or investments had been moved from Ireland.The Paradise Papers is the name for a huge leak of financial documents that is throwing light on the world of offshore finance.Paradise Papers - Tax secrets of the ultra-rich Up until 2014, the tech company had been exploiting a loophole in tax laws in the US and the Republic of Ireland known as the "double Irish".This allowed Apple to funnel all its sales outside of the Americas - currently about 55% of its revenue - through Irish subsidiaries that were effectively stateless for taxation purposes, and so incurred hardly any tax.Instead of paying Irish corporation tax of 12.5%, or the US rate of 35%, Apple's avoidance structure helped it reduce its tax rate on profits outside of the US to the extent that its foreign tax payments rarely amounted to more than 5% of its foreign profits, and in some years dipped below 2%.The European Commission calculated the rate of tax for one of Apple's Irish companies for one year had been just 0.005%.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2013: "We pay all the taxes we owe.Every single dollar" Apple came under pressure in 2013 in the US Senate, when CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend its tax system.Angry that the US was missing out on a huge amount of tax, then-Senator Carl Levin told him: "You shifted that golden goose to Ireland.You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland.These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it's not right."Mr Cook responded defiantly: "We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar.We do not depend on tax gimmicks... We do not stash money on some Caribbean island."Apple's questionnaire After the EU announced in 2013 that it was investigating Apple's Irish arrangement, the Irish government decided that firms incorporated there could no longer be stateless for tax purposes.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Panorama's Richard Bilton tries to speak to Appleby about Apple in Jersey In order to keep its tax rates low, Apple needed to find an offshore financial centre that would serve as the tax residency for its Irish subsidiaries.In March 2014, Apple's legal advisers sent a questionnaire to Appleby, a leading offshore finance law firm and source of much of the Paradise Papers leak.It asked what benefits different offshore jurisdictions - the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey - could offer Apple.The document asked key questions such as was it possible to "obtain an official assurance of tax exemption" and could it be confirmed that an Irish company might "conduct management activities without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction".They also asked whether a change of government was likely, what information would be visible to the public and how easy it would be to exit the jurisdiction.Source document: Apple questionnaire (extract) Leaked emails also make it clear that Apple wanted to keep the move secret.One email sent between senior partners at Appleby says: "For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity.They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know."Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies.Paradise Papers documents show Apple's two key Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), believed to hold most of Apple's massive $252bn overseas cash hoard, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed from Appleby's office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016.This would have enabled Apple to continue avoiding billions in tax around the world.Apple's 2017 accounts showed they made $44.7bn outside the US and paid just $1.65bn in taxes to foreign governments, a rate of around 3.7%.That is less than a sixth of the average rate of corporation tax in the world.Apple and Ireland vs the EU In August 2016, after a three-year investigation, the European Commission finds that Ireland gave an illegal tax benefit to Apple.The EC says Apple must repay Ireland taxes for the period within its remit of investigation, 2003-2013, a total of 13bn (11.6bn) plus interest of 1bn.Ireland and Apple launch an appeal.Apple's Tim Cook calls the EC ruling "total political crap", with "no reason for it in fact or in law".Ireland says the EU is encroaching on sovereign taxation.It fears multinationals will go elsewhere.Ireland agrees to collect the 13bn, to be held in a managed escrow account pending the appeal verdict.In October 2017, the EU says it will take Ireland to court as it has not yet collected the money.Ireland says it is complicated and it needs time.Massive GDP spike When the "double-Irish" loophole was shut down, Ireland also created new tax regulations that companies like Apple could take advantage of.One of the companies that Apple moved to Jersey, ASI, had rights to some of Apple Inc's hugely valuable intellectual property.If ASI sold the intellectual property back to an Irish company, the Irish company would be able to offset the enormous cost against any future profits.And since the IP holder, ASI, was registered in Jersey, the profits of the sale would not be taxed.It appears Apple has done just that.There was an extraordinary 26% spike in Ireland's GDP in 2015 which media reports put down to intellectual property assets moving into Ireland.Intangible assets rose a massive 250bn in Ireland that year.Ireland's department of finance denied that the new regulations had been brought in to benefit multinationals.It said Ireland was "not unique in allowing companies to claim capital allowances on intangible assets" and had followed "the international norm".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Investigative journalist Richard Brooks on Apples questionnaire and the Isle of Mans response to it Apple declined to answer questions about its two subsidiaries moving their tax residency to Jersey.It also declined to comment when asked whether one of those companies had helped create a huge tax write-off by selling intellectual property.Apple said: "When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States."The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country.In fact, our payments to Ireland increased

Paradise Papers documents raise questions over African mining deal:::::Image copyright Premieres lignes Image caption Katanga mine in the DR Congo One of the world's largest firms loaned a businessman previously accused of corruption $45m and asked him to negotiate mining rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Paradise Papers reveal.Anglo-Swiss company Glencore made the loan available to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a notorious middle man with a close relationship with senior figures in the DR Congo government, in 2009.Mr Gertler was asked to negotiate a new deal for a mining company in which Glencore had a significant stake, which campaigners say cost DR Congo hundreds of millions of dollars.He and Glencore deny any wrongdoing.Glencore agreed to pay Dan Gertler $534m (407m) to buy him out of their shared mining interests in DR Congo in February this year.The new details came to light in the Paradise Papers, a leak of more than 13.4 million documents, many from within Appleby, one of the world's leading offshore law firms.DR Congo has been mired in violence and corruption for decades, leaving more than half of its population living below the poverty line.But the country's vast mineral resources are worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year for those that can access them.This includes Glencore, a huge Anglo-Swiss mining and commodity trading company.By some measures it is the 16th largest company on the planet.For many years Glencore has been involved in mining in DR Congo, in particular the production of copper.The company says it has invested $50bn there.Ten years ago it had an 8.52% stake in a company called Katanga which had the rights to mine copper in the south of the country.In June 2008 Katanga's board, which contained a senior Glencore figure, received some bad news.The DRC government under President Joseph Kabila wanted to renegotiate the terms of its mining licences.Glencore had already invested $150m in Katanga but this could have been wasted if it was unable to mine.The state-owned mining company Gcamines wanted $585m (409m) in an "access premium" to allow the exploitation of copper and cobalt at the mine.The previous agreement had been for $135m (94.5m).Documents contained within the Paradise Papers show Katanga's board felt the demands of the DRC authorities were "quite unacceptable".For the first time, it is possible to see that the directors decided to call for the help of an Israeli businessman called Dan Gertler.Source document: Katanga board minutes - June 2008 "Dan Gertler, who had a substantial indirect interest in the company, should be given a mandate from the board to negotiate with the DRC authorities," Katanga's board minutes from June 2008 show."The board... should approach Mr Gertler to see whether he was prepared to act in this way."Mr Gertler was asked to negotiate an agreement on Katanga's behalf.At around the same time, Glencore agreed to lend a company in the British Virgin Islands called Lora Enterprise $45m (31.5m).Lora Enterprises was controlled by Mr Gertler's family.Glencore then loaned Katanga $265m (185m).This was later converted into shares in the company, allowing Glencore to become its biggest shareholder.The loan to Lora Enterprises allowed Dan Gertler to maintain his stake in the mine.Although Mr Gertler says he did not benefit in any way from the loan.Source document Katanga announced the larger of the loans to the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2009, but the details around it were sparse until now.The terms of the loan to Mr Gertler's company show that if he failed to deliver a new agreement for the rights within three months, Glencore would have been entitled to demand immediate repayment of the loan.The Paradise Papers documents suggest Mr Gertler was quickly successful.Gcamines reduced the access premiums it was asking for from $585m to $140m, which was close to the original agreement, saving Katanga $445m.Source document Pete Jones from anti-corruption campaigners Global Witness said deals similar to the one Glencore was able to strike have had serious consequences for DR Congo."For a country that dependent on it natural resource wealth, deals like this which just suck money out of the economy have hugely negative consequences for DR Congo."Mr Gertler disputes that it was a poor deal for the DRC and says "Gcamines benefitted significantly from the new JVA including Katanga's release of copper and cobalt reserves to Gcamines worth $825m."Glencore told the BBC the $45m loan to Lora Enterprises was made "on commercial terms and was negotiated at arm's length".It also said it was repaid in full by 2010.Lawyers for Mr Gertler said it's not unusual for a lender in a mining deal to demand repayment of a loan if a joint venture fails.They went on to say that "neither Lora Enterprises nor Mr Gertler nor any company or person related to them received the loan funds directly".Mr Gertler's notoriety in DR Congo goes back almost two decades.In 2001 the UN produced a report that accused him of exchanging weapons and military training in part of a deal to secure a monopoly on diamond mining rights.In 2013, a report by the Africa Progress Panel, led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, suggested Dan Gertler's companies had won mining rights in DR Congo at well below their true value.Lawyers for the Israeli businessman deny the allegations made in the 2001 and 2013 reports.Last year, hedge fund Och-Ziff agreed to pay $412m to settle a case brought by US authorities accusing it of paying bribes in several African countries.Prosecutors described, but did not name, an Israeli businessman who they claimed paid "together with others, more than $100m in bribes to obtain special access to, and preferential prices for, opportunities in Congo's mining sector".Dan Gertler denies that he did this.Perhaps most significantly, Mr Gertler was also known to be a close friend of a man called Katumba Mwanke, a key advisor to President Kabila before dying in 2012.Daniel Balint-Kurti from the NGO Global Witness, which has been investigating the relationship between Dan Gertler and Glencore for several years, says the company should have been wary of working with the businessman."By hiring someone close to the Congolese president and pumping him with cash and mandating him as their man in negotiations they were running an extremely high risk," he said.Dan Gertler's lawyers told the BBC that "[He] is a respectable businessman who contributes the vast majority of his wealth and time to the needy."Find out more about the words and phrases found in the Paradise Papers.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a

Paradise Papers: F1 champion Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on 16.5m private jet:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: How Lewis Hamilton got a 3.3m VAT refund Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his 16.5m luxury jet, according to Paradise Papers documents.They show a 3.3m VAT refund was given after the Bombardier Challenger 605 was imported into the Isle of Man in 2013.It appears a leasing deal set up by advisers was artificial and did not comply with an EU and UK ban on refunds for private use - although he may have been entitled to one for business.Hamilton's lawyers say a tax barrister review found the structure was lawful.They added it was not correct to say no VAT had been paid on any of the arrangements.A statement later issued by the racing driver's representative said: "As a global sportsman who pays tax in a large number of countries, Lewis relies upon a team of professional advisers who manage his affairs."Those advisers have assured Lewis that everything is above board and the matter is now in the hands of his lawyers."Instagram posts At 06:15 on 21 January 2013, Hamilton touched down at Ronaldsway airport on the Isle of Man in his new jet with his then-pop star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger to finalise the paperwork with customs.While Hamilton's planned use of the jet was predominantly for business purposes, the BBC's Panorama programme has seen documents which suggest the 32-year-old F1 Mercedes driver intended to make private flights about a third of the time.Image copyright AIRTEAM IMAGES Image caption Hamilton's plane carries the private registration G-LCDH (Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton) Hamilton's social media accounts provide evidence he has used the candy apple red Challenger for holidays and on other personal trips around the world.He has posted a number of photographs of himself on the plane on Instagram - including one showing his bulldogs Roscoe and Coco on board."If private usage of the jet is being disguised as business usage of the jet, then what you essentially have is a tax avoidance scheme," says Rita De La Feria, professor of tax law at Leeds University."You're using it for your own private interests, you're going on holidays, meeting friends.You're supposed to pay the tax on private consumption."Ultimate client Private jets purchased outside the EU are subject to 20% VAT on importation in order to qualify for free circulation within the bloc.While the Isle of Man is not part of the EU, it is a British Crown Dependency and forms a common area with the UK for VAT purposes.Because of this link, an aircraft imported via the island is granted full access to the EU.To try and get round EU and UK rules banning VAT refunds on aircraft used by private individuals, Hamilton's advisers formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man, the leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby suggest.The new company, Stealth (IOM) Limited, leased the jet from Hamilton's British Virgin Islands company, Stealth Aviation Limited, and imported it into the Isle of Man.It was then leased on to a UK jet management company that provided Hamilton with a crew and other services - and which leased it back to Hamilton and his Guernsey company, BRV Limited.Source document Hamilton is described in the documents as the jet's "ultimate client".They also suggest he was being kept up to date.In one email sent ahead of the final signing of the charter agreements and the jet's importation into the Isle of Man, an adviser states: "I would like to email Lewis his agreement this evening and try to reach him on the phone to talk him through it."Source document Other documents show the hourly rate of the plane's lease was increased from 2,000 to 5,500 overnight at one stage, so the Isle of Man company turned a profit as a "commercial" aircraft leasing business.On the basis of the transactions, Hamilton's advisers were able to claim a 100% VAT refund on the 3.3m he was obliged to pay at the point of importation.But the leasing agreements suggest Hamilton was going to be using the plane 80 hours per month, with his company using it for 160 hours.If this estimate had been used for the basis of the VAT refund, under UK and EU VAT rules, only two thirds could have been considered for a refund in relation to business use.The artificiality of the structure raises questions about whether Hamilton should have received a refund at all.'No subterfuge' Image copyright PA Image caption Hamilton secured his fourth F1 title at last month's Mexico Grand Prix Lawyers acting for Hamilton said the driver has a "set of professionals in place who run most aspects of his business operations and that no subterfuge or improper levels of secrecy had been put in place".In a statement, they said Stealth (IOM) Limited was formed to run a leasing business and hire the aircraft on a long-term basis at a commercial rate.They added that the company made all necessary disclosures to Isle of Man officials, who approved the approach.The lawyers said that reducing taxes was not the motive, but even if it had been, it is lawful to lease rather than buy in order to reduce VAT.There are 50 schemes like Hamilton's in the Paradise Papers.The documents show that Appleby on the Isle of Man has imported luxury jets worth 1.25bn.In total, the island has handed out more than 790m in VAT refunds to jet leasing companies, involving more than 230 planes.In light of the Paradise Papers revelations, the Isle of Man government has invited the UK Treasury to conduct an assessment of the practice of importing aircraft into the EU through the island.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Isle of Man Chief Minister Howard Quayle defends VAT treatment It has denied "mistakenly" refunding VAT.The Isle of Man says since 2011 more than 30 assessments for under-declared or over-claimed VAT against businesses in the aircraft leasing sector, with a value of about 4.7m, have been raised.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn last week called on the Prime Minister Theresa May to launch an investigation into VAT avoidance allegations linked with business jets in the Isle of Man.In a statement on the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby said it was a law firm which "advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business.We operate in jurisdictions which are regulated to the highest international standards".Timeline of a VAT refund Source document December 2012: Lewis Hamilton's company in the British Virgin Islands Stealth Aviation Limited pays $26.8m (16.5m) to buy the Bombardier Challenger 605 and luxury additions 24 December 2012: Hamilton flies his family and Nicole Sherzinger to Hawaii for Christmas in the jet 9 January 2013: Appleby Isle of Man incorporates a company for Hamilton -

Paradise Papers: Bono linked to tax probe in Lithuania:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Bono, also known as Paul David Hewson, co-founded U2 in 1976 A Lithuanian shopping mall partly owned by U2's Bono is under investigation for potential tax avoidance, following a probe prompted by the Paradise Papers.The mall allegedly avoided paying 47,000 euros (41,500) in local taxes using an unlawful accounting technique.The company running the mall, in the city of Utena, denies any wrongdoing.The leaked documents show that Bono owned a stake in a Maltese holding company that bought the mall, via a Lithuanian holding company, in 2007.In a statement, the Irish entertainer and anti-poverty campaigner, also known as Paul David Hewson, said he had been "assured by those running the company that it is fully tax compliant".He emphasised that he had previously campaigned for more transparency surrounding the ownership of offshore companies, and was in favour of public registries.Earlier, a spokeswoman told reporters at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that Bono was a "passive, minority investor" in the Maltese entity, which was "voluntarily wound up in 2015".Paradise Papers - exposing the tax secrets of the ultra-rich In recent years, Bono, one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, has received international recognition for his social justice activism and philanthropy, even receiving an honorary knighthood from the Queen in 2007.In the wake of the Panama Papers leak, the ONE Campaign, a charitable organisation fronted by Bono, repeatedly called for more transparency on the ownership of "shell companies" and offshore trusts, and decried the effect of lost tax revenues on developing economies.Image copyright Lukas Balandis/15min.lt Image caption The mall in Utena at the centre of a tax probe Utena, which has a population of roughly 27,000, is a growing city in north-east Lithuania which has recently attracted tens of millions of dollars in foreign investment, mostly in the manufacturing sector.The 3,700-square-metre Ausra mall, which currently contains 20 food and clothing shops, was built by Eika, one of Lithuania's leading developers, and opened its doors in 2006.In April 2007, Eika announced it had sold the mall to an unnamed "foreign investor".The buyer was a Lithuanian company named UAB Nude Estates 2.Records uncovered by the Lithuanian journalist Sarunas Cerniauskas, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian show that the company was ultimately part-owned by Bono, via a series of companies in foreign jurisdictions.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption U2 toured this year to mark the 30th anniversary of their Joshua Tree album Between 2007 and 2012, the Lithuanian firm UAB Nude Estates 2 was owned by a similarly named Maltese company, Nude Estates Malta Ltd.Leaked registry documents reveal that the Maltese company was partly owned by Bono, along with two other businessmen.In 2012 ownership of the Lithuanian company was transferred to another offshore company, named Nude Estates I Ltd, this time in the British Crown dependency of Guernsey.In a written response to questions from the ICIJ, a spokeswoman for Bono, Kathy McKiernan, said the U2 frontman is currently "a passive, minority investor" in the Guernsey company, Nude Estates I, and had held a minority stake in Nude Estates Malta, which has since been wound down."Malta is a well established holding company jurisdiction within the EU," Ms McKiernan added.'Crude violation' The Lithuanian company that runs Ausra mall, Nude Estates 2, declared a loss of more than 3 million euros (2.6m) in 2010.According to analysis by tax expert Ruta Bilkstyte, the loss was achieved by a write-down of the company's fixed assets, the largest of which was the mall building itself.The company carried that loss forward until 2016, paying no tax despite posting profits for five of those six years.In a statement sent to news site 15min.lt, the Lithuanian tax office confirmed that Nude Estates 2 had not paid tax on its profits since at least 2011.Ms Bilkstyte, who was not told of Bono's connection to Nude Estates 2, estimated that the company likely avoided paying 47,000 euros in tax to date, and was set to avoid almost 400,000 euros (353,000) more.Image copyright fide.lt Image caption Lithuanian tax expert Ruta Bilkstyte This, in her view, amounted to a deliberate and "crude violation" of the tax code.After 15min.lt reporters brought Nude Estates 2's filings to the attention of the Lithuanian State Tax Inspectorate, the agency said it was launching an investigation into the company.A spokeswoman for the Inspectorate told the BBC it had "commenced control procedures", and that such an action was usually undertaken on the "evaluation of risk of tax breaches"."Taxpayers having offshore transactions more often score higher points of risk," she added.Sigitas Jautakis, the Lithuanian director of Nude Estates 2, said he was unaware of Bono's connection to the mall and denied his company had engaged in illegal activity.He added that if found to have underpaid tax, the company would make up the shortfall -

Paradise Papers: Lord Ashcroft 'does not control' offshore trust:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltons questions about his offshore trust Lord Ashcroft has denied allegations that he ignored rules around the management of his offshore investments.According to leaked documents, the Tory donor gave assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Punta Gorda Trust in Bermuda in 2000.The leaked Paradise Papers provoked questions as to whether he sometimes made decisions without consulting trust officials.Such action could see the trust challenged by HMRC.The peer denied controlling the trust.In a statement, he said that he has never known the identity of any of the trustees or had any dealings with them."At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."No professional trustee has ever resigned because of anything I may have done," he added.Panorama approached Lord Ashcroft during last month's Conservative Party conference in Manchester but he declined to answer any questions about the trust.He has described two previous Panorama investigations into his affairs as "unashamedly one-sided" and said he had informed BBC director general Tony Hall that he is "simply not prepared to deal with" the programme.'Hugely significant' The 71-year-old former Conservative deputy chairman has given millions of pounds to the party.He fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then-prime minister but remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests.Journalist Peter Oborne said Lord Ashcroft has been a "hugely significant figure" in the Conservative Party over the last 20 years.He said: "Lord Ashcroft has been one of the most significant donors to the... party.But it's not just... that he's been a giver of money, he's also been very important organisationally.He's involved himself in the internal politics."Other documents in the Paradise Papers show Lord Ashcroft has secretly remained non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.Addressing this allegation, he said in his statement: "My position was made public in a statement which I made in March 2010 and to which a link is provided here."Following the change in the law later that year, a change which my statement anticipated, for each of the remaining five years during which I sat in the House of Lords, I was deemed tax resident and domiciled."This is all publicly available information and nothing was produced yesterday by the BBC which suggests different."'Inadequate supervision' The structure of a trust involves one entity legally entrusting a second to look after assets for a third, essentially removing ownership for tax purposes.Wealthy people can legally avoid paying tax on assets that they have given to a trust because they can tell the authorities they no longer own or control the assets in them.But for a trust to work as a tax break, decisions about its assets have to be taken independently by the trustees.Source document Despite the warning, Lord Ashcroft appears to have continued to make decisions about the trust's assets.In October 2000, one of the trustees said: "I would like to emphasize at this point that it is imperative at all times that the trustees are aware of any and all transactions to be entered into prior to transactions occurring."To do otherwise, will only serve to undermine the integrity of the trust as the trustees are being advised of actions taken in connection with trust assets, which should be under their control, after the event."A review of the trust in 2009, discovered that significant payments out had been made that had not been properly recorded.In an internal email, a lawyer representing the trust says: "There have been very large sums of money involved and I am very concerned that there has been inadequate supervision of both transactions and distributions... to put it bluntly we seem to be told nothing whereas we carry the responsibility of acting as trustee."Source document Paperwork then appears to have been put in place retrospectively "to ensure that we have all the relevant trustee and company authorities in place for the transactions which have occured [sic]".'Red flag' Trust experts say anybody who puts their money into a trust could face a challenge by tax authorities if it was felt rules had been abused.Image copyright Hidefumi Nogami, Asahi Shimbun Image caption Lord Ashcroft's trust was based in Bermuda This could include a challenge from HM Revenue and Customs if it was to take the view an overseas trust had been controlled from the UK.Nicholas Shaxson, the author of Treasure Islands, an expose of the workings of tax havens, told Panorama: "On the evidence I have seen, it looks like something that is abusive behaviour and an abusive structure.If the trustees are worried, the trustees are expressing alarm about that, that's a clear red flag."Prof Brooke Harrington, the author of Capital Without Borders, said: "It's important that trustees be independent because the whole concept of a trust is that a settlor gives over legal ownership of an asset to the trustee."That's why you get these tax benefits and other legal benefits from the trust structure."Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International

Paradise Papers: Isle of Man law 'sanctioned' tax dodge:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The law change was passed by the Isle of Man's Parliament in Douglas on May 2005 The Isle of Man passed a law that would help tax evaders, documents in the Paradise Papers show.Lawyers promoting a scheme allowing Swiss bank clients to hide their cash offered to help the authorities amend rules in November 2004.The law was changed seven months later, amid an EU clampdown on tax dodging.BBC Panorama has spoken to the man behind the scheme who claims an Isle of Man regulator was aware the new law would help tax evaders.Mark Morris, a tax adviser and leading expert on tax loopholes, told the programme regulators in offshore territories used to regularly help financial institutions in this way."I think in those times, it was wrong, and there were regulators helping financial institutions," he said."But today, this would never be allowed."'Doesn't seem ethical' Mr Morris devised the scheme to help wealthy clients avoid the European Union Savings Directive (EUSD).The EUSD was introduced in 2005 to stop people from within one part of Europe putting assets in an account in another country without declaring it.Most of the people targeted by EUSD were therefore already evading tax.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Swiss-based adviser Mark Morris on how Isle of Man tax dodge law came about The idea was that EU-based banks and those in other nations including Switzerland would make automatic deductions for tax from interest payments.Mr Morris's scheme was designed to be exempt from the reach of the EUSD.It involved Swiss bank deposits being moved into a redeemable insurance product sold by a new Isle of Man company, Minerva Assurance Ltd.The draft of an agreement with an unnamed bank says of the proposals: "Policy applications and surrenders are transacted expeditiously....Confidentiality is maintained, as the individual client is not directly involved."Image caption A slide presentation illustrated how EUSD would be avoided at each stage of the investment 'Get in touch' The leaked documents outline events in late 2004 when lawyers acting for Mr Morris held talks with the IoM insurance and pensions regulator, David Vick.After it became clear that the new insurance company would not be authorised to operate under existing laws, they appear to have offered to help Mr Vick draft new regulations.A letter they wrote to Mr Vick in November 2004 after their discussions asks him to get in touch "if you believe it would be helpful for us to provide you with ideas as to how to improve the regulations to more readily accord with our client's proposal".Source document Mr Vick then emailed them in March 2005 to say a consultation was to take place about proposed changes to the 1986 Insurance Act.He tells the lawyers he would "be particularly interested in any comments that you have in this regard".On 17 May 2005, amendments were approved by the IoM parliament, known as the Tynwald, and they took effect on 1 June 2005 - exactly a month before the EUSD began.Mr Vick retired from the IoM's Insurance and Pension Authority in 2015.Approached about the events, he declined to answer any questions and referred the BBC to the Isle of Man authorities.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Vick refuses to comment on his role in law change that would have helped tax dodgers The Isle of Man's Chief Minister, Howard Quayle, says the island is a "responsible jurisdiction" and complies with international regulations on tax transparency.He said the events surrounding the insurance scheme would be investigated but he did not believe the regulator at the time would have knowingly helped to create a law to facilitate tax evasion.Mr Quayle told Panorama: "If it had happened I would be incredibly disappointed.Give me the opportunity to look at the evidence first and then we'll take action if it is proven."'Many loopholes' Mark Morris said he had acted within the law and described the financial structure he devised as one of "many loopholes" available at the time.He said that "nine times out of 10" the investors would have been intending to evade tax.In the end, the tax dodge was never used because Mark Morris was unable to recruit enough clients.He said: "Nobody utilised this plan because there were so many other solutions."Mr Morris later gave evidence to the German parliament on EUSD and helped the European Commission with reform of the rules.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Paradise Papers: Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'diverted 2m in offshore tax dodge':::::Three stars of hit BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys diverted more than 2m into an offshore tax-avoidance scheme, Paradise Papers documents show.Patrick Houlihan and Martin and Fiona Delany transferred their fees into companies in Mauritius and sent money back as loans.Similar tax avoidance schemes have been subject to investigation and challenges by HMRC in recent years.The actors have not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.Houlihan told the Irish Times he had joined the scheme after receiving professional advice without fully understanding it.Roy Lyness, who put the stars in touch with the advisers behind the set-up, was the accountant behind the similar tax avoidance scheme used by comedian Jimmy Carr.Paradise Papers - exposing the tax secrets of the ultra-rich Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Richard Bilton asks Mrs Browns Boys star Fiona Delany about the offshore scheme.The revelation in 2012 that Carr had used a Jersey-based tax shelter attracted criticism from then-Prime Minister David Cameron.It led to the comedian saying he had made "a terrible error of judgement".The leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby show how the three Mrs Brown's Boys stars put their fees from a production company owned by Brendan O'Carroll, the creator and star of the show and real-life father of Fiona Delany, in companies they controlled in Mauritius.Mr O'Carroll said neither he nor his companies have been involved in a tax avoidance scheme or structure and the actors' wages were paid into a UK company bank account.Mr O'Carroll's production company is registered at accountant Mr Lyness's office in Oldbury in the West Midlands.Mr Lyness said he was "bound by client confidentiality as well as duties under the Data Protection Act not to divulge confidential information concerning my clients' financial affairs".Worldwide hit Mr O'Carroll plays Irish matriarch Agnes Brown in Mrs Brown's Boys.Patrick Houlihan is one of the boys - Dermot.Fiona Delany stars as Mr Houlihan's nurse wife Maria, and her real-life husband, Mr Delany, stars as Trevor Brown, the youngest son.Image caption The show's creator, Brendan O'Carroll, stressed he had never been involved in a tax avoidance scheme or structure The sitcom started life as a radio show on RTE 2FM in the Irish Republic and became a worldwide hit after being turned into a TV series by the BBC and RTE in 2011.There is also a successful stage show which tours the world.A film, Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie, came out in 2014, and the show's Christmas specials are among the UK's top-viewed festive programmes.Investment advisers The Paradise Papers documents suggest the actors' fees from their work connected to Mrs Brown's Boys was sent offshore to avoid income tax and national insurance.Source document Image caption The leaked documents show the trail of money being transferred to the actors via Mauritius They show: Brendan O'Carroll's production company pays a UK-based company for the actors' work the UK company transfers the money to a trust set up in Mauritius by Appleby the actors were self-employed contractors for the trust, which took a 12.5% cut of their fees, before transferring the money into three companies in Mauritius the actors each had effective control over the companies they took on the role of investment advisers, "recommending" their earnings be sent back to their personal bank accounts in the form of loans the loans had been structured to avoid triggering rules brought in by the UK government to prevent similar schemes from operating - with the money paid into the accounts through a third party.Documents for the 2014-15 financial year show Martin Delany's offshore company received 448,095 and Fiona Delany's received 448,168.No figures are available for Paddy Houlihan, as his company's accounts for that period are not in the data.But a spreadsheet for the next financial year shows in December 2015 Mr Houlihan's company had assets of 696,349, Fiona Delany's 715,122, and Martin Delany's 725,030.Accelerated payment notices In official guidance issued in 2016, HMRC said it would investigate and challenge such practices."Scheme promoters will tell you that the payment is non-taxable because it's a loan, and doesn't count as income," it said."In reality, you don't pay the loan back, so it's no different to normal income and is taxable."So if you're using one of these schemes and being paid this way you're highly likely to be avoiding tax."Image caption Comedian Jimmy Carr's use of a tax avoidance scheme came to light in 2012 HMRC has the power to send people using these sorts of schemes "accelerated payment notices" - which require them to repay the tax immediately, while their case is investigated.Told of the type of scheme being used by the Mrs Brown's Boys stars, MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: "If it's not outside the actual rules it's certainly... way outside the spirit of the rules."She added: "A decade ago perhaps it wasn't so much in the public domain, but now I don't think anybody with any sense would be just taking the advice of a tax adviser without asking certain questions... That's just common sense... these people ought to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves whether it's really fair what they're doing."In a statement on the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby said it was a law firm which "advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business.We operate in jurisdictions which are regulated to the highest international standards".The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)

"The Duchy has only invested in highly regarded private equity funds following a strong recommendation from our investment consultants."A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster added: "We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds.All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate."The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."Duchy's reputation Details about the Duchy's investments came to light in the Paradise Papers - a leak of 13.4m documents from companies including Appleby, one of the world's leading offshore law firms.The two funds were based in British overseas territories with no corporation tax and at the centre of the offshore financial industry.But the Duchy said it was not aware there were tax advantages to it from investing in offshore funds, adding that tax strategy was not a part of the estate's investment policy.The documents show the Duchy of Lancaster put 5m in the Jubilee Absolute Return Fund Limited in Bermuda in 2004, with the investment coming to an end in 2010.In 2005 the Duchy agreed to put $7.5m (5.7m) in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP.Documents show the fund invested in medical and technology companies.The connection to rent-to-buy firm BrightHouse began in 2007 when the US company running the fund asked the Duchy to contribute $450,000 to five projects, including the purchase of the two UK High Street retailers.This included an interest in London-based private equity firm Vision Capital, the company which acquired 100% of BrightHouse and 75% of the owners of Threshers off licence chain.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge says she is furious with those who advise the Queen Under its new owners, Threshers' balance sheet was loaded with debt and it paid no corporation tax for two years.When the drinks retailer went bust in October 2009, almost 6,000 people lost their jobs.The majority of Vision Capital's BrightHouse investment later ended up in a company based in Luxembourg and it began paying less corporation tax in the UK.Last month, the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said BrightHouse, which sells electrical goods and furniture predominantly to people on lower incomes via weekly installments, had not acted as a "responsible lender" and ordered it to pay 14.8m compensation to 249,000 customers.The Duchy said its investment in the Cayman Islands fund is due to continue until 2019 or 2020 and amounts to 0.3% of the total value of the estate, while its interest in BrightHouse now equates to just 0.0006% of its wealth.The Duchy did not provide a figure for its interest in Threshers.Vision Capital said it "complies with all laws and regulations and pays its tax in full and on time.Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong".Analysis: BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell The Paradise Papers' revelations over the Queen's finances are certainly embarrassing.Many will also view the Duchy of Lancaster's offshore investments in BrightHouse and Threshers as dubious and inappropriate.However, it is not a question of tax avoidance, but of judgement on behalf of her advisers.The Queen is officially exempt from UK tax laws, but voluntarily pays her share of income tax on her 500m estate.It is extraordinary and puzzling that her advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds.There will be meetings and questions being asked within Buckingham Palace this morning as the monarchy finds its reputation tarnished by association.The Duchy's 2017 annual report says it "gives ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation of the Duchy or Her Majesty The Queen".Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said she was "pretty furious" with the Queen's investment advisers, saying they were bringing her reputation into disrepute."It is so obvious that if you're looking after the money of the monarchy, you've got to be actually cleaner than clean and you must never go near the dirty world of money laundering, tax avoidance, tax evasion or actually making money in dubious ways," she said.'Preying on the vulnerable' The business model of BrightHouse has long come under the spotlight.A parliamentary report in 2015 said the company was charging interest rates of up to 94%.One in five customers were in arrears and one in 10 purchases ended in repossession.In one case examined by MPs and Lords, a Samsung freezer cost 644 to buy in John Lewis but 1,716 under a five-year plan from the chain.Image copyright Alamy BrightHouse was attracting attention at the time of the Duchy's investment - with the Financial Times challenging its chief executive in November 2008 to respond to accusations that the chain was "preying on the vulnerable".The company maintains it is a responsible lender and through its 300 stores provides a services to millions of Britons who are unable to access up traditional lines of credit.BrightHouse told the Guardian newspaper it follows all relevant tax regulations and pays its tax in full and on time.Vision Capital announced it was acquiring the stakes in BrightHouse and Threshers in June 2007.Source documents The offshore leaked documents show the Duchy of Lancaster was among 46 investors in the $312m Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP.In September 2007, investors were asked to pay 6% of their financial commitment into five investments, including "Project Bertie".The investors were told Project Bertie was formed to take an interest in a company set up by Vision Capital to "acquire a portfolio of two retailers in the United Kingdom".The Duchy of Lancaster's $450,000 commitment to the "capital call" is listed in the documents.Another document shows the investment in Jubilee Absolute Return Fund.Full disclosure Established more than 700 years ago, the Duchy of Lancaster has a commercial and residential property portfolio and financial investments.Its main purpose is to provide income for the Queen, who is known as the "Duke of Lancaster".Although the Duchy is not subject to tax, since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid tax on any income she receives.The Duchy's annual report and accounts include a summary of its holdings and financial performance and are put before Parliament.The offshore investments were not referenced in the reports but there is no requirement for specific details of the Duchy's holdings to be disclosed.Dave McClure, the author of a book about the wealth of the Royal Family, told the BBC "pressure will grow on the Duchy to open up to proper parliamentary scrutiny by the National Audit Office, which they've resisted for decades."The solution to the problem might be just full disclosure, so everyone knows what investments they're investing in."Image copyright Getty Images The Duchy said the Queen "takes a keen interest in the Duchy's estates and tenants" but "appoints a chancellor and the Duchy Council to administer the affairs of Her Duchy.The chancellor delegates the oversight to the Duchy to the Council".Investors in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP made a commitment for a "given period" and are "not party to its ongoing investment decisions" or where money is "ultimately invested", it added.Asked whether the Duchy had other investments in offshore funds, it said it "currently invests in a fund domiciled in Ireland".The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is a government minister and sits in the cabinet, but plays a nominal role in running the estate.The current chancellor is Sir Patrick McLoughlin MP, the Chairman of the Conservative Party.At the time the Duchy initially invested in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP in September 2005, its chancellor was Labour MP John Hutton.Ed Miliband was the chancellor of the Duchy at the time the call came to invest in the company taking over BrightHouse and Threshers.Coincidentally in 2016, the former Labour leader called for better regulation on buy-to-rent firms such as BrightHouse in a film for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Paradise Papers: Commerce chief Wilbur Ross's links with sanctioned Russians:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Wilbur Ross has played a key part in Donald Trump's business and political careers A top member of Donald Trump's administration has business links with Russian allies of President Vladimir Putin who are under US sanctions, the Paradise Papers have revealed.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has an interest in Navigator Holdings, which earns millions a year transporting oil and gas for Russian energy firm Sibur.Two major Sibur shareholders are under some form of US sanctions.A commerce department spokesman did not dispute the revelations."Secretary Ross recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels," the spokesman told BBC Panorama, adding that the secretary "works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards".Another Sibur shareholder is President Putin's son in law, Kirill Shamalov.He holds a 3.9% stake in the firm.Gennady Timchenko, who has been individually sanctioned by the United States, has at least 12 companies connected to him, and Leonid Mikhelson, whose main company, Novatek, is also sanctioned, are major shareholders.Sibur itself and Mr Shamalov are not under sanctions, although Mr Shamalov's father, Nikolai, is.The commerce department spokesman said Mr Ross had never met the three Russian shareholders.The US imposed some sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.Others were imposed last year for alleged interference in the US presidential election.The revelations will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team.His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election.He has called the allegations "fake news".A special counsel is investigating the matter.Wilbur Ross and Donald Trump have known each other for more than a quarter of a century.Mr Ross played a key part in a prepackaged bankruptcy deal - deal agreed between a company and its creditors - for Mr Trump's Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, in the 1990s.Trump biographer David Cay Johnston told BBC Panorama: "If it hadn't been for Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump would not be in the White House.Major client WL Ross & Co, which was founded by Wilbur Ross, first invested in Navigator Holdings in 2011.An investigation has revealed details of how Mr Ross retains a financial interest in Navigator Holdings via a number of companies in the Cayman Islands.Some of these Cayman companies were disclosed by Mr Ross when he became commerce secretary, but under the disclosure rules he did not have to declare his interest in Navigator Holdings.Its annual report in 2016 showed 31.5% was still held by entities in which Mr Ross has a stake, although the value of Mr Ross's personal holding remains unclear.When Trump met Ross Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump at the Taj Mahal casino in 1990 Back in 1990, after a high-profile financial battle, Donald Trump opened his third casino in Atlantic City - the Taj Mahal, dubbed the "eighth wonder of the world".It didn't go well.Mr Trump financed it with $675m raised through junk bonds at an interest rate of 14%.He struggled to make the payments.Step in Wilbur Ross.Then at Rothschild Inc, he was representing the angry bondholders but liked Donald Trump's style.Trump biographer David Cay Johnston said: "Wilbur Ross was a key negotiator in Donald Trump not having to go through bankruptcy and not being swept into the dustbin of history because he saw the value in the Trump name."Mr Ross said at this year's Concordia Annual Summit: "When you meet people who are under tremendous financial pressure... you really get to see what they are made of, and he was made of much stronger stuff than a lot of owners of troubled businesses."One prepackaged bankruptcy later and The Donald was on his way out of debt and heading up the Forbes rich list.Wilbur Ross became a board member of Navigator in 2012 but the commerce department said he was not on the board when Navigator signed its charter deal with Sibur that year.But Mr Ross was still a board member during the period from March to November 2014, when the US was sanctioning Russians over the annexation of Crimea, including Mr Timchenko and Mr Mikhelson's company, Novatek.During that period Navigator continued to increase its business with Sibur.The energy firm accounted for 9.1% of Navigator's total revenues in 2015, compared with 5.3% in 2014, Navigator's own filings show.Mr Ross left Navigator's board in November 2014 but his seat was taken by Ross group partner Wendy Teramoto, who served on it until 2017.Figures from 2016 showed Sibur was still among Navigator's top five clients, predominantly exporting Russian gas to Europe and potentially providing significant income to sanctioned Putin allies.This year, Navigator doubled the fleet it is using on Sibur exports to four.Sibur has provided Navigator with $68m (49m) in revenue since 2014.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ex-US sanctions policy co-ordinator Daniel Fried on dealing with Russians There is no suggestion Mr Ross has violated any rules.But Daniel Fried, who oversaw the introduction of US sanctions against Russia under President Barack Obama, told Panorama that it would be a mistake for any American official to do business with Sibur."I would advise any client who came to me to stay well away from Sibur or anybody else who has been sanctioned or has a relationship with sanctioned individuals... on the grounds, at least, of reputational risk."But Mr Ross appears to have maintained a close relationship with the shipping company.On the night that he was nominated as commerce secretary by President Trump, Mr Ross went to a restaurant in New York where he was congratulated on his promotion by the senior management of Navigator Holdings, Bloomberg reported.Mr Ross reportedly told the CEO of Navigator: "Your interest is aligned to mine.The US economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary."Another key Navigator customer has been PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company.It was targeted by US sanctions this year.The commerce department said Mr Ross had "been generally supportive of the Administration's sanctions of Russian and other entities".The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Paradise Papers: Who is in control of Everton?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: Who is in control of Everton?Questions have been raised in the leaked Paradise Papers about who controls Everton FC and whether Premier League rules have been broken.Farhad Moshiri sold his Arsenal stake in 2016 to buy nearly 50% of Everton.But the leaks suggest his original Arsenal stake was funded by a "gift" from oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who owns 30.4% of Arsenal, raising the question of whether his money is now in Everton.Mr Moshiri strenuously denied the money was a gift.Lawyers acting for him in the Everton deal said any allegation Premier League rules had been violated were wholly false.They say Mr Moshiri is independently wealthy and funded the football investments himself.Mr Usmanov's legal representatives said there were errors in the allegations and that the investigation was a gross intrusion into their client's privacy.Premier League rules state an individual who owns a stake of 10% or more in one club cannot hold a single share in another, to avoid any conflict of interest, including in games between the clubs and in transfers.Officially Mr Usmanov and Mr Moshiri, the oligarch's former accountant, bought a 14.58% stake in Arsenal together in 2007 through an offshore company called Red and White Holdings.But the documents show that all the funds for the purchase of the Arsenal shares came from a firm called Epion Holdings, a company wholly owned by Mr Usmanov, who is currently said to be worth about $15.8bn (12bn).Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Panorama questions Farhad Moshiri on the Everton deal One document reads: "Dividend from Gallagher Holdings to Alisher Usmanov who will then gift the monies to Moshiri who will in turn invest in the company.Funding for Red and White has come from Epion Holdings Limited".Gallagher Holdings is also an Usmanov company.SOURCE DOCUMENT Lawyers acting for Mr Moshiri originally denied that the money had come from Epion.They later admitted the initial funding had come from Epion, but said Mr Moshiri had subsequently paid Mr Usmanov back.Red and White Holdings continued to raise its stake in Arsenal, reaching 30.4%.In February 2016, Mr Moshiri sold his half of the Arsenal shares to the Russian oligarch.A document in the Paradise Papers from Appleby, the firm overseeing due diligence on the deal, confirms the sale was used to raise funds to buy a 49.9% stake in Everton.The reported price was 87.5m.A Russian media company with close links to Mr Usmanov initially reported the Everton deal as "Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov has become the new owner of Everton".The report was soon taken down but suspicions were aroused.The suspicions rose further this January when it was announced Everton's training ground, Finch Farm, was now being sponsored by Mr Usmanov's company, USM Holdings.The training ground has been renamed USM Finch Farm.When BBC Panorama approached Mr Moshiri and asked him whether Mr Usmanov was in control of Everton, he asked: "Are you crazy?Have you seen a psychiatrist?"He said: "If it is a loan, you owe the money back to him.If it is a gift, it is yours.It is neither of them because I paid for it."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ex-FA chairman Greg Dyke on how the Premier League may respond Mr Moshiri later said that all the documents that mentioned a gift were "a mistake".Mr Moshiri's legal representatives said the Premier League had carried out checks, including on its funding, and was satisfied that he had complied with its Owners' and Directors' Test.They also said that Mr Moshiri, who is said by Forbes magazine to be worth $2.4bn, had subsequently provided considerably more finance to Everton.Former FA chairman Greg Dyke told Panorama that a gift "sounds unusual", adding: "If these papers say what you say they say, I feel sure that the Premier League will want to do their own investigations."And shadow culture minister Tom Watson has said he will be writing to the Premier League to urge them to investigate.The outcome of any investigation would depend on what the two men did and what the clubs knew.When asked about the matter, the Premier League said it "would not disclose confidential information about clubs or individuals".The Everton deal was administered by Isle of Man company Bridgewaters Limited.Other documents in the Paradise Papers suggest that Bridgewaters was secretly taken over by Mr Usmanov in 2011.This is strongly denied by Bridgewaters and Mr Usmanov.Blue Heaven Holdings, the company that owns Everton, has its registered office at Bridgewaters and its two directors are an employee of Bridgewaters and an employee of Mr Usmanov's company, USM Holdings.Who is Alisher Usmanov?Image copyright Getty Images Born in Uzbekistan in 1953, Russian citizenship Dubbed the "hard man of Russia",

said: "Our client is not obliged at all to assist you in your enquiries.It is not for him to do your journalists' research which on its face appears to be biased."In May, Mr Usmanov failed in a 1bn bid to buy out major Arsenal shareholder Stan Kroenke, a move that would have left him with about 97% of Arsenal shares.Mr Usmanov is known to be frustrated at his inability to influence Arsenal and has no seat on the board.Both clubs have had their problems on the pitch.Many Arsenal fans have questioned whether manager Arsene Wenger should continue given the recent lack of league titles, while Everton sacked boss Ronald Koeman after a poor start to the season.The teams met at Goodison Park on 22 October, with Arsenal running out 5-2 winners.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents

Paradise Papers: Lord Ashcroft stayed non-dom despite pledges:::::Image copyright EPA Lord Ashcroft remained a non-dom, and continued to avoid tax despite attempts by Parliament to make peers pay their full share, leaked documents reveal.The peer was domiciled for tax purposes in Belize at a time when it was widely believed he had given up the status, the Paradise Papers show.While ordinary Britons have to pay tax on everything they earn, non-doms are only taxed on their UK income.Lord Ashcroft, who donated millions to the Tories, said he would not comment.He said it was because of the way he had been treated by BBC Panorama in the past.But his spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures.When questions were raised about the peer's non-dom status in 2010, he denied any "impropriety or wrongdoing".A former party treasurer and deputy chairman, Lord Ashcroft fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then prime minister.But the 71-year-old remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests and last year said he would start donating "smaller sums" to the party again.$200m payments Parliament tried to force the controversial peer to pay full British tax when he entered the House of Lords in 2000.Lord Ashcroft promised to become a permanent resident in the UK - a change that would have meant giving up his status as a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside of the country.The then leader of the Conservative Party William Hague told Parliament that becoming a peer would "cost him [Lord Ashcroft] and benefit the Treasury tens of millions of pounds a year in tax".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltons questions about his offshore trust The tax was never paid because Lord Ashcroft, who was once Belize's ambassador to the United Nations and maintains links to the central American country, persuaded officials that he should be allowed to become a long term resident of the UK rather than a permanent one.A distinction that allowed him to retain his non-dom status.The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (150m) from his offshore trust in the Bermuda.The Tory Peer continued to sit in the House of Lords and as a non-dom he did not have to pay tax on these payments.'His true domicile' Lord Ashcroft's admission in 2010 that he was still a non-dom led to a major political controversy and the introduction of legislation designed to force anybody who sits in Parliament to pay full British tax.After Lord Ashcroft told the BBC in May 2010 he was going to become "a fully taxed person in Britain", it was widely reported he had given up his non-dom status.The Conservative Party also gave such an indication on 7 July that same year.However, documents seen by the BBC's Panorama, reveal "his true domicile is Belize".Source document The new law, the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, had not specified that non-dom MPs and peers would have to give up the status - only that they be "treated as domiciled in the UK" by the tax authorities.It meant Lord Ashcroft had to pay full British tax while he sat in Parliament, but as soon as he resigned from the House of Lords in March 2015 he was also a non-dom again in the eyes of UK revenue inspectors.No capital gains tax The Paradise Papers suggest Lord Ashcroft worked around the new law to continue avoiding tax on his worldwide income between 2010 and 2015.On the 31 March 2010, the day before the new law came into effect, Lord Ashcroft's offshore trust bought shares worth 33.9m from one of his companies.His advisers note that the deal has "capital gains tax implications" but they point out he is "not domiciled in the UK at the moment".If the deal had happened the following day, he would have been treated differently and could have been liable for capital gains tax.Image copyright PA Image caption Lord Ashcroft with William Hague and Ffion Hague in 2006 While he was sitting in the Lords as a full British taxpayer between 2010 and 2015, Lord Ashcroft appears to have stopped taking payments from his offshore trust.One of his advisers notes "that there is no applicable tax as there is no distributable income".The accounts for the trust show Lord Ashcroft didn't receive any payments in 2011, 2012 or 2013.The accounts for 2014 and 2015 were not in the leaked documents.Lord Ashcroft announced his resignation from the House of Lords in March 2015.A week later, he sold shares worth 11.2m.If he had still been sitting in Parliament, he would have been liable for capital gains tax on any profits from the sale.But Lord Ashcroft was being treated as a non-dom again and could legally avoid the tax.Journalist Peter Oborne says Lord Ashcroft's non-dom status was a "huge issue" at the time he started to sit in the Lords and there was "fresh controversy" when the Tories entered power in 2010.The revelations in the Paradise Papers could cause a "major political explosion," he said."The Labour Party... will turn it into a first class political row.It will raise huge questions about not just the Conservatives [but] also the House of Lords."The Conservative Party did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Paradise Papers: Lord Ashcroft 'ignored rules' on offshore trust:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltons questions about his offshore trust Tory donor Lord Ashcroft ignored rules around the management of his offshore investments, leaked documents suggest.The peer gave assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Punta Gorda Trust in Bermuda in 2000.The Paradise Papers suggests he sometimes made decisions without consulting trust officials.Such action could see the trust challenged by HMRC.Lord Ashcroft said he would not respond because of the way he has been treated by BBC Panorama in the past.Panorama approached Lord Ashcroft during last month's Conservative Party conference in Manchester but he declined to answer any questions about the trust.The 71-year-old former party deputy chairman has given millions of pounds to the Tories.He fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later he co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then prime minister but remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests.Journalist Peter Oborne says Lord Ashcroft has been a "hugely significant figure" in the Conservative Party over the last 20 years.He said: "Lord Ashcroft has been one of the most significant donors to the... party.But it's not just... that he's been a giver of money, he's also been very important organisationally.He's involved himself in the internal politics."Other documents in the Paradise Papers show Lord Ashcroft has secretly remained non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.'Inadequate supervision' The structure of a trust involves one entity legally entrusting a second to look after assets for a third, essentially removing ownership for tax purposes.Wealthy people can legally avoid paying tax on assets that they have given to a trust because they can tell the authorities they no longer own or control the assets in them.But for a trust to work as a tax break, decisions about its assets have to be taken independently by the trustees.A series of leaked emails between trustees and Lord Ashcroft's advisers suggest he was was willing to ignore the rules.Source document Despite the warning, Lord Ashcroft appears to have continued to make decisions about the Trust's assets.In October 2000, one of the trustees says: "I would like to emphasize at this point that it is imperative at all times that the Trustees are aware of any and all transactions to be entered into prior to transactions occurring."To do otherwise, will only serve to undermine the integrity of the Trust as the Trustees are being advised of actions taken in connection with trust assets, which should be under their control, after the event."A review of the trust in 2009, discovered that significant payments out had been made that had not been properly recorded.In an internal email, a lawyer representing the trust says: "There have been very large sums of money involved and I am very concerned that there has been inadequate supervision of both transactions and distributions... to put it bluntly we seem to be told nothing whereas we carry the responsibility of acting as trustee."Source document Paperwork then appears to have been put in place retrospectively "to ensure that we have all the relevant trustee and company authorities in place for the transactions which have occured [sic]".'Red flag' Trust experts say anybody who puts their money into a trust could face a challenge by tax authorities if it was felt rules had been abused.Image copyright Hidefumi Nogami, Asahi Shimbun Image caption Lord Ashcroft's trust was based in Bermuda This could include a challenge from HM Revenue & Customs if it was to take the view an overseas trust had been controlled from the UK.Nicholas Shaxson, the author of Treasure Islands, an expose of the workings of tax havens, told Panorama: "On the evidence I have seen, it looks like something that is abusive behaviour and an abusive structure.If the trustees are worried, the trustees are expressing alarm about that, that's a clear red flag."Professor Brooke Harrington, the author of Capital Without Borders, said: "It's important that trustees be independent because the whole concept of a trust is that a settlor gives over legal ownership of an asset to the trustee."That's why you get these tax benefits and other legal benefits from the trust structure."Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with
