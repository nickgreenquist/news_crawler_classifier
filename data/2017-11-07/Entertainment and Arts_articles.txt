Author Gay Talese tells Kevin Spacey accuser to 'suck it up':::::With the mounting allegations of sexual harassment and predatory behavior against Kevin Spacey, author and journalist Gay Talese had some choice words for the House of Cards stars first accuser.Speaking to media at an event in New York City, Talese was asked for his thoughts on the recent litany of people coming forward to accuse people in Hollywood of sexual harassment.The author of such magazine profiles as Frank Sinatra Has a Cold and The Silent Season of a Hero said hed like to make Spacey his next subject.Spacey has stepped away from acting and is reportedly seeking treatment at an undisclosed location following a BuzzFeed News report in which actor Anthony Rapp came forward and said Spacey made a sexual advance at him when he was just 14 years old.Since then, many men have come forward, including eight people who worked with Spacey on his Netflix series, with similar claims.Amid the controversy, House of Cards suspended production and Netflix is severing ties with its star.I feel so sad, and I hate that actor that ruined this guys career, Talese told Vanity Fair.So, OK, it happened 10 years ago Jesus, suck it up once in a while!The author went on to mention that he would like to ask Spacey about losing his entire career and a lifetime of success and hard work because of something that happened for approximately 10 minutes more than a decade ago.You know something, all of us in this room at one time or another did something were ashamed of.The Dalai Lama has done something hes ashamed of.The Dalai Lama should confess... put that in your magazine!The magazine noted that, in its reporters discussion with Talese, he didnt seem to be aware of the further allegations beyond Rapp.However, it did not confirm what Talese knew or didnt know.
Manhattan DA will reportedly seek indictment against Harvey Weinstein for rape allegations:::::The Manhattan district attorney will seek an indictment against Harvey Weinstein as early as next week ignoring an NYPD plan to immediately slap the movie mogul in cuffs, sources told The Post.Cops had been building a case against the predatory producer for allegedly raping actress Paz de la Huerta twice in 2010.Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said last week the department is sharing information with DA Cy Vances office and the next step would be to obtain an arrest warrant to pick up Weinstein in Arizona, where he is in rehab.There has been bad blood between the two law enforcement arms since each blamed the other for botching a 2015 case against Weinstein based on allegations by an Italian model and the DAs office was irate when police officials last week told the press that they were just waiting on Vance to come through with the warrant, a source said.Vance instead plans on presenting a case to a grand jury first and waiting for an indictment, law enforcement sources said.Were not commenting on the investigation or any timeline, said Manhattan DA spokeswoman Joan Vollero.De la Huerta is just one of dozens of women to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment in recent months, but police believe her case is particularly strong because the alleged rapes happened within the statute of limitations and she can recount both incidents in detail.The Boardwalk Empire star says the producer twice wormed his way into her Tribeca apartment in as many months, then forced himself on her.I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, I dont want to do this.He kept humping me and it was disgusting.Hes like a pig He raped me, she told Vanity Fair.This article originally appeared in Page Six.
Ronan Farrow throws shade at NBC News while revealing 'dark side' of Weinstein-friendly media:::::Ronan Farrow cast more shade on NBC News on Tuesday, launching a Twitter storm that suggested the network sought to shut down his reporting on sex abuses by Harvey Weinstein and even threatened his NBC producer with losing his job.My reporting is only possible because of a group of brave journalists who fought for the story, Farrow tweeted in the first of a 10-message thread that praised the prestigious New Yorker magazine which published his investigations of Weinstein..@RichMcHughNBC, my wonderful producer, refused to bow to pressure to stop, through numerous shoots, even when it meant risking his job, Farrow went on to say in his Twitter storm.Multiple press accounts of NBCs decision to pass on Farrows reporting on Weinstein described the NBC News investigative producer, Rich McHugh, as disappointed that NBC shut down his and Farrows reporting on Weinstein.NBC did not respond to questions about Farrows tweet storm.Farrows latest bombshell report regarding Weinstein was published in The New Yorker on Monday, claiming that Weinstein used a network of Israeli ex-spies and other investigators working in concert with New York super lawyers to try to shut down various journalistic exposs in the works on Weinsteins treatment of women.On Tuesday, the celebrity scion had nothing but praise for his New Yorker editors and fact checker who championed and protected him.Farrows bosses at NBC, by contrast, had told him to take his initial Weinstein bombshell elsewhere, claiming it wasnt good enough for the network.To add insult to injury, Farrow, whose Twitter bio currently describes him as an NBC reporter and Today show correspondent, appeared Tuesday morning on Good Morning America, arch-rival of the Today show, during the crucial November sweeps period.GMA described Farrow as a New Yorker contributor and mentioned NBC only when co-host George Stephanopoulos asked Farrow if Weinstein got to NBC when it decided to spike the original story.I think the story makes it clear [Weinstein and his team] were focusing on everyone trying to get word out about this, Farrow said carefully.NBC News did not respond when asked how it felt about Farrow appearing on its bitter rival.The relationship between Farrow and NBC is almost as confusing as why the network killed the Weinstein story in the first place.NBC News declined comment when Fox News asked if Farrow is still paid or has a freelance relationship with the network.Farrow, who also did not respond to request for clarification, has been very active on the Twitter account that says in its bio that he works at NBC.The former MSNBC host also threw his network under the bus on The Rachel Maddow Show when his first Weinstein article was published last month.Hours after his story was published, he told Maddow that The New Yorker immediately realized his story was reportable and there were multiple determinations that NBC had enough to run it.On Tuesday, Farrow tweeted that New Yorker editor David Remnick saved his story as a rare bastion of journalistic integrity, and digital editor David Rohde was a compassionate, thoughtful and tireless editor on the pair on Weinstein bombshells.As for Farrows reportedly embattled NBC producer, Rich McHugh, NBC News did not immediately respond when asked if McHughs job was actually at risk, or if Farrow is lying.McHugh did not immediately respond to Fox News request for comment.Last month, embattled NBC News President Noah Oppenheim faced public pressure to step down after it was revealed that he killed Farrows long-gestating investigation that would have outed Weinstein as a sexual predator months before the New Yorker published Farrows story.NBC News has denied that Oppenheim has ties to Weinstein, but the NBC News president moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter and the two men recently shared a relatively small table at a swanky media event.This story shows dark side of how media treats powerful men but also reminds us brave people are still defending the truth, Farrow wrote on Tuesday, praising the New Yorker.After Oppenheims NBC spiked Farrows initial report, he eventually took the story to The New Yorker, which is known for its fact checking and high editorial standards.Oppenheim, then under siege, contended during a private NBC News event last month that the incredible story Farrow published in the New Yorker was not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.On Maddow last month, Farrow essentially accused Oppenheim of lying, saying The New Yorker immediately realized his story was reportable and there were multiple determinations that NBC had enough to run it.CNN reported that a source called NBCs decision indefensible and longtime New Yorker media critic Ken Auletta said its a scandal.NBC has strenuously denied that Oppenheim had any conflict of interest.The Weinstein contretemps is the latest embarrassment for NBC News, which a year ago also sat on the notorious Access Hollywood tape of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women to future Today co-host Billy Bush.At the time NBC was sitting on the tape, Oppenheim was overseeing Today.The tape was eventually leaked to the Washington Posts David Fahrenthold, who is Oppenheims friend from prestigious Harvard University.Bush was fired after the tape became public, and Oppenheim was soon thereafter promoted to NBC News president.While some NBC insiders say it may be the best scenario for everyone involved if Oppenheim steps down, another NBC insider told Fox News that powerful NBC News chairman Andy Lack to whom much of NBCs news operations report directly was ultimately responsible for the Weinstein debacle.Lack has been conspicuously silent about the Weinstein story.Meanwhile, the The New York Post has reported that major networks are fighting over signing Farrow, who is reportedly dragging his feet to sign another exclusive deal after his relationship with NBC went sour.Farrow was initially hired by NBC in 2014 to great fanfare as host of a liberal daytime MSNBC show, which was quickly canceled due to poor ratings.He had been largely adrift at NBC for some time until he started working on his Weinstein project.
'Game of Thrones' actress Sophie Turner defends 'Stranger Things' stars in fiery Twitter thread:::::Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner got mad on Monday about the way some paparazzi are treating the cast of the hit show Stranger Things.Turner, who is not a affiliated with the Netflix series, took to Twitter to chastise the way the kids are being stalked by photographers.Turner, who has been in the public eye thanks to her role as Sansa Stark since she was 15-years-old, had a lot to say about adults camping outside the hotels of the cast, which consists mostly of children.Damn seeing fully grown adults wait outside the Stranger Things kids hotels etc, and then abuse them when they dont stop for them Is Super weird A.What adult in their right mind waits for a CHILD outside their hotel and B is then is offended when the CHILD doesnt stop, she wrote in a fiery series of tweets.It doesnt matter if they are an actor they are kids first.Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe Anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.Oh and ps.Imagine.. You, a parent, walking with your 13 year old son/daughter and seeing a fully grown adult pointing their camera phone.. .. at your kid.You would do anything you could to delete that persons photograph, and remove your child from that situation as soon as .. you could.It doesnt matter if that child happens to be an actor and consented to a professional film crew capturing their moves when.. .. in character.. That does NOT mean that this child consented to being followed around with a camera in their face.I dont care if it Comes with the job .It doesnt.And how dare you shun and demean that child when they dont pose for an adult strangers photograph or walk over and talk to them when they.. .. take that NOT CONSENTED FOR photo .Doesnt that go against everything we teach our children anyway?Pshhhh.Some poeple man.As Yahoo Entertainment notes, Turners comments come in the wake of a similar Twitter tirade from Stranger Things actress Shannon Purser, who fired back at someone who called co-star Finn Wolfhard heartless for not stopping for a photo.The users initial comment has since been deleted, but the outlet notes it read: Imagine being 14 and heartless that you cant even stop for your fans who made you famous in the first place!WOW.Okay, no.No actor is under any obligation to stop for anyone.Finn is an incredibly kind human.But hes a human and he needs breaks too, Purser, who played Barb in Season 1 of Stranger Things retorted, launching into her own Twitter thread about the issue.

Miley Cyrus slams Trump, demands gun control after Texas church shooting:::::In the wake of the mass shooting at a church in Texas, Miley Cyrus appears to be fed up and has taken to social media to denounce gun violence, President Trump and the shooter.On Monday, The Voice coach posted an image of text to her Instagram listing the victims of the attack.In her emotional caption, she laments how disgusting such an act is and highlights the shooter as a terrorist and WHITE AMERICAN MAN!She later notes that shes both disgusted and embarrassed by her country for not taking action on gun violence.The post received a lot of attention, prompting the star to write another.In the second one, she calls out Trump and his reaction to the tragedy.I'd like to believe that EVERY person who takes the life of another being is mentally ill, she said, quoting the presidents words.It's hard to conceptualize that a sane human could commit such a hideous crime.BUT I am sorry Donald Trump this absolutely is a GUNS SITUATION.The Wrecking Ball singer went on after the critics of her previous post who noted that the shooters skin color or sex shouldnt matter.Cyrus noted that she believes things like skin color, gender and religion seem to matter when it comes to labeling terrorist activity.DONT START to be all innocent!Gender, race, & religion HAS and continues to matter for all the wrong reasons & that's only the beginning of how backwards this country is!The star ended her Instagram tirade with an attempt to show shes not villainizing white Americans by posting three images of her with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, and two brothers, Braison and Trace, noting that they were a few of her favorite WHITE AMERICAN MALES
Jessica Chastain says anyone ignoring sex abuse problem in Hollywood is 'complicit':::::Jessica Chastain is reminding her social media followers that "X-Men" producer Bryan Singer was once accused of sexual assault.Although the Golden Globe winner has worked with Singer (she's in the upcoming "X-Men: Dark Phoenix"), she said she is unafraid of push-back from her recent tweet about the Hollywood heavyweight."I do not feel beholden to anything.Im going to speak my mind about any injustice that I see.Im not afraid of anything in terms of that," the Golden Globe winner told the Daily Beast."And I think the greatest myth that an industry can create is to make people feel like theyre easily replaceable.Im not going to allow that into my life.The "Molly's Game" star went on Twitter last week with a link to a The Daily Wire story from November 2 that reported on claims against Singer.The Daily Wire piece quoted a source saying, "I guarantee the stories of the young men who say they were raped are true."Chastain, 40, also expounded on the state of Hollywood in the wake of sexual harassment and assault allegations against a raft of entertainment power players including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Roy Price, and Brett Ratner, among others."I know its devastating, its terrible, its heartbreaking.These stories that are coming out are just so sad.But what makes me hopeful is that people are taking responsibility for their silence, their inaction," she said.In no way should we, as a society, look at the victims and show any sense of blame.But anyone involved in an industry where there is abuse like this, you are part of the problem.And your inaction makes you complicit.The A-lister has been outspoken about harassment and sexual misconduct in the film industry since the Weinstein scandal broke last month.But Chastain said she was once warned by an unidentified male director to not talk about women's issues so much.Chastain said to American Way Magazine, "I had one male director say to me that I talk too much about all of this women stuff.This is a person I love, and maybe he was concerned I would hurt my career.Im not attacking anyone.Im trying to create more inclusiveness, compassion and empathy which in turn makes better movies, better art.
Weinstein allegedly paid 'army' of investigators, ex-Mossad agents to keep actresses, journalists from revealing predatory behavior:::::Journalist Ronan Farrow, who wrote the initial expos on now-disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for The New Yorker, has published a new piece with some shocking allegations.According to his report, Weinstein spent more than a year using private investigators to track actresses and journalists in an effort to stop his predatory behavior from going public.The New Yorker article alleges that Weinstein hired firms like Black Cube, which is largely made up of former officers from Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies, to look into women who could potentially go on the record about his sexual harassment and assault -- and to look into journalists working on similar stories, including Farrow himself.The goal: to target and suppress anyone who might come forward to ruin Weinstein's reputation, according to the report.A representative for Weinstein denied to the outlet that anyone was targeted or suppressed at any time.Reps for Weinstein did not respond to Fox News when reached for comment.Two private investigators from Black Cube reportedly got information from actress Rose McGowan, who has been an outspoken critic of Weinstein and has publicly accused him of rape since exposs from The New York Times and The New Yorker were published in which many women came forward to tell their respective stories about Weinsteins predatory nature.In addition, Farrow's new report revealed that Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer among other magazines, offered to share material a reporter had dug up which could have disproven McGowan's rape allegations.He later reportedly told Weinstein, I have something AMAZING, referring to audio from an off-the-record phone call between the reporter and Elizabeth Avellan, the ex-wife of director Robert Rodriguez, who had a relationship with McGowan.Avellan told The New Yorker she never would have approved of trying to discredit McGowan.I dont want to shame people.Howard responded to the magazine by saying his work for Weinstein was separate from his work as a journalist.I always separated those two roles carefully and completelyand resisted Mr. Weinsteins repeated efforts to have AMI titles publish favorable stories about him or negative articles about his accusers.He also said AMI had a now-terminated TV production agreement with Weinstein.American Media Inc. did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.McGowan also reportedly was approached by an operative using a false name and credentials to talk with her about womens rights issues in the workplace.In reality, she wanted to know if McGowan had spoken with any journalists and whether the actress would go on the record about her experience with Weinstein, according to the report.Not realizing that she was speaking to an operative, the Scream star reportedly met with the woman, and another operative who approached her at a later date, many times.The story revealed that countless documents and audio recordings were provided to the 65-year-old studio head with information not only on actresses he allegedly assaulted, but journalists as well.The outlet cites seven people directly involved with the effort as well as dozens of pages of documents it unearthed as its sources for the new allegations against Weinstein.Psychological profiles allegedly were created including information of past relationships, sexual histories and evidence of positive encounters between Weinstein and his potential accusers that could later be used to discredit the women if they came forward, which many did.Also named in the story is Weinsteins lawyer, David Boies, who admitted to working with Weinstein and these agencies to stop the New York Times story from being published, despite his law firm representing the Times in a libel case at the time.In October 2016, he allegedly wired Black Cube the first hundred thousand dollars of an alleged $600,000 invoice.Its unclear how much of that total invoice was paid, but bonuses reportedly were offered if the company could stop any article from being published.Although he vigorously denies using physical force, Mr. Weinstein has himself recognized that his contact with women was indefensible and incredibly hurtful, Boies told Farrow.In retrospect, I knew enough in 2015 that I believe I should have been on notice of a problem, and done something about it.I dont know what, if anything, happened after 2015, but to the extent it did, I think I have some responsibility.I also think that if people had taken action earlier it would have been better for Mr. Weinstein.In a statement to Fox News, Boies, who previously argued for marriage equality at the Supreme Court and represented Al Gore in the disputed 2000 election, noted that he told Weinstein that neither he nor his firm would represent him against potential allegations of rape.He also made sure to warn him that he likely couldn't stop The New York Times story through "threats or influence."However, he believed at the time that Mr. Weinstein was merely trying to take proactive steps to prove his innocence on the matter of a rape allegation."While I told Mr. Weinstein that I was not in a position to represent him on these issues, his request to contract with investigators seemed at the time, like a reasonable accommodation for a longtime client," Boies told Fox News."I regret having done this.It was a mistake to contract with, and pay on behalf of a client, investigators who we did not select and did not control.It was not thought through, and that was my mistake.I take responsibility for that."After a fan told McGowan that the latest New Yorker piece should be made into a film, the actress responded: I do not need to do a film.I am the film.
At the Met Opera, a Note So High, It’s Never Been Sung Before:::::Advertisement At the Met Opera, a Note So High, Its Never Been Sung Before Image Audrey Luna, with (background, from left) John Tomlinson, Frdric Antoun and David Adam Moore in The Exterminating Angel at the Metropolitan Opera.Credit Emon Hassan for The New York Times It lasts just a split second, almost imperceptible in a two-hour score.Its over too quickly to summon the dogs of the Upper West Side or to break any nearby windows.But brief as it is, the A above high C that the soprano Audrey Luna reaches in Thomas Adss new opera, The Exterminating Angel, is so high, it has never been sung in the 137-year history of the Metropolitan Opera.Video Watch soprano Audrey Luna hit the highest note in the history of the Met with the help of assistant conductor Bryan Wagorn.High C has been hit by the thousands .Ds and Es, too, are rousing but not uncommon.Fs have been rarer, and Gs and A flats rarer still.But a high A a combination of genetic gifts, rigorous training and psychological discipline over two fragile vocal cords is monumental, and unprecedented at the Met, according to its archivists.Theres a particular thrill about that high coloratura range, Mr. Ads said in a phone interview.When I hear the conventional high C of a soprano, I want to say, Show us what else youve got.As he planned the new opera, he approached Ms. Luna, who had already ventured to a high G as the sprite Ariel in Mr. Adss adaptation of The Tempest at the Met in 2012 .Ive practiced up to a C above high C in the past, she said in an interview in her dressing room.So I know its in me.But its just nothing Ive performed on any stage before.When I saw Ariel the first time, it was like a dare, she added, referring to the Tempest score.And this is a double-dog dare.In The Exterminating Angel, based on the 1962 Luis Buuel film , Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening.The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.The note, Mr. Ads said, the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score.Unlike in other high-flying parts the imperious Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute, the spunky Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, the long-suffering title role in Lucia di Lammermoor theres little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before shes even visible onstage.(She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)Its a moment of arrival, Mr. Ads said.It had to be on this note.Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school just because it was fun, she said.And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses.It just gave me a high.It still gives me a high.Image Ms. Luna with Joseph Kaiser, left, and Frdric Antoun in The Exterminating Angel.Credit Emon Hassan for The New York Times Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless.Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Lunas tone is full.She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the Wagnerian coloratura spectacle that is her final Exterminating Angel aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F. Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres.A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in Lucia di Lammermoor; its no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Lunas character performs just before the dinner party at the start of The Exterminating Angel.Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908.The review in The New York Times praised her flutelike Santos-Dumont notes, comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from Lucia sung, at her Met debut in 1931, in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto, according to The New York Post.At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenets Manon, hit a G, known as her Eiffel Tower note.Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.Mado Robin sings B flat over high C Credit Video by operabeauty More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear Gs as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbachs Les Contes dHoffmann.Just this fall, Erin Morleys Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks.Theres no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff, said Peter Clark, the Mets archivist, who remembers hearing Ponss F on a radio broadcast as a child.So its not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didnt happen.But I doubt that it wouldnt be mentioned somewhere.The Exterminating Angel isnt the first time Mr. Ads has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was The Tempest.In fact, one of his very first works, Five Eliot Landscapes for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.Five Eliot Landscapes Op.1: V. Cape Ann Credit Video by Thomas Ads - Topic Its a certain amount of useful cruelty involved, he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself.Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.Callow or not, hes still at it.Mr. Ads said that in the score of The Tempest, which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G. Now, more than a decade later, the score of The Exterminating Angel has a high B in brackets yet another seemingly impossible note, waiting patiently for a soprano who can crack yet another music-stave ceiling.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Reaching a New High At the Met Opera Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Review: The Big Apple Circus Is Ripe for Another Bite:::::A year ago, the Big Apple shrank a little.Big Apple Circus, which opened in 1977, had amassed more than $8 million in debt and did not produce a fall show.A crowdfunding campaign sputtered, and the circus filed for bankruptcy.But after a successful auction, Big Apple Circus has returned to Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center with its, well, core sensibilities intact.Big Apple Circus has switched from nonprofit to for-profit, but on a Saturday this month, the big top looked more or less the same.The souvenir stand had stayed modest; the portable toilets were unimproved.Concessions were of the chips-popcorn-churro variety, though the Dippin Dots came in a glowing cup, which seemed troubling.There was also a small booth selling beer and wine, where a few of the parents had lined up.At 11 a.m., some people find the circus taxing.Inside were plenty of familiar faces, both in the ring and behind the scenes.Big Apple has retained the director Mark Lonergan, the music director Rob Slowik, the writer and clown Joel Jeske and Barry Lubin, a rubber-faced pro who plays Grandma, a housecoat-clad clown who is ardently and inexplicably beloved.(Well, its probably more explicable if you like clowns.And flatulence jokes.)
David Hallberg’s Tell All (About His Own Psyche):::::He did, thanks to a 14-month stint with the physical therapy team at the Australian Ballet in Melbourne.There he retreated into a monastic routine of daily physical therapy and exercise, relearning the fundamentals of ballet technique and how to use his body.Mr. Hallberg offers a detailed and moving account of this period at the end of his book, describing the solitude and depression that went alongside the physical work.You are worth nothing anymore, he writes in an account of his persistent internal monologue at that time.Look at where you were and look at you now.You did this to yourself, thinking you were invincible.The thoughts continue.Its over.Youve ruined your body.Your ego killed you.Rotted you.Mr. Hallberg was just as unsparing during the interview.When I started writing, I was riding high, life was fast and furious, he said.The ego was rife.At one point when I reread, post-injury, what I had written, I was shocked.Photo But he said the reality of his injury initially a frayed deltoid ankle ligament, then a mass of complications made him ask more urgent questions: What was the calling of the artist, and how do you live up to that responsibility?A Body of Work may be unsparing, but it is not gossipy.I didnt write the book to give the reader an insider view of how other people acted behind closed doors, Mr. Hallberg said.The only tell-all aspect of the book is within my own psyche.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The book, which he said took five years to write, is partly a conventional life story.It recounts his upbringing in a typical suburban household in Minneapolis; his discovery of, and passion for, dance as a child; the ostracism and bullying he encountered growing up; and his parents calm acceptance of his homosexuality.Mr. Hallberg is relentlessly ambitious throughout: He must join Ballet Theater; he must become a soloist, then a principal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It always seemed to me, if I can just get that, it will be my dream come true, a never-ending cycle of desires, he said.His book offers an inside look at that cycle: the endless hours of rehearsal, the preparation that informs the tiniest of details, the constant traveling, the brief thrill of performance.Mr. Hallberg also describes living in Moscow and working with the Bolshoi, but says little about being a gay man in Russia, writing only that it was a nonissue.I was never discriminated against; I never felt in danger, he said.He is similarly discreet about his colleagues, writing about them with respect and, usually, affection.(The only difficult relationship he details is with Michele Wiles, with whom he was frequently partnered early in his career.)Photo Mr. Hallberg said he first began to write about his travels and professional encounters around 2008.(Full disclosure: I am credited in the books acknowledgments for suggesting he do this.)But it wasnt until the publisher contacted him in 2012 that he thought about writing a memoir.After his injury, the material took shape.I was losing control of my art form and my life, he said, and it eventually became clear that this would be the backbone of the book.Mr. Hallbergs account of his decision to go the Paris Opera Ballet School in his senior year of high school is one of the most striking parts of A Body of Work.He endured a year of cool disdain from his French classmates, but never questioned his choice.Strangely, what I most enjoyed writing about were these very raw experiences, he said.Falling in love with my childhood friend, the Paris Opera school, the stress and pressure of going to the Bolshoi.And the injury.The more difficult the experience, the easier it was to write about it.The memoir suggests a pattern of risk, adventure and solitude.When he finally made the decision to go to Australia, he cut off from everyone, said Dianna Mesion, a close friend.I think it was a safe space for him; there was only so much he could do to hold up his public face in New York.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Hallberg is a dance world celebrity, a subject of intense critical acclaim and scrutiny.As one of the most visible figures in the ballet world, the stakes for David were unique, Sascha Radetsky, a Ballet Theater ballet master, said in an email.He was in a dark place during his injury, and solitude and distance seemed to help guide him out of it.Since returning to the stage, Mr. Hallberg has become a resident international guest artist at the Australian Ballet; created roles in pieces by Alexei Ratmansky and Mr. Millepied; and worked with the choreographer Mark Morris.But he is pacing himself, he said, only too aware of how a feeling of invincibility, and an insatiable drive to do it all, led to injury and despair.He is also, he added, less judgmental about his own work.I still have the same love of work and critique, he said.But I know now that even if it isnt perfect, the next time will be better.
Pamela Adlon: The First Time I Ever Tried a Tampon:::::But I was skeptical when I went to the beach wearing a pad for the first time.It felt like a whole big bundle of a situation between my legs.Like oh, God.Yes.Ill say it, my worst fear: a diaper.It reminded me of the nasty playground lady at elementary school who teased me mercilessly by calling me Pampers.Not the best thing to call a very short person.I hated her.I went swimming and when I came out of the water, it felt like half of the ocean had been absorbed into my pad.I realized that maybe those ladies in the commercials were having me on.Later, I realized that I was actually seeing ads for tampons, which were not offered to me by my mother.She had told me I shouldnt use them.Not until I was older.We didnt discuss them.These were not an option for me.A few years later my friend Sherry invited me to join her and her mom in Palm Springs.Before we got to her place we went to the supermarket and loaded up on all kinds of goodies and junk food.This was a first.I never got to buy stuff like that.Im guessing her mom was around?But I felt like it was just the two of us heading to our own place in the desert.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sherry had a pool.I had my period.I was 16 and had been having it for four years.(I mean once a month, not constantly).Of course, we had been planning to spend the whole day in the pool.So when I told her I wasnt going to swim and why she looked at me like I was crazy.Sherry grabbed me by the hand and took me into the womb of this beautiful, white, creamy chic apartment in the desert, held up a tampon, and said: Pammy.Are you serious?!!!You put this in.Right now.Are you kidding me?This will help you.Im about to change your life.This is the end and the beginning.(I do believe Im paraphrasing here but its my memory and its special and I am grateful to Sherry forever for it).I was afraid to put the tampon in.In fact, I was convinced it wouldnt go in.That I was the one woman on the planet who didnt have the right equipment.But it worked.We went swimming.And my life was better after that.Now, I had a new feeling.That it was kind of cool that I had a period at all.My body had an ability to work like this.To go through cycles.And do a thing that women get to do.I felt like I was a part of something bigger.In life.And I didnt have to suffer.And I could go swimming without leaving a trail of chum for the sharks anytime I wanted.(Update: Now I never swim, and I think I have about four periods left.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story Addendum: O.K.So now.Im a mother to three girls.And here I go in the opposite direction of my own childhood experience.Hey, girls.Grab a mirror and explore yourself.Want to have a talk about sex?Anything?What kind of razors do you want?Mach3?Thats the kind Mommy uses.You have a boyfriend now so Im not saying you are sexually active but regardless, I made you an appointment at the lady-parts doctor.All to be met with a pillow or hand held up in front of their faces followed by an, Ew.Stop, Mom!I got this!Ill ask my sister.And now I realize that if my mom had ever said anything to me about my vagina, I would have thrown her out the window.I mean, I cant even take it if she touches my hair.So the moral of the story is, look to your sisters and your friends.Leave your mom out of it.
Forsaking the Punk Clubs of His Youth for a Well-Stocked Library:::::Photo Its hard to imagine too many other punk rock musicians being taken seriously when they cite as equal inspirations the Kingsmens three-chord garage stomp Louie Louie and 19th-century French poetry.But Richard Hell has always thrived on intellectual contradictions, bitterly dismissing the countercultural ideals of the 1960s just before singing a heartfelt Creedence Clearwater Revival cover, as heard to memorable effect on his 1977 album with his band the Voidoids, Blank Generation.The record receives the deluxe 40th anniversary reissue treatment this month, a testament to the enduring power of its songs as well as the iconography that Mr. Hell created himself (better known to Warner Musics accountants as Mr. Meyers).T-shirts featuring Mr. Hells spiky-haired visage are ubiquitous in fashion circles; the contemporary art world seems similarly besotted, with a whos who from Nicole Eisenman to Christopher Wool invoking him in their work.Still, Voidoids fans shouldnt expect a reunion tour.Sitting inside the East Village apartment where hes lived since 1975, Mr. Hell, now 68, explained that his music career was over.It was really a challenge to find a way to make my singing effective, since I can barely carry a tune, he said matter-of-factly.Leaving the punk scene behind was partly an act of self-preservation (Theres the danger of drugs, which is an issue with me a subject compellingly detailed in his 2013 memoir, I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp) and partly a return to his first love.Photo Id come to New York when I was 17 with the idea of being a poet, he recalled of his arrival in 1967, having dropped out of high school in Kentucky.He found himself gravitating toward the writers of The Mimeo Revolution, an early 60s loose network of poets including San Franciscos Jack Spicer, Clevelands d.a.levy, and most formatively on Mr. Hell, New Yorks Ted Berrigan, who all sidestepped the commercial publishing milieu to design their own handmade books on mimeograph machines.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon enough, Mr. Hell was hand-cranking his own press, producing a literary magazine, Genesis : Grasp, and then books of poetry by Andrew Wylie and Theresa Stern, a pseudonym for his collaboration with his future Television bandmate Tom Verlaine (copies of which now fetch $2,500).Mr. Hells 1973 detour into music was borne out of frustration over not finding a mass audience and deciding to explore an alternate path to one.Though hed never previously played a note of music, or even sung publicly, he bought a bass guitar and began composing lyrics.As obnoxious and pretentious as it sounds, I wanted to influence the culture, he said.Youre not going to do that with poetry.Allen Ginsberg did it, but it happens once, maybe twice a century.
Louvre Abu Dhabi, a Cultural Cornerstone Where East Meets West:::::The bounty is evident for many of the 13 French museums in the consortium.The Fontainebleau castle is lending a giant 16th-century bronze, the Apollon du Belvdre.In turn, it is receiving a check for about $5.8 million that it will invest in the restoration of its own Imperial Theater, which will be renamed for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates.The Muse de Cluny, which is lending a jeweled 13th-century box, is funding half of an $8.8 million renovation of its reception area with money from the Louvre Abu Dhabi project..A small part of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is dedicated to contemporary and modern art.The rest focuses on telling the story of world histories and religions, with an emphasis on mixing works from different places.Photo Beyond loans, the team of six curators have been scouting for art from private collections.They have acquired more than 600 works, including Piet Mondrians 1922 Composition With Blue, Red, Yellow and Black, bought in 2009 for $27.9 million from Christies auction of the collection of Yves St. Laurent and Pierre Berg.Another important purchase was a Renaissance painting of the Madonna and Child by Giovanni Bellini, which museum officials say demonstrates a commitment to highlighting works that reflect different religions.What is the Louvre Abu Dhabi?Its a narrative of humankind from the beginning of knowledge, using art as a witness of the times, said Jean-Franois Charnier, the projects chief curator and scientific director for Agence France-Museums.Photo Some museum curators feared the Louvre Abu Dhabis buying spree could send global art prices surging.But Jean-Patrice Marandel, a curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said the new museum has not affected the market at all.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It does not have an image yet or a brand or a flavor, he added.A constant question for the new museum is how bold it will be.Ms. des Cars, who as former director of acquisitions had placed the winning bid for the Mondrian painting at an auction, insisted that cultural officials here have taken some daring positions dealing with religion and nudity.Mr. Mubarak took pains in an interview to praise the beauty of a newly acquired Yemeni Torah.It will be exhibited with a sixth-century Quran and gothic Bible.The museum commissioned a new piece by the American artist Jenny Holzer, who carved three stone walls with historic scripts in cuneiform, Arabic and French, drawing from a Sumerian Creation Myth and an essay on self-determination by Michel de Montaigne, the Renaissance philosopher.Photo I had to have the content reviewed, but no one said no, she said, when asked if there were any restrictions.She hopes to create an app for museum visitors to pick their own creation myths to project on the stone walls.Abu Dhabi officials are already preparing for the future.Mr. Mubarak predicted that the Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a domino effect and that the construction contract for the long-planned Guggenheim Abu Dhabi could be awarded next year.(A Guggenheim spokesman declined to comment.)In the meantime, Jean-Luc Martinez, the director of the Louvre Museum, said the project has already had a dramatic effect in France.Thanks to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, our museums were forced to work together after 50 years of development.We have some egos, he added, with Gallic understatement.Thats a revolution in mentality.
Sex, Drugs and Crime in the Gritty Drama ‘Babylon Berlin’:::::The complicated plot encompasses a Russian freight train carrying poison gas and gold; secret military maneuvers; and a brutal May Day confrontation between police and Communists.There are Soviet agents and Trotskyist agitators, a cross-dressing jazz singer, an Armenian mafia boss and a rich industrialist in cahoots with a group of army officers.The star of the show, however, is Berlin.The lavish production lovingly recreates the citys 1920s streets, cafes and nightclubs.Around 70 percent of the series was shot on location, with the rest filmed on a massive set at the historic Babelsberg studios.Costing 38 million euros (about $44 million) to produce, the 180-day shoot involved three crews and three writer/directors: Tom Tykwer (of Perfume and Run Lola Run fame), Achim von Borries and Henk Handloegten, who had all long sought to work together on a project based on this period.Photo The three of us had the idea to do a big panoramic view of the society at the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic, before we actually knew the novels, Mr. Handloegten said.Paul Cooke, professor of world cinemas at the University of Leeds, said TV depictions of this period have been rare.Most obviously, Fassbinders Berlin Alexanderplatz, which was a big hit in the 1970s, he said.Its touched on in Edgar Reitzs Heimat, which was a huge international hit.But its later periods of history that tend to be the focus of German productions that do well internationally.The makers of Babylon Berlin, however, were interested in exploring the prelude to the Third Reich.All these people didnt fall from the sky as Nazis, Mr. Handloegten said.They had to become Nazis.In writing the screenplay, the creators made some key changes to the books.As well as expanding the political elements, they turned Gereon Rath into a more sympathetic character, traumatized by his experiences in World War I, prone to fits of shaking and addicted to morphine.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Charlotte Ritter is no longer a bourgeois law student but a street-smart working-class woman.We felt very strongly that we should have a main character from this proletarian background, because Berlin was always a poor city, Mr. Handloegten explained.Work has already begun on Season 3, and theres plenty more source material to draw on.Mr. Kutscher has already written six Gereon Rath novels and plans another three, culminating with Kristallnacht in 1938.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The TV adaptation is already a commercial and critical hit at home.Within a week of its German premiere on Oct. 13, the first episode had been watched by 1.2 million people a German viewing figure bested only by Game of Thrones.The show is epic, the story is complex, the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel wrote.The TV version gives the material what it requires while never taking away the striking images, ambiguous characters and exciting story: everything needed to suck you in.The weekly magazine Der Spiegel described the show as a masterpiece and a great, dizzying panorama, and predicted that it could be the first big German TV production since Das Boot to have really relevant success abroad.Photo The praise, however, has not been universal.The Munich-based daily Sddeutsche Zeitung said: The period it depicts may have been sensuous, but the show is not.The world of Babylon Berlin remains behind glass.In Britain, the reception has been positive so far.Its all wonderfully gripping, and Bruch has the most pained, expressive eyes youll see all year, the critic for The Financial Times wrote.With the arrival of Charlotte drab secretary by day, jazz baby by night, we enter the youthful Berlin of dance crazes and desperate excess.Some critics have also drawn parallels to current political events, like the American election of Donald J. Trump, the Brexit vote, and the arrival of the far-right Alternative for Germany in the Bundestag.The echoes of the populism of the 1930s with what is going on right now is certainly a link that is being made, Professor Cooke said.How far this is played out in the show itself remains to be seen.But it is fair to say that these kinds of historical dramas always tend to use the past as a cipher for the present.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Hajo Funke, professor of political science at the Free University Berlin, cautions against making too many comparisons.Economically, socially and politically, it was a totally different situation, he said.In 1929, there was a brief phase of stability after the terrible shock at the end of World War I, the inflation crisis, the economic restrictions, Professor Funke added.It was not at all clear if it would be possible to overcome the next crisis.At the same time, he agrees that the show taps into the current mood.It could serve to point to the dangers, to the destructive forces in society and politics, he said.For the makers of Babylon Berlin, it was crucial that the audience experience the past through the eyes of the protagonists.In the first season, for example, Hitler is only mentioned once in passing.After all, Berlin was a left-wing bastion, and in the 1928 election, the Nazis got only 1.6 percent of the citys votes.In 1929, there were no Nazis in Berlin, said the producer Stefan Arndt.You cannot see or even smell that theres danger coming.
Review: A Triple Bill at the Royal Ballet Comes Up Two-Thirds Short:::::LONDON So whats ballet?Three internationally renowned choreographers provide quite dissimilar answers in the Royal Ballets new triple bill at Covent Garden.Ballet is about sensuous dancing to music (says Twyla Tharp, in The Illustrated Farewell, a world premiere to Haydns Farewell Symphony, No.45 in F sharp minor, which incorporates her As Time Goes By, first made in 1973 for the Joffrey Ballet).Ballet is about telling an exciting story (says Arthur Pita, in The Wind, the world premiere of a staging of Dorothy Scarboroughs 1925 novel later memorably adapted as a 1928 silent film directed by Victor Sjstrm and starring Lilian Gish here set to a commissioned score by Frank Moon).Ballet is about moody atmosphere, theatrical effects and quasi-military regimentation (says Hofesh Shechter, in Untouchable, created for the Royal in 2015 to a score composed by Mr. Shechter and Nell Catchpole).Each of those three answers has proved perfectly valid in other ballets.These three works, however, are all problematic at best.The evening not only grows worse as it proceeds, it grows more tiresome and foolish.But it starts with The Illustrated Farewell, which has several sequences some extended, some fleeting in which Ms. Tharp reminds the London audience that she is as sophisticated a choreographer as any alive today.Her vocabulary is eclectic and large, her grammar arrestingly idiosyncratic, her skill at group organization often superlative.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tharp here turns the first two movements of the Farewell Symphony into a long, demanding, complex pas de deux for Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae.This looks entirely Tharpian; the traditional lexicon of ballet is seamlessly extended with slides on flat feet, boogying moves, through-the-body shimmies and vertiginous plunges.Dancing occurs to both silence and music, as if the dancers were attuned to a larger score than the one we hear.When Mr. McRae, back turned to us, does a sideways ripple passing left to right through arms and torso, hes showing us how Ms. Tharp can even include the style of the Royal Ballets founder-choreographer Frederick Ashton and make that look Tharpian too.

Meek Mill’s Lawyer Says Judge Showed ‘Enormous Bias’ in Sentencing:::::Photo A lawyer for the rapper Meek Mill has accused a Philadelphia judge of inappropriate and vindictive behavior toward his client after she sentenced the rapper this week to two to four years in prison for probation violations.Judge Genece E. Brinkley, who has overseen Meek Mills case since he was known by his given name, Robert Rahmeek Williams, scolded the rapper in court on Monday for the violations, which stemmed from a 2008 conviction.I gave you break after break, and you basically just thumbed your nose at this court, she said.The rapper, a 30-year-old Philadelphia native, was convicted in 2008 on charges related to the possession of guns and drugs, and served eight months in prison.He was then placed on probation for five years, a period that has been extended several times.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.The violations include two arrests in the past year, the first for a fight at a St. Louis airport and the second for reckless driving while filming a music video in New York City.Charges were dropped in the first case and the rapper took a dismissal deal in the second.The judge also cited the rappers repeated scheduling of concerts in areas where she had barred him from performing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a phone interview Tuesday, a lawyer for Meek Mill, Joe Tacopina, said that Judge Brinkley had behaved inappropriately over the course of the case, saying, for example, that the judge had requested that the rapper include her name in a song and had given him unsolicited advice on who should manage him.
In an Age of Fake News, a Historian of the Hoax:::::Bunk traces a lineage of lies through time.It begins in the 18th century, with Shakespeare forgers and travel liars; makes its way through the 19th, with P. T. Barnum as a kind of ringmaster/hoaxmaster (among whose incredible acts was Joice Heth, a black woman whom he purported had been George Washingtons nursemaid which would have made her, in Barnums time, 161 years old); and wends through the false memoirs and fake personae of the 20th and 21st.(In Mr. Youngs taxonomy the hoax, unlike a lie, a conspiracy theory or an urban legend, flirts with and delights in the possibility of discovery, at least in its early iterations.)What the hoax returns to, both underpinning and undermining, Mr. Young found, is race.I had a hunch that they would often deal with race, Mr. Young said, but he was struck how often the hoaxes he found came back to the subject.The hoax lays bare both prejudice (as did Barnums exhibiting of a black man as What Is It?, the missing link) and pilfering (as in the case of Rachel Dolezal, the former N.A.A.C.P.chapter president who had been living as a black woman until she was outed, in 2015, as white).Mr. Youngs earlier book, The Grey Album, looked at the generative power of storytelling, but Bunk takes a bleaker view.The progression of the hoax, as Mr. Young describes it, is one from honor to horror.Early hoaxes validated: a young poet tracing a false genealogy between himself and the greats; Joice Heth providing a direct line between her 19th-century spectators and the father of the country.By the late 20th century, the hoax had turned grim: Mr. Young points to hoaxes like false Holocaust or Benghazi memoirs or even, in his view, Dylann Roof, the Charleston, S.C., shooter, whom Mr. Young sees as acting out in the service of a hoax the hoax that is racism, in Mr. Youngs view that perceives blackness, and black people, as a threat.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In its proximity to violence and its ever-more-accessible transmission via the internet, the hoax has metastasized, the stakes raised ever higher in what Mr. Young calls our Age of Euphemism, when fake news is a rallying cry for any unwelcome report.In a way, the book is a prehistory to Trump, said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker.Donald Trump didnt invent he used a word he acknowledged would be unpublishable in The Times but he has certainly upped the ante.The more Mr. Young researched, the more dire todays hoaxers and hoaxes seem.The modern hoaxs tragic qualities have overcome whatever triumph the hoax once tried for, Mr. Young said.We have more, and worse.Theyre worse in their damage and in their intent now.And to see that, and be proven right, or prescient, is a kind of hollow victory.The book ends on a raw note: The half-hoax world seems in no danger of ending unless its to give way to the complete-hoax one.But asked if he felt any compulsion to begin Volume II, Mr. Young was succinct: I dont.He has, in any case, other responsibilities at the moment.There is the Schomburg, fresh from a two-year, $22.3 million renovation; he arrived there last fall from Atlanta, where he had been a professor and curator at Emory University.As director, Mr. Young oversees the collections and programming, which include exhibitions and regular community events.There is his next poetry collection, Brown, which arrives in April.And now there is The New Yorker, one of the rare mainstream publications that still publishes poetry, where he will be tasked with selecting and editing the poems that appear each week.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The poetry world can be insular, Balkanized and obscure name three star poets and The New Yorker is one of the largest conduits between its various inlets and a wider world than most of the poetry journals can hope to attract.People who are not habitual poetry readers happening to read things that are magical is one of the great happy accidents that can occur reading The New Yorker, said Mr. Remnick.Kevin will be a master of those happy accidents.As it happens, The New Yorker had some hand in Mr. Youngs development as a poet.As a young teenager in Topeka, Kan., where he spent part of his youth, Mr. Young discovered the yellow-covered paperback The New Yorker Book of Poems.I carried that thing around with me, he said.I recently found my edition it has little checks next to poems I liked.(One of them, James Dickeys Falling, introduced Mr. Young to the idea that his own state could have a place in poetry.)Mr. Young wrote poems of his own from the age of 13, through high school and Harvard, where friends remembered him as an ambitious and driven writer, collecting prizes, the Stegner Fellowship and praise.He published his first book, Most Way Home, after it was selected by Lucille Clifton for the National Poetry Series.(He would later edit her collected poems.)He always knew what he wanted to do, said Mr. Whitehead, a friend since college.When most people were dabbling, he was working.He was well on his way when most of us were listening to Nirvana and wearing dirty clothes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Remnick praised Mr. Youngs catholic with a small c taste, something he said he shared with the magazines outgoing poetry editor, Paul Muldoon.And Mr. Young, whose first poem in the magazine, Langston Hughes, was published in 1999, said he would work to spotlight the wide breadth of American poetry, from its establishment lions to emerging voices.(Of recent note, he said, were Tiana Clark and Kaveh Akbar, both published in the magazine by Mr.Muldoon.)Its an exciting moment, in black poetry and poetry in general, he said.Im really looking forward to that being in the pages.O.K., but what kind of poems speak to you?I mean, good ones, Mr. Young said, and chuckled.I think I go with the Duke Ellington view on music.He said, Theres two kinds of music theres good music, and then theres the other kind.Mr. Young is held to be a champion of the good kind.I cant think of a better person to be the curator of what poetry people should be reading than Kevin, said Ms. Trethewey, who first met him 20-some years ago as fellow members of the Dark Room Collective, a community of black poets.I call him The Kevin Young.I started calling him that when we first met.Hes certainly grown into it.
Review: When La Catrina Met Giselle:::::Photo La Catrina, the skeleton lady of the Mexican Day of the Dead celebrations, began life as satire.An etching of a skeleton wearing a fancy French hat sent up the pretensions of rich Mexicans who tried to pass for European.Dia de los Muertos, the show that the Calpulli Mexican Dance Company presented at Town Hall on Saturday, might seem to have a similar anxiety about the worth of Mexican culture in relation to that of Europes.It takes Mexican folklore and the folk dance that is the specialty of this large-spirited, Queens-based troupe and crosses them with French ballet.Here, the music of Mictln, the Aztec underworld, comes from the 19th-century French ballet Giselle and is played live, in a Mexican-styled arrangement, by George Senzs capable band.Roberto Lara, Calpullis choreographer in residence, dances the character of La Catrina, the queen of Mictln, in a many-layered floral skirt, skull makeup and pointe shoes.Mr. Lara has performed in the past with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, the all-male dance company famous for its loving parodies of old-fashioned ballets.But Dia de los Muertos is entirely in earnest, expressing a love for Romantic ballet that doesnt displace a love of Mexican culture.Photo The story, also by Mr. Lara, could be from a 19th-century ballet: Lupita loves Ral, but her father arranges a marriage for her with the local rich guy, Maximiliano.When Maximiliano gives Ral poison, Lupita drinks it instead.Her Giselle-like death while dancing ends Act I. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Act II transpires in the underworld.Mr. Lara presides in the manner of Myrtha, who in Giselle is the queen of the Wilis, the jilted, avenging female spirits.Yet where Myrtha is merciless, La Catrina is a softy.Quoting Myrthas steps with large-shouldered grace and delicacy, Mr. Lara is ultrafeminine and mothering.
Review: ‘Hello Again,’ a Movie Musical Ode to Love and Lust Over Decades:::::Photo In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown (Into the Woods) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Juless little-seen Bang Bang Baby, from 2014).And now, somewhere between the two, lies Hello Again, Tom Gustafsons florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusas 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzlers La Ronde).What most distinguishes Hello Again from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.Hello Again largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades.(Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)Video It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her.And then its off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on.The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame.A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret.Their scenes together are worth the price of admission.The movie benefits from Austin Schmidts neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeones lush production design.But Mr. LaChiusas songs largely fail to resonate here.Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes.And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson (Were the World Mine).The movie musical needs more ambitious creators like him.Hello Again Director Tom Gustafson Writer Cory Krueckeberg Stars Martha Plimpton, Sam Underwood, Nolan Gerard Funk, Jenna Ushkowitz, Al Calderon Running Time 1h 45m Genres Drama, Music, Musical, Romance Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated: Nov 7, 2017

Try Not to Die.:::::Photo The first thing an audience sees when it enters the New Ohio Theater for ____ Marry Kill, James Pressons play with an unpublishable name, is a projection that reads, This is a play about where I grew up.It was exactly like this.If true, then lets hope Mr. Presson left early and subsequently clocked some serious therapy time.Prurient, futile and unconscionably long, his darkly comic portrait of teen life has an unusually high body count.At the risk of impugning Mr. Presson, this may not be strict autobiography.The play, produced by Less Than Rent theater, shares most of its plot points with John Fords superlatively lurid tragedy Tis Pity Shes a Whore, a fact Presson slyly acknowledges in the scripts subtitle, A Jacobean Revenge Comedy.(Technically, Fords play falls into the Caroline Era.But as Mr. Pressons characters often say, Whatever.)The play begins with an unnecessary frame story.Ryan (Alex Breaux) is lounging atop a Colorado mountain with his new friend Jenni (Ismenia Mendes) when a phone call from his brother lures him back to Greenport, Conn., and a set bounded with velvet ropes and topped with dozens of dangling blades.Because love is a boxing match.Or a knife fight.Or an MMA bout.Probably.Ostensibly, Ryan has returned to care for his cancer-stricken mother, while his brother, Brandon (Robbie Collier Sublett), elopes to Las Vegas with a barely legal girlfriend.To say that Jenni inexplicably tags along and that the mother and Brandons girlfriend are never seen and barely mentioned is to give some sense of the all-the-way-to-China plot holes Mr. Presson digs.Photo Back home, Ryan falls in with his high school crowd, many of whom are still in high school, becoming an accidental witness to incest, murder, suicide, attempted poisonings, extreme drug taking and a couple of scuppered teenage weddings.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Most of these incidents have analogues in Fords play, but as Joseph (Riley Suter), half of the sibling incest team, says to a friend, Well, this is getting sort of

In Alan Bennett’s Diaries, Life’s Pleasures Alongside Civic Outrage:::::Surely no British institution has made quite such a habit of refusal.Over the years he has declined a knighthood (It would be like wearing a suit every day of your life); the award of Commander of the Order of the British Empire; and an honorary degree from Oxford University, his alma mater, on the grounds that Rupert Murdoch had recently sponsored a department chair at the school.Photo Keeping On Keeping On comprises a decade of diary entries, from 2005 to 2015, all originally published in The London Review of Books, each one a burst of intellectual fire and feeling but unpretentious and unsentimental to the core.Theres not a damp squib to be found.The notion of a public diary might seem oxymoronic, an attempt to satisfy two opposing impulses.But it suits Bennett, who prefers to riff rather than reveal.His book is a string of wry asides to the audience penses, jokes and anecdotes with the compression and tang of a Lydia Davis short story.Heres one entry in full: I almost bump into an aged New York lady as I come into the grocery store and she comes out.Oh sorry, she says.I zigged when I should have zagged.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The small dramas of life are on display he tries (and fails) to protect his eyebrows from his barbers clippers as well as the unappeasable longings and sorrows.He remembers the tobacco-stained hands of his father, long dead.He records his shame at his country; how after Britains initial participation in the so-called war on terror,sometimes being English it felt as if one smelled.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But pleasure is never distant from Bennetts view, nor is it trivial.For him, the inextinguishable thrill of life is in noticing.Nothing is too small: The inside of a bean pod, shaped to the bean and furred like the inside of a violin case, has always seemed to me an instance of the prodigality of nature, a thing that is beautiful in itself and suited to its function.He is endlessly attentive to birds a baby robin with fierce black eyebrows, a pigeon hitting the same note again and again like a piano tuner and the beauty of men, their own ways of preening and posing.This lightning shift between registers is just one example of Bennetts relaxed virtuosity.This brick of a book more than 700 pages goes down like ice cream.But just as youre lolling complacently in your chair, a saw-toothed observation startles you to attention.On Margaret Thatcher: No one had done such systematic damage to the North since William the Conqueror.On Tony Blair: Less perilous, I would have thought, to have a leader intoxicated with whiskey than one like Blair, intoxicated with himself.Political outrage is the engine of the book.Bennett has had a lucky life, and he knows it.His parents were each finished with formal education by the age of 13; their son went on to become, for a time, a medievalist at Oxford.His fame was instantaneous, established when he co-wrote and performed in Beyond the Fringe at an Edinburgh festival in 1960.So when he takes stock of the gutting of the social services and education systems that made him, its with a kind of filial outrage.Closing libraries is child abuse, he writes.He has been publishing his diaries for 30 years, and a valedictory note inevitably creeps in.What has it all been for?What, even, is this book for?(Questions you wish more writers would consider.)In the case of Bennett this wolf forced into sheeps clothing the proof is on every page.He remains energetically and profitably exasperated, committed to exposing corruption, the abuse of language, the exploitation of people and assorted foolishness of all kinds.In one scene he lovingly reshelves his 13-volume Oxford English Dictionary, and then looks up a word.That word is rankle.

Museum Leader Who Resigned Calls Controversy a ‘Misunderstanding’:::::Known as one of the most influential figures in the world of international contemporary art, Ms. Ruf was hired to run the Stedelijk in 2014.Her tenure has been distinguished by critically acclaimed programming and an ambitious collaboration with the renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to redesign the museums layout to better present its permanent collection.Ms. Rufs sudden departure, accompanied by only very general public statements from Stedelijk officials and, until now, just a single quote from Ms. Ruf in a news release, had cast a shadow on her reputation and left lingering concerns about the Stedelijk boards ability to govern with transparency.The situation has also raised broader questions about the accountability of government-owned Dutch cultural institutions, which are substantially funded by the state and owe the public explanations of their policies and practices.Ms. Ruf agreed to an exclusive interview by email with The Times, saying that she hoped to clarify her role in what she called a misunderstanding.She advised that her responses would be vetted by her lawyers before being sent to The Times.All of her side activities were contractually approved by the Stedelijk before she took the job, Ms. Ruf wrote.Throughout her responses, she said several times, I am confident that I reported everything in good faith.Madeleine de Cock Buning, the acting chairwoman of the museums supervisory board was forwarded Ms. Rufs comments and replied by email saying that the board had begun two independent investigations.We have decided not to answer questions of the media while the investigations are going on, she added.Ms. Ruf, who was born in Singen, Germany, and who worked as a curator and choreographer, mostly in Switzerland, came to the Stedelijk from the Kunsthalle Zurich, where in 12 years as director she made a name for herself by mounting cutting-edge exhibitions by artists such as Trisha Donnelly, Wade Guyton and Seth Price.Mark Reutter, who was chairman of the Kunsthalles board at the time, said that her contract with the Kunsthalle allowed her to do outside work as an art adviser and consultant.The Kunsthalle does not have its own collection and does not purchase artworks, so there was no potential conflict of interest.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Rufs primary side activity while employed by the Kunsthalle was working as a salaried art adviser to the wealthy Swiss publisher and art collector Michael Ringier, who, over 20 years, collected a trove of more than 4,000 works of contemporary art with Ms. Rufs help.When she was offered the job at the Stedelijk, Ms. Ruf wanted to continue this kind of art advisory work, she said, adding that she had sought and received approval from the museums board to do so.She said she then established Currentmatters for this purpose.Photo The Stedelijks most recent annual report lists 18 additional functions that Ms. Ruf provided, such as acting as a jurist for international art prizes, advising or serving on boards of art institutions in Moscow, Rome, Vienna and Dhaka, Bangladesh, and advising the American bank Goldman Sachs on their corporate art collection in London.Benno Tempel, director of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, said that he felt it was acceptable for museum directors to sit on juries and boards, but if theres money involved, that money should go to the institution.Jo Houben, director of the Dutch nonprofit organization Culture+Entrepreneurship, which established a local code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said that any side activities that benefit an individual rather than the institution they work for is not consistent with the codes principles.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But theres a big difference if the board allowed her to do that and they knew what was happening, he added.If the supervisory board allowed the director to do something, and it turns out to be not a good choice, then the board may have to resign.Mr. Houben added that the Stedelijk building is owned by the city of Amsterdam, and the city and the Dutch state finance the institution.So if you work there you have to be aware that you work with public money and behind the public money are public values, and that means you work for the public and not for your private interest, he said.Under a rule in the code of ethics called comply or explain, he added, its fine for an organization to make its own special arrangements that deviate from the code, but the document recommends that the institution inform the public about it in its annual report or some other public document.I dont see any place where the board communicates that they dont follow the code, Mr. Houben said.In 2015, Currentmatters reported a profit of about $500,000 to the Dutch tax authorities, but Ms. Ruf said that the number was misleading: Many people wrongly assumed these profits came from side activities conducted in 2015 while I was artistic director of the Stedelijk Museum, she said.In fact, this profit statement reflects legitimate income from activities conducted before 2015, primarily a parting bonus for past work from the Ringier Collection in the amount of 1 million Swiss Francs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Ruf said that her actual earnings from approved side activities were 104,000 euros, or around $120,000, per year in 2015 and 2016.She said that the 378,000 she reported in 2015, and 628,000 that she earned in 2016 came from activities conducted before 2015, and primarily reflected the bonus from Mr. Ringier.On Wednesday, Ms. Ruf is required to report her 2016 earnings to the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands and these figure will become publicly available.Mr. Ringier confirmed in a phone interview that he had given Ms. Ruf the thank you gift of 1 million francs, paid in installments over 2015 and 2016.He said that he did this because Ms. Ruf added value in the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions to his collection.The money that I think everybody talks about in this company is the money she got for the 20 years of work for us, Mr. Ringier said.It had nothing to do with an ongoing advisorship.We absolutely wanted to avoid a conflict of interest, Mr. Ringier said.Even though Ms. Ruf said the Stedelijks board had approved her side activities for the Ringier collection, she said that she and Mr. Ringier decided it would be best if they no longer worked together, and she sent her last invoice in December 2014.The Stedelijks board did not respond to questions about whether Ms. Ruf reported to the museum that she received the bonus from Mr. Ringier.Ms. Ruf declined to comment on that question.In spite of what she said were efforts to report everything in good faith, questions remained about whether her arrangement with the Stedelijk from the beginning followed international and national codes of ethics.Mijntje Lckerath-Rovers, a professor of corporate governance at Tilburg University and the chairman of the committee that drafted the code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said in a phone interview, If there was some logical explanation, they could have said, Sorry that we were not that transparent in the beginning, we now want to be as transparent as possible, and here is what happened.In that case, she said, Ms. Ruf could have kept her job.The absence of any such explanation does give the outside world, including me, the idea that something is not completely right, Professor Lckerath-Rovers said.From my perspective, transparency is lacking here and thats the most important thing, especially because youre working with public money.

Brandeis Cancels Play About Lenny Bruce After Protests:::::Photo Brandeis University canceled an upcoming play about the comedian Lenny Bruce after some students and faculty expressed outrage about its content, the school announced on Monday.The play, called Buyer Beware, was written by Michael Weller, an alumnus of the school and a playwright with a body of work that includes 1971s Moonchildren.Buyer Beware was supposed to go on stage this month, but according to a statement from Brandeis, faculty started raising objections last summer.Theater faculty members, the statement said, felt that more time was needed to produce the play appropriately, and that its performance on campus should go hand-in-hand with robust educational programming.One criticism was that the play unfairly portrayed the Black Lives Matter movement.A Brandeis theater student, Andrew Child, who led the campaign against the play, told The Boston Globe that the portrayal of its black characters was ridiculous and vicious, and that they are caricatured.
A Novelist Confronts the Complex Relationship Between Japan and Korea:::::The migrants, whose story Ms. Lee tells in Pachinko, congregated in slums and performed mostly low-paid labor.Discrimination was rampant.The eventual liberation of their homeland at the end of World War II was a mixed blessing: No longer subjects of the Japanese emperor, Koreans lost the right to reside in Japan.Many had no homes or jobs to return to, so they stayed on anyway, prompting decades of wrangling over their legal status.At the restaurant, a television showing K-pop videos hung next to a wall covered in white cardboard squares displaying autographs from celebrity customers Korean food is popular in Japan, a paradoxical exemption from wider social prejudices.The waiter was a young man in his 20s.Ms. Lee cycled through English (her primary language) and Japanese (his) before settling on an imperfect middle ground of Korean.The fictional family at the center of Pachinko, the Baeks, grapples with problems common to transplanted people: material hardship, unwelcoming locals, the possibilities and limits of assimilation.For them, as for real-life zainichi, ethnic biases are compounded by colonial-era abuses and resentments.The physical similarities between Koreans and Japanese make passing as a member of the majority a tempting possibility, but a socially and psychologically risky one.Koreans have suffered from the discrimination that all immigrants face, plus an added dimension that comes from their having been colonial subjects, said Masachika Ukiba, a professor of cultural anthropology at Nagoya University who has studied the zainichi population.Many of todays zainichi are fourth-generation, so theyre hardly immigrants anymore.They are essentially Japanese, Professor Ukiba added.Outright discrimination has faded, he said, since the period depicted in Pachinko the 1910s through the 1980s but has not disappeared.Some bigotry has moved online, where trolls depict zainichi as cockroaches or fifth-columnists for nuclear-armed North Korea.Ms. Lee spent nearly two decades conceiving, writing and rewriting Pachinko.The seed was planted in 1989, when, as a student at Yale, she attended a talk by a Protestant missionary who had spent time among the zainichi.Until then, she said, she had never heard of this branch of the Korean diaspora.Growing up in the United States, she was used to Koreans being viewed as hardworking and upwardly mobile, a model American minority.But many zainichi, she was surprised to discover, languished at the bottom rungs of Japans socioeconomic ladder.My level of research became a little neurotic, she said.Although she was a Korean immigrant herself, she was entering a completely new world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For ethnic Koreans in Japan, one route to economic improvement has been pachinko, a pastime derived from pinball.Played by millions of Japanese at noisy, smoke-filled halls, many of which are operated by zainichi, pachinko occupies a legal and social gray zone.The game itself is legal, but the gambling that inevitably accompanies it is not.Instead of banning it, Japan tolerates it but disparages the people who run it, said Ms. Lee.She sees a parallel with Koreans place in Japanese society: deeply established, yet not fully accepted as legitimate members.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Lees family embodied the rosier American version of the Korean immigrant story.In South Korea, her father had worked in marketing at a cosmetics company, but fears that the Korean Peninsula could erupt into another devastating war convinced him to leave.After arriving in New York in the mid-1970s, her parents operated a news kiosk in Manhattan, at Broadway and 31st Street.They soon upgraded to a wholesale costume-jewelry business, working and saving their way into the middle class and sending their three daughters to college.Pachinko is a product of persistence.Ms. Lee discarded an earlier, more narrowly focused version of the novel, which she wrote in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Its original main character was Solomon Baek, an aspiring ethnic Korean investment banker who is subjected to bigotry and betrayal at a financial firm in Tokyo.It was boring, she said big on social themes but short on fully realized human characters and relationships.I didnt talk to enough people.Photo The chance for a fresh start came in 2007, when her husband, a banker of Japanese descent, took a job in Tokyo.While there, she started looking for zainichi to interview business people, pachinko parlor owners, bar hostesses.The first few were hard to get because I didnt have introductions, she said.But then it was like the floodgates opened.Many of her subjects told love stories.Almost every Korean she spoke to, she said, had been rejected at some point because of their ethnicity.It was startling for an American: Even considering the United States unbridged racial divides, the zainichi seemed inescapably stamped by difference.As she collected more stories, the novel grew in scope.It also became more feminine, she said.Ms. Lee expanded the role of Sunja, Solomons quietly tenacious grandmother, who leaves her Korean fishing village for Osaka as a young bride in the 1930s.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As an American, Ms. Lee was partly insulated from lingering bias in Japan against zainichi.But she still encountered casual ethnic stereotyping that surprised her.When she pointed out shoddy repair work at the apartment her family rented, an employee at the management company told her, You Koreans are always complaining.At the church she attended, when she argued in favor of paying the homeless volunteers who cooked curry at the church soup kitchen, a Japanese fellow congregant said it was her Korean blood that caused her to make a fuss.Photo Ms. Lee finished her novel after returning to the United States.During her recent visit to Japan, she noted that while Pachinko has been picked up by publishers in more than a dozen countries, including Turkey and Poland, it has not yet found one in Japan.Japans own literature contains prominent works by and about zainichi, many exploring similar themes of identity and history.Yang Sok-ils semiautobiographical Blood and Bones, one of a number of popular books by Korean-Japanese authors, was turned into a movie starring the actor and director Takeshi Kitano in 2004.Ms. Lee said she hoped that publishers would not be put off by an unsparing look at Japans still only partly resolved history by an American outsider.I do have love for Japan.At the same time, I have a complex relationship with Japan because Im

Mel Rosenthal, Photographer Who Captured the Bronx, Dies at 77:::::Mel Rosenthal, a photographer who documented life both close to home in the South Bronx and in faraway places like Tanzania, focusing on the human side of hardship and urban decay, died on Oct. 30 in Redding, Conn.He was 77.The cause was complications of dementia, said Deborah Dichter, a family friend.Mr. Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College for 36 years, was especially known for photographing the South Bronx in the 1970s and 80s, a time of burned-out buildings and desolate streets.But where others often shot only the blight, Mr. Rosenthal usually made people the central element of any picture, emphasizing both the human impact of the conditions and the human spirit that survived amid the bleakness.A young man turns a flip over a discarded mattress on a sidewalk.A woman and her dog pause for a portrait on Bathgate Avenue.
Review: Bending It Like Bharatanatyam:::::Photo I struggle with English, the dancer Preeti Vasudevan told an audience at New York Live Arts on Thursday, speaking eloquently in English.The problem, she explained, was a physical one, the sense of an unbridgeable distance between her and us.Tamil is my body language, the one I move with, she continued.And as she began to speak in Tamil, she sprang to life, still seated as before but newly animated and unguarded, as if confiding in friends.Photo This was the first of many stories told through multiple languages, gestural ones included, in the world premiere of Stories by Hand, a collaboration between Ms. Vasudevan and the digital artist and writer Paul Kaiser, who served as her dramaturge.Though Mr. Kaiser is known for his contributions to landmark experiments merging dance and technology, like Bill T. Joness Ghostcatching and Merce Cunninghams Biped, the pared-down Stories bears no technological traces other than Robert Wierzels sensitive lighting and Paul Jacobss sound design.Its a thoughtful if not always riveting hour of talking and dancing, informed by but not beholden to Ms. Vasudevans years of training in the classical Indian dance form Bharatanatyam.Traditionally Bharatanatyam conveys Hindu religious stories, in part through an intricate lexicon of hand positions known as mudras.Ms. Vasudevan performing solo except for two assistants who help with minimal set and costume changes makes reference to gods and myths and the history of the dance form, offering witty lessons in mudras and their meanings.But the tales she imparts come from her own life as a woman born in southern India and living in New York.Some of these are almost mythically tragic, particularly the final one, in which she recounts with uncanny evenness the night her cousin Karthik killed his wife, three children and mother-in-law before killing himself.Lighter moments find her chatting with her grandmother about marriage and walking through the red-light district of Lahore with her British boyfriend.Her delivery is sometimes cloying, sometimes deeply absorbing.At her wildest, Ms. Vasudevan swirls and skids through white flour she has laid on the ground, propelled by a recording of roaring drums.(The extensive program notes, which include a conceptual story map detailing the works three sections, inform us that this is a dance of the god Shiva as lord of cremation, surrounded by ash.)Yet its her simpler gestures like the slow, deliberate action of feeding her grandfather, as she recalls spending time with him in India that say the most.
Review: ‘Lee Harvey Oswald,’ an American Assassin in Puppet Form:::::Photo If you have ever wondered who pulled the strings of the John F. Kennedy assassination, La MaMa has a show for you.This is meant literally: The Life and Times of Lee Harvey Oswald does not explore the theories that have kept legitimate historians and basement-dwelling conspiracists busy for the past half century; what it does have is a lot of puppets, brought to wobbly life by a cast of eight humans dressed like federal agents, in white shirts and black slacks.Despite the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater stating on its website that the show explores three national traumas from the 1960s the killings of President Kennedy, his brother Robert and Martin Luther King Jr. the story squarely focuses on Oswalds bizarre journey.This is an ambitious project and typical for a company that has in the past deployed puppets for the likes of Twelfth Night, an exploration of Socrates and Platos philosophical teachings and a show about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.The first issue here is the difficulty in actually seeing the little guys, whose designs are apparently inspired by traditional Czech marionettes.They measure about eight inches, so even in the intimate confines of La MaMas first-floor space, their painstakingly detailed faces and costumes are reduced to a blur as they move in a seemingly random manner.Photo Why show Oswalds mother and father having clumsy puppet sex if the audience needs binoculars to see it?To paraphrase an old Woody Allen joke, the food is terrible and in such small portions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The sex scene, incidentally, is an early indication that the writer-director Vit Horejs, who founded the company and is in the ensemble, will take a soup-to-nuts approach to Oswalds life, all the way to Dealey Plaza and his death at the hands of Jack Ruby.Oswald died at 24, but the slackly paced show makes it feel as if he lived three times as long.
Review: ‘Damnation’ and the Sick Soul of 1930s America:::::Photo You can read the title of the USA drama Damnation a couple of ways damn nation, damned nation that both work.Its hard to figure out what this odd, bordering on bizarre historical something or other is trying to do, but its firmly focused on the sick soul of America.Damnation, whose first season begins Tuesday, appears to be very loosely based on some obscure chapters of American history: the Farmers Holiday Association, a 1930s agricultural protest movement, and the Black Legion, a Ku Klux Klan splinter group active in the Midwest at the same time.Those associations are intriguing, as is the notion of a major television drama set in the unlikely surroundings of Depression-era rural Iowa.Real life is incidental, though, in a show thats a not very coherent fever dream.Tony Tost, whose previous TV experience was on the crime-western Longmire, combines a Bernie-bro fantasy of economic populism with a violent frontier melodrama owing a heavy debt to Deadwood, and wraps the whole thing in a Cain-and-Abel religious allegory.(Four episodes were available for review.)Killian Scott plays a labor agitator whos posing as a preacher, the better to whip up discontent among the farmers in northwestern Iowa and persuade them to withhold their goods from the market.Advertisement Continue reading the main story His opposite number, played by Logan Marshall-Green of Cinemaxs Quarry, is a Pinkerton strikebreaker whose colorful behavior includes carrying the corpse of a rebellious farmer into the local speakeasy and sitting it at a table, just to send a message.He then takes up residence at the local brothel owned by the sheriff, of course where he tasks a prostitute with, among other duties, reading his correspondence to him.

‘Mad Men’ Creator Matthew Weiner’s Foray Into Fiction:::::Its unusual for a debut author to be showered in such over-the-top accolades and compared to literary masters.But then again, Mr. Weiner, 52, has hardly been laboring in obscurity.In a screenwriting career that spans more than 20 years, hes been a creative force behind some of our eras most revered cable dramas, shows that were credited with reinventing the narrative possibilities of television.He received two Emmys for The Sopranos, which he worked on as a writer and producer, and was the creator, showrunner, head writer, director and executive producer for Mad Men, which aired for seven seasons and won four Golden Globes and 15 Emmys.Photo Writing fiction has long been a goal of his, but it always felt intimidating.I was always hoping I would do it, he said during an interview this fall over lunch at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, not far from where the novel takes place.I just didnt know if I could.Mr. Weiners foray into fiction surprised a lot of Hollywood observers.Everyone was breaking down his door to do another show, and he goes off and does something that no one was expecting, said Semi Chellas, a writer who worked on Mad Men.The contrariness of going off and writing fiction after Mad Men was very Matt.For fans of Mad Men, a precisely observed, sprawling drama that chronicled the hedonistic, boozy office culture of a Madison Avenue advertising agency in the 1960s, Heather might seem like a surprising and perhaps unsatisfying creative pivot for Mr. Weiner.The story has just four central characters and can be inhaled in a single sitting.It lacks the long narrative arc and subtle character development that made Mad Men an addictive and gratifying show that rewarded close watching.But in other ways, Heather feels like a stylistic and thematic sibling of Mad Men, particularly in Mr. Weiners almost surgical dissection of the ways that social status, wealth, gender and class define us.As we know from his television work, hes a great observer of people, said Ms. Messud, author of The Burning Girl.This is almost like a bullet train.Hes distilled the narrative down to its essence.Heather unfolds in present-day Manhattan, and like so many gripping New York stories, the plot hinges on real estate.The couple at the center of the story, Mark and Karen Breakstone, lead sheltered, privileged lives, and fawn over their perfect daughter, Heather.Mark, who works in finance, frets about his annual bonus and his status, while Karen stays home to tend to Heather, then becomes resentful when Heather grows up and no longer needs her.The Breakstoness quiet, simmering dissatisfaction is interwoven with a darker, parallel story about a man named Bobby Klasky, who grew up neglected by his a heroin-addicted mother and developed a violent streak.The two narratives collide when Bobby finds work on a construction crew that is renovating the penthouse in the Breakstoness building, and becomes obsessed with Heather.In a way, its not all that surprising that Mr. Weiner turned to fiction.He grew up loving Mark Twain and J.D.Salinger.As a college student at Wesleyan University, he wrote poetry and studied philosophy, literature and history.Mad Men is steeped in literary allusions.Mr. Weiner has cited Cheever, Frank OHara and Sherwood Anderson as writers whose work influenced him and informed the show.At the start of every season in the writers room, Mr. Weiner began by reading Cheevers preface to his Collected Stories.He often brought in short stories or poetry that he read aloud.Once, he brought in an audio recording of Sylvia Plath reading her poetry and had the writing staff listen for about an hour, Ms. Chellas said.Very rarely was there a direct point, it was more a mood or a tone that he wanted to explore, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Over lunch at the Carlyle, Mr. Weiner was cheerful and animated, occasionally breaking into high pitched peals of laughter.He gushed about his favorite books and authors and seemed more eager to talk about his reading than his writing, noting that he went on a binge-reading tear after finishing Mad Men, and devoured books by Haruki Murakami, Donna Tartt, Delmore Schwartz, John Steinbeck and Hermann Hesse, among others.He gossiped about famous dead novelists like they were old acquaintances.While describing his writing process and sources of inspiration, he dropped in bits of literary trivia and issued pronouncements about writers he admires.Photo Mark Twain: Hes amazing!He dictated!Tolstoys Anna Karenina: Theres like five novels in that thing.Charles Dickens: I consider him the first TV writer.Patricia Highsmith: She was at Yaddo!I love her work.I like the fact that it isnt judgmental and its a little perverse.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The idea for Heather came from a scene Mr. Weiner witnessed when he was walking around the Upper East Side.in the fall of 2015.He saw an attractive teenage girl walking into an apartment building where construction work was being done, and noticed one of the workers staring at her with what looked like a mixture of lust and menace.Mr. Weiner jotted down his observations in a notebook where he collects ideas and stray bits of dialogue, and wasnt sure if anything would come of it.While he was at Yaddo, he kept thinking about the girl and the construction worker, puzzling over what he had seen, and began writing a fictionalized story about the years leading up to the encounter.He wrote 5,000 words over the next 16 days, and finished a draft in nine months.Mr. Weiner is now back to writing and producing TV hes currently working on his new show, The Romanoffs, an anthology series for Amazon that follows people who believe themselves to be descendants of the Russian imperial Romanov family.He still seems surprised that hes adding novelist to his resume.He never expected to finish the book, much less publish it.Its like someone who goes to the casino for the first time and wins, he said.
‘Kiss Me, Kate’ Will Head Back to Broadway With Kelli O’Hara:::::Photo Brush up on your Shakespeare: Kelli OHara is coming back to Broadway to star in a Roundabout Theater Company revival of Kiss Me, Kate.The production will be directed by Scott Ellis (She Loves Me) and will begin performances in February 2019, Roundabout said Monday.The nonprofit did not announce a theater or other members of the cast.The musical, featuring songs by Cole Porter, tells the story of two once-married actors who fight, flirt, and fend off gangsters as they prepare to stage a musical adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew.Ms. OHara will play the leading role of Lilli Vanessi/Katharine.With a book by Bella and Sam Spewack, the show originally opened on Broadway in 1948 (and won five Tony Awards, including for best new musical); a revival, with uncredited revisions by the playwright John Guare, opened in 1999, won the 2000 Tony Award for best musical revival, announced a closing in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and then managed to run a bit longer after a voluntary cast pay cut.Ms. OHara is one of Broadways most loved contemporary performers, and has led well-received Lincoln Center Theater revivals of South Pacific and The King and I.She won a Tony Award in 2015, for The King and I, and had previously been nominated five other times, including for a 2006 Roundabout revival of The Pajama Game.Last year, Ms. OHara performed in a staged reading of Kiss Me, Kate, also directed by Mr. Ellis, to benefit Roundabout.In that production, the male lead was played by Will Chase.
Chopin’s Heart, Pickled in a Jar, Offers Clues to His Death:::::Photo The heart of Frederic Chopin, pickled in a jar of alcohol and then encased in a stone pillar in Holy Cross Church in Warsaw, shows the Polish composer died from complications of tuberculosis, according to an early version of an article published by the American Journal of Medicine.According to the article, which is to be published in its final form in February under the title A Closer Look at Frederic Chopins Cause of Death, the researchers found Chopins heart submerged in an amber-brown liquid, thought to be Cognac, which was often used for tissue preservation.The researchers did not open the jar, but they could see that Chopins heart was massively enlarged and floppy, they wrote in the article.It was also covered in a white substance that gave it a frosted appearance, leading the researchers to conclude that Chopin had suffered from pericarditis, an inflammation of tissue around the heart that was likely the result of tuberculosis.Previous theories held that he may have died from cystic fibrosis.The heart has a long and contentious history.Chopin, who died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, dreaded being buried alive, and asked that his body be cut open before burial and his heart sent to Warsaw.Accordingly, his heart was cut out, sealed in a crystal jar and smuggled past the Russian authorities into what is now Poland.
Hear a Newly Found Kurt Weill Song That Surprised Experts:::::Mr. Juchem said he didnt believe the archivist at first, but when he saw the handwriting, My jaw dropped.Photo Then the search for the songs origin began.Lenya had mentioned the song before, but under a different title, Song of the Blind Maiden.In the 1960s, she attempted to find the song but came up empty.Nowhere to be found, she said at the time.Probably buried in some basement.Weill scholars thought the song Lenya remembered was written for Das Lied von Hoboken, a German translation of the American play Hoboken Blues that starred Lenya at the Volksbhne in 1930.But, Mr. Juchem said, the lyric by Gnther Weisenborn didnt quite fit in the context of the play.So Mr. Juchem looked into the name of the Weimar-era faith healer mentioned in the song, Joseph Weissenberg (1855-1941), who was a charismatic evangelist with thousands of followers in Berlin and used cottage cheese and prayer as treatment.He formed a real sect, and he was a constant feature in the Berlin tabloids at the same time that Kurt Weill was reaching the height of his fame as a young composer in the city, Mr. Juchem said.It was in newspapers that Mr. Juchem eventually found the origin of Song of the White Cheese, which Weill wrote for a politically charged revue to benefit actors who had been laid off from the Volksbhne in November 1931.(Other artists who participated included Brecht and the composer Hanns Eisler.)Photo The song tells the story of a blind girl treated unsuccessfully by Weissenberg.It jokingly nods to the Lutheran chorale Lord, Take My Hand and Lead Me and ends with the girl wondering whether it would be better for everyone to be blind, so nobody would have to see whats currently going on in this world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the time, Germany was in a political crisis as the Nazi party rose to power, and aftershocks of the Great Depression had reached Europe.Song of the White Cheese is very much a song of its time a zeit song Mr. Kowalke said.Although the songs satire was easy to grasp for Berliners of the time, much of it would be lost on most people today.What do we do if the topical references have disappeared?Mr. Kowalke said.He added that when it is published and recorded in English, We might probably put an alternative lyric for Weissenbergs name.How the song ended up in Gerda Schaefers collection is still a mystery.One theory, Mr. Juchem said, is that Lenya, who had to begin performances for the Berlin production of Weill and Brechts Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, may have sung in the revue only once or twice, then passed on the song to Schaefer.That the song was never published isnt unusual for Weill, who was often so busy he didnt take the time to do that even for more major works like Das Berliner Requiem, Mr. Kowalke said.
The World Really Is a Stage, Scripts and All, to an Actor With Autism:::::A boyish 29-year-old Seattle native with the slight but toned build of a gymnast, he looked me in the eye and shook my hand when we met.On our table, he placed a sheaf of papers face down scripted notes it made him feel better to have, which he consulted if I asked a question he wanted to be careful answering.His vocal tone, timid at first, soon had the resonance of an actors voice.This is easy-ish for me because youre a reporter; Im the interviewee, he said when wed been talking awhile.We have specific roles.If we met on the street, that would be more scary.Thats how hes felt about performing, too, ever since he was little: perfectly comfortable as long as he knows the part hes meant to play.Whether Mr. Rowe is the first autistic actor to play Christopher is hard to pin down, given the number of Curious Incident productions around the world.Even Mr. Stephens, the playwright, said that while Mr. Rowe is the first hes heard of, he cant be sure.Photo Casting Mr. Rowe was the result of a deliberate effort by two professional regional theaters, Syracuse Stage and its co-producer, Indiana Repertory Theater (where the show opened this fall), to audition actors both with and without autism for the role.At a time when theaters are discussing diversity, there is a heightened pressure to include performers with disabilities.Uncommon Sense, Tectonic Theater Projects new Off Broadway play about people with autism and their families, has an actor on the spectrum, Andrew Duff, in its ensemble.Robert Hupp, the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, said that seeking out actors on the spectrum made logical and irrefutable sense for Curious Incident.To him, Mr. Rowes performance is clear validation.To anyone who ever had any concerns or doubts or wondered, Could an actor with autism play this role?Would an actor who falls on the spectrum be overwhelmed by this production?the answer is definitively no, he said.Not if youre Mickey Rowe.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Rowe, who earned a bachelors degree in drama from the University of Washington, found out when he was a senior there that he had autism.Legally blind, he struggles to read print smaller than 18-point type (he wears contacts onstage and glasses in real life, he says), and was in special education classes for his vision throughout childhood years he spent friendless, obsessed with magic tricks and circus skills: stilt-walking, juggling, unicycling.It strikes him as telling that he got speech and occupational therapy, too.He suspects his parents knew he had autism but didnt want to label him, and if so, he understands.He hasnt asked them, though; he said they dont have that kind of relationship.It was his girlfriend now his wife and the mother of their two small children who urged him to get help with issues like interpreting social cues.At the universitys Adult Autism Clinic, his diagnosis came as a big relief, because you know your whole life that something is different, Mr. Rowe said.You dont know why or what it is or if youre stupid or whats going on.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Still, he didnt tell people about his autism.So it was unsettling when, in an acting class he took around the time Curious Incident opened on Broadway in 2014, the teacher handed him one of Christophers speeches and said, You need to do this monologue.This is you.I remember thinking to myself afterwards: Does she know Im on the spectrum?Mr. Rowe said.Like, do people just know?He is not Christopher, though, and he and Christopher occupy very different spots on the spectrum.Even so, he recognized enough pieces of himself in that monologue that he went home and listened to the novel, by Mark Haddon, that Mr. Stephens adapted into the play.Photo Not long afterward, struggling to get work, Mr. Rowe threw in the towel on trying to pass as neurotypical.In an essay on the theater industry website HowlRound, he wrote about being an actor with autism, noting the tension between everything that I am and everything that might be conventional for an actor.He hoped his disclosure would change the way people looked at him, just enough to give him a chance.The piece raised his profile and put him on the radar of anyone searching for an actor with autism, but in practice nothing changed.Going out for roles, he still faced immediate roadblocks: the small talk, the eye contact, the instant connection an actor is supposed to make with the director.Just how you walk into the room and shake hands with the person when you first meet them is a huge part of the audition, and people on the spectrum arent very good at that, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So his rsum was comparatively slender when the Indiana/Syracuse production asked him to submit a video audition.Soon the shows California-based director, Risa Brainin, flew to Seattle to see if he had the chops.If he didnt, they werent going to compromise.We couldnt, she said.Its too major of a role, and too difficult of a role.What we wanted to do was give the opportunity.In Syracuse, where the production runs through Nov. 12, Mr. Rowe plays Christopher with an agile grace, an impish humor and a humanizing restraint that seems directly connected to his experience of autism.When the stage directions say that Christopher barks like a dog, for example, Mr. Rowe chooses to underplay it.The attention the show has gotten has been positive for him.For one thing, Lincoln Center asked him to speak at its autism-focused Big Umbrella Festival next spring.And the ripples extend farther.Marissa Wolf, who is directing Curious Incident this winter at Kansas City Repertory Theater, in Missouri, said Mr. Rowes casting inspired her to choose an actor with Tourettes syndrome, a condition often associated with autism spectrum disorder, to play Christopher in her production.Mr. Rowe worries a little about being pigeonholed, because he also wants to play roles that have nothing to do with autism.At the same time, he sees characters in the canon who he thinks could be on the spectrum like Bobby, the young misfit in David Mamets American Buffalo, and Jason, the awkward adolescent in David Lindsay-Abaires Rabbit Hole.Eager to work with Mr. Rowe again, Mr. Hupp and Ms. Brainin have been scheming about future projects, pondering which roles maybe something in Shakespeare?would be a great fit for him.What Mr. Rowe wants is a life in the American theater, probably with a stint in graduate school on the way.He can envision himself as the leader of a regional theater, and he is undaunted by the socializing that would require.Mingling may not be in his skill set, but to him, an artistic director is simply playing a role.And knowing that takes the fear away.
‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 1, Episode 8: A Little Harmony:::::Photo Season 1, Episode 8: Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum In very conventional Trek fashion, we find ourselves on an away mission to a strange new world in this weeks episode.There lives a species previously unknown to Starfleet.(In even more typical Trek fashion, an away team to this strange world requires sending three senior bridge officers.What could go wrong?)But it is the other story line in this episode, titled Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum, that spoke to the larger puzzle pieces at play in the Discovery universe.And the Klingon story moved in ways I didnt expect.LRell wants to defect.Or does she?She teams up with Cornwell to escape the ship, but was she really?And is Cornwell actually dead?There are some tight camera shots of Cornwells body that suggest otherwise.And Kol discovers the deception.Or does he?And is Tyler a Klingon spy?There are some more bread crumbs to feed this theory.When Saru offers Tyler a crystal, which seems to have the power to probe minds, Saru spots a deception: Your intentions are false.This comes after Tyler gives a lengthy diatribe about wanting to hurt Klingons.Saru was right, but whether he is more right than he realizes remains to be seen.The Discovery crew seems to accept that it was the Pahvans that sent the signal to the Klingons.Its possible that it was Tyler.(Filed under Reading Too Much Into It, look at what Tyler said to Saru: I want to hurt them.You dont just forget something like that.You cant.If it means I can make them suffer, like they made me suffer.Isnt this the kind of language our forgotten Klingon friend Voq would use to discuss humans?And in an earlier conversation, Tyler suggests to Burnham that they should leave the transmitter alone so the war can continue.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story These are all open questions.But more important, for the first time, I was genuinely intrigued about what is happening with the Klingons.That comes with a few caveats: Its still difficult to take the Klingons seriously in the subtitled scenes.How Kol amassed support is still baffling to me, given that he seems to just kill political foes without consequence.So who exactly is behind him?
Putting the Ghosts of Princeton’s Racial Past Onstage:::::Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins, a Princeton graduate whose plays include An Octoroon and Neighbors, said he was inspired by Stocktons travels to Hawaii, a place where American racial categories were essentially incomprehensible.He said he was also moved by her commitment to education for everyone in contrast to Princeton itself, which didnt graduate its first black undergraduates until 1947.It was really important to me that the impact of these findings not be reduced to the same old conversation about the black and white of our countrys history, he said in an email, referring to the research project, but instead, were underlined as implicating any- and everybody on this campus in this town, even.Under the Liberty Trees Photo The first nine presidents of Princeton owned slaves, many of them during their tenures there.In the 18th century, prospective students had to present themselves to the university president for examination, so first person an applicant encountered at Princeton may have been an enslaved person who answered the door at the at the presidents house on Nassau Street.Ms. Manns play, Under the Liberty Trees, is based on a 1766 newspaper advertisement for a slave auction in front of the house, when the property of Samuel Finley, Princetons fifth president, was sold after his death.The liberty trees in front, according to campus lore, had been planted a few months earlier to celebrate the repeal of the hated Stamp Act.Ms. Mann, whose plays include Having Our Say (based on the memoir by two centenarian African-American sisters, the Delanys), said the projects research had reshaped her mental geography.I see this town completely differently now, she said.Princeton is such a microcosm of race in America.So much more has happened here than people realize.Freedom on Trial Photo During a visit to the archives, the playwrights were shown materials highlighting the range of what researchers had uncovered, from early land records to documents relating to a local free African-American who himself owned slaves.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But what struck Regina Taylor hardest were newspaper articles about James Collins Johnson, a janitor at Princeton who was arrested in 1843 and put on trial after a white student identified him as a fugitive slave.Here was an African-American man who escapes slavery, names himself and believes that he was a free man, but then finds that he was not able to become a free man as he chooses, according to the Constitution of the United States, Ms. Taylor said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Taylors play, James Johnson: Princeton and the Constitution, uses beat-boxing and overlapping intergenerational voices to tell Johnsons irony-rich story.At trial, he contested the identification.Ultimately, a local white woman purchased his freedom for todays equivalent of well over $10,000 money that Johnson had to pay back.Johnson continued to work as a campus vendor for decades, and was buried in 1902 under a headstone, paid for by Princeton alumni, calling him the students friend.Ms. Taylor, who will direct a revival of her gospel musical Crowns at the McCarter next spring, connects the injustice of Johnsons debt with the school-to-prison pipeline today.Ava DuVernays film 13th lays it out, she said.How were still paying off the debt of our forefathers, the obstacles we still face to being a free person with full ownership of self.Talking Back to Statues Photo Earlier this year, Nathan Alan Davis (Nat Turner in Jerusalem) toured the campus with Martha Sandweiss, the history professor who led the research project.One stop was an imposing statue of John Witherspoon, an early Princeton president and signer of the Declaration of Independence, which was erected in 2001.Mr. Davis had been thinking about the continuing national controversies over monuments and naming, and had followed the debate at Princeton in 2015 over the legacy of Woodrow Wilson.When I saw the statue and learned that Witherspoon owned slaves, I thought, Here we go, he said.The Torch features a conversation between Witherspoons statue and a blowtorch-wielding African-American student named Jasmine, who quite literally holds his feet to the fire.Like a number of the other plays, it takes off from history but is very much in the present tense, connecting the legacy of slavery with contemporary issues like policing (introduced via an African-American officer who intervenes in Jasmines interrogation of the statue).Often with narratives about slavery, people say, Oh, this terrible thing happened, its too bad, but thank God were not doing that anymore, Mr. Davis said.But I dont want to let anybody off the proverbial hook.We cant simply look at slavery as an episode we have overcome.Its still present.
Princeton Digs Deep Into Its Fraught Racial History:::::Princetons heavily Southern antebellum student body and its desire to keep the sons of slaveholders comfortable may have set it apart.But its deep entanglements with slavery did not.Princetons history is American history writ small, said Martha Sandweiss, the history professor who led the project.From the beginning, liberty and slavery were intertwined.Photo The Princeton research is being released amid renewed debate about slavery, the Civil War and national memory.It also arrives nearly two years after a student group at Princeton called the Black Justice League occupied the presidents office and demanded, among other things, that Woodrow Wilsons name be removed from places of honor on campus because of his racist ideas and actions.Wilson, a Princeton graduate and former president of the university, kept his place, and that controversy quieted down.The new research does not come with any recommendations for action.But Professor Sandweiss said she hoped it would foster a broader, more fully informed conversation about history and racial justice.Woodrow Wilson doesnt just come from nowhere, she said.He comes from this particular place.Unlike slavery research at some other institutions, the Princeton project was a bottom-up affair, originating with an undergraduate class that Professor Sandweiss began teaching in 2013, with help from the universitys archivist, Dan Linke.Early on, she told the administration what she was doing and said she didnt think it would be embarrassing to Princeton, she recalled.As the project grew, it was supported piecemeal by various partners, including the universitys art museum, which has commissioned a large-scale outdoor installation by the artist Titus Kaphar commemorating the 1766 slave sale, and the McCarter Theater, which has commissioned seven plays inspired by the research, to be performed later this month as part of a two-day public symposium.Advertisement Continue reading the main story [Playwrights on putting the ghosts of Princetons racial past onstage] Earlier this year, the project got more formal support from the administration, in the form of a grant from the Princeton Histories Fund, established in the wake of the Wilson controversy to support aspects of Princetons history that have been forgotten, overlooked, subordinated or suppressed.Princetons current president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, who will speak at the symposium, issued a statement praising the projects creativity, diverse perspectives and rigorous academic standards, which he said he hoped would promote a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of our history.That history is certainly imposing.Princeton, founded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, is the nations fourth-oldest university, and the one most associated with the American Revolution.Its sixth president, John Witherspoon, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence.In 1783, the Continental Congress briefly met in Nassau Hall, in the same room where campus lore holds that a cannonball (fired by Alexander Hamilton, no less) decapitated a portrait of George III six years earlier.Today, that room is lined with oil portraits of the universitys presidents, the first nine of whom owned slaves.(The researchers found no evidence that the university itself ever owned slaves.)On a recent morning, Professor Sandweiss paused in front of the likeness of Samuel Stanhope Smith (1751-1819).Photo Smith, a Presbyterian minister, helped inspire the colonization movement, which advocated resettling freed slaves in Africa.(Many leading colonization advocates, the researchers discovered, had Princeton connections.)But at a time when many educated whites believed that blacks had separate evolutionary origins, Smith also argued that racial differences were purely due to environment, and even advocated interracial marriage.Historians are fond of going around saying, Its complicated, Professor Sandweiss said.But it is complicated.Professor Sandweisss team, which included some 30 students and two full-time postdoctoral fellows, Craig Hollander and Joseph Yannielli, looked at subjects familiar from studies at other universities, like slavery-related donations and slave ownership among professors, including one who owned a slave as late as 1840.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But they also zeroed in on one of the distinctive, and fateful, aspects of Princetons history: its heavily Southern student body.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the archives, they found evidence of early administrators eagerness to recruit students from the South.To nail down some hard data, a dozen graduate students gathered in the archives one night and, with the cast album of Hamilton blaring, tracked down the places of origin for more than 2,000 names in their database of pre-Civil War students.Roughly 40 percent of students from the colleges founding until 1861, the researchers determined, came from the slaveholding South, with the figure spiking as high as nearly two-thirds in the early 1850s.(The figure for Harvard and Yale at that time was about 9 percent.)And as slavery moved southwest, a heat map on the website shows, so too did the student body.Princeton had more students from Mississippi in the decades before the Civil War than it does today, Professor Sandweiss said.This fact heavily influenced the culture at Princeton, which became more conservative as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified.In town, Southern students (as well as many Northern ones) encountered something unfamiliar: a proud, and longstanding, free black community.But inside the campus gates, the university was maintained as a safe space for the sons of slaveholders.Photo Unlike at Harvard and Yale, abolitionists were generally not invited to speak on campus.And when they did show up, violence sometimes ensued.In 1835, a gang of students descended on the towns African-American neighborhood in an attempt to lynch a white agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society who had come to address a secret meeting.(Researchers found no records of any attempts to discipline those students.)The next year, at commencement, a white student from South Carolina attacked a black abolitionist minister, Theodore Sedgwick Wright, shouting a racial slur.The universitys president, James Carnahan, a onetime slaveholder, published a letter denying that the attacker was a Princeton student or that any actual violence had occurred, and blaming Wright for the disturbance.But Princetons compromise over slavery, like the nations, didnt hold forever.In the universitys archives, R. Isabela Morales, a graduate student, found an 1846 diary in which a student from Mississippi described going out with other Southern bloods to hunt down a local black man they had scuffled with and try him in the worshipful court of Judge Lynch.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Another group of students, led by John Maclean Jr., a professor who later became Princetons first nonslaveholding president, mustered to try and stop them.The man was still whipped within an inch of his life, the diarist exulted, to the silent Satisfaction of all the arrayed collegians from the South!Princeton had a reputation as this moderate place, where Northerners and Southerners got along, Ms. Morales said.But here, 15 years before the Civil War, you have them dividing along battle lines to fight over the question of race.Photo As Southern states began seceding, Southern students began leaving campus.In student autograph books, Ms. Sandweisss team found poignant inscriptions traded by friends who would soon meet on the battlefield.Basically, theyre going off to kill their roommates, Professor Sandweiss said.The researchers have yet to figure out just when Southern students (like the Virginia-born Wilson, class of 1879), started coming back after the Civil War, and in what numbers.But the instinct to keep the sectional peace reasserted itself.An article on the website tells the story of the Civil War memorial carved on a wall just inside Nassau Hall in the 1920s the only one anywhere in the country, Professor Sandweiss said, to give no indication of which cause the names inscribed there fought for.The initial plan was to group them by side.But the universitys president at the time, John Grier Hibben, overruled it, saying no one shall know on which side these young men fought.Photo On todays campuses, the battles are often fought over monuments themselves.One of the new plays commissioned for the project, by Nathan Alan Davis, features a rawly funny dialogue between a statue of John Witherspoon, Princetons slave-owning Revolutionary War-era president, and a contemporary African-American student armed with a blowtorch.As part of the aftermath of the Wilson controversy, Princeton is already discussing ways to make its iconography more reflective of its current diversity.If you walk around campus, you see a lot of dead white men, Professor Sandweiss said.Thats not untrue to our history, but it is deeply untrue to what Princeton has worked hard to become in the past few decades.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sometimes, she said, its hard for history to catch up.

‘The Walking Dead’ Season 8, Episode 3: Cut to Black:::::Photo Season 8, Episode 3: Monsters A show as determinedly dismal as The Walking Dead cant allow for outright comic relief, but the series has recently found a more broadly leavening influence in Ezekiel, who begins and ends this weeks episode.The actor Khary Payton has done a marvelous job of extending the character beyond his colorful accouterment the elaborate wig, the slinking pet tiger to create a cohesive, winning personality.Payton plays Ezekiel as a kind king with a magnanimous spirit that endears him to his many subjects.In the opening sequence, His Majesty delivers a rousing oration to his warriors as they ready for a battle we glimpse in snatches of crosscuts.He energizes his soldiers with grandiloquence bordering on the Shakespearean, warning of bloodthirsty rogues and unrepentant cutthroats bent on nothing short of our pitiless destruction.The writers couldnt have chosen a more ill-suited character for the shows latest hot seat of red herring non-death.This weeks episode grants Ezekiel another stirring speech in the last scene to mirror his speech in the first, ultimately cuing up a chaotic assassination attempt.The episode cuts to black with his fate still hanging in the balance, the latest in a long series of manipulative cliffhangers designed to goose easy, short-term suspense.But when three of his loyal compatriots leap on him the moment bullets start flying, seasoned viewers see the writers leaving themselves a way out.Its the same old trick, gone from enraging to merely tiring.For its constant death fixation, this series has handled the topic carelessly and clumsily in its new season.Gabriel vanished without a trace, and after sustaining a mortal gunshot wound last week, Eric joins the ranks of the departed this week in another tearful goodbye that comes off as perfunctory.Set aside the inevitable pushback from the same fans who cried foul the last time this show tore a gay relationship asunder; Aarons guilt-stricken farewell to his lover gets an almost insultingly small amount of screen time, a clear indicator that the show isnt all that committed to its own emotional stakes.The show speeds through their teary farewell as if its an obligation that must be completed before its time for the good stuff.Regrettably, the A Plot isnt particularly worth rushing back to.The coalition of survivors continues to have a debate over dignity and danger.Negans militia loses ground this week, with many low-level flunkies landing themselves in custody while their leader remains at large.Their makeshift imprisonment in flimsy rope restraints poses yet another ethical quandary to our collected heroes, who must again reconcile their basic decency with practical concerns of resources and security.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After betraying Maggie and the denizens of the Hilltop, Gregory slithers back to their stronghold and pleads for a safe haven, claiming he only worked with Negan under duress a dystopian take on the good German argument.The larger caravan of prisoners follows soon after, and both requests for sanctuary leave those in power with a Hobsons choice: Use their precious food and water on people who were trying to kill them just hours earlier, or abandon the civility theyve spent years working to establish.This same push-pull between respect for human rights and the imperative to punish feels meaty in the real world, but when the writers briefly brush up against this wider significance, its incidental.
‘Outlander’ Finally Unveiled Jamie’s Big Secret. Here’s How the Writers Did It.:::::We realized, after losing one daughter in Paris and sending his other child away with Claire to the future, theres an empty part of him.He wants to wake up from the nightmare hes been in all these years.He wants to come back to the land of the living.And then comes this perfect night, this magical night Hogmanay, which is the Scottish version of New Years and there are these girls, and hes caught up in that moment of being a father figure, having paternal feelings.And Laoghaire appears, out of nowhere, like shes the ghost of Christmas Past.From there, we kind of justified the marriage.We know before Claire does.Were clued in, before it explodes.We went back and forth in the writers room about the how and the when and the why.The fundamental thing we wrested with was when when is he going to tell her?Its a structural argument, because it blows up the rest of the print shop episode.As soon as she walks into the print shop, and he accepts that shes actually back, there should be an alarm going off in his head: I married Laoghaire.How am I going to tell her?The Jamie Fraser that we know had better get this out in the open, and quickly.And Claire opens the door for that.In all versions in our version, in the book version she basically says, Did you ever fall in love with somebody else?So the question was, Do you do it then?Or do you do the book version, and do it later?We tried variations of Jamie telling Claire while they were still in Edinburgh, but it became a thing we couldnt get away from.Even when they try not to talk about it, its there.It swamps everything.And we didnt really want that episode to be about that.We wanted it to be about their reunion, getting to know each other again, and how theyve changed over 20 years.All the sweetness, and all the sex.So you opted to make the book version chronology work, with some revisions.I didnt want it to feel like when you got to Lallybroch, and this was revealed, that Jamie had just deliberately withheld it, because then youre going to be pissed at him.So we did lay in some foreshadowing that he was wrestling with it, and its more a sin of omission.I dont think the audience would believe for a second that Claire would respond by running back to Craigh na Dun, as she does in the books.Its a red herring.As soon as she says, Im out of here, youre kind of waiting for her to turn around.And if we were going to dramatize that, it would mean the journey would be one long voice-over, so lets not do that.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get expert TV and movie recommendations from the Watching newsletter The best of what to watch and where to watch it, delivered to your inbox twice a week.Instead, we can have Jamie explain, and understand his jangled nerves and feelings.He sent his wife and his unborn child to this other mans arms, and hes had a good, long 20 years to think about that.There would be a lot of resentment, hurt, anger and irrational feelings, since it was his decision to do it, and it would come to a place where that would come boiling out.We jokingly refer to Jamie in the writers room as the king of men, but at a certain point, you want to humanize him.He can do dumb things, too.Are you tracking certain plot elements now because they will have reverberations down the line, like you did with this one?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Major events like this one, definitely.Not everything.We do try to keep an eye on the future, especially when it comes to time travel.In Book 1, very, very little is said about the mechanics of time travel, and so as we werent actually paying that much attention to the hidden meanings of how and why people are able to go through the stones.And Diana Gabaldon would chime in, Remember, they use jewels, gemstones, and that has a whole mythology, and its only certain kinds of people.So when we were going to have Claire go through the stones at the end of Season 2, when shes going from the 18th century to the 20th century, we realized: Oh my gosh, she needs a gemstone.Weve got to give her a gemstone.So we had Jamie give her his fathers ring, which is actually a callback to something from the books we had not done, when Jamie gives her the ring at the wedding.We said: Oh!Lets give her that ring.And when she comes through the other side, youll see that the stone is actually gone, as a clue.When Claire discusses that this season, she also mentions her watch from her first trip through the stones.But if you watch that episode, her watch doesnt disappear until after shes been in the 18th century for a few minutes, when she tumbles down the hill.She never opened it up, though, so she never saw whether the jewel inside the watch was destroyed!By and large, when weve made those kinds of missteps, weve usually been able to fix them or correct them, even if it wasnt in the moment.We can find a way to retrofit it.There are people on the show who catch these

‘Outlander’ Season 3, Episode 8: The Secret Revealed:::::It could be fascinating for a man who prides himself on honor to face the all-too-human compromises he made in order to survive.And at the very least, he admits he lied to Claire because he was afraid to lose her.But that should be the beginning of either atonement or Jamies being the bad guy.Instead, we get a series of moments that set all that up, only to be undercut.Jamie gets short with Claire for assuming he fathered Laoghaires younger girl; he tells Laoghaires daughter that he and Laoghaire dinnae have a bond that keeps people together forever, a distinctly passive divorce chat; and Claires rage is sexualized, both by Jamie and then, after she gives in, by the show itself turning her anger into foreplay whether she wants it or not.(Its especially notable given that Jamies tactics would read as assault from any other character, as he stops her from leaving, breaks furniture and pins her down as she struggles against him.)But the episode doesnt ask him to reckon with any of it in fact, Jennys concern as she picks up the pieces is that Jamie is unhappy.This is thrown into even starker relief because Claire spends the episode doing uncomfortable penance for her 20-year absence.Jenny in the dark about time travel takes Claire to task for leaving without looking for Jamie, and for not reaching out to them.Did you think we were all just frozen in time, waiting for you to return?she asks.The camera follows Claire as she awkwardly hovers in the house that used to be a refuge, increasingly uneasy with her decision to return and feeling that all her old connections are lost.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Great.So, what about Jamie?Why should he expect Claire to forgive him for such a deliberate lie and such a cavalier response?Where is the depth of his character if he isnt affected by the hurt he inflicted?Is Laoghaires anger meant to be an excuse for Jamie not to apologize?Are we meant to think If you wont stay with me, then Id rather die is romantic and not just a guilt trip?(By the time Laoghaire is swinging a pistol, you get the sense that she and Claire are fighting over a man whos just not worth it not a great impression for your romantic lead.)Theres hope that this will yet become a problem Jamie actually has to deal with.Even the most picturesque cliffside vista in the world cant distract Claire from fearing that she traveled back through time for the sake of a man who isnt worth it.Its absolutely a concern worth exploring and one that could bear great dramatic fruit.The fact that young Ian gets captured by sailors, hurling them into another plot before Jamie actually has to answer for anything, is less promising.Outlander is meant to be a show about two imperfect people whose relationship is complicated but powerful.(The time travel is a useful narrative frame, but Claire and Jamie are the story.)But that requires two imperfect people.Someday, the show will make Jamie wrong about something.Not this time, though.Other Gossip Will you risk the man I am for the sake of the one you once knew?Dont ask a question unless you want to know the answer, Jamie.Are we supposed to be angry at Laoghaire who suffered through at least one abusive husband because she files for a lot of alimony in order not to feel pressured to marry again?Do they know theyre in the 18th century?Kudos to Terry Dresbach for Claires homemade riding habit, which has looked historically accurate but also just a sliver out of place both in Edinburgh and Lallybroch.
Performance Space 122 to Return to Its East Village Home:::::Photo Performance Space 122, one of New York Citys downtown bastions of innovative visual art, dance and theater, will return to its home in the East Village in January, after six nomadic years while the organizations building was renovated.Inaugurating the new space will be the 13th and final edition of Performance Space 122s Coil festival the first during the tenure of Jenny Schlenzka, a former Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 curator who became the institutions executive artistic director this year.In an email, Ms. Schlenzka said that Coil would be ending because there is not the same need for a performance festival in January as there was when Coil started.She added that, because Performance Space 122 will once again have a permanent home, we are eager to spread our programming over the entire year.Among Coils events, from Jan. 10 through Feb. 4, are three world premieres: Jupiters Lifeless Moons (Jan. 12-17), a theater piece by the composer and writer Dane Terry; Petra (Jan. 23-27), by the choreographer Dean Moss and inspired by Rainer Werner Fassbinders 1972 film The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant; and he his own mythical beast (Jan. 31-Feb. 4), David Thomsons dance work that draws from a variety of sources including Alfred Hitchcock, James Baldwin and Roland Barthes.
The Most Riveting Host in Late Night (and the Most Overlooked):::::In his first years on TBS, Mr. OBrien still seemed haunted by losing The Tonight Show, but his series now has the pleasing eccentricity of someone who doesnt care about ratings or expectations.In the past two weeks, he has brought on weirdo characters like Butterscotch, part of a long tradition of creepy clowns, and a guy doing a Dracula impression who cant stop making bad puns (I dont want to sound like your mummy but ), a bit that spun out unexpectedly into a story of addiction that led this bad joker to attend the Lestat Institute for Word Therapy.The fake institute, complete with serious-looking people in white lab coats, evoked Albert Brookss classic sendups of the conventions of comedy.Just because the premises of these sketches are tethered to a tradition doesnt mean they arent peculiar.Mr. OBriens brand of silliness has always been delightfully, often gruesomely askew.Recently, he began a sketch by asking strangers what they thought about the news that Sears would no longer be carrying Whirlpool appliances.But this man-on-the-street premise was only the setup, because after a few people expressed normal curiosity or indifference, one man appeared stunned, immediately called his family, went home and buried himself alive while they watched.The video ended in another interview with a person showing mild interest in the news, but in the background, the family looked down on the grave and set it aflame.While some jokes are connected to the calendar, like the clown for Halloween, many of them are evergreen.A punch line about the daily goings-on in Washington can get easy laughs from like-minded viewers.But they wont age well, and Mr. OBrien, generally speaking, aims for jokes that depend less on the news cycle than his competitors do.This even extends to how Mr. OBrien handles politics.While he does an ordinary joke or two about President Trump every night, he also produced one of the most truly daring episodes of political comedy this year, with a September show shot entirely in Israel and the Palestinian territories, one of his many episode-long forays into other cities.Mr. OBrien floated in the Dead Sea, engaged in some terrible haggling with street vendors and delivered a minute-long history of the area that covered thousands of years.Much of the special was simply Mr. OBrien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene.But he didnt only stay light.When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler.He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment online.Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks.Earlier this year, there were rumors that Conan was shifting to a weekly format, and Lord knows, after being a daily talk-show host since 1993, he has earned the right to a slower schedule.But heres hoping he sticks around, because more than anyone else on air, he is a reminder that talk-show hosting is an art form deserving respect.The increasing politicization of late-night comedy has been great for ratings, and has helped certain hosts find their voices, but its worth examining if it comes at a cost.Comedy doesnt need to serve a political end to be important.
‘Thor: Ragnarok’ Hits Theaters With a Thunderclap:::::Photo LOS ANGELES After a four-month absence from theaters, Walt Disney Studios returned over the weekend, releasing Thor: Ragnarok to blockbuster results and teaching rival studios a lesson about how to approach sequels to sequels.Thor: Ragnarok, the latest film from Disney-owned Marvel Studios, took in an estimated $121 million on 4,080 screens in North America over the weekend.That total was colossal even by superhero standards about 42 percent higher than opening-weekend results for Doctor Strange, released last fall, and 3 percent higher than what Spider-Man: Homecoming initially managed over the summer.Directed by Taika Waititi, an eccentric New Zealand filmmaker whose previous three movies played in art houses and collected a grand total of $9.5 million, Thor: Ragnarok has taken in an additional $306 million overseas, Disney said on Sunday.The film, starring Chris Hemsworth and Cate Blanchett, cost an estimated $180 million to make, not including at least $100 million in marketing costs.Interest in Thor: Ragnarok has been sizzling since Disney released a teaser trailer in April.In early September, an informal moviegoer poll conducted by Fandango, the online ticket seller, found that Mr. Waititis film was the most anticipated offering of the fall a surprise to Hollywood, which had expected Justice League, produced by Warner Bros. and set for Nov. 17 release, to easily dominate.(It was second.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story At first, few had been crying out for another Thor sequel.Marvels second stand-alone film about the character, Thor: The Dark World, took in $645 million worldwide in 2013.But critics were lukewarm, the production had been marked by behind-the-scenes creative clashes and one star, Natalie Portman, did not want to return.Photo Instead of taking the usual route with third chapters in successful Hollywood franchises Who cares about making a good movie?Take the money and run!Marvels movie chief, Kevin Feige, decided to radically retool the Thor series.With input from Mr. Hemsworth, Thor: Ragnarok became less self-serious and much more comedic, leaning into the absurdity of the main character, a beefcake god who carries a magic hammer and travels by rainbow.
How a Curator Attributed This Drawing to Michelangelo:::::Advertisement How a Curator Attributed This Drawing to Michelangelo There are more than 130 Michelangelo drawings in the exhibition opening next week at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer .They are here on loan from dozens of institutions around the world, and span the artists long creative life.But one of the works is a sort-of new arrival: a drawing in black chalk on white paper from about 1530, which the shows curator, Carmen C. Bambach, has attributed to Michelangelo.The work, which has been in the collection of the Stdel Museum in Frankfurt since the 19th century, is a fragment of a page, with handwriting across the top and a sketch of two figures, one a reclining male nude, at the bottom.In an interview, Dr. Bambach, a curator in the Mets department of drawings and prints, explained how she concluded that the work is in Michelangelos own hand.Image "Sleeping Reclining Male Nude With Boy-Genius," a chalk drawing on white paper, newly attributed to Michelangelo by Carmen C. Bambach, curator of the exhibition "Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Credit Stdel Museum, Frankfurt Challenging the Consensus Some experts considered the drawing at the bottom to be a copy of a Michelangelo original by Giorgio Giulio Clovio, Dr. Bambach said.Clovio is known to have made many such reproductions in the 16th century.But Dr. Bambach had doubts.She pointed to a Clovio work of more certain attribution, The Rape of Ganymede, a copy of a lost Michelangelo drawing, which hangs nearby in the exhibition.Image A Clovio drawing after a lost work by Michelangelo, "The Rape of Ganymede."Credit Royal Collection Trust/Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2017 Everything is very even on the paper, she noted.Especially when seen in person, as in the Met exhibition, the smooth grayscale of Ganymede contrasts starkly with Michelangelos style.That evenness is a consistent feature of Clovios drawings, including his originals and his copies.In the reclining nude, by comparison, the gnarled torso, the lightly sketched peripheral elements and the corrections made with parallel hatching are all hallmarks of Michelangelo.Mysterious Handwriting The handwriting across the top of the page was considered to be by an unknown person, Dr. Bambach said.But it was clearly not by Michelangelo, who left behind numerous letters and other documents for comparison.The script, however, is distinctive, she said, pointing to the left hooks that top certain letters, an unusual style that pointed her to another contemporary of Michelangelos.Image The handwriting shows distinctive left hooks on certain letters.Credit Stdel Museum, Frankfurt Sebastiano del Piombo, a Venetian-born artist who spent almost 20 years in Michelangelos orbit in Rome, was not only a painter, Dr. Bambach noted, but a poet.Enthralled by Michelangelos work, the younger Sebastiano often made paintings based on his drawings, and the two had an extensive correspondence.Michelangelo would send drawings, and Sebastiano frequently shared madrigals , poetic vocal arrangements that were sometimes set to music.Examining these letters led Dr. Bambach, who has studied the handwriting of the great artists of the period, to attribute the script to Sebastiano, whose handwriting includes the distinct hooked letters l and d. Sebastiano was left-handed, she noted, but he taught himself to write right-handed.But unlike any of the right-handed writers, she said, all the hooks of the letter go to the left rather than to the right.After that, she said, The natural question was, could the drawing be by Sebastiano del Piombo?Image A study by Sebastiano del Piombo for "The Christ Child and Infant Saint John the Baptist."Credit The Metropolitan Museum of Art She concluded that it could not be, pointing to an example of Sebastianos work nearby, a study for The Christ Child and Infant Saint John the Baptist.While Michelangelos drawings show an incisive, authoritative contour, examining Sebastianos work closely reveals fine, delicate strokes with multiple reinforcement outlines.Documentary Evidence When it was acquired by the Stdel Museum in 1850, the drawing was described as a Michelangelo, which might seem like persuasive evidence, except that many such 19th-century attributions have fallen under scrutiny from modern researchers.Two major 20th-century scholars, Bernard Berenson and Luitpold Dussler, both rejected the claim.The recent consensus among Dr. Bambachs colleagues was that the reclining nude was either by an unknown artist or a Clovio copy after a lost Michelangelo original.But she argued that the general skepticism directed at 19th-century attributions does a disservice to Johann David Passavant , who bought the drawing as a Michelangelo and was the greatest connoisseur of his generation.There is also a detailed inventory of Clovios possessions made in 1577, the year before his death.It included many of his own works, of course, but also two Michelangelo drawings, which, Dr. Bambach suggested, could include the reclining nude.(She was quick to note that without further evidence, this particular detail was a hypothesis, not a conclusion.)Michelangelos Lines All these signs would be merely suggestive, though, without the key evidence of Michelangelos style, Dr. Bambach said.In particular, she focused on the deeply incised contours of his work.Michelangelos drawings on paper are marked by a forceful use of chalk.Its very difficult to see in a reproduction, or even in person, without the use of a magnifying glass.But looking closely, you can discern what seem like two lines outlining the body of the reclining nude.But that is the result of the artist pressing with such force that the chalk gouges a slight channel in the surface of the paper, leaving behind a barely visible striation that distinguishes Michelangelo from the other possibilities, Dr. Bambach said.Image A detail of the "Sleeping Reclining Male Nude" showing the heavy contour line characteristic of Michelangelo.Credit Stdel Museum, Frankfurt Another point of comparison is a known Michelangelo work, Fall of Phaeton, now in the Royal Collection, where a finished figure very similar to the reclining nude sits at bottom.Image Michelangelos The Fall of Phaeton.Credit Royal Collection Trust/Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2017 Ultimately, attributing a drawing to a single artist relies upon several pieces of evidence, Dr. Bambach said.Its not enough to examine a single work closely.It must be considered in the context of other works, and facts about the artists life.Traditional connoisseurship in our field had always been done one by one, she said.So, This is not by Michelangelo, and the conversation stopped there.What I believe in is in thinking in terms of groups.Just as the building blocks of a language have to cohere when assembled, she added, the group of drawings that we are attributing to somebody have to make sense as a whole.But Dr. Bambach, as a scholar, is careful to couch her claims, even as she affirms them.I believe that we all have to have intellectual humility, so I will be very happy to be proved wrong, she said.But adding her new attribution of Sebastianos handwriting to the larger picture makes Michelangelo the simplest explanation, she added.This one drawing is only a part of a vast exhibition that took eight years to assemble, but nevertheless provided her with something thats rare for a scholar.When she made the connection to Sebastianos letters, she said, I felt like I had won the lottery!Even though art historians are paid nothing.But it was its always exciting.Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Nov. 13; metmuseum.org .Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Giving Michelangelo His Due.Finally.Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Review: ‘Uncommon Sense’ Looks at Life on the Autism Spectrum:::::Not that people with autism have been utterly absent from the stage.But too often they have been, like the young horse-mutilator in Equus, freaks and villains.More recently, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time featured a hero on the spectrum a role now being played, in a regional production, by Mickey Rowe, an actor with autism.And in Uncommon Sense, Andrew Duff, the actor who plays Moose, has a diagnosis of autism too.Still, it can be difficult to find ways to tell the stories of nonverbal characters like Moose and Lali authentically, when even their parents dont know what those stories are.Photo Mr. Paris and Ms. Paris-Carter, a couple with a family member on the spectrum, get around that problem by packing as much variety into their narrative as a 100-minute show will allow.As members of Tectonic Theater Project, they are expert mosaicists, comfortable with the process of research and montage that produced earlier Tectonic docu-plays like The Laramie Project.Though fiction, Uncommon Sense was developed over several years of investigation with autism families in Northern Iowa and elsewhere.The result can sometimes feel too programmatic.Putting across so many medical factoids and bits of real stories has the paradoxical effect of diminishing a sense of emotional truth.You can almost count the items on a worthy checklist being addressed, one by one, in the intercut vignettes: safety, sexuality, employability, the push-pull of independence.But with their exceptional and sometimes opaque traits, Moose and Lali and Dan and Jess, who are composites, never cohere as characters.Or perhaps thats just the perspective of a neurotypical observer a perspective that the play implicitly asks us to question.When the sound of silverware being sorted makes Lali miserable, Uncommon Sense helps us understand her discomfort by having us hear an avalanche of grating metal.(The sound design is by Stephanie Robinson.)When Jess reacts painfully to the fluorescent lighting vibration that a classmate doesnt even notice, she seriously asks him, Whats wrong with you?One persons disability is anothers exceptional awareness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even so, I suspect that most audience members who dont live with autism will have an easier time connecting to the stories of the parents, whose highest hopes for their children begin where the depths of other parents despair might end.Lalis mother, afraid that she will never be more than a thing to her daughter, dreams of a day when the girl might somehow be able to say, as other children do, whatever is on her mind.Spoiler alert: Be careful what you wish for.And Mooses parents must in the course of the play contend with the likelihood that their sons abilities may never improve.What kind of life will he have, and how much of their own lives can they sacrifice to provide it?By serving, in effect, as his brain in the world, are they preventing him from achieving whatever growth is possible?Would he be happier in an institution?What would happier mean?In the context of these racking questions, many of the plays comic devices, no doubt intended to balance the pathos, seem labored.(Dan, on a first date, licks a young womans feet as a cat might.)Strangely for a work about difference, the shape of the storytelling tends toward the conventional.Yet when uncomfortable scenes are allowed to develop naturally such as those in which Jess tries to manage a flirtation with the classmate shes tutoring real comedy, mixed with sadness, emerges.If Uncommon Sense had less of an overview in mind, it might have focused more profitably on this or any one of its other stories.As it is, under Mr. Pariss sometimes inventive but sometimes awkward direction, on a cramped multi-platform set by John Coyne, there is too much information pressing in from all sides.Neither the eye nor the mind is comfortable anywhere.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Which, on second thought, might be the most powerfully mimetic gesture in a play overfull of them.Uncommon Sense Sheen Center 18 Bleecker St. E.

‘Maybe I Am Arnold!’ How Michael Urie Agreed to Fill Harvey Fierstein’s Shoes:::::When asked by Mr. Fierstein and the plays director, Moiss Kaufman, to consider the role, Mr. Urie felt the same way.I never thought of myself as Arnold, he said.I thought they were insane.It was not that Mr. Urie, 37, hasnt played larger-than-life roles over the course of his career, from Marc St. James on the ABC comedy Ugly Betty, to Barbra Streisands assistant in the one-man play, Buyer and Cellar, to the frenetic lead in Gogols The Government Inspector recently.And after Torch Song, which runs through Dec. 9, he will play Hamlet at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington.But there was something about this part that Mr. Urie said he found daunting.In the first scene, the character is in drag, he said.And I thought, I could never do that.I could never be that guy.Im never going to be that free, that brave.It was way too scary.Mr. Fierstein said one reason he had held off bringing the show back to New York for 30 years was to make sure that he had the right Arnold.And while he knew Mr. Uries work, mostly from Ugly Betty, and said that he was a wonderful actor, it wasnt until a 2016 reading that he realized he had found his leading man.It was just there, Mr. Fierstein said.There was that thing you hope for, a magical connection between actor and role.The reading was equally revelatory for Mr. Urie: At the end, I thought, Maybe I am Arnold!Michael understood the character at that first reading, Mr. Kaufman said.And, he added, laughing, Actors arent always the best judges of what parts they should play.Photo Photo Noticed, but Not Typecast On a recent Saturday afternoon, in the three-hour break between the matinee and evening performances of Torch Song, Mr. Urie threaded his way through the crowds of Times Square to an early dinner at the Lambs Club, fashionably dressed in a dark green quilted jacket, a pair of skinny black jeans and black ankle high boots that he said were almost an exact replica of a pair his Ugly Betty character had worn.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As he passed a cluster of middle-aged men standing on the sidewalk, one spotted Mr. Urie, did a double-take and then yelled out, You were great last night.That was a trick, Mr. Urie said, not missing a beat.I dont remember his name.He was joking of course.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Urie lives with his boyfriend, Ryan Spahn, also an actor, in an apartment on the northern fringe of Hells Kitchen decorated with items taken from the sets of previous jobs.(Their dining room table is Vanessa Williamss desk from Ugly Betty and a bedroom lamp was lifted from the set of Partners, Mr. Uries short-lived CBS sitcom.)The two recently celebrated their nine-year anniversary by going to a disaster movie, the critically savaged Geostorm.(It was wonderfully terrible, he said, giggling.)At the restaurant, he glanced at the menu, announced that he tried to avoid both red meat and alcohol when doing a play, because they make him sleepy, and ordered the halibut, a side of roasted carrots and a Diet Coke.As the waiter walked away, Mr. Urie said he had only broken that dietary rule once, when he was in Washington doing Buyer and Cellar, and was up for a part in the Broadway revival of an award-winning play he declined to name: the role of the gay best friend to the female lead.The audition had gone well, and he and the director seemed to be on the same wavelength, he said.But that day, in between his matinee and evening performances, he got a call.You were great, Mr. Urie said the director told him.But there is one small, but probably insurmountable, obstacle: The estate that controls the rights is insisting that the role not be played by an openly gay character.The part went to someone else.Mr. Urie said he was so angry, I went out and had a beer and a huge hamburger.And then I went home to take a nap.Photo That was perhaps the only time in his career, he said, when his sexuality might have lost him a role.(He said the producers were convinced that if audiences knew the actor was gay it would take the ambiguity out of the opening scene in the play.)In fact, he said, his openness about his sexuality had mostly been a boon to his career: If I had never done these gay characters, you would have no idea of who I was, he said.You would never have heard of me.His Own Way In Getting the role in Torch Song was one thing.But Mr. Urie said he struggled early on with how to make it his own.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Should he get to know Mr. Fierstein, who based the character on his early career experiences as a drag performer?Spend more time with him?But I gradually realized he didnt want me to do him, or else he wouldnt have hired me, he concluded.He would have hired someone who was just like him.Mr. Fierstein was, however, a frequent and unpredictable presence at rehearsals.What was so funny is that he would always walk in the room when I would be questioning something about the role, Mr. Urie explained.I would read a line and then ask, Why do I even say this?And then I would hear from the back of the room, this voice yelling out he imitates Mr. Fiersteins raspy growl Who wrote this?I finally asked him, Do you wait out there in the hallway for 20 minutes, and then pick the perfect moment to come in the room?At another point, Mr. Urie asked Mr. Fierstein for guidance about his characters relationship with Ed, his bisexual, on-and-off lover.Why do I keep going back to him?Why do I love this guy?And Harvey said to me, Because he lets you.Which is such a great answer, because when you think of the gay community especially then we can be so withholding with love.There are reports, for now unconfirmed, that this critically acclaimed Torch Song will move to Broadway in the fall.No one involved will discuss that possibility.But Mr. Urie is convinced that this production has firmly reestablished the plays theatrical importance and the power of its message.I run into people all the time who tell me that they

Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: Miami During the Cocaine Boom:::::Photo For anyone who lived through the 1980s, the television series Miami Vice is the pastel-shaded, music-driven, drug-saturated image of the city forever seared into memory.At the center of this action in real life was the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, a hotel and club in the citys Coconut Grove neighborhood.Roben Farzad, whose family immigrated to the United States from Iran after he was born, grew up in Miami during those years.His new book, Hotel Scarface, is a raucous history of the cocaine boom as it played out at the Mutiny.(The 1983 movie Scarface, also set in this period in Miami, was filmed mostly in California.)All roads led back to the Mutiny, an undercover police officer who worked in Miami at the time told Farzad.The druggies, the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informant, cops good and bad were all there.Appropriately, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, the stars of Miami Vice, also were known to drop by.(Thomas even lived there for a time.)Below, Farzad talks about the haunting image that got him interested in the story, the filmmakers who inspired him as he tried to recapture a time and place, and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I encountered the Mutiny as an abandoned property 23 years ago, just before I left Miami I thought for good to go to college up north at Princeton.I had a severe case of senioritis in high school, and I had a job selling frozen lemonade at a street fair in front of this abandoned building.It didnt make sense.Coconut Grove is like the West Village of Miami.This was not a run-down part of town.Waterfront property gets snapped up.Back in the day, you had Richard Nixon and the Bee Gees docking their yachts in the marina there.People were staring at me from these collapsed balconies.Eddie Money was performing live across the street, singing, as if on cue, I want to go back / And do it all over / But I cant go back I know.I was really haunted.Im not given to the supernatural, but later I kept thinking back to that tableau.I think if I didnt get homesick, I wouldnt have thought back to it.It became a talisman almost.Whats the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?Some really smart, ambitious and strait-laced people class salutatorians, Federal Reserve Bank analysts morphed into cocaine dealers in no time at all.The profit motive, you couldnt resist it.Some very worldly people got a chance to get some cocaine for a few thousand dollars and turn it into much, much more money.And even if you tell yourself, Ill just do three or four kilos and let it go, its a victimless crime people couldnt do that.It took over their lives.
How We Used VR to Explore What Music Feels Like to a Deaf Person:::::James does not have a cochlear implant; he uses hearing aids.Like Rachel, he reads lips.Communicating on the phone with a deaf person is often not ideal, so we used video chat or email to correspond and give creative notes.I went to London to work with James and his colleagues for a few days, and interacting in person helped our process but I could say that about any collaboration.When I work with voice-over, Im hardly ever able to work out whats being said from the voice track alone, James explained.I can hear when something is being said, but not so much what is being said.So I use a combination of the audio track and the transcript with time stamps.The audio waveform, which I can see on the computer screen, helps me to sync things up.If I still cant work it out, theres usually a friendly producer nearby who can help me fill in the gaps.At one point, before we had a crucial sound cue built in, James threw in some sound cues himself, but the volume levels were really loud so he could hear them.When we watched and listened to that version together, the hearing collaborators dove for the volume.We all laughed about it and James apologized, but it taught us a lesson: Jamess sound cues were the only ones we felt as well as heard.That mattered for our sound design.In the moment when Rachels cochlear implants are turned on, we aimed to have a sound cue that jolted us physically.We also wanted an acoustically extraordinary setting.Since there is a detail in Rachels op-ed about her first experiences hearing live music after getting her implant, we asked her where those experiences happened and which ones were the most impactful.The Santa Fe Opera, near her home in New Mexico, was at the top of her list.It generously opened its doors, and the back wall of its open-air stage, so we could film Rachel there with a twilit desert backdrop.Photo While the animations were being developed, we landed a partnership with the technical wizards at Lytro to create our live-action scenes.Their light field technology can bring an extraordinary amount of depth and detail to a virtual reality image.The biggest VR camera we use regularly at The Times is about the size of a basketball.Lytros camera is the size of a sumo wrestler.It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece.Lytros system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece.If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away.If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle.This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel.Its what we call presence the magic of VR.During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast Love + Radio, which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling.I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant.The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadnt done before: hear music.In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadnt done before.We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachels story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved.In the VR department, our jobs are the most exciting when we can use a new technology to shine a light on an important story.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are several ways to experience Sensations of Sound and other NYT VR pieces.You can watch through the NYT VR apps in Oculus and Daydream headsets for an immersive experience.You can watch on your phone through the NYT VR app or by clicking on this link and waving your phone around to explore.Or you can watch on your computer and use your mouse to scroll around in the 360 video.

had another 85 minutes to go.Uncomfortable Monologue of the Week Mr. David, the creator and star of the HBO cringe-comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm, took the stage by joking to the audience, You tolerate me.You really, really tolerate me.He then put that proposition to the test with a discomforting monologue that even his cable-TV alter ego would have had trouble getting away with.A lot of sexual harassment stuff in the news of late, the real Mr. David said.And, uh, I couldnt help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging.Which is that many of the predators not all, but many of them are Jews.After a long grimace, Mr. David said, I dont like it when Jews are in the headlines for notorious reasons.I want, Einstein Discovers the Theory of Relativity.Salk Cures Polio.What I dont want?Weinstein Took It Out.Mr. David continued to think aloud: You know, Ive always, always been obsessed with women, and Ive often wondered, if Id grown up in Poland, when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp?I think I would.He added, Of course, the problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp.Imagining how such an interaction might unfold, Mr. David said, Hows it going?They treating you O.K.?You know, if we ever get out of here, Id love to take you out for some latkes.You like latkes?What, whatd I say?Is it me or is it the whole thing?Its cause Im bald, isnt it?Bernie Sanders Sketch of the Week Reprising a recurring role from last season, Mr. David played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, this

What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Shameless’ and ‘Last Week Tonight’:::::Photo Shameless returns with more drugs and poverty.Jenny Slate has a guest spot on Bobs Burgers.Whats On TV SHAMELESS 8 p.m. on Showtime.The Gallagher clan has endured deaths, mental illnesses, prison stints, addictions and so much more over seven bleak, hilarious seasons.They stumble into Season 8 after burying their matriarch, Monica; shes bequeathed them each with a bag of meth, which they handle with various degrees of maturity.The coming season deals in relevant plotlines like a new presidential administration and anti-immigration raids descending on the South Side of Chicago; within the family, Frank (William H. Macy) tries to sober up, and Fiona (Emmy Rossum) becomes a landlord.Photo BOBS BURGERS 7:30 p.m. on Fox.Of all of the cartoon sitcom families on TV, the only one youd probably want to be a part of is the Belchers, who, unlike the Simpsons, the Marshes or the Griffins, are kindhearted, generous and mostly just trying their best.In this episode, Tina (voiced by Dan Mintz) starts a babysitting enterprise, which is quickly derailed by her nemesis, Tammy (Jenny Slate, a voice-over veteran from The Secret Life of Pets, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On and many more).Bob and Linda scout out a competitor in the restaurant business.The Simpsons follows at 8 p.m., with Grampa getting a hearing aid.LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER 11 p.m. on HBO.In a climate where troubling or seismic news seems to break every day, a weekly news show like John Olivers runs the risk of missing essential stories or glossing over the details.But Mr. Oliver hasnt changed his methodical, slow-burning attacks, usually spending each episode skillfully dissecting one topic with plenty of zingers.This season he has gone after Equifax; Harvey Weinstein; and his No.1 antagonist, President Trump, and his relationship with the truth.RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS 11 p.m. on AMC.In the event of a zombie apocalypse, there arent many people you would rather have riding shotgun than Norman Reedus, who is still surviving as the lovable rogue Daryl on The Walking Dead.Ride With Norman Reedus puts the motorcycle enthusiast on the road to visit custom bike shops, tattoo parlors and smokehouses; in this episode in Spain, he is joined by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whos been terrorizing Daryl as Negan on The Walking Dead.Whats Streaming Photo MARC MARON: TOO REAL (2017) on Netflix.Things that get better with age: wine, cheese and Marc Marons curmudgeon act.His endearing grumpiness is on full display on his podcast, WTF; in his turn as a narcissistic, coke-addled director on GLOW; and especially in this new standup special.(His first sentence is I cant take it.)Mr. Maron goes off on the president, contemplates mortality while watching the Rolling Stones live and lampoons the landscape of streaming services that churns out an endless supply of meaningless content with a pinch of sarcasm, of course.

Preet Bharara Goes to the Theater and Sees a Familiar World on Stage:::::His handling of the Cohen case, in particular, in which Mr. Cohens hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, pleaded guilty to insider trading and paid a record $1.8 billion penalty, made him something of a household name, landing him on the cover of Time (as well as on the list of its 100 Most Influential People of 2012) and even reportedly inspiring the character of Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti, in Billions.A New Yorker 2016 profile, headlined The Showman, in print, was more direct in the web version: The Man Who Terrifies Wall Street.That fame only increased after perhaps the most dramatic event in his legal career: being forced out of his position by President Trump on March 11.Mr. Bharara went on the offensive almost immediately, posting his version of events on the Twitter account he had started only five days earlier.I did not resign, Mr. Bharara stated.Moments ago I was fired.Being the US Attorney will forever be the greatest honor of my life.The tweet got 63,000 retweets and 133,000 likes.(He now has 495,000 Twitter followers.)Since that acrimonious parting, Mr. Bharara has begun to build a nascent media empire.In addition to signing on as a visiting professor at New York University School of Law, he is also a paid commentator on CNN, has signed a book contract with Knopf (the thought of the July deadline for his manuscript is a bit scary, he said), and has started a podcast, "Stay Tuned With Preet Bharara, with his brother Vinit, a technology entrepreneur.And he has kept up his gimlet-eyed observations of the Trump administration.If Donald Trump fires Robert Mueller, he should be impeached, Mr. Bharara tweeted on Oct. 31.Period.At the Junk opening, Mr. Bharara, dressed in a Boss suit and a Canali tie (close to, but not quite the Brooks Brothers and Brioni uniform of the predatory Wall Street kings cited in the plays opening lines), seemed as much as

chance to shake your hand.(And at the after-party at Tavern on the Green, one particularly effusive woman said to Mr. Bharara: You are a buoy in the roiled waters of these troubled times.)Does this kind of thing occur often?Mr. Bharara was asked.Yes, he said.This is what happens when you are fired by the president.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As he walked back to his seat,

in particular seemed especially knowing about the world he once inhabited one that showed a government informant fumbling his attempts to draw out incriminating statements from his boss in a wiretapped phone conversation.There is a lot of speculation right now about whether George Papadopoulos was wearing a wire, people saying that if he wore a wire, he must have gotten good information, Mr. Bharara said of the man who recently pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.as part of the Robert Mueller investigation into the 2016 election.And I was trying explain to people that just because someone wears a wire if he was wearing a wire doesnt mean you are going get anything good."Sometimes you have very good actors and they draw other bad guys in, he said.But sometimes you have a halting, nervous, unsuccessful attempt.They go into a meeting and they ask too many questions like that character did tonight and they get told, stop with the questions!and you walk away with nothing.Thats what went on it that scene.It rang totally true.(The playwright and Mr. Bharara had met briefly in the lobby before the play started, with Mr. Akhtar telling Mr. Bharara: You are such a hero to me, not just because our shared background, referring to their South Asian heritage, but also because of all you have done for this country.)At the after-party, a surprising number of people wanted to talk about Mr. Bhararas podcast, which seems to have attracted a devoted following in its short tenure.Preet?You are Preet, arent you?an elegantly dressed woman called out as Mr. Bharara passed by on his way to the buffet station of sliders and french fries.She beckoned him over to her table."I just wanted to tell you I love your podcast, she said.Its just tremendous."Thank you, Mr. Bharara said.Its No.5 on iTunes this week.Then he laughed, and added, Not that Im checking.With that, he was soon out the door, on his way home to Westchester.He left his last words for Twitter,

H. Weiler wrote that serious criticism of such an esteemed institution would be tantamount to throwing rocks at Buckingham Palace.Nearly 50 years later, that institution continues to flourish (and in a video made for the 2012 Olympics opening ceremonies, Daniel Craigs Bond did indeed film a scene inside Buckingham Palace).Plus, Mr. Lazenbys turn is now highly regarded: It topped a 007 Magazine poll rating all of the Bond films.The second- and third-place finishers, Goldfinger (1964) and From Russia With Love (1963), are also streaming on Amazon.Photo 42 (2013) on iTunes, Amazon and Netflix.Chadwick Boseman plays Jackie Robinson in this biopic, with Harrison Ford as the Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey.The movie does a good job of dramatizing the salient emotions of the moment and the racism that surrounded Robinson and every other black American of his time, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times, adding that the director Brian Helgeland avoids the trap that so many depictions of the Jim Crow era fall into, which is to imply that racial prejudice was an individual or regional pathology rather than a national social norm.

across North America.He carried squeeze bottles filled with white paint for the outline and red paint for the make-believe blood.I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene, Penny Arcade, the performance artist, says in Shadowman, a forthcoming documentary about Mr. Hambleton, directed by Oren Jacoby.After seeing another outline, she says, she realized that this may be something else, but I didnt have any language for it.Mr. Hambleton studied maps to determine where, in each city, he would strike next.I began to think I was murdering people, going back to my hotel covered in paint, blood, blood-red paint, he says in the documentary, adding, Blood has a beautiful color.Photo Announcing that Dick Trace-It, also known as Richard Hambleton, was the private detective trying to solve the murders in Vancouver, he posted 4,000 fake wanted posters seeking the apprehension of Mr. Reee for the crimes.In 1980, soon after moving to the Lower East Side, he started another urban art project, installing full-size photographic images of himself, dressed up in a suit and tie and staring, on walls around the city and elsewhere.He called it I Only Have Eyes for You.The images were printed on paper that stretched when moistened and faded to white shadows after three months.His early Shadowman period led to shadow images of bucking horses and riders on walls and canvases.By 1984, he had turned to the Marlboro Man, the cowboy figure whose macho image promoted cigarettes for decades.Mr. Hambleton, who smoked, toyed with the image, painting shadow figures over it, sometimes mixing tobacco with black paint for what he called a black lung effect.Richard Art Hambleton was born in Vancouver on June 23, 1952.His parents, Arthur and Vale Hambleton, survive him, as do two sisters and a brother.Photo After graduating from the Emily Carr University of Art & Design in Vancouver, he started the Pumps Center for Alternative Art, a gallery, performance and video space, in the same city.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By the mid-1980s he had begun his transition to creating enormous seascapes, among them turbulent ocean-wave paintings.I wanted to do something that was a different sensibility, he says in the documentary.Its about love.Reviewing an exhibition of Mr. Hambletons paintings at the Piezo Electric Gallery in the East Village in 1985, Michael Brenson of The New York Times wrote that the violence inherent in his early Shadowman work had not fully left him.There are three paintings called Rainstorm, in which raging water seems to be rushing toward us from within the canvas, Mr. Brenson wrote.In each of the paintings, sea and sky rage a bit more until they seem on the point of swallowing everything.Mr. Hambleton soon moved into his beautiful period, painting landscapes with gold and silver leaf and tinted varnishes.Photo But by the early 1990s he had begun to withdraw from the art scene.Mr. Haring had died of AIDS at 31, Mr. Basquiat of a drug overdose at 27, and Mr. Hambleton, Ms. Woodward said, had become paranoid about gallery culture and the impact on the artist and his freedoms.His life had begun to unravel.His drug use continued.His skin cancer worsened.He lived in increasing squalor.His goal was to reach the sublime, Ms. Woodward said.He used drugs to get there.It was just who he was.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2009, two art entrepreneurs cajoled him into producing some new work, paintings of shadowy figures wearing suits, which were added to a retrospective exhibition in New York sponsored by Giorgio Armani.For his documentary, Mr. Jacoby filmed Mr. Hambleton as he procrastinated and battled with his anxious patrons.The show, which traveled to Europe the next year, was successful, and a comeback seemed possible.But the moment did not last long.While Mr. Hambleton kept painting almost until he died, he was becoming increasingly frail.His cancer was eroding his face.His back was bowed and lopsided from his spinal conditions.He used his folding bicycle as a walker.At times he was homeless.At least Basquiat, you know, died, he says bitingly in the documentary, during a scene shot in 2014.I was alive when I died, you know.Thats the problem.

Louvre Abu Dhabi, a Cultural Cornerstone Where East Meets West:::::The bounty is evident for many of the 13 French museums in the consortium.The Fontainebleau castle is lending a giant 16th-century bronze, the Apollon du Belvdre.In turn, it is receiving a check for about $5.8 million that it will invest in the restoration of its own Imperial Theater, which will be renamed for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates.The Muse de Cluny, which is lending a jeweled 13th-century box, is funding half of an $8.8 million renovation of its reception area with money from the Louvre Abu Dhabi project..A small part of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is dedicated to contemporary and modern art.The rest focuses on telling the story of world histories and religions, with an emphasis on mixing works from different places.Photo Beyond loans, the team of six curators have been scouting for art from private collections.They have acquired more than 600 works, including Piet Mondrians 1922 Composition With Blue, Red, Yellow and Black, bought in 2009 for $27.9 million from Christies auction of the collection of Yves St. Laurent and Pierre Berg.Another important purchase was a Renaissance painting of the Madonna and Child by Giovanni Bellini, which museum officials say demonstrates a commitment to highlighting works that reflect different religions.What is the Louvre Abu Dhabi?Its a narrative of humankind from the beginning of knowledge, using art as a witness of the times, said Jean-Franois Charnier, the projects chief curator and scientific director for Agence France-Museums.Photo Some museum curators feared the Louvre Abu Dhabis buying spree could send global art prices surging.But Jean-Patrice Marandel, a curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said the new museum has not affected the market at all.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It does not have an image yet or a brand or a flavor, he added.A constant question for the new museum is how bold it will be.Ms. des Cars, who as former director of acquisitions had placed the winning bid for the Mondrian painting at an auction, insisted that cultural officials here have taken some daring positions dealing with religion and nudity.Mr. Mubarak took pains in an interview to praise the beauty of a newly acquired Yemeni Torah.It will be exhibited with a sixth-century Quran and gothic Bible.The museum commissioned a new piece by the American artist Jenny Holzer, who carved three stone walls with historic scripts in cuneiform, Arabic and French, drawing from a Sumerian Creation Myth and an essay on self-determination by Michel de Montaigne, the Renaissance philosopher.Photo I had to have the content reviewed, but no one said no, she said, when asked if there were any restrictions.She hopes to create an app for museum visitors to pick their own creation myths to project on the stone walls.Abu Dhabi officials are already preparing for the future.Mr. Mubarak predicted that the Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a domino effect and that the construction contract for the long-planned Guggenheim Abu Dhabi could be awarded next year.(A Guggenheim spokesman declined to comment.)In the meantime, Jean-Luc Martinez, the director of the Louvre Museum, said the project has already had a dramatic effect in France.Thanks to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, our museums were forced to work together after 50 years of development.We have some egos, he added, with Gallic understatement.Thats a revolution in mentality.
Museum Leader Who Resigned Calls Controversy a ‘Misunderstanding’:::::Known as one of the most influential figures in the world of international contemporary art, Ms. Ruf was hired to run the Stedelijk in 2014.Her tenure has been distinguished by critically acclaimed programming and an ambitious collaboration with the renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to redesign the museums layout to better present its permanent collection.Ms. Rufs sudden departure, accompanied by only very general public statements from Stedelijk officials and, until now, just a single quote from Ms. Ruf in a news release, had cast a shadow on her reputation and left lingering concerns about the Stedelijk boards ability to govern with transparency.The situation has also raised broader questions about the accountability of government-owned Dutch cultural institutions, which are substantially funded by the state and owe the public explanations of their policies and practices.Ms. Ruf agreed to an exclusive interview by email with The Times, saying that she hoped to clarify her role in what she called a misunderstanding.She advised that her responses would be vetted by her lawyers before being sent to The Times.All of her side activities were contractually approved by the Stedelijk before she took the job, Ms. Ruf wrote.Throughout her responses, she said several times, I am confident that I reported everything in good faith.Madeleine de Cock Buning, the acting chairwoman of the museums supervisory board was forwarded Ms. Rufs comments and replied by email saying that the board had begun two independent investigations.We have decided not to answer questions of the media while the investigations are going on, she added.Ms. Ruf, who was born in Singen, Germany, and who worked as a curator and choreographer, mostly in Switzerland, came to the Stedelijk from the Kunsthalle Zurich, where in 12 years as director she made a name for herself by mounting cutting-edge exhibitions by artists such as Trisha Donnelly, Wade Guyton and Seth Price.Mark Reutter, who was chairman of the Kunsthalles board at the time, said that her contract with the Kunsthalle allowed her to do outside work as an art adviser and consultant.The Kunsthalle does not have its own collection and does not purchase artworks, so there was no potential conflict of interest.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Rufs primary side activity while employed by the Kunsthalle was working as a salaried art adviser to the wealthy Swiss publisher and art collector Michael Ringier, who, over 20 years, collected a trove of more than 4,000 works of contemporary art with Ms. Rufs help.When she was offered the job at the Stedelijk, Ms. Ruf wanted to continue this kind of art advisory work, she said, adding that she had sought and received approval from the museums board to do so.She said she then established Currentmatters for this purpose.Photo The Stedelijks most recent annual report lists 18 additional functions that Ms. Ruf provided, such as acting as a jurist for international art prizes, advising or serving on boards of art institutions in Moscow, Rome, Vienna and Dhaka, Bangladesh, and advising the American bank Goldman Sachs on their corporate art collection in London.Benno Tempel, director of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, said that he felt it was acceptable for museum directors to sit on juries and boards, but if theres money involved, that money should go to the institution.Jo Houben, director of the Dutch nonprofit organization Culture+Entrepreneurship, which established a local code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said that any side activities that benefit an individual rather than the institution they work for is not consistent with the codes principles.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But theres a big difference if the board allowed her to do that and they knew what was happening, he added.If the supervisory board allowed the director to do something, and it turns out to be not a good choice, then the board may have to resign.Mr. Houben added that the Stedelijk building is owned by the city of Amsterdam, and the city and the Dutch state finance the institution.So if you work there you have to be aware that you work with public money and behind the public money are public values, and that means you work for the public and not for your private interest, he said.Under a rule in the code of ethics called comply or explain, he added, its fine for an organization to make its own special arrangements that deviate from the code, but the document recommends that the institution inform the public about it in its annual report or some other public document.I dont see any place where the board communicates that they dont follow the code, Mr. Houben said.In 2015, Currentmatters reported a profit of about $500,000 to the Dutch tax authorities, but Ms. Ruf said that the number was misleading: Many people wrongly assumed these profits came from side activities conducted in 2015 while I was artistic director of the Stedelijk Museum, she said.In fact, this profit statement reflects legitimate income from activities conducted before 2015, primarily a parting bonus for past work from the Ringier Collection in the amount of 1 million Swiss Francs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Ruf said that her actual earnings from approved side activities were 104,000 euros, or around $120,000, per year in 2015 and 2016.She said that the 378,000 she reported in 2015, and 628,000 that she earned in 2016 came from activities conducted before 2015, and primarily reflected the bonus from Mr. Ringier.On Wednesday, Ms. Ruf is required to report her 2016 earnings to the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands and these figure will become publicly available.Mr. Ringier confirmed in a phone interview that he had given Ms. Ruf the thank you gift of 1 million francs, paid in installments over 2015 and 2016.He said that he did this because Ms. Ruf added value in the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions to his collection.The money that I think everybody talks about in this company is the money she got for the 20 years of work for us, Mr. Ringier said.It had nothing to do with an ongoing advisorship.We absolutely wanted to avoid a conflict of interest, Mr. Ringier said.Even though Ms. Ruf said the Stedelijks board had approved her side activities for the Ringier collection, she said that she and Mr. Ringier decided it would be best if they no longer worked together, and she sent her last invoice in December 2014.The Stedelijks board did not respond to questions about whether Ms. Ruf reported to the museum that she received the bonus from Mr. Ringier.Ms. Ruf declined to comment on that question.In spite of what she said were efforts to report everything in good faith, questions remained about whether her arrangement with the Stedelijk from the beginning followed international and national codes of ethics.Mijntje Lckerath-Rovers, a professor of corporate governance at Tilburg University and the chairman of the committee that drafted the code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said in a phone interview, If there was some logical explanation, they could have said, Sorry that we were not that transparent in the beginning, we now want to be as transparent as possible, and here is what happened.In that case, she said, Ms. Ruf could have kept her job.The absence of any such explanation does give the outside world, including me, the idea that something is not completely right, Professor Lckerath-Rovers said.From my perspective, transparency is lacking here and thats the most important thing, especially because youre working with public money.
How a Curator Attributed This Drawing to Michelangelo:::::Advertisement How a Curator Attributed This Drawing to Michelangelo There are more than 130 Michelangelo drawings in the exhibition opening next week at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer .They are here on loan from dozens of institutions around the world, and span the artists long creative life.But one of the works is a sort-of new arrival: a drawing in black chalk on white paper from about 1530, which the shows curator, Carmen C. Bambach, has attributed to Michelangelo.The work, which has been in the collection of the Stdel Museum in Frankfurt since the 19th century, is a fragment of a page, with handwriting across the top and a sketch of two figures, one a reclining male nude, at the bottom.In an interview, Dr. Bambach, a curator in the Mets department of drawings and prints, explained how she concluded that the work is in Michelangelos own hand.Image "Sleeping Reclining Male Nude With Boy-Genius," a chalk drawing on white paper, newly attributed to Michelangelo by Carmen C. Bambach, curator of the exhibition "Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Credit Stdel Museum, Frankfurt Challenging the Consensus Some experts considered the drawing at the bottom to be a copy of a Michelangelo original by Giorgio Giulio Clovio, Dr. Bambach said.Clovio is known to have made many such reproductions in the 16th century.But Dr. Bambach had doubts.She pointed to a Clovio work of more certain attribution, The Rape of Ganymede, a copy of a lost Michelangelo drawing, which hangs nearby in the exhibition.Image A Clovio drawing after a lost work by Michelangelo, "The Rape of Ganymede."Credit Royal Collection Trust/Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2017 Everything is very even on the paper, she noted.Especially when seen in person, as in the Met exhibition, the smooth grayscale of Ganymede contrasts starkly with Michelangelos style.That evenness is a consistent feature of Clovios drawings, including his originals and his copies.In the reclining nude, by comparison, the gnarled torso, the lightly sketched peripheral elements and the corrections made with parallel hatching are all hallmarks of Michelangelo.Mysterious Handwriting The handwriting across the top of the page was considered to be by an unknown person, Dr. Bambach said.But it was clearly not by Michelangelo, who left behind numerous letters and other documents for comparison.The script, however, is distinctive, she said, pointing to the left hooks that top certain letters, an unusual style that pointed her to another contemporary of Michelangelos.Image The handwriting shows distinctive left hooks on certain letters.Credit Stdel Museum, Frankfurt Sebastiano del Piombo, a Venetian-born artist who spent almost 20 years in Michelangelos orbit in Rome, was not only a painter, Dr. Bambach noted, but a poet.Enthralled by Michelangelos work, the younger Sebastiano often made paintings based on his drawings, and the two had an extensive correspondence.Michelangelo would send drawings, and Sebastiano frequently shared madrigals , poetic vocal arrangements that were sometimes set to music.Examining these letters led Dr. Bambach, who has studied the handwriting of the great artists of the period, to attribute the script to Sebastiano, whose handwriting includes the distinct hooked letters l and d. Sebastiano was left-handed, she noted, but he taught himself to write right-handed.But unlike any of the right-handed writers, she said, all the hooks of the letter go to the left rather than to the right.After that, she said, The natural question was, could the drawing be by Sebastiano del Piombo?Image A study by Sebastiano del Piombo for "The Christ Child and Infant Saint John the Baptist."Credit The Metropolitan Museum of Art She concluded that it could not be, pointing to an example of Sebastianos work nearby, a study for The Christ Child and Infant Saint John the Baptist.While Michelangelos drawings show an incisive, authoritative contour, examining Sebastianos work closely reveals fine, delicate strokes with multiple reinforcement outlines.Documentary Evidence When it was acquired by the Stdel Museum in 1850, the drawing was described as a Michelangelo, which might seem like persuasive evidence, except that many such 19th-century attributions have fallen under scrutiny from modern researchers.Two major 20th-century scholars, Bernard Berenson and Luitpold Dussler, both rejected the claim.The recent consensus among Dr. Bambachs colleagues was that the reclining nude was either by an unknown artist or a Clovio copy after a lost Michelangelo original.But she argued that the general skepticism directed at 19th-century attributions does a disservice to Johann David Passavant , who bought the drawing as a Michelangelo and was the greatest connoisseur of his generation.There is also a detailed inventory of Clovios possessions made in 1577, the year before his death.It included many of his own works, of course, but also two Michelangelo drawings, which, Dr. Bambach suggested, could include the reclining nude.(She was quick to note that without further evidence, this particular detail was a hypothesis, not a conclusion.)Michelangelos Lines All these signs would be merely suggestive, though, without the key evidence of Michelangelos style, Dr. Bambach said.In particular, she focused on the deeply incised contours of his work.Michelangelos drawings on paper are marked by a forceful use of chalk.Its very difficult to see in a reproduction, or even in person, without the use of a magnifying glass.But looking closely, you can discern what seem like two lines outlining the body of the reclining nude.But that is the result of the artist pressing with such force that the chalk gouges a slight channel in the surface of the paper, leaving behind a barely visible striation that distinguishes Michelangelo from the other possibilities, Dr. Bambach said.Image A detail of the "Sleeping Reclining Male Nude" showing the heavy contour line characteristic of Michelangelo.Credit Stdel Museum, Frankfurt Another point of comparison is a known Michelangelo work, Fall of Phaeton, now in the Royal Collection, where a finished figure very similar to the reclining nude sits at bottom.Image Michelangelos The Fall of Phaeton.Credit Royal Collection Trust/Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2017 Ultimately, attributing a drawing to a single artist relies upon several pieces of evidence, Dr. Bambach said.Its not enough to examine a single work closely.It must be considered in the context of other works, and facts about the artists life.Traditional connoisseurship in our field had always been done one by one, she said.So, This is not by Michelangelo, and the conversation stopped there.What I believe in is in thinking in terms of groups.Just as the building blocks of a language have to cohere when assembled, she added, the group of drawings that we are attributing to somebody have to make sense as a whole.But Dr. Bambach, as a scholar, is careful to couch her claims, even as she affirms them.I believe that we all have to have intellectual humility, so I will be very happy to be proved wrong, she said.But adding her new attribution of Sebastianos handwriting to the larger picture makes Michelangelo the simplest explanation, she added.This one drawing is only a part of a vast exhibition that took eight years to assemble, but nevertheless provided her with something thats rare for a scholar.When she made the connection to Sebastianos letters, she said, I felt like I had won the lottery!Even though art historians are paid nothing.But it was its always exciting.Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Nov. 13; metmuseum.org .Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Giving Michelangelo His Due.Finally.Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Yayoi Kusama and the Amazing Polka-Dotted, Selfie-Made Journey to Greatness:::::Sometimes I think Yayoi Kusama might be the greatest artist to come out of the 1960s and one of the few, thanks in part to her long life, still making work that feels of the moment.Other times I think shes a bit of a charlatan who produces more Kusama paintings than the world needs and stoops to conquer with mirrored Infinity rooms that attract hordes of selfie-seekers oblivious to her efforts on canvas.Ms. Kusamas current three-ring circus of exhibitions at David Zwirners uptown and downtown spaces which include 76 works on canvas argue in favor of greatness.Photo While there are the inevitable Infinity rooms on view in Chelsea, the shows give her paintings a new forcefulness; with their fluctuating rhythms and imaginative images, they could even win over fans who only have eyes for her Instagrammable environments.On all fronts, Ms. Kusama has a formidable urge toward art and fame fueled by what seems to be a steely will and also a great mental focus partly a function of psychological imbalances that have led to periods of hospitalization.(She began to experience visual and auditory hallucinations as a child and they continue.)She has characterized art as her chance for salvation both here and in the afterlife.Photo Now 88, Ms. Kusama works nonstop and, if youre wondering, does all the painting herself, save for a ground color applied by assistants.Recently she shifted her workweek from five days to six, saving Sunday for writing, reading, talking on the phone and making smaller paintings.She and her art run the gamut from avant-garde to popular to outsider to whiz-bang conjuring.The pixieish creature we see in a bright orange wig wearing clothes printed with patterns from her art is only her most recent public persona.She plays cute grandma to Jeff Koonss cheerful robot, to cite another widely known artists self-presentation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The new Zwirner space in New York, on East 69th Street, is presenting Infinity Nets, a beautiful display of 10 paintings, all from this year, that make a surprisingly good case for Ms. Kusamas continuing reprises of her Net paintings from the early 1960s.Who knows how many of these works exist, but individually they can mesmerize.Their surfaces of little commalike strokes resembling knitting are ancestors of the artists polka dots.
Coming Face to Face With Jimmie Durham:::::Handwritten words mark the figures brick-pink skin like tattoos.Some are first-person confidences (Hello!Im Jimmie Durham.As an artist Im confused about many things; I have 12 hobbies!11 houseplants!).Others are like a clinicians notes.(Mr. Durham has stated that he believes he has an addiction to alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine; Indian penises are unusually large and colorful.)The piece is one of the great sculptural selfies of the late 20th century.Its both a record and an invention, a compound of false history and genuine cultural clich.Photo When Mr. Durham does dramatize specific indigenous history, the results can be stirring.In a life-size image of Hernn Corts, the 16th-century invader of Mexico becomes a mechanized pale-faced monster, a juggernaut of pipes and pulleys.No real surprise.But a corresponding figure of the native woman named Malinche, Cortss slave, interpreter and mistress, has a very different presence.She is often derided in Mexico as a traitor to her people, a colonial sellout.But Mr. Durham depicts her skeletal limbs, tiny whittled hands, disconsolate stare with a tenderness thats almost disconcerting in the context of an exhibition otherwise laced with needling, jibing bitterness.A source of this bitterness is the artists unsleeping awareness of colonialisms persistence anti-native, anti-nature, anti-difference as a condition of American life.In 1994, in the spirit of protest, he and Ms. Alves relocated to Europe, where they now divide their time between Berlin and Naples, Italy.Mr. Durham hasnt set foot in his homeland in over 20 years.I am not a Native American, nor do I feel that America has any right to either name or un-name me, he said in a 1996 interview.Overt signs of American Indian culture have receded in his art over time.The more recent work in the retrospective organized by Anne Ellegood, senior curator of the Hammer Museum, and installed by Elisabeth Sussman and Laura Phipps at the Whitney includes homages to nonnative artists who have influenced him, among them Alexander Calder and David Hammons.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A brand-new billboard-size piece, The Free and the Brave, installed on a Whitney terrace, combines photographs of Indian country in the American Southwest with a self-portrait of Mr. Durham playing what looks like a Gypsy version of Marcel Duchamps drag alter ego Rrose Slavy, but that might also refer (Im just guessing here) to the famous 1890 photograph of the Lakota Sioux chief Spotted Elk, or Bigfoot, who was found frozen to death, a scarf over his head, after the Wounded Knee massacre.The address of Mr. Durhams work has always been both global and local, as it is in a short 2003 film called Pursuit of Happiness, which places a comedy version of his career in the context of the international art world.The films protagonist, named Joe Hill (and played by a real artist, Anri Sala), lives alone in a trailer on empty scrub-grassland.He scours the terrain for organic castoffs rotten fruit, road kill and makes collages.A gallery spots him, gives him, this unsmiling outsider, a show.The art crowd turns out.The shows a hit!The dealer (played by Mario Pieroni) hands him wads of cash.Now the new Chosen One, Joe Hill torches his trailer and heads for the Big Time (Paris, in the film).The narrative is simplistic, but accurate.The art world or that part of it represented by the nexus of museums, art fairs, auction houses, collectors and promoters that comprise the market periodically makes exactly such one-off choices when it comes to artists perceived as ethically or socially marginal.We have lots of white male superstars these days, but only one Chinese (Ai Weiwei) and one black African (El Anatsui).Mr. Durham has been assigned the Native American slot.Once such decisions are made, the diversity quota filled, the door shuts.Race-based tokenism justifiably sparks resentment.And I suspect that this resentment has done much to fuel the calling out of Mr. Durhams ethnic bona fides.But to focus on shaming an artist for what is, on the evidence of this show, a truly brilliant, half-century-long act of politically driven self-invention, strikes me as self-defeating.Far better to direct that anger at the institutions that make the decisions about what art is bought and shown.The Whitney is one, and we should demand that the place where Mr. Durham now stands should be taken by Native American artists, one after another, when he moves on.
Kahlil Joseph’s New Film Is Steeped in Harlem’s History. And His Own.:::::But in 2014, Mr. Joseph had just completed a 14-minute film that he couldnt release.It was based on work hed done for Mr. Lamar, after the release of his album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.Blending home video from Mr. Lamars family with original footage filmed in Compton, Calif., Mr. Joseph had made something new.But it was not a traditional music video, and Mr. Lamar was not interested in putting it out, Mr. Joseph, 36, recalled in a recent interview.Thats when Mr. Josephs brother advised him to turn it into an installation for the Underground Museum.Projected on two screens arranged in a V shape, the film, m.A.A.d, was a striking success, drawing a host of new visitors to the space.All of a sudden, Im a fine artist, Mr. Joseph said.All thanks to my brother.Photo Among the transfixed viewers was Helen Molesworth, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.I literally drove back to the museum and put it on the schedule, she said.The films triumphant run at the Museum of Contemporary Art was followed by more work, including Lemonade and Music Is My Mistress, a project for the fashion house Kenzo.Then, last year, came the invitation from the New Museum: Could Mr. Joseph create a new film, a sort of New York-based companion piece to m.A.A.d.?For the first time in his career, Mr. Joseph faced a blank slate.There was no song, no album, no core material to draw on.But he quickly found that its impossible not to think about all your heroes and references when you write, he said.In addition to Mr. DeCarava, the photographer, Mr. Joseph drew on the work of Chris Marker, whose film Sans Soleil offers an extended meditation on memory and time.With Fly Paper, Mr. Joseph pays homage to a host of literary and cultural figures, splicing and mixing in references among its scenes of fictional characters.Some figures skate away, while others recur.Photo Photo The film builds in layers, with vrit footage from the street interspersed with elegant, vividly staged scenes.A woman places a handbag on a bed; an elegant gentleman (Ben Vereen) climbs a set of stairs, then reclines, fully dressed, in a bathtub.He visits an art gallery.He dances in an empty room and with the Brooklyn-born flex dancer Storyboard P. The soundtrack leaps, too.Music collides with the sounds of the city: drums, bass, an ambulance, a train.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I wanted people to feel like they saw a Harlem that they cant see, Mr. Joseph said.You can take a tour bus around Harlem and see the exterior.His hunt for the heart of the neighborhood also shows the influence of Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, author of the 2011 book Harlem Is Nowhere (its title is from a 1948 essay by Ralph Ellison).The neighborhoods role as a capital of American culture, and exuberant celebration of African-American life is a voice in his work, which includes a passage read from Ms. Rhodes-Pittss book.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But some of the ghosts are his own.A middle-aged man in an overcoat gets into a cab.Hes on a gurney, proceeding down a hospital hall.Hes in a chair, head shaved, a surgical scar circling one side of his skull, watching ESPN.That would be Mr. Josephs father, the sports and entertainment attorney Keven Davis, who lived in Harlem until his death in 2011 at 53.That shock still reverberates for Mr. Joseph.I remember having no concept that my parents could ever pass away, he said.They seemed like these eternal experiences.The next shock came in 2015, when Noah, his brother, died at 32.You think you have a lot of time with people, when youre young, Mr. Joseph said.Theyre going to live until theyre at least 70.Right?Photo It was a struggle to edit Fly Paper, because of its deeply personal nature, and only late in the process did Mr. Joseph decide to include footage of his family.Searching through video he had shot in 2011 during his fathers last months, he said, led to a wormhole, all this stuff that I totally forgot I shot, because I was in such automatic mode.Again, he was inspired by Mr. DeCaravas work, noting how the photographer included portraits of his wife and daughters in his 1996 MoMA retrospective, alongside his depictions of jazz greats like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis.He was able to not compartmentalize, Mr. Joseph said.Thats why I started to include my family.Thats my big reference to Roy.That was his big genius.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The loss of his father and brother also contributed to the erosion of Mr. Josephs sense of time, he said a huge preoccupation for a filmmaker.Our understanding of time as linear is completely false, he said.In the film, its rarely clear whether everything is happening in the same period, across generations, or in a kind of eternal loop.Visitors at the New Museum show wander in, not knowing quite what to expect.But that kind of serendipity is fine with Mr. Joseph, who compared it to his youthful experience of flipping TV channels, only to happen across a movie in progress.The likelihood that I would finish the film was probably increased by coming in somewhere in the middle, not knowing where I am, he said.A sense of dislocation defines the film, which slips from one visual format to another from 35-millimeter color film to coruscating black-and-white to bleary hand-held video in a way that recalls the rapidly shifting frames of a dream.In the coda, just after the final shot of Mr. Josephs father, there is a sequence of video clips from the 1990s, highlights from the career of the former Detroit Lions star running back Barry Sanders, who abruptly retired before the 1999 season.Mr. Joseph warmly recalled that during his fathers final months they would bond over sports, and Mr. Sanders, a particular favorite.Ive always been drawn to the ballet-like nature of his specific play, Mr. Joseph said.He also praised the athletes decision to step away from the sport at the peak of his powers.It was like a Zen samurai principle thing, right?In the clips, which last a minute or so, the football star streaks across the field, again and again, a flash of joy that sharply contrasts with the painful hospital scenes.It may seem like a jarring shift in mood, but it is in keeping with the films essayistic form.I really love filmmaking, to be honest, Mr. Joseph said.More than plot.
After ‘Hope,’ and Lawsuit, Shepard Fairey Tries Damage Control:::::LOS ANGELES By just about any measure, its been a long time since the street artist Shepard Fairey managed to capture the optimism of Barack Obamas candidacy in his Hope poster, the stylized portrait in red, white and blue tones that easily ranks as the most famous, also ubiquitous, artwork of 2008.Mr. Faireys oldest daughter, then 2 years old, is now almost a teenager.The Hope image became the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit by The Associated Press that was both expensive and embarrassing for the artist.Mr. Fairey, who is 47, has since gone on to create art for activist movements like Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and the Womens March.And now Damaged his biggest gallery show yet, with about 200 new paintings, prints and illustrations made since 2015 is set to open on Nov. 11 in a Chinatown warehouse, the same day a documentary on the artist has its premiere on Hulu.The mood of the exhibition: what happens when hope gets trampled but not killed.Our approach to the environment is damaged, our political system is damaged and our communication with each other especially through social media is deteriorating, Mr. Fairey said, ticking off themes in his new work.But this show is not all about me being angry and apocalyptic; Im trying to diagnose problems and move forward.Photo You could call it an attempt at damage control, something Mr. Fairey knows about firsthand.As the Hulu documentary by James Moll shows, Mr. Fairey has gone from great heights to dramatic lows in the last decade.Hes risen from cult figure to cultural reference point on The Simpsons to committing what he now calls his biggest blunder during the course of the A.P.lawsuit when he lied to his lawyers about exactly which A.P.photograph he used as the source of the Hope image and deleted files from his computer to cover up the truth.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So on top of settling the A.P.lawsuit in 2011 for an undisclosed amount, he ended up paying $25,000 in fines and serving a two-year probation for federal charges of tampering with evidence.Now, in the film, he is issuing his most public mea culpa, calling his lapse of judgment the first time I felt so overwhelmed that I did something cowardly.
Hidden Treasures of Nazis’ Art Dealer Finally Go on Display:::::Also displayed are documents that record the efforts of the two galleries staging the exhibition to establish the original ownership of the works.Each of the shows focuses on a different aspect of the Third Reichs policies on art.The Bern exhibition, Degenerate Art, Confiscated and Sold, opens on Thursday.Its focus is on works acquired as part of the 1938 law that allowed the Nazis to seize so-called degenerate art, mostly Modernist pieces viewed by Hitler as un-German or as Jewish.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In Bonn, works in Nazi Art Theft and its Consequences will go on display on Friday.Most of the art in the Bonn show is suspected of having been wrongfully taken by the Nazis from its Jewish owners and the ownership history of many pieces on display is not yet clear.Last week, researchers working with Project Gurlitt, the team of art historians and provenance researchers tasked by the German government with establishing the original ownership of works in the collection, identified a Thomas Couture painting as having belonged to Georges Mandel, a Jewish French politician.The work, Portrait of a Seated Young Woman, was the sixth to have been identified, thanks in part to the restoration team in Bonn, which was readying it for the exhibition.They noticed a barely detectable repaired hole in the canvas, at the level of the young womans chest, a detail which had been recorded in an initial claim filed after the end of the war.The fact that the researchers have been able, through their meticulous and unstinting work, to identify the painting by Thomas Couture as Nazi-looted art demonstrates once again how important it is not to let up in our efforts in the field of provenance research, Monica Grtters, Germanys culture minister said in a statement.News of the collections existence, first reported by Focus magazine in November 2013, spurred Germany to intensify efforts to establish provenance, following intense criticism for having kept the works secret for months after their initial discovery by tax authorities in February 2012.But three years after research efforts began, researchers had established the original ownership of only five works.The collection was hailed by art historians when it was found as the most important discovery of Nazi-looted art since the Allies discovered the hoards in the salt mines and the castles, and initial speculation placed its total value at more than $1 billion.As the reality of the scope and contents of the collection have become clear, the monetary value has been scaled back to hundreds of millions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rein Wolfs, director of the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn, and Nina Zimmer, director of the the Kunstmuseum Bern, wrote in the catalog that accompanies the exhibition that they do not see the value of the collection in monetary terms.Rather, they wrote, it is an opportunity to pay homage to the people who became victims of the National Socialist art theft, as well as the artists who were defamed and persecuted by the regime as degenerate.
Murillo: The Selfies (Yes, Spain’s Golden Age Had Them, Too):::::What did it mean for Murillo to place himself in this wholly artificial marble box, and to undercut the naturalism he brought to depicting his own face?Mr. Salomon, in his catalog essay, notes that the false stone frame is wholly unique to this portrait, and neither his contemporaries nor later Spanish painters relied on such a device.(A separate technical essay attests that the background initially contained blue pigment; imagine, then, that Murillo first painted the block against an outdoor landscape.)The marble has an ennobling function, sure Murillo has literally inscribed his image onto the stones of the past.But the cartouches evident hollowness, not to mention Murillos modern dress, insists that the painter has invented this looking-glass marble object as a game or a provocation.It shows Murillo both as a self-conscious, thinking individual (in the manner Ren Descartes had theorized just a decade or so prior), and also as a relic of history, already worthy of the fame afforded to glories past.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This show offers two illuminating pairings for the youthful self-portrait.One is Murillos even earlier painting of Juan Arias de Saavedra, a young minister for the Spanish Inquisition, painted in 1650.Murillo painted Saavedra in an oval niche inside a gray stone frame.He appears stern and joyless, and the Latin inscription below affirms as much; he was hard to the criminals of the Inquisition, though also, once his day at the torture chamber was concluded, a profound connoisseur of the liberal arts.Photo The second, even shrewder pairing here is a print from around 1626 that depicts the Count-Duke of Olivares, the top dog at the court of King Philip IV.The printmaker drew on a portrait by Velzquez for Olivaress likeness, but he set the portrait in a frame bedecked with fruit, palm fronds, torches and horns and designed by Peter Paul Rubens.The young Murillo would have encountered ornate frames like this in important books from northern Europe, and his self-portrait inside a marble block draws not only on traditions of antiquity but on the more contemporary practice of printmaking.Photo About 20 years after Murillo painted himself in that hunk of marble, he turned to the mirror again for a mature self-portrait that plays its own optical tricks.In the National Gallerys self-portrait, circa 1670, the artists hair has grown thinner; the pencil mustache is flecked with white, and hes developed a double chin.He appears fatigued, as if he has been working all night.Here, again, he appears in a stone cartouche, but this one, rather than pretending to come from antiquity, is smooth and round.Beneath the cartouche are a compass, a ruler, a palette, and paintbrushes, and his right hand sits on the bottom of the putative frame a trompe-loeil show-off move of the first order.Photo This is one of many self-portraits in Western art history that showcases the painters talent by advertising the fact of its own making.You could place it beside Rembrandts nearly contemporary Self-Portrait With Two Circles, in which the Dutchman painted himself in front of two perfect, can-you-top-this discs; William Hogarths 1745 The Painter and His Pug, in which the Englishman depicts himself in a painting-in-the-painting; or even Philip Gustons 1969 The Studio, in which a hooded painter paints himself.The use of trompe-loeil also makes this later self-portrait of a piece with Murillos genre paintings, including the delightful Two Women at a Window, lent to the Frick from the National Gallery in Washington, in which the principal figure appears to lean out of the picture frame.But just as much, the later Murillo self-portrait is a rejoinder to that earlier one a courteous but resigned epistle from an older artist to his younger self.Once, Murillo had dreamed himself as a gentleman in the lineage of Roman heroes.The repeated device of the stone frame reaffirms that the artists haughtiness had not fully abated by his 50s.But age, work, family, politics: These have taken their toll on Murillo, and his right hand extends toward us as if he is desperate to make contact.Immortality is a young mans delusion.The older artist has more modest goals, but wiser ones: To see and be seen is enough.
Disputed Sale of Rockwells by Museum Can Go Forward, Judge Says:::::The museum, in Pittsfield, announced over the summer that it was planning to sell 40 pieces from its collection by artists like Rockwell, Albert Bierstadt and Alexander Calder and use the proceeds to increase its endowment, renovate its building and expand programming as part of a larger effort to reshape the museum as an interdisciplinary institution that focuses on science and nature as well as the arts.Photo But the plan drew criticism, locally because of the loss of beloved images and in museum circles because of longstanding resistance to any sale of art that is used to underwrite operational expenses instead of being used to enhance an institutions collections.In a joint statement the American Alliance of Museums and the Association of Art Museum Directors condemned the sale in July, writing: One of the most fundamental and longstanding principles of the museum field is that a collection is held in the public trust and must not be treated as a disposable financial asset.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The attorney generals office initially filed papers supporting the request for an injunction, telling the court that it had concerns over the sale and needed additional time to complete an investigation.Last week, the office asked that it be substituted as a plaintiff if the court determined that the lawsuits by the Rockwell descendants and museum members lacked standing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Judge Agostini described the office as a reluctant warrior, noting it had never filed suit to block the sale on its own.He said the lawyers for the state had not specified what information was necessary to complete a review of the sale, what attempts had been made to obtain such information, or when the office would be in a position to offer its opinion regarding the merits of the sale.Meanwhile, the judge said, the requested delay would have had considerable financial consequences for the museum.The Rockwells alone are estimated to bring in as much as $40 million, according to the Sothebys catalog.The museum and Sothebys both praised the judges decision.Emily Snyder, a spokeswoman for the attorney generals office, said the agency was reviewing its options.
At Tiffany, the Fifth Avenue Face-Lift Starts at Home:::::Since joining Tiffany & Co. in January as chief artistic officer, Reed Krakoff has undertaken to freshen the image of the 180-year-old jewelry company.His first major footprint is on the fourth-floor home and accessories floor of Tiffanys Fifth Avenue flagship, where the sacred and the profane are now commingling cheerfully.The main thing we were trying to bring back was that aesthetic of the extraordinary as well as the everyday, Mr. Krakoff said.Which is how the world came to know the Tiffany Tin Can (actually sterling silver and vermeil, $1,000), whose humble shape and unhumble price tag set the internet a-dither on Monday.(When panhandling before the big riot, dont be caught without this stunning $1,000 tin can from Tiffanys.)Tiffany is a luxury purveyor, and luxury in everything, from dog bowls to baby combs to teakettles, is to be expected.Mr. Krakoffs injection of levity is not an unwelcome twist on the usual gilded or silvered theme.Were just getting started, he said.Here, Mr. Krakoff explains the thinking behind the new design.
Forsaking the Punk Clubs of His Youth for a Well-Stocked Library:::::Photo Its hard to imagine too many other punk rock musicians being taken seriously when they cite as equal inspirations the Kingsmens three-chord garage stomp Louie Louie and 19th-century French poetry.But Richard Hell has always thrived on intellectual contradictions, bitterly dismissing the countercultural ideals of the 1960s just before singing a heartfelt Creedence Clearwater Revival cover, as heard to memorable effect on his 1977 album with his band the Voidoids, Blank Generation.The record receives the deluxe 40th anniversary reissue treatment this month, a testament to the enduring power of its songs as well as the iconography that Mr. Hell created himself (better known to Warner Musics accountants as Mr. Meyers).T-shirts featuring Mr. Hells spiky-haired visage are ubiquitous in fashion circles; the contemporary art world seems similarly besotted, with a whos who from Nicole Eisenman to Christopher Wool invoking him in their work.Still, Voidoids fans shouldnt expect a reunion tour.Sitting inside the East Village apartment where hes lived since 1975, Mr. Hell, now 68, explained that his music career was over.It was really a challenge to find a way to make my singing effective, since I can barely carry a tune, he said matter-of-factly.Leaving the punk scene behind was partly an act of self-preservation (Theres the danger of drugs, which is an issue with me a subject compellingly detailed in his 2013 memoir, I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp) and partly a return to his first love.Photo Id come to New York when I was 17 with the idea of being a poet, he recalled of his arrival in 1967, having dropped out of high school in Kentucky.He found himself gravitating toward the writers of The Mimeo Revolution, an early 60s loose network of poets including San Franciscos Jack Spicer, Clevelands d.a.levy, and most formatively on Mr. Hell, New Yorks Ted Berrigan, who all sidestepped the commercial publishing milieu to design their own handmade books on mimeograph machines.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon enough, Mr. Hell was hand-cranking his own press, producing a literary magazine, Genesis : Grasp, and then books of poetry by Andrew Wylie and Theresa Stern, a pseudonym for his collaboration with his future Television bandmate Tom Verlaine (copies of which now fetch $2,500).Mr. Hells 1973 detour into music was borne out of frustration over not finding a mass audience and deciding to explore an alternate path to one.Though hed never previously played a note of music, or even sung publicly, he bought a bass guitar and began composing lyrics.As obnoxious and pretentious as it sounds, I wanted to influence the culture, he said.Youre not going to do that with poetry.Allen Ginsberg did it, but it happens once, maybe twice a century.
Richard Hambleton, ‘Shadowman’ of the ’80s Art Scene, Dies at 65:::::With her husband, John Woodward, Ms. Woodward exhibited Mr. Hambletons art, found studios and lodging for him and cooked for him.A trained nurse, she also attended to many of his medical needs.He was so charismatic and so manipulative, but once you were in his sphere you couldnt shake him, Ms. Woodward said in an interview.He had it.He didnt care about the periphery.He would live in a bag on the street.All he wanted was paint supplies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A prankster who liked to provoke as the anonymous street artist Banksy has done since the 1990s Mr. Hambleton came to public attention in the mid- to late 1970s by painting faux crime-scene outlines of bodies on pavement and adding blood, hoping to make people believe that a serial murderer was on the loose.He began this Image Mass Murder series in his hometown, Vancouver, British Columbia, and then took it down the West Coast and across North America.He carried squeeze bottles filled with white paint for the outline and red paint for the make-believe blood.I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene, Penny Arcade, the performance artist, says in Shadowman, a forthcoming documentary about Mr. Hambleton, directed by Oren Jacoby.After seeing another outline, she says, she realized that this may be something else, but I didnt have any language for it.Mr. Hambleton studied maps to determine where, in each city, he would strike next.I began to think I was murdering people, going back to my hotel covered in paint, blood, blood-red paint, he says in the documentary, adding, Blood has a beautiful color.Photo Announcing that Dick Trace-It, also known as Richard Hambleton, was the private detective trying to solve the murders in Vancouver, he posted 4,000 fake wanted posters seeking the apprehension of Mr. Reee for the crimes.In 1980, soon after moving to the Lower East Side, he started another urban art project, installing full-size photographic images of himself, dressed up in a suit and tie and staring, on walls around the city and elsewhere.He called it I Only Have Eyes for You.The images were printed on paper that stretched when moistened and faded to white shadows after three months.His early Shadowman period led to shadow images of bucking horses and riders on walls and canvases.By 1984, he had turned to the Marlboro Man, the cowboy figure whose macho image promoted cigarettes for decades.Mr. Hambleton, who smoked, toyed with the image, painting shadow figures over it, sometimes mixing tobacco with black paint for what he called a black lung effect.Richard Art Hambleton was born in Vancouver on June 23, 1952.His parents, Arthur and Vale Hambleton, survive him, as do two sisters and a brother.Photo After graduating from the Emily Carr University of Art & Design in Vancouver, he started the Pumps Center for Alternative Art, a gallery, performance and video space, in the same city.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By the mid-1980s he had begun his transition to creating enormous seascapes, among them turbulent ocean-wave paintings.I wanted to do something that was a different sensibility, he says in the documentary.Its about love.Reviewing an exhibition of Mr. Hambletons paintings at the Piezo Electric Gallery in the East Village in 1985, Michael Brenson of The New York Times wrote that the violence inherent in his early Shadowman work had not fully left him.There are three paintings called Rainstorm, in which raging water seems to be rushing toward us from within the canvas, Mr. Brenson wrote.In each of the paintings, sea and sky rage a bit more until they seem on the point of swallowing everything.Mr. Hambleton soon moved into his beautiful period, painting landscapes with gold and silver leaf and tinted varnishes.Photo But by the early 1990s he had begun to withdraw from the art scene.Mr. Haring had died of AIDS at 31, Mr. Basquiat of a drug overdose at 27, and Mr. Hambleton, Ms. Woodward said, had become paranoid about gallery culture and the impact on the artist and his freedoms.His life had begun to unravel.His drug use continued.His skin cancer worsened.He lived in increasing squalor.His goal was to reach the sublime, Ms. Woodward said.He used drugs to get there.It was just who he was.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2009, two art entrepreneurs cajoled him into producing some new work, paintings of shadowy figures wearing suits, which were added to a retrospective exhibition in New York sponsored by Giorgio Armani.For his documentary, Mr. Jacoby filmed Mr. Hambleton as he procrastinated and battled with his anxious patrons.The show, which traveled to Europe the next year, was successful, and a comeback seemed possible.But the moment did not last long.While Mr. Hambleton kept painting almost until he died, he was becoming increasingly frail.His cancer was eroding his face.His back was bowed and lopsided from his spinal conditions.He used his folding bicycle as a walker.At times he was homeless.At least Basquiat, you know, died, he says bitingly in the documentary, during a scene shot in 2014.I was alive when I died, you know.Thats the problem.
Sotheby’s Results Are Stronger Than Expected:::::Photo Sothebys auction house announced Friday that its third-quarter losses were less than half of the losses that the company experienced during the same period last year, primarily because of a scheduling change and the resolution of a tax issue.For the three months ending on Sept. 30, 2017, Sothebys posted a net loss of $23.5 million, versus $54.5 million during the same time period last year, a difference of 57 percent.The per-share loss was 45 cents this year, down from 99 cents, a 55 percent difference.Two circumstances were primarily responsible for the improvement.One was that this year, Sothebys semiannual Hong Kong sales totaling $82 million net occurred during the third quarter, while in the previous year they did not.In prepared remarks for an analyst and investor call on Friday morning, Mike Goss, the companys chief financial officer, conceded that the scheduling change was unexpected: The occurrence of these sales in the third quarter means that the fourth quarter will be negatively impacted to the extent that we all originally expected these sales to occur in Q4.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other contributing factor was the addition of a $7.4 million income-tax benefit that the company derived by reversing a reserve it had created in 2013 to address a potential tax liability.The statute of limitations for this liability has elapsed.The infusion of the reserve was a one-time event and will have no influence on Sothebys fourth-quarter finances.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The company also cited increased inventory sales as a reason for the relative strength of this quarter.Sothebys has made a concerted effort to reduce its inventory in the last several years to free up capital for other projects.At the end of 2015 its inventory was valued at $215 million.Now it totals $63 million.
Virginia Thoren, Artful Fashion Photographer, Dies at 97:::::Photo Virginia Thoren, an advertising designer who had no formal training behind a camera but became a leading fashion photographer in New York and Paris in the mid-20th century, died on Oct. 27 in Manhattan.She was 97.Her death was confirmed by her friend and archivist Betty Guernsey.Embracing the preference of her mentor, Toni Frissell, for natural light and realistic settings, Ms. Thoren photographed Julie Andrews, Vivien Leigh, Lee Radziwill and other celebrities, as well as models like Carmen DellOrefice, Dorian Leigh, Barbara Mullen, Suzy Parker, Mary Jane Russell and Anne St. Marie in what she characterized as relaxed portraiture for magazine covers and advertisements.She chased beauty through the eye of the camera, Gaby Basora, the designer and owner of the Tucker clothing line, told the Council of Fashion Designers of America in an interview on its website this year.Beatrice Virginia Thoren was born on April 29, 1920, in South Orange, N.J., to Swedish immigrants.Her father, Julius Thoren, was a chauffeur.Her mother, the former Gerda Gustaffson, was a seamstress.

Is It Possible That the Eisenhower Memorial Will Finally Get Built?:::::Photo After more than a decade and a half of planning and controversy, work began Thursday on the long-stalled, $150 million memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower with a groundbreaking at the four-acre site in Washington DC.The memorial to the former president and World War II general will be built on Independence Avenue at the base of Capitol Hill in front of the Department of Education Building and close to the Smithsonians National Air and Space Museum.Construction is expected to last about three years.Dedication of the memorial is envisioned for the 75th Anniversary of V-E Day, May 8, 2020, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission said in a statement.Members of three generations of the Eisenhower family took part in the groundbreaking, as well as members of the bipartisan Eisenhower Memorial Commission, and the memorials designer, Frank Gehry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Susan Eisenhower, a granddaughter who had once been a fierce critic of the Gehry design, was among the speakers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The controversy had centered on certain aspects of the design, including the size and scope of the structures large-scale metal tapestries.But family members lifted their objection last year, giving the project final impetus.

Alberto Savinio: Emerging From Big Brother’s Shadow:::::Photo The Greek-born Italian artist Alberto Savinio spent most of his life in the shadow of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico, famed as the pioneer of Surrealist painting.It remains to be seen if he will spend eternity there.The question is not settled by Alberto Savinio, a rare exhibition of 22 of his paintings at the Center for Italian Modern Art in SoHo, but it is given a tantalizing spin.Savinio (1891-1952) was born in Athens to a family of Italian-speaking Greeks and went to Italy as a teenager.He changed his name in 1914, during a sojourn in Paris (1911-1915) with his brother, who was already becoming known for the dreamlike metaphysical paintings that proved foundational to Surrealism.These efforts, as de Chirico admitted, had been formulated with the multitalented Savinio, who worked variously during his life as poet, novelist, critic, composer, pianist and set designer as well as a painter.The brothers frequented avant-garde circles and were especially close to Guillaume Apollinaire, contributing essays to a journal he published.But at the time, music was Savinios chief interest and, not unlike the Italian Futurists, he favored reducing it to raw, physical sound.On May 21, 1914, Savinio gained notoriety with a well-attended concert where he played the piano so violently that it had to be replaced more than once.The event would be recalled by Blaise Cendrars in his 1948 book, Bourlingueur.The war forced the brothers back to Italy but 1926 found them both in Paris again, with Savinio very much in painting mode.All but one of the canvases here date from the second Paris sojourn, which ended in early 1934.They reveal an artist juggling several styles, all buoyed by easy, robust paint handling, all connected more or less to Surrealism.
Painter’s Ex-Assistant Charged With Stealing His Works:::::Mr. Scullys high prices at auction may have made him an inviting target.Born in Dublin in 1945, he became established in the 1980s and has gone on to have shows in Paris, Rome, Barcelona and Beijing.He is known for paintings that feature bands and blocks of color that have sold for more than $1 million.His works have been displayed in major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Tate in London and the National Gallery of Ireland.The email from Bonhams to Mr. Scullys studio, sent on Sept. 5, included not only an image of a work that was listed as a triptych created in 1985 but additional details about its purported history.The message said that the work was made up of three attached oil and linen canvases with an overall size of 28 by 76 by 3 inches and had been exhibited twice at the McKee Gallery, once in 1986 and again in 1989.A stretcher bar was signed Scully, the email from Bonhams said, and the work was described as being part of a private collection after having been acquired directly from the artist.Photo I wonder if you might be able to confirm that the information we have matches your records, and if you are aware of any additional information regarding this piece, such as exhibition history or literature references?the email from Bonhams asked.Mr. Scully, who said he keeps meticulous records, could find no indication that any such work had existed.But he said each of the three panels looked like something he would create, even if he would not combine them into a triptych.Those were three small stolen fragments, he said Wednesday, adding that someone had arranged them into a triptych and invented a provenance meant to fool Bonhams.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Scully asked Bonhams where the work had come from.At first the auction house would not tell him, he said, but it became cooperative once the authorities began looking into the matter.The police investigation led to Mr. Rucci, who had done inventory work for Mr. Scully and while working for him had access to his storage space on West 17th Street.The criminal complaint said that Mr. Rucci sold the painting under a consignment contract, according to records from Bonhams.The work was never included in a catalog or offered for sale, auction house officials said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokeswoman for Bonhams declined to discuss the matter on Wednesday, saying, We are unable to comment on an ongoing investigation.Mr. Rucci, a painter who has produced figurative and abstract works, has had solo shows at the Mixed Greens gallery in Chelsea.Information about a 2009 show on the gallerys website said that Mr. Rucci had been born in Oberammergau, Germany, and at that time was living in Brooklyn.Mr. Scully said that Mr. Rucci had worked for him from about 2005 to 2010 and then had gone on a paid leave so that he could address personal issues.Mr. Rucci returned to work for Mr. Scully for part of 2011 but Mr. Scully said he was dismissed later that year.On Wednesday, Mr. Scully said he harbored no ill will toward Bonhams and was not celebrating the arrest of Mr. Rucci, whom he described as an educated person with several positive attributes.I actually feel sorry for him, Mr. Scully said.Its quite a tragic situation.
What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week:::::Heidi Hahn Through Nov. 12.Jack Hanley Gallery, 327 Broome Street, Manhattan; 646-918-6824, jackhanley.com.Photo Heidi Hahns paintings remind me of Erik Saties compositions.Its a funny comparison to make, because his music is famously minimal, and the first thing you notice about the 10 numbered oils in Ms. Hahns new show, The Future Is Elsewhere (if It Breaks Your Heart), at Jack Hanley, is their luxurious brushwork.But like Satie, Ms. Hahn achieves the richness in her work by stripping it down to a few formal elements and then prying those elements apart to reveal the sticky, inexhaustible force that holds them together.Photo Every piece in the show is centered on one or more extended female figures in sinuous cartoon silhouette.The Future Is Elsewhere (if It Breaks Your Heart) No.3, a dark vertical tricolor, is complicated conceptually as well as chromatically by its three figures: one standing, one on a chair and one sitting on the floor.Blond and brown hair, a green sweater and roseate noses add subtle dissonance to the background of lavender, cloudy pink and gray, while Ms. Hahns use of figuration and some cues to depth of field gently undermine the abstract flatness of that background and of the figures themselves.(No.7, in which an apartment buildings 15 windows act as streaky rectangles of pure color, almost convinced me that theres no such thing as pure abstraction, anyway.)In No.9, the artist paints her stand-in stretched out on the floor, back and arm curved like a billowing hill, painting herself, Galatea turned Pygmalion.WILL HEINRICH Bernhard Buhmann Through Nov. 12.Marinaro, 1 Oliver Street, Manhattan; 212-989-7700, marinaro.biz.The large-scale compositions of demurely exuberant shapes that constitute most of the Austrian painter Bernhard Buhmanns American debut, Fragments of Statue, look sweet and old-fashioned, but a faintly bitter aftertaste of self-consciousness puts them squarely in the present day.Rounded corners, together with the occasional gradation and imperfect edge or drip, create a curious suggestion of depth that hovers at the corner of the eye.The pieces look as if they should look flat, but dont quite.On any given canvas, similarly, the colors are so well balanced as to very nearly cancel out to nothing, but Mr. Buhmann always leaves just enough discord to hold viewers attention.Photo Capitain (II) moves loosely in a spiral, from a block of orange in the bottom right through maroon, blue and increasingly pale shades till it reaches a fine peach trapezoid; in Fast Car (Self-Driving), the same orange appears as a circle resting on a fuchsia railing.In four figurative canvases, though, this stately march of earnest irony explodes into prismatic complication, with views of a halved and doubled cabaret figure seen as if through a cut glass chandelier.In Checks and Balances (Figure), she wears a gemlike top hat and an enormous blue beard that curls into the shape of a butterfly wing; in Janus, shes in profile back-to-back with herself, blue and purple circles marking her cheeks and stylized puffs of cigarette smoke emanating from her lips.WILL HEINRICH
Frank Stella’s Favorite Cities for Art:::::Photo The American artist Frank Stella, 81, best known for his Minimalist and abstract styles, will tell you that, without travel, he wouldnt have been able to sustain his career as long as he has.Seeing great art in different destinations gives me the motivation to keep going and holds me to a high standard professionally, he said.Now, Mr. Stellas 60-year trajectory as an artist, which developed as he traveled the world, is on display in an exhibition, Frank Stella: Experiment and Change, at the NSU Art Museum Fort Lauderdale, in Florida; the show will run from Nov. 12 to July 8, 2018, and includes approximately 300 of his paintings, sculptures and drawings spanning from the late 1950s to the present.Mr. Stella lives in New York City and spends between 30 and 40 percent of his time on the road for work, traveling to his exhibitions and giving talks on his art.Below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation with him.How did an exhibition of your works end up in Fort Lauderdale?What is the citys art scene like?Advertisement Continue reading the main story When I think about art in Fort Lauderdale, I also include Miami because they are so near each other, and together, they are a lot more visible now in the arts world than they were several years ago.The excitement around Art Basel, the show in Miami Beach, is an example of this visibility, but some of the museums are also high-caliber.The NSU Museum, for one, is in an interesting modernist building designed by the American architect Edward Larrabee Barnes.I had visited the museum before and admired many of the works inside.I had also worked with the exhibits curator, Bonnie Clearwater, in the early 2000s on an exhibition of my art at the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, and when she approached me about this show, it was a no-brainer for me to say yes because of my relationship with her and my fondness for the museum.
Luke Skywalker Speaks:::::It is, if you can be objective about it, he said a few weeks ago, sitting in his home here near the Pacific Ocean.Photo Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood?I could be the size of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, whos going to know?You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with Star Wars, which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal.The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.But Mr. Hamill isnt bitter or jaded, and he isnt Luke, though he has retained some of that characters incorruptibility.Hes gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing Star Wars war stories.At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought Star Wars into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im such a fraud, he said with a theatrical air.But Im enjoying all the residual attention that the movies getting.I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn.Whats not to love?On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin.The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to Star Wars its mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamills own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of Return of the Jedi.Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up.In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; hell slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues the adenoidal clip of the Star Wars creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was King Kong.Proudly recalling a fight scene from Return of the Jedi, Mr. Hamill said, For me, sitting in the rancors hand, I was going all Fay Wray its like a major accomplishment to me.But it was always that way.Id say Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3POs cereal!Photo The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings.He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could.If I didnt get a part, no problem, he said.Then where do I go?I sell tickets.I make props.I make posters.I dont have to be in the show I want to be near the show.He landed early roles on General Hospital and The Partridge Family.And then, of course, came Star Wars: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects.I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity, Mr. Lucas said.He added that Mr. Hamill brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character, and that made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first Star Wars and its sequels.Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience.I thought, even if this thing doesnt slay at the box office, its got midnight cult movie written all over it, he said.Move over, Rocky Horror, Star Wars is here!Instead, Star Wars became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them Harry and Carrison as they promoted the movie together.When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed adequately, Mr. Hamill uninspiredly and Ms. Fisher wretchedly, Mr. Hamill said, We had T-shirts made: adequate, uninspired and wretched.I said, Harrison, adequates practically a rave compared to what we got.Photo Photo Mr. Ford said that during this time, the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness.We really were figuring this out as we went along.Mr. Hamill struck him as a very bright, sincere young actor, who Mr. Ford said seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the Star Wars royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now.Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: Hes a brilliant actor thats a given, he said.Hes also a leading man.When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.Mr. Hamill believed hed find his destiny on a different path one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.After two blockbuster sequels, The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the Star Wars story was complete.With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in The Elephant Man.I wasnt getting character parts in movies and television, he explained.Unless youre Meryl Streep, they dont let you do accents.He starred in the Broadway production of Amadeus while Return of the Jedi was still in theaters.But his 1985 musical Harrigan n Hart, about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his Star Wars legacy.He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on The Simpsons, he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of Guys and Dolls.Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.He was always comfortable being part of the Star Wars subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for ultra-passionate fans).Its clearly not for everyone I get that, Mr. Hamill said.But the passion of it all is just astonishing.The way its become part of the fabric of their lives I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia its moving.Photo He was not involved in the much-maligned Star Wars prequels from 1999 to 2005.And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new Star Wars trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate.We figured we had the middle three, he said.It was over.When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, I was completely stunned.Carrie, not a minute went by she slapped the table and goes, Im in!I said, Carrie, poker face!Mr. Hamill needed more time to think.I was just really scared, he said.I thought, why mess with it?The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their Star Wars heyday.No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star, he said.Its sad.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse The Force Awakens, expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.Hes too old and too rich and too cranky, Mr. Hamill said.Hes not going to do this.But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no?Id be the most hated man in nerd-dom.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of Star Wars fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega).He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists.But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of The Force Awakens, and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Lukes story line.(The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)The idea of it was so enormous, Mr. Abrams said.It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters.That had to be the next movie.Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in The Force Awakens.I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal, Mr. Abrams said.I dont think he knew just how minimal until he read it.In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was not particularly happy with how little he was in it.Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Lukes big reveal at the end would fall flat.If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if theres a big groan in the house, the eggs on my face, not J.J.s, he said.Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read he jokingly calls it a table listen of the Force Awakens script.He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration.(I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse, Mr. Hamill said.)Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.Photo Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in The Force Awakens, lamented that they had worked together on the early Star Wars movies far less than viewers realize.The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few, he said.I knew Chewbacca better.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.Hes very centered in his own experience and his own life, Mr. Ford said.Hes not a grandstander.Hes a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and thats what were there for.Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in The Force Awakens when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, thats fabulous, he said.But now he and the The Last Jedi creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this, said Rian Johnson, the Last Jedi writer and director.Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.Mr. Johnson said The Last Jedi also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke.In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with the youthfulness and innocence he now embodies a person full of soul and experience, Mr. Johnson said.Video While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the Star Wars filmmakers on big plot points hes still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in The Last Jedi.Thats the hard part, Mr. Hamill said.You dont want to admit how possessive youve become.There are times where you go, Really?Thats what they think of Luke?Im not only in disagreement Im insulted.But thats the process and you thrash it all out.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December.Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to Star Wars.Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his Star Wars work, he said, She goes, Whats your problem?I said, Well, its theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.She goes, I am Princess Leia.Youre Luke Skywalker.Get used to it.More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.She deserved that second act, he said.Harrison was more prominent in VII, Im more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one.Her timing was perfect, except in this case.His Star Wars colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise Hes the last man standing, said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in The Force Awakens.But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.It means what it means to him, and thats all that matters, he said.Im sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone that its all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.Photo Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either.Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original Star Wars movies outside of theaters and has seen The Force Awakens only twice.All I notice are flaws, he explained.Oh, why did I do that?Look at my hair.What was I thinking?Advertisement Continue reading the main story During production of The Force Awakens, he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt and was struck by what he saw.They were all great, Mr. Hamill said.They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is A Hard Days Night, Richard Lesters madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, I saw it originally going, Oh, can you imagine it?Girls chasing me down the street!It looks like so much fun.But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light.Its like a horror movie, he said.Theyre trapped.They cant go anywhere.One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamills mind was the Cant Buy Me Love sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.Its the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy, Mr. Hamill said.It plays so differently now, when youre on the other end of it.

shes lovely.When I met her, I just cried.In front of her?Yeah, tears coming down my face.Wah.I was just completely star-struck and moved by meeting her.Did they have to cajole you to sing?They didnt, but they didnt give me a lot of time to prepare.I got an email from Ken, and he was like, I have this wacky idea, how would you like to sing this song?I havent sung since Hairspray, my vocal cords are rusted shut.I said, Ill give it a try, but you better have a backup.I dont really consider myself a singer.I consider myself an actor who can sing just good enough in movies.If I really trained, I could be much better.Photo Do you feel an artist should reflect society or push ideas forward or both?Do you feel any responsibility to do that?Advertisement Continue reading the main story I do.Its because of owning that responsibility that Ive actually passed on a number of projects that were very hard to turn down.I certainly dont want to be putting out any more toxicity.I wouldnt want to do anything, for instance, that was misogynistic.When I did Elvira for Scarface, that was a very misogynistic relationship and that character obviously was pathetic.She was just an armpiece for her man.But by playing that part, you actually can say more sometimes than by getting up on your soapbox.I think its all in the way thats presented.But I am always aware of that.Even at that [early] point.Did you have any trepidation coming back now?Theres a lot more social-media scrutiny.The only trepidation was I think I took for granted how nice it was to not be under the spotlight and just having a life.I remember thinking, Do I really want to step back into this?And I just realized that Im not done.I have a lot more to do, and a lot more to say.Im never going to be one that retires.
Blood, Sweat, Toil and Tears: Playing Churchill on Screen:::::The movie also tries to understand Churchill through his use of language, with the sound of typewriters constantly clacking in the background.They are the most iconic speeches in the history of the English language and they were all written in 28 days, so how these speeches came to be and how he came to express the will and the sentiment of the nation is really the subject, Mr. Wright added.In one of the most stirring scenes, Churchill famously addresses the House of Commons, arguing that the British need to face the Nazi threat at all costs: If we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour.Video Speaking those words is a dream for actors, but the role also represents an enormous risk, Mr. Oldman said, where you could easily slip into caricature.Hes quite often portrayed as old, grumpy, a curmudgeon.Lugubrious and grunting and shouting, Mr. Oldman said.Thats how Ive seen him played and I think that contaminated my own thinking about him.To get at the man beneath those cigar-puffing, jowly stereotypes, enhanced by makeup, Mr. Oldman spent four months researching and preparing for the role watching footage, reading his many works and those of biographers like Martin Gilbert and even the politician Boris Johnson.He visited Churchills family homes, Chartwell and Blenheim Palace, and talked to people who knew him.I discovered a man who was not as fat as we all thought he was in 1940 and who had really an athletic tread.He skipped around and he had this sort of stoop and it was forward moving, Mr. Oldman said, adding, Theres a real twinkle in the eye, and he has humor.The Churchill I saw and I discovered had charm.Mr. Oldman also spent time in the war rooms in Westminster where those fateful decisions were made, and sat in the great mans chair.On the left-hand arm of the chair were these marks where he had made scratches with his nails, the actor recalled.And on the right-hand side were scratches from his ring that he used to wear.He was in this chair throughout the war, so you can imagine the stress and strain that he was under.What many people now fail to realize, he added, is how precariously close he came to disaster and that he was himself resistant to war.His most powerful and beautiful words were about the horror of war.With Darkest Hour, Mr. Oldman now joins a long line of actors who have played Churchill, including Albert Finney, Richard Burton and even a satire featuring Christian Slater.Heres a look at a few other memorable turns.Video Brian Cox, Churchill (2017) In Jonathan Teplitzkys recent film, Mr. Cox plays Churchill opposite Miranda Richardson as his devoted wife, Clemmie, during the 96 hours leading up to D-Day.Mr. Coxs Churchill, one reviewer in The Telegraph wrote, was a distant cousin of a brown bear, or a Hereford bull, snuffling and stalking through his subterranean Whitehall war rooms, champing at underlings and barking at his reflection.John Lithgow, The Crown (2016) Mr. Lithgows version often comes across as a grandfatherly figure to Claire Foys Queen Elizabeth II in this Netflix series.To get into character, he donned a fat suit, a wig and plumpers to swell his jowls.He told The Los Angeles Times, I never would have chosen myself for the role.Im so different than him.Im so tall and so American.Still, his portrayal won him an Emmy in 2017.Video Advertisement Continue reading the main story Timothy Spall, The Kings Speech (2010) Theres been much debate over what this movie got right and wrong about the rise of George VI see Christopher Hitchenss writings for withering criticism.But Mr. Spall proved a welcome addition in a cameo as Churchill.So much so that he was invited to perch atop a fake Big Ben and perform as Churchill giving Calibans speech from The Tempest at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.Rod Taylor, Inglourious Basterds (2009) Mr. Taylor, who died in 2015, preferred a bow tie for his portrayal in Quentin Tarantinos film.Mr. Taylor reportedly suggested that the director try Albert Finney instead, but Mr. Tarantino said his heart was set on Mr. Taylor and the actor accepted.Brendan Gleeson, Into the Storm (2009) In a sequel to HBOs award-winning film The Gathering Storm, which starred Albert Finney, Mr. Gleeson here plays Churchill recalling in flashback his glory days during the war.Mr. Gleeson faced several challenges he was 15 years younger and far taller than Churchills 5 feet 6 inches.But like many British actors before him, Mr. Gleeson said the biggest obstacle was getting the idea of him as a hero out of my head.
Making ‘Jumanji’ With Robin Williams: An Oral History:::::The filmmakers assembled the rest of the cast, including Jonathan Hyde, who played dual roles as young Alans aloof father and a hunter who terrorizes the players.JONATHAN HYDE It was a strange shoot.We were in Vancouver through the winter.Its a wet, cold city.For five months, that became a bit of a drag.JOHNSTON I was a little put off by Bonnie Hunts performance on the first day of shooting.I thought it was completely over the top.But once she made me understand what her character had gone through to become this crazy lady, she sold me.BONNIE HUNT (via email) Joe had a clear vision.Naturally, Robin wanted some improvisation, so those two worlds had to meet.Respectfully, we always did takes as written, but then Robin would ask, Joe, could we please have one more for us?JOHNSTON I was a little apprehensive at first, based on what Id heard about Robin and how he wants to ad-lib and go crazy.It wasnt like that at all.He understood that he needed to be this very critical part of the machine.It was a tightly structured story.He never went out of the box.BRADLEY PIERCE A lot of things Robin would improv would go over Kirstens and my heads.He would go on these Ethel Merman riffs where he would sing all his lines like her.It was hysterical, but I didnt realize he was imitating a real person.Photo The film combined animatronics and puppetry with computer-generated effects that had to be added in postproduction.Advertisement Continue reading the main story LAURA BELL BUNDY I was told, Youre going to be chased by bats.There will be no bats, but you have to run around screaming your head off as if there are.Actually, there was one mechanical bat on my shoulder.The O. J. Simpson trial was going on at the time, and the crew nicknamed it Ito [after the judge].It was really cute.Through the long hours of shooting, Mr. Williams would keep the mood light on the set.HUNT In between setups, we would drop our Jumanji roles and improvise, just to get it out of our system.Characters would spring to life based on the daily headlines or waiters from dinner the night before, and the crew was a wonderful audience.It was pure joy.ADAM HANN-BYRD Robin was such a gentle soul.He had this larger-than-life manic persona, but he could turn that off when he wanted to.He was a complicated guy.PIERCE Robins son, whos my age, would come up, and they would invite me to join them at the zoo or the aquarium or a movie.It was great to see him as a dad and a friend rather than just a comedian.It was amazing to get to know the man behind the characters.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.HYDE Every Monday night, Robin went to a comedy club in Vancouver and did an hour and a half of improv with the locals, then another hour and a half of solo stand-up three hours of burning off excess steam.He was glorious.Although she was only 12, Ms. Dunst was already a seasoned veteran, having co-starred in Little Women and Interview With the Vampire, among other films.The actress wouldnt comment for this article, but she made an impression on her cast mates.BEBE NEUWIRTH (who played her aunt) She did have a depth.Even as a child, she was a very interesting actress who had something unusual about her.PIERCE I wont say I didnt have a crush on Kirsten.Shes only about six months older than me, but she had done more film projects than I had.It was nice to have a friend my age to give me guidance.She gave me tips on how to keep your energy up so youre ready to film the next scene without being so rambunctious that its unprofessional.Photo When the film was released in December 1995, it was an immediate box office success, but some critics suggested its violent action sequences were too scary for children.Advertisement Continue reading the main story JOHNSTON That did surprise me.Maybe I was too close to it.I assumed people knew it was a fantasy.HYDE Children love to be frightened I think its an important part of childhood.People between 25 and 35 come up to me and say, You scared the [hell] out of me when I was a kid.I have to say thats usually quite gratifying.Thats what was required.Over time, Jumanji has become a cherished classic, with families watching it over and over.JOHNSTON Theres a little bit of Its a Wonderful Life to the story.What if you could go away and come back and see what life would be if you hadnt existed?HUNT Kids always remember the first movie that makes their hearts pound.Then that feeling becomes nostalgic, and you want to revisit it and share it with a new generation.PIERCE Theres something very relatable about the fears of the characters.Yes, the lions and mosquitoes and crocodiles are very scary, but the real fears came from the interpersonal relationships the fear of being yourself and being comfortable in your own skin.That really made the film connect with people.Photo The cast looks back on the making of Jumanji with great fondness, and some of them still have mementos they took from the set.NEUWIRTH I have hippopotamus salt-and-pepper shakers.I dont remember how they fit into the story, but somehow I have them.HANN-BYRD I ended up taking one of the massive vines that grow on the walls of the mansion.I had to get it back to the States, so we took it through customs, and everyone freaked out, so I had to explain.I still have that vine in my parents house.PIERCE Robin gave the cast hard-bound copies of the script as wrap gifts, and he signed them.He wrote something like, You were a great monkey boy and a pleasure to work with.You have a bright future ahead.He was very much an inspiration, not just as a performer, but as a person.Video The original ensemble wishes the makers of the new film well but said it wouldnt be the same for them without Mr. Williams.Advertisement Continue reading the main story HYDE I was hoping they would make another Jumanji while we were all still alive.HANN-BYRD I was totally devastated when Robin died.He really did care about everyone around him.There was only one Robin Williams.
Unraveling Racial Hatred in ‘Mudbound’:::::DEE REES Well, it added to the story.The thing that attracted me was the multiplicity of voices and the interior dialogue.With characters, it just has to come from something honest somewhere.Its a failure of imagination if you can only write what you know we have to be able to imagine different worlds.You cant be limited by your own experience.Mary, you inhabited your character, Florence, on a molecular, almost spiritual level.Your long career must have informed how you played her.MARY J.

shes living every experience.If youve been to her concert, its like therapy with 30,000 people.Photo Every one of you had brutal scenes.How did you recoup from that, or is that part of your job?GARRETT HEDLUND Every bit of it was quite emotional, and we had an amazing team that made it seem easy.Because it was an insanely short shoot, everybody came to play.CAREY MULLIGAN I do quite a lot of films that are emotional.So a long time ago I stopped taking it home.I did a play in New York about seven years ago where I played a paranoid schizophrenic.It was very bleak.And after that I realized I couldnt take it home at the end of the day.I had to sort of wear a hat and take the hat off.Even though Mudbound is a period film, it feels deeply relevant today.With the events in Charlottesville and neo-Nazis on the rise, do you think that people are more aware of something that black people in this country knew never went away?REES Its like we just pulled the tablecloth off.This tables always been here; we just now pulled off the cloth and said, Oh, wait.So I think its forcing a recognition for seeing an interrogation of histories.If I can go three grandmothers back and find a slave, that means someone else can go three grandmothers back and find a slave owner.When you interrogate your histories, it forces you to rethink who you are and where you are.Was it surprising that things maybe havent changed all that much?MULLIGAN I was surprised to the extent of it, that part of society still holds archaic, unforgivable beliefs about things.Ive been shocked in the last year by the extent of it.I think I was a little bit nave.Where people felt before they had to keep a secret, now theyre given a platform to speak these things out loud, which is crazy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.BLIGE I knew that there was still racism because I would have to deal with it going in stores, or if youre not dressed up people really Advertisement Continue reading the main story REES They assume youre stealing.BLIGE until you pull your credit card out, you know?REES I feel like a lot of it was evident during Barack Obamas presidency.There was unprecedented disrespect, unprecedented resistance.There was a sole purpose to stonewall him.That was a version of putting him in his place.People were talking about postracial; we just kind of knew that was an error.Im fine now dressed up in these clothes and talking to you, but when Im in the drugstore and in my sweats, the reaction is still more of suspicion.Im treated as a thief rather than a customer.And thats New York City today.Its arguably most pronounced in America, but its not limited to America.Set against that bleak reality, what does Mudbound do then?REES I think Mudbound reveals the interconnectiveness of our stories.You cant separate out threads of history and race as economic construct.Mudbound makes it very plain.Race is about commerce; its not an actual thing.Its a fiction that was created to basically divide resources unequally.You couldnt do this with someone if you saw them as another human being.You could only do it if you say, Youre different.Manifest Destiny.God wants us to have it.Mudbound unravels all that.We see these particular threads, and how their fates are woven together, and how theyre in almost a jail of their own creation.BLIGE I think that it will show us that we really need to stop all of this Im better than you because I have this, or Im better than you because Im this.I know it sounds clich, but it will show us that we are in this together.When all those storms came and Houston was flooded, the same neighbor you said you hated the other day as you were underwater had to help you.HEDLUND I think theres going to be a great amount of self-reflection for everybody that watches it to see where they stand and where theyve been.I dont want to give away the ending; I think that the best part is that it ends with love.For a film that everybody thinks is so sad, or so divided, that ends so positively, thats a rarity.Photo Do you feel its different working for a male director versus a female director?HEDLUND I think an artist is an artist, and passion is passion.And there is no divide in that.MULLIGAN Ive had great experiences with women and great experiences with men.Ive had very collaborative experiences with women, probably more so.But that might just be chance.I felt on this particularly there wasnt an idea that wasnt fully explored.We all brought stuff that we wanted to put in.Seventy-five percent of it did get in and thats rare.But that could just be Dee being really collaborative and wonderful.HEDLUND The most freeing thing was that we didnt overrehearse everything and do it nine million times.Dee said from the beginning she wants to meet the characters through us, and it was just beautiful for that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After #OscarsSoWhite and then Weinstein, people are saying we need more voices behind the camera.Do you see any change?REES I just shy away from saying, Oh, yes, theres progress.We thought wed changed in the 60s, and when Im 80 well think, Oh, weve really changed now.I think consciousness maybe ticks upward, but in terms of behavior, we as human beings move in cycles.So well see.Are things shifting in the industry?MULLIGAN I think there is a shift in understanding, but it hasnt affected things the way that we hope yet.REES The fact that the exception to the rule [is] a cast that looks like this, with a crew that looks like this, that all these women department heads [are] news tells you where we are.The moment its not news Oh yeah, theres woman crews all the time then maybe weve gotten somewhere.
The Hand-Drawn Journey of the ‘Shape of Water’ Poster:::::Guillermo del Toros latest film, The Shape of Water, is not easy to classify.It genre-hops through fantasy, science fiction, thriller and romance to tell the tale of a mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) at a laboratory who falls for an amphibious, scaled creature (Doug Jones).Imagery expresses the story better.And one image in particular, that of a woman and a merman floating in an underwater embrace, distills the movie to its soulful essence.That concept, which comes to life in the film (out Dec. 1), is the focus of the movies intricately hand-drawn teaser poster.Here is how the poster evolved, as explained by Mr. del Toro and its designer, James Jean.Photo Starting With a Drawing Five or six years ago, when Mr. del Toro was deep into other projects, he imagined this embrace and worked with the storyboard artist Guy Davis to get it down on paper.Fast-forward to preproduction on The Shape of Water, when the Los Angeles illustrator Natalie Hall was asked to make another sketch based on Mr. del Toros conception.Thats what appears in the movie (and the trailer): the womans face partly obscured by the creatures, the two melding in a kind of yin and yang.Next, Mr. del Toro brought in Mr. Jean to create an illustration for the teaser poster.The director was a fan of the covers Mr. Jean had designed for the DC Comics series Fables.As Mr. del Toro explained in a phone interview, His drawings have a delicate nature to them and beautiful line work that is at the same time realistic and sort of elevated into a style of his own.Using charcoal on paper, Mr. Jean got to work on the poster, pictured above in progress.He used screen grabs and photos of the creature costume from various angles as reference points to create an accurate duplication of the mermans look.And he was inspired by Gustav Klimts painting The Kiss when thinking about how to intertwine the characters.Photo Creating the Poster Mr.Jeans process involved first making a pencil sketch of the image, then enlarging that image and transferring it onto printmaking paper.He put down a coating of charcoal to create the hazy background, sort of like a gray mist, he said in a phone interview.The womans face is clear in the drawing, but not the creatures.It just seemed natural for me to hide the face because the form and silhouette of his body are so striking to begin with, he said.I wanted the creature to stay more mysterious and have the viewer project their own idea of what he would look like.The final teaser is bathed in aqua with glimmering sparkles.The blue was applied digitally, but Mr. Jean painted white textures and added the pinpoints of light for a more magical effect.

Review: Greta Gerwig’s ‘Lady Bird’ Is Big-Screen Perfection:::::I want you to be the very best version of yourself, says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).Video But what if this is the best version?Lady Bird responds.Its a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice.She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.While Lady Bird honors the gravity of Christines struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight.The very first scene begins in tears.Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of The Grapes of Wrath while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novels moving final sentences.Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy.It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the admissions process.Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage.She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time.She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush).She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.Photo You might think youve seen this all before.You probably have, but never quite like this.What Ms. Gerwig has done and its by no means a small accomplishment is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise.The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothe Chalamet).None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig.(Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument.Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted.It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family.The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larrys melancholy and Marions ill humor.They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesnt always express itself as kindness.They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make Lady Bird sound drab and dutiful, but its the opposite.I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is.I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits.Id tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail.Im tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself.In life, thats a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies.Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, Lady Bird is.
‘Thor: Ragnarok’ Hits Theaters With a Thunderclap:::::Photo LOS ANGELES After a four-month absence from theaters, Walt Disney Studios returned over the weekend, releasing Thor: Ragnarok to blockbuster results and teaching rival studios a lesson about how to approach sequels to sequels.Thor: Ragnarok, the latest film from Disney-owned Marvel Studios, took in an estimated $121 million on 4,080 screens in North America over the weekend.That total was colossal even by superhero standards about 42 percent higher than opening-weekend results for Doctor Strange, released last fall, and 3 percent higher than what Spider-Man: Homecoming initially managed over the summer.Directed by Taika Waititi, an eccentric New Zealand filmmaker whose previous three movies played in art houses and collected a grand total of $9.5 million, Thor: Ragnarok has taken in an additional $306 million overseas, Disney said on Sunday.The film, starring Chris Hemsworth and Cate Blanchett, cost an estimated $180 million to make, not including at least $100 million in marketing costs.Interest in Thor: Ragnarok has been sizzling since Disney released a teaser trailer in April.In early September, an informal moviegoer poll conducted by Fandango, the online ticket seller, found that Mr. Waititis film was the most anticipated offering of the fall a surprise to Hollywood, which had expected Justice League, produced by Warner Bros. and set for Nov. 17 release, to easily dominate.(It was second.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story At first, few had been crying out for another Thor sequel.Marvels second stand-alone film about the character, Thor: The Dark World, took in $645 million worldwide in 2013.But critics were lukewarm, the production had been marked by behind-the-scenes creative clashes and one star, Natalie Portman, did not want to return.Photo Instead of taking the usual route with third chapters in successful Hollywood franchises Who cares about making a good movie?Take the money and run!Marvels movie chief, Kevin Feige, decided to radically retool the Thor series.With input from Mr. Hemsworth, Thor: Ragnarok became less self-serious and much more comedic, leaning into the absurdity of the main character, a beefcake god who carries a magic hammer and travels by rainbow.
Thomas Barrack’s Colony Capital Ends Bid for Weinstein Studio:::::Photo LOS ANGELES A potential buyer walked away from the Weinstein Company on Tuesday, nudging the struggling studio closer to the brink.After disagreeing on price, Colony Capital, the private equity firm run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., ended talks with the boutique studio to buy some or all of its assets, according to two people briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was private.The Weinstein Company entered into exclusive talks with Colony on Oct. 16 as it rushed to contain the fallout from allegations of sexual harassment and assault against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein.We believe the company has substantial value and growth potential, Mr. Barrack said in a statement at the time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Colony found more disorder than it had expected and less value once it started closely examining the studio.By Oct. 26, a preliminary agreement for Colony to give the Weinstein Company an immediate cash infusion had fallen apart, even as Colony continued to evaluate the possible purchase of some or all of the studio.
Review: ‘Hello Again,’ a Movie Musical Ode to Love and Lust Over Decades:::::Photo In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown (Into the Woods) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Juless little-seen Bang Bang Baby, from 2014).And now, somewhere between the two, lies Hello Again, Tom Gustafsons florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusas 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzlers La Ronde).What most distinguishes Hello Again from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.Hello Again largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades.(Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)Video It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her.And then its off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T.

New Trailer: ‘Downsizing’:::::Photo Matt Damons star may have shrunk a bit after the failure of his recent dark comedy Suburbicon, but he could expand his box-office footprint again by getting small in Downsizing.He plays a telemarketer who undergoes a procedure that reduces him to five inches tall but gives him a new perspective on whats important in life.Directed by Alexander Payne, who wrote the script with his longtime collaborator Jim Taylor, the film feels less down-to-earth than their previous films, like Sideways and Election.Considering theyve earned 10 Oscar nominations between them, Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor can never be counted out as awards contenders.The comedys cast includes the Saturday Night Live veterans Kristen Wiig (as Mr. Damons reluctant wife) and Jason Sudeikis (as a gung ho advocate of miniaturization), and the new trailer offers glimpses of Laura Dern, Neil Patrick Harris, Niecy Nash and Christoph Waltz.Hong Chau, whose credits include Big Little Lies, has a key role as well.Set to Talking Heads Once in a Lifetime, the teaser reflects the confusion and regret initially felt by Mr. Damons character with the lyrics: And you may say to yourself, My God, what have I done?Paramount hopes audiences wont feel the same way when Downsizing hits theaters on Dec. 22.
Harvey Weinstein Expelled From Television Academy Over Abuse Claims:::::Photo Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer accused of sexual harassment and assault by several women, has been banned for life from the Television Academy because of widespread examples of this horrific behavior.The organization, which awards the Primetime Emmys, voted Monday to oust Mr. Weinstein, Variety reported.The Academy supports those speaking out against harassment in all forms and stands behind those who have been affected by this issue, the organization said in a statement to Variety.The unfolding and widespread examples of this horrific behavior are deeply disturbing to the Academys leadership.Investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker have revealed accusations of sexual harassment, assault and rape from women going back decades.Mr. Weinstein said his behavior has caused a lot of pain.A representative for Mr. Weinstein has said he denies allegations of nonconsensual sex.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The New Yorker reported Monday that Mr. Weinstein had hired private investigators to collect information on his accusers and on journalists who were reporting about their allegations.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His ouster from the Television Academy is the latest in a series of professional condemnations since widespread accusations about his treatment of women were published last month.Since the accusations surfaced, he has been kicked out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and fired from the Weinstein Company, which he co-founded.
John Mollo, Whose Costumes Made ‘Star Wars’ Seem Real, Dies at 86:::::Mr. Mollos costumes, intricate but appearing lived-in, were based on Mr. Lucass instructions and on his own sketches and those of a concept artist, Ralph McQuarrie, who drew some of the earliest renderings of many of the characters.The results included the weather-beaten martial arts outfit of Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill; the monkish robes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Alec Guinness; the dusty cowboy look of Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford; and the pure white dress draped over Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher.For the dark side, Mr. Mollo encased the imperial storm troopers in hard white carapaces and masks and hid Darth Vader, played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones, in a swooping black cloak and a helmet that brought to mind that of a samurai.The imperial outfits were designed to embody a fascist, dehumanizing order.Mr. Mollo said he had never expected the film to be the blockbuster it became on its release in 1977.Photo Most of the crew thought that the film was a bit odd while we were making it, he told The Times of London in 2012.We doubted that it would ever be shown.And I remember someone asking me what I was doing and I said, Its sort of a space western and one of the heroes is a dustbin.Star Wars, the surprise hit of the year, won six Oscars, including the one for Mr. Mollos costumes.He accepted it at the award ceremonies flanked by actors dressed as Darth Vader and storm troopers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As youve seen, the costumes in Star Wars are really not so much costumes as a bit of plumbing and general automobile engineering, he said in his acceptance speech.His second Academy Award, for Gandhi, was shared with Bhanu Athaiya.It was one of eight won by the film, including best picture.John Mollo was born in London on March 18, 1931.His mother, the former Ella Cockell, was an artist.His father, Eugene Mollo, escaped Russia in the 1920s and started a company built around a process for spraying cement.Photo Mr. Mollo traced his love of military uniforms to his watching the film Clive of India (1935) when he was a child and returning home from the movie theater to sketch the costume of King George II of Britain.He grew up in London and near the town of Farnham, in Surrey, and studied in a local school in Godalming before attending an art school in Farnham.Mr. Mollo served in the Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in Hong Kong, ending his service shortly before the Korean War began.After returning home, he helped run his fathers cement company and studied military history on the side, conferring with historians and conducting his own research.His other books include Military Fashion (1972) and Uniforms of the Seven Years War (1977, also with illustrations by Malcolm McGregor).His first film work came by way of his brother, Andrew, who was also a military historian and film consultant.Andrew recommended him for Tony Richardsons remake of The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968), set in the Crimean War.Mr. Mollo supervised the creation of about 3,000 military uniforms.Mr. Mollo also designed costumes for science fiction films like Ridley Scotts Alien (1979) and Paul W. S. Andersons Event Horizon (1997).His first marriage, to Ann Farquharson, ended in divorce.He married Louise Pongracz in 1968.Besides her, he is survived by a son, Thomas; his brother, Andrew; and three grandchildren.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mollos last work as a costume designer was on a series of television movies adapted from C. S. Foresters novels about the Napoleonic War officer Horatio Hornblower, the last of which was shown in 2003.
George Clooney’s Awkward White Guilt in ‘Suburbicon’:::::Nice try.Were just in hoary old Hollywood, where showing a problem tends to be confused with addressing it.All we know about the family across the way theyre the Mayerses is that theyre new homeowners and that theyre black.And boy, are they restrained.When racists scream at her, Mrs. Mayers doesnt scream back.She merely continues to pin the laundry on the clothesline.When she experiences a customized price hike at the grocery store (for her, every item is suddenly $20), she relents and makes the sort of stoic exit that a movie like this needs to double as a triumph of dignity.Photo Meanwhile, Mr. Mayers barely gets a line.But he mows a mean lawn.Their kid spends the movie playing with Nicky, whos mandated to do it by his aunt.The mandate extends to Mr. Clooney, whose sense of social progressivism hits a ceiling.The way the Mayers family functions isnt all that different from how Dianne Reevess jazz singing and the footage of the actual Annie Lee Mosss testimony are deployed in Mr. Clooneys 2005 docudrama, Good Night, and Good Luck.They were flicking at progressivism that the movie didnt have the political bandwidth to get into.But the difference is that both women (neither of whom achieves character status) are part of the movies wider sanctimony in recreating Edward R. Murrows battle in the 1950s with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his televised anti-Communist witch hunt.Its righteousness on Ambien.But I put up with the movies turning Ms. Reeves and the footage of Moss into weapons: They served the movies thematic strategy.Unlike, Suburbicon, it had an argument.McCarthyism really is bad.Yet it seems that in his films, dignified is the only way Mr. Clooney wants to imagine black people.Anytime a movie or television show retreats into certain American pasts, Im both annoyed and relieved.Back then can provide cover for an all-white cast.It can feel like an excuse or a hide out.But filmmakers might want to be careful about where the time machine sends them.Sofia Coppolas went back to the Civil War, for The Beguiled.Rather than deal with the moral centrality of slavery, she simply freed the slaves herself.Sometimes you get very good filmmaking anyway.You also get gentrification.Mr. Clooney has directed six movies; five are set in the middle of the previous century.And Suburbicon clarifies why.Race is a blind spot.None of the scenes with the Mayerses go on for more than 90 seconds; most last less than 15.And all are intended as a moral counterpoint to the darkening frivolity going on at the Lodges.The Timess Manohla Dargis got at this inequality in her review of the film.The casting telegraphs the movies priorities.The black actors Karimah Westbrook, Tony Espinosa and Leith M. Burke may not be as famous as the movies white stars, but Mr. Clooney hasnt given them a chance to show whether theyre also as good.Photo In September, after the Suburbicon premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, he told David Sims, of The Atlantic, that he knows his approach is imperfect.In all fairness, there are a lot of people better qualified to make the African-American story in suburbia, I think, Mr. Clooney said.Theres a version of this film Id like to see from the other side that could be better represented by someone who can speak to that better than me, and probably should.He went on: I think my version was what I know, which is white angst and the fear of losing your place to minorities.He also said that hed like to see others directors Ava DuVernay or Steve McQueen, say do a version of this story.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sure, its possible that the white riots happening in Suburbicon reflect the current tour of white nationalist pop-up events.And perhaps somewhere inside this movie lives a farce that reckons with white indifference in the face of national catastrophe.But no one had the audacity to find it.The movie is the catastrophe, instead.During the era in which this movie is set, you would get dramas like Joseph L. Mankiewiczs No Way Out, from 1950, or Pressure Point, a social drama from 1962 that Stanley Kramer had a hand in.They both star Sidney Poitier, and neither is afraid of at least trying to see race from the other side.The violent, relentless depiction of racism in No Way Out, complete with a race riot, is actually still pretty shocking.Theyre as square as the movies Mr. Clooney tends to make, but theyre also daring, however imperfectly, to look right at the present rather than hunkering down in the past.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The big surprise of Jordan Peeles Get Out is its conception of a racism that doesnt need lynch mobs or a Confederate flag to make its point.Good, liberal white people the ones for whom I voted for Obama is supposed to be an icebreaker inflict as much harm as obvious bad ones.Mr. Clooney is not humanizing the Mayerses, per se.He is using them.The sad thing is that he didnt need to.The black characters have nothing to do with the plot of this movie.Theyre here almost against their will, kept in the white-controlled existential purgatory that Mr. Peeles movie identifies as the sunken place.By the final bogusly optimistic shot, its obvious what Suburbicon wants you to know: This movie voted for Obama.If Hollywood movies are in trouble, something as confused as this one signals a hastening of their demise.Most of me will always want some version of this middlebrow entertainment in my life.But if fighting to keep that kind of movie alive also means fighting for the cynicism of Suburbicon, the rest of me wants to say get out.
Laurence Fishburne on the Role That Made Him Cry:::::Last Flag Flying grapples with a complex, highly emotional situation.How does it resonate in our political climate?I think the film transcends the politics of the day in that it really deals with the camaraderie among men at arms and the way they are bonded pretty much for life as a result of having to experience combat together.It also illuminates beautifully the anguish of the loss that people feel when a loved one goes off to serve and makes the supreme sacrifice.Its comedic in many ways yet stars Steve Carell in an unusually serious role.When I say that Bryan and Steve are master actors, you must remember that we have these little symbols for the actor: the comedy mask and the mask of tragedy.Steve is perhaps best loved for his comedic work, but its not like he hasnt developed his skills for tragedy.You seem aged beyond your 56 years in this movie.And youre only nine years older than Anthony Anderson, who plays your son on black-ish.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I was only [about] nine years older than Cuba Gooding Jr. when I played his dad, too, [in Boyz N the Hood].[Laughs] And I was cast in Apocalypse Now at the age of 14 to play a 17-year-old.Its my luck that I was born a bit of an old soul, and its served me well.How did the Apocalypse Now casting go?I had been acting for about four years when I met with Francis Coppola and Fred Roos, who produced the film.And Fred did all the talking, while Francis sat there quietly observing me.They asked simple stuff like, How old are you?And I lied and said 16.Then they asked, What grade are you in school?And I said, A freshman I mean a sophomore.Then a receptionist walked in, and Francis finally spoke up and said, Do you think this kid could be 18?And she took a look at me and went, Sure, and walked out of the door.And the rest is history.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On black-ish, the show has dealt with police brutality, the presidential election and even menstruation.As an executive producer, do you have any say about the issues that the creator, Kenya Barris, tackles?Kenya and his writing staff do their thing, and when I have an idea or a suggestion, we throw things at the wall and see what sticks.I trust his point of view because its not that different from mine.You have to remember that Kenya, myself, Anthony, any number of our producers weve been black all our lives.And yet less than a quarter of black-ish viewers are black, according to a Nielsen study.Were trying to reach everybody that we can with the specificity of our culture and our experience, the joys and challenges and vicissitudes of what its like for us in this country at the moment.And if the numbers are any indication of how were doing, the reality is that our experience is universal.Youve been working for 16 years on an adaptation of Paulo Coelhos The Alchemist.Any other passion projects?My company, Cinema Gypsy, produced a podcast, Bronzeville, in conjunction with Larenz Tate and his brothers that were developing into a television show.It deals with a very tight-knit African-American community in Chicago in 1947 and people who run a numbers wheel.And Im doing another Marvel movie in Atlanta hush-hush, secret-secret, top-secret stuff.Im passionate about all the things I do, really.
Transactions Tied to Weinstein and AIDS Charity Are Under Investigation:::::Mr. Cole said that amfARs lawyer told him the charity was not the target of an investigation but was a witness.We will certainly cooperate and comply with the subpoena, Mr. Cole said.In May 2015, Mr. Weinstein had arranged for two items to be auctioned at an annual fund-raiser for amfAR in Cannes, France, on the condition that half the proceeds would go to the American Repertory Theater, which had done a trial run of his production Finding Neverland.Photo The arrangement served an underlying deal Mr. Weinstein had struck with the theater that allowed him and other investors to be reimbursed for a $1.25 million payment and a $500,000 charitable contribution toward the show if they got third parties to donate those amounts.It is unclear whether Mr. Weinstein, who was a chairman of the fund-raiser event, disclosed the underlying deal to anyone at amfAR.When the auction came up short, he insisted that the theater get more than half the money raised, and that amfAR wire it immediately.When amfAR officials said they werent in a position to share the proceeds because the winning bidders had yet to receive their items, Mr. Weinsteins company placed $600,000 in an escrow account for the organization on a short-term basis, according to internal amfAR records.As part of their investigation, prosecutors are examining transactions and contracts between amfAR and Mr. Weinstein and the American Repertory Theater, according to two of the people with knowledge of the investigation.Prosecutors have sought correspondence, payment records, tax documents and any written agreements related to the donations.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Weinstein defended the transactions in a September interview, saying that everyone involved benefited, and that he told Mr. Cole the money would go to the theater as part of a business arrangement.That month, Mr. Cole said in an interview that he had agreed to Mr. Weinsteins proposal because it brought in money for the AIDS cause, ultimately raising $306,669 for amfAR.He said that he did not recall Mr. Weinstein telling him at the time that it would serve an underlying business deal, but that he was satisfied knowing the money was going to a legitimate nonprofit.Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a law firm hired by the amfAR board, reviewed the $600,000 arrangement and determined that it was legitimate and lawful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the charitys chief executive, Kevin Frost, expressed concern to its chief financial officer in a June 2015 email: Nothing about this deal feels right to me, and I believe we have not done due diligence to understand exactly what this money is being directed to or why amfAR is being used to facilitate these transfers.The auction catalog disclosed that some proceeds from one of the items, a sitting with a fashion photographer, would go to the theater.It did not include that note for a Hollywood experience package arranged by Mr. Weinstein.In April this year, four members of amfARs 19-person board expressed concerns about the handling of the transactions to the charities bureau at the office of the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.In a letter to the charity in September, the bureau said the transactions raised several concerns, including whether they resulted in benefits to private interests, and told the charity to strengthen its corporate governance.
Film Series in NYC This Week:::::Photo Our guide to film series and special screenings.All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.DIRECTED BY DENNIS HOPPER at the Metrograph (Nov. 3-8).Around the end of the 1960s, Mr. Hopper, as a director, made an era-defining classic (Easy Rider, showing Tuesday and Wednesday) and an end-of-an-era semi-fiasco (the wildly innovative The Last Movie, showing Friday, whose making is addressed in the documentary Along for the Ride, opening this week).And although he is probably most remembered his subsequent turns as unhinged villains (Blue Velvet, Speed), he didnt stop directing.Out of the Blue (Saturday and Tuesday), a ragged portrait of a punk youth (Linda Manz) and her troubled home life (Mr. Hopper plays her jailbird father), makes haunting use of Neil Young tracks and is regarded by some as a neglected great film of the 1980s.Calling the movie a late-blooming masterpiece, the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that it proved Mr. Hopper to be an heir to the cinema of Nicholas Ray.212-660-0312, metrograph.com ORIGIN STORIES: GRETA GERWIGS FOOTNOTES TO LADY BIRD at the Quad Cinema (through Nov. 9).To accompany the release of Lady Bird (opening Friday), her first solo directorial feature, Ms. Gerwig has compiled a program of movies that influenced her.Some of the titles, like the Northern California coming-of-age classic American Graffiti (Saturday and Tuesday) and D.A.Pennebakers Original Cast Album: Company (Friday, Saturday and Wednesday), have clear bearings on Lady Bird, which follows a Sacramento teenager (Saoirse Ronan) as she copes with her family, adolescent romance, college applications and high school theater.Other titles, like Mike Leighs Secrets & Lies (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday), connect in more oblique and intriguing ways.212-255-2243, quadcinema.com OTHER ISRAEL FILM FESTIVAL at various locations (through Nov. 9).This annual festival emphasizes voices from what it calls the other Israel.In this years edition, that label includes Palestinian and Arab-Israeli communities and, in the documentary Desert Wounds (Tuesday and Wednesday), Christian refugees from Eritrea and Sudan.The festival closes Thursday with Holy Air, a comedy about a man who tries to bottle and sell air from the site of the Annunciation in Nazareth.otherisrael.org STANISLAW LEM ON FILM at Anthology Film Archives (through Nov. 11).Perhaps the best-known film adaptations of Lem, the Polish science-fiction author, are the two versions of Solaris one from 1972, a brooding, glacially paced philosophical meditation by Andrei Tarkovsky, and Steven Soderberghs remake from 2002, a concise, poetic recapitulation of the same themes.But both films were actually late to the punch.Anthology Film Archives will also show the rare Solyaris (Sunday), from 1968, shot in black-and-white for Russian television.This survey of Lem on screen also includes the half-live-action, half-animated The Congress (Sunday and Nov. 11), from 2013, directed by Ari Folman (Waltz With Bashir).It centers on an aging actress (Robin Wright) who agrees to have her likeness digitally archived for future use.212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org
Review: ‘LBJ’ Hides Its Light Under a Bushel of Makeup:::::Photo From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into LBJ, you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character.It couldnt have been easy.Hes nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy an actors landscape while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions.This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an unconditional war on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.Video Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnsons road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nations healer after John F. Kennedys death.Its a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky.One moment its 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether hes barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier.Hes fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasnt thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in Point Break.Its a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him.I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.Photo Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstones script, LBJ is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelsons talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity.Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but hes booming in a vacuum.Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary.Thats too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies Selma, Jackie, Marshall that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history.They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate.With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, LBJ doesnt look all that different from most other great-man stories.Yet there are moments Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness.In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior.
Review: In ‘A River Below,’ Saving Dolphins Can Get You Killed:::::Photo The truth turns into a tangled mess in A River Below, a bold and urgent documentary whose seemingly straightforward story quickly runs awry.Filmed primarily on and around the Amazon River, the movie centers on the pink river dolphin and two men trying to save the species from extinction.The dolphin is amazingly approachable and curious, yet its flesh is also the prime bait for piracatinga, a catch that many fishermen sell for their livelihood.In recent years, thousands of dolphins have been slaughtered.Fernando Trujillo, a Colombian scientist, has toiled to protect dolphins and alert authorities to high levels of mercury in piracatinga.Eventually he brings his facts to the media, and receives threats from those who disdain his work.What kind of world is this when a biologist needs to be scared to tell the truth?he asks.By the end of the film hes donning a bulletproof vest.The second man, Richard Rasmussen, is a Steve Irwin-like host of a nature show in Brazil.He was instrumental in bringing a horrific video to light, one where fishermen spear then butcher a pregnant dolphin.The footage, played here several times, sparked outrage and led to a five-year ban on piracatinga fishing.Soon there are disputes over the videos accuracy and how it was obtained, as well as fights over the collateral damage that arose from its airing.Accusations of media manipulation are made, as are arguments over whether the videos ends justified the means.Even while delivering magnificent views of the Amazon, Mark Grieco, the director, doesnt shy away from harsh images.He also captures taut moments as this conservation film becomes an examination of ethics and aftereffects, and as simple facts turn frustratingly complex.
China’s Newest Film Festival Tests the Limits of Independence:::::Agang Yargyi, a Tibetan filmmaker who traveled from the western province of Sichuan to attend, expressed admiration for Mr. Fengs choice of a historical subject, calling it very daring.Mr. Agang, 27, has made three short films, including one, Dream, that played in film festivals in Finland and Washington.He described the challenges facing filmmakers, heightened in his case by his ethnic ties to a sometimes restive region.He cannot get a visa, for example, to accompany his films on the festival circuit.China is a country that doesnt like to review its history, he said.And yet Chinas troubled history is inescapable.Pingyaos historical center, a protected Unesco heritage site, dates back 2,700 years.Its 30-foot walls enclose evocative narrow streets and courtyards hidden behind worn wooden doors.Many structures have been neatly restored, catering to the millions of tourists drawn to one of Chinas last unspoiled old cities.Photo Mr. Jia chose Pingyao because it is near his hometown; one of his films, Platform, takes place there and includes an encounter between two characters on the ramparts of the citys walls.That film was about a theater troupe in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, which ravaged the countrys cultural elite.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The only cinema in Pingyaos old city, ironically, was a modern addition, built in 1965, just before the Communist leader Mao Zedong set the Cultural Revolution in motion.The cinema closed in 2003, but reopened last year as a museum.A red banner on the building declares, Long Live Great Leader Chairman Mao.The festival had the financial support of the regional government, which hopes to attract still more visitors.Opening night drew more than 1,500 people, according to organizers.Fans pressed the barricades framing the red carpets to snap photographs of Chinas biggest stars.
Kevin Spacey to Seek Treatment as Sexual Accusations Grow:::::Former employees of the Old Vic have come forward to say that the theater had known about Mr. Spaceys behavior at the time.We were all involved in keeping it quiet, a former employee told The Guardian newspaper.I witnessed him groping men many times in all sorts of different situations.A spokeswoman for the Old Vic declined interview requests.On Sunday, the Star Trek: Discovery actor Mr. Rapp told Buzzfeed News that Mr. Spacey had invited him to a party at his apartment in 1986, where he had made unwanted sexual advances.Mr. Rapp said that after the other guests had left, Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, took him into his bedroom, and lay on top of him.In a statement that has been widely criticized in part for using this moment to come out, Mr. Spacey said he was horrified by the accusations and did not remember the incident.But if I did behave then as he describes, he said, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.The day after that apology, Netflix announced that the next season of House of Cards, in which Mr. Spacey starred, would be its last.On Wednesday, another man came forward, saying that when he was a teenager, Mr. Spacey had lain on him while he was sleeping.Speaking via a video link in which his face was not visible, the man told Victoria Derbyshire of the BBC that the episode had occurred in the 1980s in New York.The man said that when he was 17, Mr. Spacey had invited him to spend the weekend in New York.He said that Mr. Spacey had asked him to share his bed, but that he had declined and slept on the sofa.He then described waking up in the morning to find Mr. Spaceys arms around him.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I was uncomfortable, at best, traumatized at worst, he said.In a statement posted on Facebook, Roberto Cavazos, a Mexican actor, said that Mr. Spacey routinely made unwanted advances toward young men.It seems that it only took a male under 30 to make Mr. Spacey feel free to touch us, he said.He also said that Mr. Spacey was often seen in the Old Vics bar, squeezing whoever caught his attention.Mr. Cavazos went on to describe his own experience with Mr. Spacey: I myself had a couple of unpleasant encounters with Spacey that were on the edge of being called harassment.
Review: ‘A Gray State,’ Behind a Filmmaker’s Madness:::::Photo After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, David Crowley began work on a spectacularly ambitious feature film called Gray State.As we learn in the new documentary A Gray State, Mr. Crowleys movie was supposed to be a dystopian thriller designed as a warning against authoritarian control.Mr. Crowley made a concept trailer that appeared online in 2012 and garnered a huge following.But despite signs of progress, the film never happened.Mr. Crowley was found dead in January 2015, along with his wife and daughter, in what police concluded was a double homicide and suicide: He had shot his family and then himself.Perhaps because Mr. Crowley was drawn to the paranoid fringe (he is shown meeting and watching Alex Jones), the deaths became a cause for conspiracy theorists.Video The documentarys director, Erik Nelson (a producer on Grizzly Man), explores the disjunction between the charismatic filmmaker-to-be with a penchant for both self-promotion and self-documentation and a man who was, it eventually seems clear, descending into mental illness.In one scene that captures the apparent duality of Mr. Crowley, the movie features an interview with two entertainment executives who speak enthusiastically about a meeting with him.Mr. Nelson then shows them as they listen to audio recorded beforehand in which Mr. Crowley describes plans to manipulate them.Theres a morbid fascination inherent to documentaries like A Gray State, which is engrossing for the reasons its also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour, a friend of Mr. Crowleys, says, its a mystery that answers all the major questions except Why?
Review: ‘Along for the Ride,’ an Artist Through the Eyes of an Assistant:::::Photo No man is a hero to his valet has been a truism since the 17th century.It does not apply, however, to Satya de la Manitou, the self-described right-hand man to the actor and filmmaker Dennis Hopper for over 40 years and the onscreen narrator of Along for the Ride.His reverence for his friend infuses this documentary, shot in somber, stately black and white (except for color clips).He interviews many of Hoppers friends and associates, including the art dealer Tony Shafrazi and the actor and filmmaker Dean Stockwell, with whom Hopper so memorably appeared in David Lynchs Blue Velvet.Video Mr. de la Manitou met Hopper in New Mexico when he was flush with the success of Easy Rider (1969) and had persuaded Universal Pictures to fund a metafictional art film called The Last Movie.The editing of that movie, in Taos, became the subject of its own documentary, The American Dreamer (1971), which seems to depict Mr. Hopper going mad.The Last Movie, as hermetically brilliant as it is indulgent, was a huge commercial failure that resulted in Mr. Hoppers near-exile from Hollywood.Mr. de la Manitou followed.Along for the Ride, directed by Nick Ebeling, does not ignore Hoppers wild side.Mr. de la Manitou tells of Hopper alienating Taos locals and sassing cops in bars as if these were heroic acts.But Hopper here is an artist as tortured as he was torturing, as if the director is trying to redress some imbalance.As moving as Mr. de la Manitous testimony sometimes is, this movie too often feels like a credulity-straining attempt at hagiography.
Review: In ‘Wait for Your Laugh’ and ‘Gilbert,’ Comedians Work Hard:::::Photo Rose Marie has been famous for so long that Wait for Your Laugh, a charming documentary about her nine decades as a performer, doubles as a history of 20th-century show business, focusing on vaudeville, early radio comedy, the birth of Las Vegas and the evolution of the female sitcom star.Now 94, Rose Marie, who proudly asserts that she went by her first name before any other celebrity, started singing for crowds at the age of 3, pairing an adorable childs face with the brassy belt of a grizzled diva.That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines.After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television.There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on The Dick Van Dyke Show, and later for many years on Hollywood Squares.In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her and Dan Harmon, the creator of Community, displays an insightful critics eye but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage.Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wises documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked.Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse.As in the documentary Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, this is a movie about a star never at peace unless shes performing, a contrast with Gilbert, another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.Video The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice.The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy.(I have a flight to California, he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11.I cant get a direct flight.They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes.When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing.And when she cracks a joke, hes quick with a booming laugh.Gilbert is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.Wait for Your Laugh Find Tickets Director Jason Wise Writers Christina Tucker, Jason Wise Stars Perry Botkin Jr., Deacon Conroy, Tim Conway, Dan Harmon, Alan Hecht Running Time 1h 25m Genres Documentary, Comedy Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated: Nov 7, 2017
Review: ‘My Friend Dahmer,’ the Boy Who Became a Cannibal:::::Photo No matter how much of a social outcast you are in high school, theres always this one kid whos even worse off.I recall a guy who, on the one hand, had facial hair before anybody else in his class and, on the other, wore a slide rule attached to his belt.I wonder what happened to him.In My Friend Dahmer, written and directed by Marc Meyers and adapted from a graphic novel memoir by Derf Backderf, that one kid is, yes, Jeffrey Dahmer, who shortly after completing his studies at an Ohio high school began his career as a sex offender, serial killer and cannibal.In this account, the teenage Dahmer is a withdrawn fellow who dissolves roadkill in acid in a shed behind his house and indulges in attention-getting classroom antics.For these he is adopted, in a sense, by three other nerds.Their mischief-making alternates with sometimes grisly scenes in which Dahmer contends with emerging obsessions.When a disturbed schoolmate cuts open his palm and drinks the blood, the others disperse, but Dahmer stands staring, transfixed.This film is sensitively wrought.Its credible in its evocation of mid-70s suburbia.The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul.But in abandoning the subjective perspective of the graphic novel, My Friend Dahmer feels a little lacking in purpose.My Friend Dahmer Find Tickets Director Marc Meyers Writer Marc Meyers Stars Ross Lynch, Alex Wolff, Anne Heche, Zachary Davis Brown, Lily Kozub Rating R Running Time 1h 47m Genres Biography, Drama, Horror Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated: Nov 7, 2017
Review: Bad Grandmoms Show Up for ‘A Bad Moms Christmas’:::::Photo Opposed as I am to sequels of any description, I have to allow that one can never have enough Kathryn Hahn.Add the magnificent Christine Baranski to the mix and A Bad Moms Christmas, while still a slog of base sight gags and lazy profanity, becomes marginally more bearable.Only marginally, given that this pitiful follow-up to last years Bad Moms is even less able to distinguish between crass and comedic.(To the writers and directors, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, theyre apparently the same thing.)Adding an extra schmear of bad mothers, the plot finds our three originals (Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Ms. Hahn) buckling under the stress of Christmas and appalled when their own mothers (played by Ms. Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) show up for the holiday.Video The new arrivals, complete with a single neurosis apiece the grifter, the clinger, the perfectionist infantilize and infuriate their daughters, who vow to take back Christmas.This rebellion, staged in raucous montages in a mall and elsewhere, involves getting plastered at the food court, terrorizing Santa with cleavage and assaulting strangers and one another.Worst of all is an extended sequence where Ms. Hahns character gives a Brazilian wax to a prodigiously endowed male client, who verbally guides us from stem to stern with disgusting specificity.At the same time, the movies presumably normally gifted men are as superfluous to the proceedings as a thesaurus in the writers room.Set in a suburban nightmare of oppressive expectations, A Bad Moms Christmas ends with its own sequel already cued up.I have heart cancer, Ms. Hiness character says at one point in a vain attempt to halt her daughters complaints.I think I know exactly what she meant.
Review: ‘Most Beautiful Island,’ an Immigrant’s New York Nightmare:::::Photo Dark corners of the immigrant experience in New York City, especially for women, are frighteningly dramatized in Ana Asensios suspense film Most Beautiful Island, a modest but effective writing-directing debut for Ms. Asensio, who also stars.The film opens with distant shots of diverse women walking through Manhattan before it alights on Luciana (Ms. Asensio), who has left her native Spain after a family trauma.Barely eking out a living babysitting two indulged Manhattan brats, and working part-time in a chicken costume to promote a restaurant Luciana is desperate to pay her rent in Brooklyn.She increasingly despairs of ever finding a path to financial security and personal fulfillment.Video Her Russian friend Olga (a vivid Natasha Romanova), an ardent believer in the promise of American opportunity, suggests an answer.She invites Luciana to attend a fancy party in a Chelsea basement, one that will pay Luciana well for her presence.What Luciana enters is a nightmare rabbit hole of objectification and physical peril for the amusement of wealthy New Yorkers.And we discover what is to become of the women who appear in the opening sequence.Ms. Asensio paints a Manhattan populated by threatening hoodlums, demanding roommates, indifferent doctors and scheming merchants.Greatly aided by her cinematographer, Noah Greenberg (shooting in Super 16 millimeter), and her sound designer, Jeffery Alan Jones, she uses restless tracking shots, hectic cityscapes, ambient noise and sequences of prolonged stillness to conjure unease and dread.Her producer, Larry Fessenden (Wendigo), is an old hand at indie horror, and Ms. Asensio has skillfully rendered a fate that is horrible indeed.
Review: ‘It Happened in L.A.,’ All That Questing After Love:::::Photo Michelle Morgans It Happened in L.A. is an ensemble comedy aspiring to wordy Woody Allen sophistication but lacking serious political or satirical bite.And yet, glimmers of promise abound.Ms. Morgan plays Annette, an unrealized Type A writer living with the milquetoast Elliot (Jorma Taccone), a writer-director on a Game of Thrones-like TV show.Their friend Baker (Dree Hemingway), an interior designer who pines for marriage but sleeps with men too quickly, pursues a loveless affair with a married man (Tate Donovan).When Annette and Elliot separate because of Annettes restlessness, she canoodles with a disheveled dilettante (Robert Schwartzman).As for Baker, her cousin (Kentucker Audley) promises to hook her up with a colleague.Video In Annette, Ms. Morgan (who wrote the Kristen Wiig vehicle Girl Most Likely) gives herself the smart, loquacious and caustic role, while Ms. Hemingway (Starlet) plays the needier, less intellectual of the two.Amid peppery dialogue and solid production values, the movie acknowledges show-business absurdities (green-screen emoting, the seeming ubiquity of people hawking their own scripts) with rueful affection.But the film stoops to using a prostitute (Margarita Levieva) yes, she proves to have a heart of gold to validate Elliots virility.As a screenwriter, Ms. Morgan is nimble with glib conversation, and she is fearless at playing an often unlikable character.But this movie might only narrowly pass the Bechdel test, and mustering sympathy for Annettes affluent, insular circle is difficult.The plot resolutions ultimately feel pat, and the conflicts, in retrospect, thin.You sense that Ms. Morgan can deliver harder punches.Maybe someday she will.
Review: In ‘No Dress Code Required,’ a Gay Couple’s Mexicali Blues:::::Photo A county clerk in Kentucky made headlines in the United States in 2015 when she defied a landmark Supreme Court ruling and refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.But that was old news in Mexico, where months earlier a similar showdown had played out.After almost two years, two gay men were finally issued the marriage license they were legally entitled to in Mexicali, the capital of the northern Mexico state of Baja California.No Dress Code Required documents the obstacles that couple, Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Victor Fernando Urias Amparo, who goes by Fernando, confronted to reach their goal and the public support that saw to it they would.As early as 2010, Mexicos highest court upheld same-sex marriages, yet local compliance varied widely.Citing religious grounds, the Mexicali mayor and Baja California governor made no secret of their opposition.In the film, Victor and Fernando are repeatedly rebuffed; municipal officials challenge their birth certificates, and investigate a claim they are mentally ill. Three wedding dates are scheduled, then postponed.At one, authorities say a bomb threat is closing City Hall.Video Publicly, the men remain amused; privately, they grow increasingly politicized.Asked if he knew what he was getting into, Victor says, I didnt understand.I had to change my attitude so people would respect me.As they become a media cause clbre, though, the bureaucrats eventually relent.Cristina Herrera Borquezs film limits its point of view to Victor and Fernandos, and doesnt delve into the opposition or examine the backstage maneuverings.When, as a public demonstration grows, the men are suddenly asked into the mayors office, no cameras follow.But they get their license, and No Dress Code Required chronicles the grudging advance of cultural change.
Review: Sorcery and Revenge Fuel ‘Blade of the Immortal’:::::Photo If theres one constant in samurai movies, its that their heroes are ridiculously hard to kill, battling on through every assault short of being blown to smithereens.Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds the physical ones, anyway heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miikes Blade of the Immortal.Adding a soupon of sorcery to the genres typical vengeance saga, Manjis immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishis screenplay.(As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly like, over years.)Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds.Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed.And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents.But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a True Grit connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.Its also one of the most bonkers.Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents.These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal whos 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves.(A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)Video Though not nearly as mindful or meaty as Mr. Miikes 2011 triumph, 13 Assassins, Blade is creatively gory fun.Overlong and over-the-top, the brutality finally becomes repetitive and somewhat deadening; but Mr. Miike has learned a few tricks from his many previous movies, like allowing the camera to sit still and capture the eerie silence that follows a massacre.That stillness is a trademark of Anotsu (Sota Fukushi, terrific), the storys big bad and also its most beautiful.Languid and slender, with an androgynous pout and a fondness for palest turquoise, the soft-voiced Anotsu leads his renegade army primarily by standing and posing.He doesnt need to scream or gesticulate; the whole world is his runway.
Review: ‘Dream Boat’ Documents Cruising on the High Seas:::::Photo Dream Boat, Tristan Ferland Milewskis documentary about a weeklong European cruise for gay men, quickly gets its audience into a vacation mood.It begins with passengers boarding the luxury ship in flip-flops and tank tops.A pair in nautical outfits greets old friends with kisses and champagne glasses.The chatter in the promenade grows as small crowds become a large sea of excited smiles.Soon, the camera moves from just gazing at passing strangers to focusing on specific men in the international crowd.Theres a passenger from India on his first gay cruise, a Frenchman with disabilities whos determined to have a good time, a Polish man searching for a soul mate, a Palestinian whos moved to Belgium and the hot Austrian photographer everyone poses for.Although we dont yet know their names, the men start to emerge through their stories.These subjects have been gleaned from a group of largely white Adonises.Mr. Milewski does not directly address race and ethnic background, but clearly has some serious issues in mind.He asks different passengers their thoughts on love, H.I.V.status and the looks-obsessed mainstream gay culture.Although the repeated questions are narratively obtrusive, the mens voices broaden this experience beyond its escapist trappings.Some of the tougher interviews suggest that Mr. Milewski would like Dream Boat to be more substantial, but that impulse is mostly kept at bay in favor of lighter scenes, like high-heel races around the pool, costume ball preparations and all-night dance parties that give way to poolside flirting.The need to capture so many different perspectives dilutes the intensity of some of the mens feelings of loneliness and fear of rejection.
Review: In ‘11/8/16,’ Looking at Election Day, After the Race Is Run:::::Photo Spoiler alerts would be superfluous in a review of 11/8/16: You already know the ending, and youve lived through the events.Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night.The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere.We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect.When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic.Many of these voters decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities.Some of their outlooks are nave, others inspiring.Video Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated 11/4/08, an examination of that Election Day.The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen.Considering all thats been written and said over the last year, theres not much new to learn from 11/8/16.But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled.Judging by most people here, that wont be soon.
Review: ‘Last Flag Flying’ Is a Starry, Somber and Comic War Movie:::::Photo Richard Linklater is one of the great listeners in American movies.At his best most canonically in the Before trilogy but also in films like Slacker, Dazed and Confused and Waking Life he quiets the engine of plot, keeps the camera at a polite, attentive distance and lets people talk.The content of the conversations is important, but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words.Last Flag Flying, Mr. Linklaters new feature, is a suite for three voices.Its a lot of other things, too.A war movie, in its way, and also a road picture and a memory play.Set in 2003, at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished, it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task.Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines.Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) his nickname was Doc served in the Navy.Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie, and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war.Video Back then, Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge he mordantly calls it a better career decision a fact that connects Last Flag Flying to an earlier work, Hal Ashbys The Last Detail.That movie, released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young, was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklaters film.(Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)Last Flag Flying is not a literal continuation of The Last Detail.The names of the men and the details of their shared back story have been changed.A petty theft has been replaced by something grimmer and more specifically tied to Vietnam.But the new movie echoes its predecessor in shape and to some degree in mood.The three men make their way up the Eastern Seaboard, mostly by train, toward Portsmouth, N.H., stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Portsmouth is where Doc did his time, and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey.The young man, who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school, died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush.Doc has sought out his old buddies though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities to help bring his boy home.He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery, a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored.A member of the sons company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men.Photo Last Flag Flying often plays less like a tragedy than a low-key comedy in a tragic frame.Doc, Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes.Doc, younger than the other two he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together is the quietest, a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief.Sal is the wild man, a motor mouth whose high spirits, you feel, could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye.Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past, sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family.
Shopping With Superman:::::Aside from a Superman-ish forelock that tumbled down his forehead, Mr. Cavill looked more like a romantic lead from an E. M. Forster period drama, wearing a royal blue Cifonelli blazer, a dandyish confection of curls and a distinctly retro, and distinctly absurd, handlebar mustache.Its for a role, Mission: Impossible 6, he said sheepishly, referring to his giant crumb catcher.It makes me feel a little odd at times.People think Im some crazy handlebar-mustache-growing person.But, he added gamely, Im also playing around with it now, growing it a bit longer.Why the hell not?When else am I going to grow a handlebar mustache?Photo To the degree the mustache was intended as a disguise, it failed.In recent weeks, the whiskers had seemingly become more famous than he was, inspiring countless tabloid items after Mr. Affleck jokingly referred to it as a full-on porn-star mustache during a Justice League reshoot.Then again, Mr. Cavill has an uneasy relationship to fame.For years, he was a Hollywoods king of the near miss.He lost out to Daniel Craig to be the next James Bond, and also to Robert Pattinson on both Twilight and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Although he has been working steadily since he was a teenager, he always seemed to receive second billing to his biceps.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he has been flirting with A-list stardom ever since he inherited the role of Superman in Zack Snyders 2013 franchise reboot, Man of Steel, followed by featured roles opposite Armie Hammer in Man from U.N.C.L.E.in 2015 and now Tom Cruise in his latest Mission Impossible installment.In person, though, Mr. Cavill comes across less like a Hollywood action hero than an English gentleman in the prewar sense, a vestige of an era when leading men were described as dashing or debonair, and civility meant something.In a less august setting than one of Londons oldest bespoke tailors, he might be fair game for the paps (paparazzi), as they say in England, as well as for any hormonal young woman with a smartphone and an Instagram handle.Photo You go to the pub and youre sitting there with your friends having some drinks, and you keep on feeling like people are looking at you or checking their phones, he said, pausing in the aisles.You think, Shut up, theyre not looking at you.Maybe thats just my ego.Then one person comes up and says, Can I get a photo, please?All of a sudden its like terror cells just woke up.Yay, its photo time!He certainly was not raised to draw attention to himself.The son of a stockbroker father and homemaker mother, Mr. Cavill grew up in family of five boys on the island of Jersey, a crown dependency off the Normandy coast, and was educated at Stowe, an elite British school.His very British breeding may explain why Mr. Cavill carries himself with an utter absence of Hollywood star ego.He listens deferentially, even to shop managers and waiters; laughs easily, if self-consciously; and bashfully glances toward the floor at any mention of his cover-boy looks.It is an awkward British charm familiar to anyone who has seen a Hugh Grant movie from the 1990s.Browsing the aisles of Gieves & Hawkes, he said that he is still trying to figure out how to carry himself like a star, or even dress like one.Ive typically always been very classically English, and Ive enjoyed that classic cut, and I thought, Great, well done, you found your identity, he said.Understated only goes so far on the red carpet, however, so lately he has experimented with dressing more like a star, including his head-turning blazer that day, rendered in a shade of blue that might be called electric.I thought, Living in the world you live in, in the public eye, in Hollywood, try to be different, he said.Photo Listening to him speak in his clipped Masterpiece Theatre accent, it seemed odd to imagine him achieving crossover fame playing, essentially, a wide-eyed American farm boy (albeit with X-ray vision ) who speaks in a Yank accent as broad and flat as the Kansas plains.You can thank long hours with a dialect coach for that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its things like Ls, he said.My Ls belong in the front of my mouth.For an American, an L belongs in the back of the mouth.Strolling beneath framed photos of noble and royal clients like Prince William, he paused before a glass case containing the red ceremonial uniforms and swan-feather helmets of the queens bodyguards.This is the reason why I like the idea of Gieves & Hawkes, because they do so much of the military stuff, Mr. Cavill said.The military used to be such an important part of high society.You could take prizes in the Navy and suddenly you became quite a wealthy man, because if you took four French ships, you were rolling around in gold and gems.After an hour of suit shopping (nothing was purchased), Mr. Cavill suggested coffee at a place he knew a 10-minute stroll away.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.Wandering through Mayfair, he discussed the weight of the Superman legacy.Too often, he said, popular culture has gotten it wrong about Superman, interpreting his do-gooder ethos and blue tights as cheesy, and maybe a bit boring, compared to the acknowledged cool superheros, like Batman and Iron Man.Theres so much more in there, he said.Its like a movie about taking the super-pill.Imagine you have the ability to do absolutely anything you wanted.What do you choose to do with that power?How would you choose to use it?How do you exert it upon others?How do you accept failure?How do you love?We paused in front of an unmarked white door of a handsome townhouse near Berkeley Square.The door swung open to reveal Marks Club, a storied and exclusive private club.A lovely surprise, said a handsomely attired woman with a bob at the front desk.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lovely to see you, Mr. Cavill answered chipperly.He looked effortlessly dapper as he settled into a sofa beside a fireplace in the drawing room, which looked like a den in a viscounts country estate with its oil portraits and crystal chandelier.I mentioned that, in this setting, he looked more like James Bond than Superman.When Daniel gives up the mantle, well see, he said with a smile, adding that he would not find it taxing to play both characters, should the opportunity arise.(He already owns the requisite silver Aston Martin DBS.)Photo I asked him what other types of people are members of Marks Club.Honestly, I have no idea, he said, explaining that he had just been invited himself.Its a very old establishment-type thing.You cant just pay your way in.He was unsure whether other movie stars who were members.I dont even know what that means anymore, he said of the term.He said he would worry about someone who constantly thought of himself as a star.Theyre clearly injured on the inside, he said.Thats problematic.He certainly never expected to be called a star.In school, after all, he had been chubby; other boys called him Fat Cavill.Even as his profile rose, he never thought of himself as a Lothario when he was single.(He declines to chum the waters by talking about his current relationship, though the tabloids have him dating Lucy Cork, a 25-year-old stuntwoman.)When he was dating, he said, I couldnt do the whole, Hey, can I get your number?Cool, and then call them a week later.When I like someone, I like someone.I dont play hard to get.I cant be texting four or five different women all at one time.I cant do my Wednesday girl, my Monday girl, my Friday girl, my weekend girl, my after-12 p.m. girl.To put it in simple terms, I never had game, he said.It is fair to say, however, that those days are fading quickly.
Brett Ratner, Prominent Producer, Accused of Sexual Misconduct:::::A spokesman for Warner Bros. declined to comment.In addition to the cofinancing arrangement, Mr. Ratner will also remove himself from work on the studios adaptation of The Goldfinch, which he was set to produce.The New York Times spoke to several of the women interviewed by The Los Angeles Times, including Ms. Henstridge.Separately, The Times spoke to a former fashion stylist who said that Mr. Ratner had assaulted her in 2003.A lawyer for Mr. Ratner, Marty Singer, disputed the womens accusations to The Los Angeles Times.He also denied there had been any misconduct by Mr. Ratner in a statement to The New York Times, asserting that we are confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims.Ms. Henstridge, in a phone interview with The Times on Wednesday, said she had fallen asleep while watching a movie with Mr. Ratner and a group of friends in an apartment in New York, and awoke to find herself alone with him.She said that when she got up to leave, Mr. Ratner tried to coax her into staying.When she declined, she said, he blocked the door, pushed her down and forced himself on her.In the wake of allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein, whom dozens of women have come forward to accuse of misdeeds ranging from harassment to assault, Ms. Henstridge said she had struggled with whether to speak out.Every single day I woke up and realized, I cant let this go, she told The Times.This was not a confused lovers

ago.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The New York Times also spoke to a former fashion stylist who said that Mr. Ratner had cornered her more than a decade ago in the home of the producer Robert Evans and masturbated.The whole thing was so shocking and it all happened so fast, the woman, Leah Forester, said in a telephone interview.I just remember shaking and being in the bathroom and trying mentally to figure out what to do with this experience that just happened.She said she struggled for years to make sense of the episode, and even attended a party for Mr. Ratner at the home the next day.In a letter, lawyers for Mr. Ratner disputed Ms. Foresters account, and said that Mr. Ratners recollection was substantially different.The letter asserted that the two were friendly at the time and remained so afterward.Attending the party the next day is completely inconsistent with the notion that something objectionable had occurred with my client the day before, the letter said.Mr. Ratner, who got his start making music videos, wields considerable influence in Hollywood as a successful producer of big-budget action movies.He directed all three Rush Hour films, a franchise that cumulatively grossed about $850 million worldwide and cemented Mr. Ratners status among the industrys elite.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by

together.Naturally you get the hint, if I go bathroom with him, I could get a line.Her account was backed up by Kent Richards, a production assistant Ms. Sasaki was dating at the time.Photo Ms. Sasaki also provided her account to The Los Angeles Times, which reported that Mr. Singer said his client had no recollection of the episode.Another actress, Jaime Ray Newman, who appeared in the television series Supernatural, said she had once sat next to Mr. Ratner on an airplane and that he had made lewd comments to her and graphically described the sex acts he would like to perform with her.A friend of Ms. Newmans, Dennis Staroselsky, said she had told him about the encounter shortly after it happened in 2005.Ms. Newman also recounted the episode to The Los Angeles Times.Mr. Ratner could be generous and complimentary, according to several people who worked with him.He thanked every crew member by name during a screening of Rush Hour 2, Ms. Glatter said.Other women who appeared in the film told The New York Times that they had had positive experiences on set, and that Mr. Ratner had treated them professionally.Mr. Ratners behavior has occasionally gotten him into trouble.In 2011, he lost a coveted position as producer of the Oscars telecast after he used an anti-gay slur at a public event.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In The Los Angeles Times article, Ms. Munn, whose film credits include Magic Mike and X-Men: Apocalypse, elaborated on an episode she had written about in her 2010 book, Suck It, Wonder Woman!The Misadventures of a Hollywood Geek.In the book, she did not name Mr. Ratner, but in the article she said that he had masturbated in front of her in his trailer on the set of the 2004 film After the Sunset.Mr. Ratner had previously identified himself as the producer Ms. Munn had referred to, and said that he had sex with her a few times and then forgot her.Days later, he reversed that statement, telling the radio host Howard Stern that he had never slept with Ms. Munn.Mr. Singer, his lawyer, told The Los Angeles Times that Mr. Ratner and Ms. Munn had had an intimate relationship, something Ms. Munn denied in the article.Her sister corroborated her account in the report.A spokesman for Ms. Munn declined to comment to The New York Times.Ms. Forester, the former fashion stylist, said that she was assaulted during a visit to the home of Mr. Evans, a friend of Mr. Ratners and once the chief of production at Paramount Pictures.Ms. Forester said that Mr. Ratner had told her that he wanted to show her some old film reels in the projector room.He basically pushes me into the room, comes in and closes the door behind him and shoves me against the wall, Ms. Forester said.Mr. Ratner began tugging at her clothes, she said, then masturbated and ejaculated on her.A friend of Ms. Foresters, Jen Bush, said that Ms. Forester told her of the encounter about a year ago.A spokeswoman for Mr. Evans declined to comment.Ms. Forester said that it took her years to come to grips with what had happened or to even think of it as assault.I look back on that and I see this girl who really didnt understand, she said.I dont think the assault is blurry, but I think my psychology around it was blurry.
Beyoncé Joins Disney’s ‘Lion King’ Remake, in a Role Fit for a Queen:::::Photo Beyonc as close as any modern artist to royalty status in American pop music will play the queen to be of the Pride Lands in Disneys coming live-action remake of The Lion King.The studio confirmed Tuesday that she will voice the role of Nala, opposite Donald Glovers Simba, in the classic coming-of-age tale set among the animal kingdom of the African savanna.The star-studded cast will also include James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa from the 1994 animated version Chiwetel Ejiofor in the part of Scar, and a new spin on a vintage odd couple: Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa.The new King will make a play for a box office coronation in July 2019.It will join a string of live-action adaptations (with a healthy dose of state-of-the-art visual effects) that have been reliable hits for Disney in recent years, following Beauty and the Beast this year, The Jungle Book in 2016 and Cinderella in 2015.Jon Favreau, who helmed the recent Jungle Book, will direct.
Weinstein Documentarian Wants Another Shot at His Subject:::::Mr. Avrich, 53, chronicled his quest to document Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Weinsteins aggressive attempts to thwart him in a 2016 memoir, Moguls, Monsters and Madmen: An Uncensored Life in Show Business.It was in that book that Mr. Avrich also claimed that IFC had watered down the film and failed to give it a robust release.(Mr. Weinstein ended up hosting a release party for the book.)Photo There was nothing subtle about it, Mr. Avrich reasserted on Wednesday.IFC worked to soften content in the film that was negative to Harvey.According to Mr. Avrich, IFC asked for trims to a section that described Mr. Weinstein as giving specific instructions for a sex scene in the film Factory Girl.Mr. Avrich said IFC had also wanted to cut discussion about attempts by Mr. Weinstein to help his wifes fashion label by using his clout with celebrities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even so, Mr. Avrich said he had contacted IFC in recent days to ask if it would collaborate with him on a new version of the film or at least let him buy back distribution rights.If IFC declines, Mr. Avrich said, he will go forward with a new film.IFC did not comment on that.The effort could lead to criticism that Mr. Avrich is trying to capitalize on Mr. Weinsteins behavior.Anybody who says that doesnt know me or my work, Mr. Avrich said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Weinstein was fired by the studio he co-founded in early October after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.Since then, more than 50 women have come forward with claims against him, including rape, sexual assault and groping.The police in London, New York and Los Angeles have opened investigations.Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Mr. Avrich, who is working on a film about the Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, rights for which were previously controlled by the Weinstein Company, is best known in Hollywood as the writer and director of The Last Mogul, a 2005 documentary about the entertainment kingpin Lew R. Wasserman.Mr. Avrich intended to take a similar approach with Mr. Weinstein, tracing his rise from the concert promotion business in Buffalo to independent film chieftain.I set out to make a film that looked at Harvey as a businessman and cultural force, someone who was a creative genius but also an incredible bully, Mr. Avrich said on Wednesday.I briefly looked into his reputation with women, but nobody would touch it.He added: I was never told about him as a sexual predator.Would I have gone there if I had known?Absolutely.I obviously wish I had pushed harder.It would have made for a far better film.Mr. Avrich said he had tried to get Gwyneth Paltrow, Quentin Tarantino and others associated with Mr. Weinstein to participate in the film but had been rebuffed.Ms. Paltrow told The Times last month that Mr. Weinstein had sexually harassed her when she was in her 20s.Mr. Tarantino told The Times that he had known about sexual misconduct claims against Mr. Weinstein dating to the 1990s, and apologized for never speaking out.
Review: ‘Thor: Ragnarok,’ of Gods, Monsters and Silly Jokes:::::That isnt Thors fault; he was drawn that way.But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary and not just to boost his box-office appeal.Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isnt its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier.Its a good fit, at least for a while.Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: Hes a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth.For much of Ragnarok, hes a playfully sustained joke.As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality.That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance.Theres a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining.The Chatty Cathies also include Thors sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard.She lusts for Odins realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences.(Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.)Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok kill, strut, repeat and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until its serious hammer time.Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lam and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tuccis host in The Hunger Games.Photo The Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititis handling of the material.Its here that the vibe relaxes and the pictures filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background.Its also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, whos been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender.After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulks inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in Ragnarok than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititis truest achievement here.For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors.These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery.
New Trailer: ‘Daddy’s Home 2’:::::Photo As sexual harassment and assault scandals continue to rock Hollywood, the newly released trailer for Daddys Home 2 suggests that even the worst reputation can be rehabilitated.The family comedy casts Mel Gibson as the father of Mark Wahlbergs character.Mr. Gibson made headlines in 2006 with an anti-Semitic rant and in 2011 pleaded no contest to battery against a girlfriend.The trailer plays his shocking real-life behavior for laughs.Hey, kids, Ive got one for you, he tells his grandchildren.Two dead hookers wash up on the shore.Elsewhere in the trailer, Will Ferrell conjures up memories of classic yuletide comedies like National Lampoons Christmas Vacation as well as his own Elf with slapstick gags involving burning-hot cocoa and collapsing Christmas trees.(John Lithgow plays his father.)The first Daddys Home was a surprise hit during the 2015 holiday season, and Paramount hopes the sequel will turn out to be equally popular when its released on Nov. 10.As the trailer itself asks, What could go wrong?

‘Moulin Rouge! The Musical’ to Open in Boston With Broadway Hopes:::::Photo A stage musical adaptation of Moulin Rouge, Baz Luhrmanns lush dreamscape film that infused a 19th-century love story with contemporary pop music, will get a first production in Boston next summer.Moulin Rouge!The Musical will be the first show at the renovated Emerson Colonial Theater, which, after facing possible conversion into a college dining hall, is instead being refurbished by a large British company, the Ambassador Theater Group, that also operates two Broadway theaters (the Lyric and the Hudson).The production, which will begin performances in Boston in late June, is aiming for Broadway, but did not announce a schedule or a theater commitment.The Colonial, which opened in 1900 with Ben-Hur, is now owned by Emerson College and operated by ATG, and has a long history of pre-Broadway productions, including Anything Goes, Porgy and Bess, Oklahoma!, Annie Get Your Gun, Follies and La Cage aux Folles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Moulin Rouge, set in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris in 1899, is about a writer, Christian, who falls in love with a dancer, Satine, at the Moulin Rouge cabaret hall.The film, released in 2001, starred Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Moulin Rouge stage musical is being directed by Alex Timbers, a two-time Tony nominee (for the book of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson and for direction of Peter and the Starcatcher).The show has just begun a developmental lab in New York, with Aaron Tveit and Karen Olivo in the starring roles; the cast for the Boston production has not been announced.John Logan, who won a Tony for writing the play Red, is writing the musicals book.The score, an anachronistic mix of songs from the last 50 years, will include music featured in the film along with songs released more recently.
‘The Exterminating Angel’ Brings Together Opera and the Movies:::::WALLS This is one of the biggest hurdles for a composer trying to adapt Buuel: defining in music something that originally had little of it.Mr. Ads responds to the challenge with a crazily varied score.His earlier works have exhibited some similar traits; his 1995 opera Powder Her Face is full of self-consciously outrageous winking.But his sounds here are stranger and funnier.He emphasizes the situations surrealism with his choice of instruments, like the ondes Martenot and its ethereal, swooping tones.Miniature violins and a salad bowl are included.Video The orchestras regular instruments also get in on the fun.Theres a lot of dissonance in some of the ensemble scenes but also some abstracted waltz pulses that are amusing for the would-be-elegant way they wander in from nowhere.What did you make of the music?Photo KENNY Even though theres little music in the film, The Exterminating Angel is about people attending a dinner party after an opera Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor and the film is steeped in music appreciation.One of the guests, Blanca, entertains everyone on the piano, and theres talk of pizzicato and sonatas.The most beautiful woman in the group, Leticia, is mockingly given the Wagnerian nickname Valkyrie.Its commendable that Mr. Ads doesnt take these specific classical-music allusions as a cue for lazy pastiche.When Leticias nickname is first mentioned, a Wagnerian motif does not follow.Thats not to say that Mr. Ads isnt referential.Like many of our best contemporary composers, hes got an exhaustive command of musical idioms.I heard percussion like that of Calanda, the town where Buuel was from; flamenco; Wagner by way of Bernard Herrmann.WALLS During intermission, you reminded me that Buuel used the Liebestod from Wagners Tristan und Isolde twice, in Un Chien Andalou and LAge dOr, right at the start of his career.Advertisement Continue reading the main story KENNY The Liebestod was a piece of music Buuel was drawn to almost as much as he was to the drums of Calanda.He also uses it in a rarity, his 1953 Mexican adaptation of Wuthering Heights.For him the Liebestod is the ultimate musical expression of amour fou, the surrealist ideal of wild romantic love, an overwhelming destructive force against bourgeois values.WALLS Its clear that he enjoyed music and that he also detested the snobbish attitudes that can ruin our experience of it.In The Exterminating Angel, the characters seem to become enmeshed in their fateful trap right after the pianists performance, when a conductor in the group harshly corrects another guest who uses the wrong terminology.Its as if that casual elitist cruelty is spurring Buuel on.Photo KENNY Thats an interesting read on it.Almost invariably, Buuels films, when they depict the bourgeoisie, depict forces at work to confuse or punish it.This theme, and its particular pertinence today, may be why artists are lately drawn to The Exterminating Angel.Theres Mr. Ads and Stephen Sondheim, whos at work on a musical that merges the story with The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, another film about an upper-class dinner party gone awry that Buuel made 10 years later.But I have never looked at the outlandish situations in terms of cause and effect.I always see Buuel as a deadpan presenter of outsize existential quandaries with no rational explanation.WALLS When I glanced over some of Buuels writings, I found many references to music.In a short 1922 piece, Orchestration, he came up with character sketches for instruments.About the cello: Murmurs of sea and woods.Serenity.Deep eyes.They have the conviction and grandeur of Jesuss sermons in the desert.Regarding the timpani: Skins filled with olives.By the time he wrote his autobiography, My Last Sigh, he was suffering from deafness.Yet his musical memory was still crisp: He recalled trying to draft Andr Breton into opera fandom.It didnt take since the production, of Charpentiers Louise, was bad enough to drive everyone from the theater.KENNY That last chapter of My Last Sigh, in which he describes his preparation for death, is sad and funny at once and never more poignant than when he complains that his deafness has made it impossible for him to listen to music.
Review: The Big Apple Circus Is Ripe for Another Bite:::::A year ago, the Big Apple shrank a little.Big Apple Circus, which opened in 1977, had amassed more than $8 million in debt and did not produce a fall show.A crowdfunding campaign sputtered, and the circus filed for bankruptcy.But after a successful auction, Big Apple Circus has returned to Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center with its, well, core sensibilities intact.Big Apple Circus has switched from nonprofit to for-profit, but on a Saturday this month, the big top looked more or less the same.The souvenir stand had stayed modest; the portable toilets were unimproved.Concessions were of the chips-popcorn-churro variety, though the Dippin Dots came in a glowing cup, which seemed troubling.There was also a small booth selling beer and wine, where a few of the parents had lined up.At 11 a.m., some people find the circus taxing.Inside were plenty of familiar faces, both in the ring and behind the scenes.Big Apple has retained the director Mark Lonergan, the music director Rob Slowik, the writer and clown Joel Jeske and Barry Lubin, a rubber-faced pro who plays Grandma, a housecoat-clad clown who is ardently and inexplicably beloved.(Well, its probably more explicable if you like clowns.And flatulence jokes.)
The World Really Is a Stage, Scripts and All, to an Actor With Autism:::::A boyish 29-year-old Seattle native with the slight but toned build of a gymnast, he looked me in the eye and shook my hand when we met.On our table, he placed a sheaf of papers face down scripted notes it made him feel better to have, which he consulted if I asked a question he wanted to be careful answering.His vocal tone, timid at first, soon had the resonance of an actors voice.This is easy-ish for me because youre a reporter; Im the interviewee, he said when wed been talking awhile.We have specific roles.If we met on the street, that would be more scary.Thats how hes felt about performing, too, ever since he was little: perfectly comfortable as long as he knows the part hes meant to play.Whether Mr. Rowe is the first autistic actor to play Christopher is hard to pin down, given the number of Curious Incident productions around the world.Even Mr. Stephens, the playwright, said that while Mr. Rowe is the first hes heard of, he cant be sure.Photo Casting Mr. Rowe was the result of a deliberate effort by two professional regional theaters, Syracuse Stage and its co-producer, Indiana Repertory Theater (where the show opened this fall), to audition actors both with and without autism for the role.At a time when theaters are discussing diversity, there is a heightened pressure to include performers with disabilities.Uncommon Sense, Tectonic Theater Projects new Off Broadway play about people with autism and their families, has an actor on the spectrum, Andrew Duff, in its ensemble.Robert Hupp, the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, said that seeking out actors on the spectrum made logical and irrefutable sense for Curious Incident.To him, Mr. Rowes performance is clear validation.To anyone who ever had any concerns or doubts or wondered, Could an actor with autism play this role?Would an actor who falls on the spectrum be overwhelmed by this production?the answer is definitively no, he said.Not if youre Mickey Rowe.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Rowe, who earned a bachelors degree in drama from the University of Washington, found out when he was a senior there that he had autism.Legally blind, he struggles to read print smaller than 18-point type (he wears contacts onstage and glasses in real life, he says), and was in special education classes for his vision throughout childhood years he spent friendless, obsessed with magic tricks and circus skills: stilt-walking, juggling, unicycling.It strikes him as telling that he got speech and occupational therapy, too.He suspects his parents knew he had autism but didnt want to label him, and if so, he understands.He hasnt asked them, though; he said they dont have that kind of relationship.It was his girlfriend now his wife and the mother of their two small children who urged him to get help with issues like interpreting social cues.At the universitys Adult Autism Clinic, his diagnosis came as a big relief, because you know your whole life that something is different, Mr. Rowe said.You dont know why or what it is or if youre stupid or whats going on.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Still, he didnt tell people about his autism.So it was unsettling when, in an acting class he took around the time Curious Incident opened on Broadway in 2014, the teacher handed him one of Christophers speeches and said, You need to do this monologue.This is you.I remember thinking to myself afterwards: Does she know Im on the spectrum?Mr. Rowe said.Like, do people just know?He is not Christopher, though, and he and Christopher occupy very different spots on the spectrum.Even so, he recognized enough pieces of himself in that monologue that he went home and listened to the novel, by Mark Haddon, that Mr. Stephens adapted into the play.Photo Not long afterward, struggling to get work, Mr. Rowe threw in the towel on trying to pass as neurotypical.In an essay on the theater industry website HowlRound, he wrote about being an actor with autism, noting the tension between everything that I am and everything that might be conventional for an actor.He hoped his disclosure would change the way people looked at him, just enough to give him a chance.The piece raised his profile and put him on the radar of anyone searching for an actor with autism, but in practice nothing changed.Going out for roles, he still faced immediate roadblocks: the small talk, the eye contact, the instant connection an actor is supposed to make with the director.Just how you walk into the room and shake hands with the person when you first meet them is a huge part of the audition, and people on the spectrum arent very good at that, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So his rsum was comparatively slender when the Indiana/Syracuse production asked him to submit a video audition.Soon the shows California-based director, Risa Brainin, flew to Seattle to see if he had the chops.If he didnt, they werent going to compromise.We couldnt, she said.Its too major of a role, and too difficult of a role.What we wanted to do was give the opportunity.In Syracuse, where the production runs through Nov. 12, Mr. Rowe plays Christopher with an agile grace, an impish humor and a humanizing restraint that seems directly connected to his experience of autism.When the stage directions say that Christopher barks like a dog, for example, Mr. Rowe chooses to underplay it.The attention the show has gotten has been positive for him.For one thing, Lincoln Center asked him to speak at its autism-focused Big Umbrella Festival next spring.And the ripples extend farther.Marissa Wolf, who is directing Curious Incident this winter at Kansas City Repertory Theater, in Missouri, said Mr. Rowes casting inspired her to choose an actor with Tourettes syndrome, a condition often associated with autism spectrum disorder, to play Christopher in her production.Mr. Rowe worries a little about being pigeonholed, because he also wants to play roles that have nothing to do with autism.At the same time, he sees characters in the canon who he thinks could be on the spectrum like Bobby, the young misfit in David Mamets American Buffalo, and Jason, the awkward adolescent in David Lindsay-Abaires Rabbit Hole.Eager to work with Mr. Rowe again, Mr. Hupp and Ms. Brainin have been scheming about future projects, pondering which roles maybe something in Shakespeare?would be a great fit for him.What Mr. Rowe wants is a life in the American theater, probably with a stint in graduate school on the way.He can envision himself as the leader of a regional theater, and he is undaunted by the socializing that would require.Mingling may not be in his skill set, but to him, an artistic director is simply playing a role.And knowing that takes the fear away.
Review: ‘Uncommon Sense’ Looks at Life on the Autism Spectrum:::::Not that people with autism have been utterly absent from the stage.But too often they have been, like the young horse-mutilator in Equus, freaks and villains.More recently, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time featured a hero on the spectrum a role now being played, in a regional production, by Mickey Rowe, an actor with autism.And in Uncommon Sense, Andrew Duff, the actor who plays Moose, has a diagnosis of autism too.Still, it can be difficult to find ways to tell the stories of nonverbal characters like Moose and Lali authentically, when even their parents dont know what those stories are.Photo Mr. Paris and Ms. Paris-Carter, a couple with a family member on the spectrum, get around that problem by packing as much variety into their narrative as a 100-minute show will allow.As members of Tectonic Theater Project, they are expert mosaicists, comfortable with the process of research and montage that produced earlier Tectonic docu-plays like The Laramie Project.Though fiction, Uncommon Sense was developed over several years of investigation with autism families in Northern Iowa and elsewhere.The result can sometimes feel too programmatic.Putting across so many medical factoids and bits of real stories has the paradoxical effect of diminishing a sense of emotional truth.You can almost count the items on a worthy checklist being addressed, one by one, in the intercut vignettes: safety, sexuality, employability, the push-pull of independence.But with their exceptional and sometimes opaque traits, Moose and Lali and Dan and Jess, who are composites, never cohere as characters.Or perhaps thats just the perspective of a neurotypical observer a perspective that the play implicitly asks us to question.When the sound of silverware being sorted makes Lali miserable, Uncommon Sense helps us understand her discomfort by having us hear an avalanche of grating metal.(The sound design is by Stephanie Robinson.)When Jess reacts painfully to the fluorescent lighting vibration that a classmate doesnt even notice, she seriously asks him, Whats wrong with you?One persons disability is anothers exceptional awareness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even so, I suspect that most audience members who dont live with autism will have an easier time connecting to the stories of the parents, whose highest hopes for their children begin where the depths of other parents despair might end.Lalis mother, afraid that she will never be more than a thing to her daughter, dreams of a day when the girl might somehow be able to say, as other children do, whatever is on her mind.Spoiler alert: Be careful what you wish for.And Mooses parents must in the course of the play contend with the likelihood that their sons abilities may never improve.What kind of life will he have, and how much of their own lives can they sacrifice to provide it?By serving, in effect, as his brain in the world, are they preventing him from achieving whatever growth is possible?Would he be happier in an institution?What would happier mean?In the context of these racking questions, many of the plays comic devices, no doubt intended to balance the pathos, seem labored.(Dan, on a first date, licks a young womans feet as a cat might.)Strangely for a work about difference, the shape of the storytelling tends toward the conventional.Yet when uncomfortable scenes are allowed to develop naturally such as those in which Jess tries to manage a flirtation with the classmate shes tutoring real comedy, mixed with sadness, emerges.If Uncommon Sense had less of an overview in mind, it might have focused more profitably on this or any one of its other stories.As it is, under Mr. Pariss sometimes inventive but sometimes awkward direction, on a cramped multi-platform set by John Coyne, there is too much information pressing in from all sides.Neither the eye nor the mind is comfortable anywhere.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Which, on second thought, might be the most powerfully mimetic gesture in a play overfull of them.Uncommon Sense Sheen Center 18 Bleecker St. E.

Brandeis Cancels Play About Lenny Bruce After Protests:::::Photo Brandeis University canceled an upcoming play about the comedian Lenny Bruce after some students and faculty expressed outrage about its content, the school announced on Monday.The play, called Buyer Beware, was written by Michael Weller, an alumnus of the school and a playwright with a body of work that includes 1971s Moonchildren.Buyer Beware was supposed to go on stage this month, but according to a statement from Brandeis, faculty started raising objections last summer.Theater faculty members, the statement said, felt that more time was needed to produce the play appropriately, and that its performance on campus should go hand-in-hand with robust educational programming.One criticism was that the play unfairly portrayed the Black Lives Matter movement.A Brandeis theater student, Andrew Child, who led the campaign against the play, told The Boston Globe that the portrayal of its black characters was ridiculous and vicious, and that they are caricatured.
Review: Welcome to Prom. Try Not to Die.:::::Photo The first thing an audience sees when it enters the New Ohio Theater for ____ Marry Kill, James Pressons play with an unpublishable name, is a projection that reads, This is a play about where I grew up.It was exactly like this.If true, then lets hope Mr. Presson left early and subsequently clocked some serious therapy time.Prurient, futile and unconscionably long, his darkly comic portrait of teen life has an unusually high body count.At the risk of impugning Mr. Presson, this may not be strict autobiography.The play, produced by Less Than Rent theater, shares most of its plot points with John Fords superlatively lurid tragedy Tis Pity Shes a Whore, a fact Presson slyly acknowledges in the scripts subtitle, A Jacobean Revenge Comedy.(Technically, Fords play falls into the Caroline Era.But as Mr. Pressons characters often say, Whatever.)The play begins with an unnecessary frame story.Ryan (Alex Breaux) is lounging atop a Colorado mountain with his new friend Jenni (Ismenia Mendes) when a phone call from his brother lures him back to Greenport, Conn., and a set bounded with velvet ropes and topped with dozens of dangling blades.Because love is a boxing match.Or a knife fight.Or an MMA bout.Probably.Ostensibly, Ryan has returned to care for his cancer-stricken mother, while his brother, Brandon (Robbie Collier Sublett), elopes to Las Vegas with a barely legal girlfriend.To say that Jenni inexplicably tags along and that the mother and Brandons girlfriend are never seen and barely mentioned is to give some sense of the all-the-way-to-China plot holes Mr. Presson digs.Photo Back home, Ryan falls in with his high school crowd, many of whom are still in high school, becoming an accidental witness to incest, murder, suicide, attempted poisonings, extreme drug taking and a couple of scuppered teenage weddings.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Most of these incidents have analogues in Fords play, but as Joseph (Riley Suter), half of the sibling incest team, says to a friend, Well, this is getting sort of
Review: ‘Hello Again,’ a Movie Musical Ode to Love and Lust Over Decades:::::Photo In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown (Into the Woods) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Juless little-seen Bang Bang Baby, from 2014).And now, somewhere between the two, lies Hello Again, Tom Gustafsons florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusas 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzlers La Ronde).What most distinguishes Hello Again from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.Hello Again largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades.(Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)Video It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her.And then its off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on.The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame.A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret.Their scenes together are worth the price of admission.The movie benefits from Austin Schmidts neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeones lush production design.But Mr. LaChiusas songs largely fail to resonate here.Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes.And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson (Were the World Mine).The movie musical needs more ambitious creators like him.Hello Again Director Tom Gustafson Writer Cory Krueckeberg Stars Martha Plimpton, Sam Underwood, Nolan Gerard Funk, Jenna Ushkowitz, Al Calderon Running Time 1h 45m Genres Drama, Music, Musical, Romance Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated: Nov 7, 2017
‘Maybe I Am Arnold!’ How Michael Urie Agreed to Fill Harvey Fierstein’s Shoes:::::When asked by Mr. Fierstein and the plays director, Moiss Kaufman, to consider the role, Mr. Urie felt the same way.I never thought of myself as Arnold, he said.I thought they were insane.It was not that Mr. Urie, 37, hasnt played larger-than-life roles over the course of his career, from Marc St. James on the ABC comedy Ugly Betty, to Barbra Streisands assistant in the one-man play, Buyer and Cellar, to the frenetic lead in Gogols The Government Inspector recently.And after Torch Song, which runs through Dec. 9, he will play Hamlet at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington.But there was something about this part that Mr. Urie said he found daunting.In the first scene, the character is in drag, he said.And I thought, I could never do that.I could never be that guy.Im never going to be that free, that brave.It was way too scary.Mr. Fierstein said one reason he had held off bringing the show back to New York for 30 years was to make sure that he had the right Arnold.And while he knew Mr. Uries work, mostly from Ugly Betty, and said that he was a wonderful actor, it wasnt until a 2016 reading that he realized he had found his leading man.It was just there, Mr. Fierstein said.There was that thing you hope for, a magical connection between actor and role.The reading was equally revelatory for Mr. Urie: At the end, I thought, Maybe I am Arnold!Michael understood the character at that first reading, Mr. Kaufman said.And, he added, laughing, Actors arent always the best judges of what parts they should play.Photo Photo Noticed, but Not Typecast On a recent Saturday afternoon, in the three-hour break between the matinee and evening performances of Torch Song, Mr. Urie threaded his way through the crowds of Times Square to an early dinner at the Lambs Club, fashionably dressed in a dark green quilted jacket, a pair of skinny black jeans and black ankle high boots that he said were almost an exact replica of a pair his Ugly Betty character had worn.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As he passed a cluster of middle-aged men standing on the sidewalk, one spotted Mr. Urie, did a double-take and then yelled out, You were great last night.That was a trick, Mr. Urie said, not missing a beat.I dont remember his name.He was joking of course.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Urie lives with his boyfriend, Ryan Spahn, also an actor, in an apartment on the northern fringe of Hells Kitchen decorated with items taken from the sets of previous jobs.(Their dining room table is Vanessa Williamss desk from Ugly Betty and a bedroom lamp was lifted from the set of Partners, Mr. Uries short-lived CBS sitcom.)The two recently celebrated their nine-year anniversary by going to a disaster movie, the critically savaged Geostorm.(It was wonderfully terrible, he said, giggling.)At the restaurant, he glanced at the menu, announced that he tried to avoid both red meat and alcohol when doing a play, because they make him sleepy, and ordered the halibut, a side of roasted carrots and a Diet Coke.As the waiter walked away, Mr. Urie said he had only broken that dietary rule once, when he was in Washington doing Buyer and Cellar, and was up for a part in the Broadway revival of an award-winning play he declined to name: the role of the gay best friend to the female lead.The audition had gone well, and he and the director seemed to be on the same wavelength, he said.But that day, in between his matinee and evening performances, he got a call.You were great, Mr. Urie said the director told him.But there is one small, but probably insurmountable, obstacle: The estate that controls the rights is insisting that the role not be played by an openly gay character.The part went to someone else.Mr. Urie said he was so angry, I went out and had a beer and a huge hamburger.And then I went home to take a nap.Photo That was perhaps the only time in his career, he said, when his sexuality might have lost him a role.(He said the producers were convinced that if audiences knew the actor was gay it would take the ambiguity out of the opening scene in the play.)In fact, he said, his openness about his sexuality had mostly been a boon to his career: If I had never done these gay characters, you would have no idea of who I was, he said.You would never have heard of me.His Own Way In Getting the role in Torch Song was one thing.But Mr. Urie said he struggled early on with how to make it his own.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Should he get to know Mr. Fierstein, who based the character on his early career experiences as a drag performer?Spend more time with him?But I gradually realized he didnt want me to do him, or else he wouldnt have hired me, he concluded.He would have hired someone who was just like him.Mr. Fierstein was, however, a frequent and unpredictable presence at rehearsals.What was so funny is that he would always walk in the room when I would be questioning something about the role, Mr. Urie explained.I would read a line and then ask, Why do I even say this?And then I would hear from the back of the room, this voice yelling out he imitates Mr. Fiersteins raspy growl Who wrote this?I finally asked him, Do you wait out there in the hallway for 20 minutes, and then pick the perfect moment to come in the room?At another point, Mr. Urie asked Mr. Fierstein for guidance about his characters relationship with Ed, his bisexual, on-and-off lover.Why do I keep going back to him?Why do I love this guy?And Harvey said to me, Because he lets you.Which is such a great answer, because when you think of the gay community especially then we can be so withholding with love.There are reports, for now unconfirmed, that this critically acclaimed Torch Song will move to Broadway in the fall.No one involved will discuss that possibility.But Mr. Urie is convinced that this production has firmly reestablished the plays theatrical importance and the power of its message.I run into people all the time who tell me that they saw this play in its original run and it changed their lives, Mr. Urie said.In fact, I got a letter the other day from someone who wrote, Ive been in love with Arnold for 35 years.
Putting the Ghosts of Princeton’s Racial Past Onstage:::::Advertisement Putting the Ghosts of Princetons Racial Past Onstage Image James Collins Johnson, a formerly enslaved man who worked as a janitor and then a campus vendor at Princeton for decades, shown around 1890. Credit The voices of enslaved people can be hard to hear in the archives.But they are front and center in the Princeton and Slavery Plays, a suite of seven 10-minute works that will have their premieres at the McCarter Theater on Nov. 18 and 19.The plays, commissioned by the McCarter, are part of the broader Princeton and Slavery Project , a five-year research effort that has excavated and publicized the universitys complex racial history.They give voice to the ghosts of the past, and put them in conversation with the present.[ How Princeton is reckoning with its fraught racial history ] Emily Mann, the artistic director of the McCarter, said she hoped the plays would add to the currently raging national debate about slavery, history and memory.The full history of America needs to be taught, said Ms. Mann, who also contributed one of the plays.Not with blame, but with full knowledge.We spoke with her and three of the other playwrights about the hidden histories that inspired them.An American Abroad Image Branden Jacobs-Jenkinss Travel was inspired by the life of Betsey Stockton, a formerly enslaved woman in the house of an early Princeton president who became a missionary in Hawaii.Credit Wikimedia Commons In Branden Jacobs-Jenkinss Travel, three contemporary Princeton students debating a trip to Berlin hold a late-night dorm room sance and accidentally summon the ghost of another traveler, Betsey Stockton .Stockton was an enslaved woman who worked in the household of Ashbel Green, who became president of Princeton in 1812.She taught herself to read, and after gaining her freedom, became a missionary in the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) and then a teacher at Princetons lone colored school.Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins, a Princeton graduate whose plays include An Octoroon and Neighbors, said he was inspired by Stocktons travels to Hawaii, a place where American racial categories were essentially incomprehensible.He said he was also moved by her commitment to education for everyone in contrast to Princeton itself, which didnt graduate its first black undergraduates until 1947.It was really important to me that the impact of these findings not be reduced to the same old conversation about the black and white of our countrys history, he said in an email, referring to the research project, but instead, were underlined as implicating any- and everybody on this campus in this town, even.Under the Liberty Trees Image Emily Manns play, Under the Liberty Trees, is based on a 1766 newspaper ad for a slave auction in front of the building that housed the president of Princeton.Credit The first nine presidents of Princeton owned slaves, many of them during their tenures there.In the 18th century, prospective students had to present themselves to the university president for examination, so first person an applicant encountered at Princeton may have been an enslaved person who answered the door at the at the presidents house on Nassau Street.Ms. Manns play, Under the Liberty Trees, is based on a 1766 newspaper advertisement for a slave auction in front of the house, when the property of Samuel Finley, Princetons fifth president, was sold after his death.The liberty trees in front, according to campus lore, had been planted a few months earlier to celebrate the repeal of the hated Stamp Act.Ms. Mann, whose plays include Having Our Say (based on the memoir by two centenarian African-American sisters, the Delanys), said the projects research had reshaped her mental geography.I see this town completely differently now, she said.Princeton is such a microcosm of race in America.So much more has happened here than people realize.Freedom on Trial Image The playwright Regina Taylor was inspired by newspaper articles about James Collins Johnson, a janitor at Princeton who was arrested in 1843 and put on trial after a white student identified him as a fugitive slave.Credit Princeton University Archives During a visit to the archives, the playwrights were shown materials highlighting the range of what researchers had uncovered, from early land records to documents relating to a local free African-American who himself owned slaves.But what struck Regina Taylor hardest were newspaper articles about James Collins Johnson , a janitor at Princeton who was arrested in 1843 and put on trial after a white student identified him as a fugitive slave.Here was an African-American man who escapes slavery, names himself and believes that he was a free man, but then finds that he was not able to become a free man as he chooses, according to the Constitution of the United States, Ms. Taylor said.Ms. Taylors play, James Johnson: Princeton and the Constitution, uses beat-boxing and overlapping intergenerational voices to tell Johnsons irony-rich story.At trial, he contested the identification.Ultimately, a local white woman purchased his freedom for todays equivalent of well over $10,000 money that Johnson had to pay back.Johnson continued to work as a campus vendor for decades, and was buried in 1902 under a headstone, paid for by Princeton alumni, calling him the students friend.Ms. Taylor, who will direct a revival of her gospel musical Crowns at the McCarter next spring, connects the injustice of Johnsons debt with the school-to-prison pipeline today.Ava DuVernays film 13th lays it out, she said.How were still paying off the debt of our forefathers, the obstacles we still face to being a free person with full ownership of self.Talking Back to Statues Image In Nathan Alan Daviss play The Torch, a modern-day student talks back to this statue of John Witherspoon, an early Princeton president who signed the Declaration of Independence and also owned slaves.Credit Wikimedia Commons Earlier this year, Nathan Alan Davis ( Nat Turner in Jerusalem ) toured the campus with Martha Sandweiss, the history professor who led the research project.One stop was an imposing statue of John Witherspoon , an early Princeton president and signer of the Declaration of Independence, which was erected in 2001.Mr. Davis had been thinking about the continuing national controversies over monuments and naming, and had followed the debate at Princeton in 2015 over the legacy of Woodrow Wilson.When I saw the statue and learned that Witherspoon owned slaves, I thought, Here we go, he said.The Torch features a conversation between Witherspoons statue and a blowtorch-wielding African-American student named Jasmine, who quite literally holds his feet to the fire.Like a number of the other plays, it takes off from history but is very much in the present tense, connecting the legacy of slavery with contemporary issues like policing (introduced via an African-American officer who intervenes in Jasmines interrogation of the statue).Often with narratives about slavery, people say, Oh, this terrible thing happened, its too bad, but thank God were not doing that anymore, Mr. Davis said.But I dont want to let anybody off the proverbial hook.We cant simply look at slavery as an episode we have overcome.Its still present.Follow Jennifer Schuessler on Twitter:

Review: ‘Junk’ Revives a Go-Go Era of Debt and Duplicity:::::With that breakout work, Mr. Akhtar showed a gift for explosive terseness, packing fraught layers of meaning into the interactions of a handful of precisely drawn characters who turned ideological stereotypes inside out and back again.His command of a wide reach within close quarters was confirmed in his equally compact The Invisible Hand, which managed to be both a high-stakes hostage thriller and a Shavian debate on capitalism and Islam.Junk finds Mr. Akhtar filling a much bigger canvas.It has a cast of nearly two dozen (with an even greater roster of characters).And it runs two and a half hours, making it the longest of Mr. Akhtars plays.But with expansion has come dilution, and a sense that characters and themes are being stretched into thin transparency.This is not to say that Mr. Akhtar seems lost in the larger space afforded by this play-by-play account of one mans bid to become a master of the universe.On the contrary, Junk follows a labyrinthine, economically dense plot with remarkable briskness, efficiency and accessibility.Still, these assets never quite erase the feeling that what were watching is a tale weve frequently been entertained and alarmed by during the past three decades.Memorable onstage variations include two British imports that flopped on Broadway: Caryl Churchills Serious Money, a dazzlingly mannered account (in rhyming couplets!)of a hostile takeover, and Lucy Prebbles spectacularly flamboyant Enron.Photo On screen, there was pre-eminently Oliver Stones Wall Street (1987), which created a new genre of Hollywood biz flicks, with such worthy 21st-century descendants as Margin Call, The Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short.And insider-y boardroom back stories are perennials on best-seller lists.At their best, these works have been enlivened by piquant details that summon the quirks and ravening egos of predators in power suits.With glory-courting characters inspired not only by Mr. Milken but also by the mayor-to-be Rudolph Giuliani and the infamous stock trader Ivan Boesky, Junk might have easily been a parade of similarly outsized personalities in overpriced clothes with big shoulder pads.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Akhtar deliberately and honorably chose not to pursue that route.In prefatory notes in the script, he says, The insinuation of the mid-1980s in costume and design must not be overdone.The play is intended, he writes, as a ritual enactment of an origin myth.The myth, in this case, is the culture of debt, which Mr. Akhtar posits is one in which we are still immersed.He does so without undue speechifying or instructional exposition, as he chronicles Merkins takeover by proxy of a third-generation Pennsylvania steel company, led by a clueless family scion (Rick Holmes).The script is refreshingly nonjudgmental.At one point, Merkin complains about how reporters always go for the simple story, with a good guy and bad guy, adding, They dont understand how the real world works.Photo Accordingly, every major character is allowed to present the viability of his or her viewpoint.Whether old-guard Protestant patriarchal types or rule-bending Jewish parvenus (who face anti-Semitic barbs now and then), none of them are unconditionally lovable or loathable.Unfortunately, none of them are entirely convincing either.This is partly a matter of casting.Mr. Pasquale (The Bridges of Madison County) renders Merkin as a handsome cipher.You never sense the obsessive and infectious passion that drives him.(His code name in his insider trading deals, by the way, is Moby Dick).As a reporter determined to strip Wall Street to its seamy underbelly, Teresa Avia Lim never conveys anything like rabid ambition.In contrast, Michael Siberry, who plays her white-shoed love interest, is a blustery, sputtering figure, a persona that feels out of sync with the old-order propriety he is meant to embody.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In supporting roles, Matthew Saldivar (as a crafty lawyer), Matthew Rauch (as a crude tyro on the rise) and Joey Slotnick (as the Boesky stand-in) at least have expressive physical presences.But no one emerges as a fully defined individual.And while Mr. Akhtar may have rejected many of the outer trappings of the Wall Street potboiler, he still hews to many of its clichs.That includes a woman being brought to orgasm by the idea of her decrepit lovers financial power, and the antihero Merkin solemnly lying to his wife (Miriam Silverman) in the manner of Michael Corleone.And while the script offers some amusing lessons in shading language with hopeful sounding words to pitch a deal, Mr. Akhtars dialogue lacks its usual original snap.When did money become the thing the only thing?Ms. Lims character asks in the opening monologue.Its an ever-intriguing question, but youve heard it

Review: ‘Lee Harvey Oswald,’ an American Assassin in Puppet Form:::::Photo If you have ever wondered who pulled the strings of the John F. Kennedy assassination, La MaMa has a show for you.This is meant literally: The Life and Times of Lee Harvey Oswald does not explore the theories that have kept legitimate historians and basement-dwelling conspiracists busy for the past half century; what it does have is a lot of puppets, brought to wobbly life by a cast of eight humans dressed like federal agents, in white shirts and black slacks.Despite the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater stating on its website that the show explores three national traumas from the 1960s the killings of President Kennedy, his brother Robert and Martin Luther King Jr. the story squarely focuses on Oswalds bizarre journey.This is an ambitious project and typical for a company that has in the past deployed puppets for the likes of Twelfth Night, an exploration of Socrates and Platos philosophical teachings and a show about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.The first issue here is the difficulty in actually seeing the little guys, whose designs are apparently inspired by traditional Czech marionettes.They measure about eight inches, so even in the intimate confines of La MaMas first-floor space, their painstakingly detailed faces and costumes are reduced to a blur as they move in a seemingly random manner.Photo Why show Oswalds mother and father having clumsy puppet sex if the audience needs binoculars to see it?To paraphrase an old Woody Allen joke, the food is terrible and in such small portions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The sex scene, incidentally, is an early indication that the writer-director Vit Horejs, who founded the company and is in the ensemble, will take a soup-to-nuts approach to Oswalds life, all the way to Dealey Plaza and his death at the hands of Jack Ruby.Oswald died at 24, but the slackly paced show makes it feel as if he lived three times as long.
‘Kiss Me, Kate’ Will Head Back to Broadway With Kelli O’Hara:::::Photo Brush up on your Shakespeare: Kelli OHara is coming back to Broadway to star in a Roundabout Theater Company revival of Kiss Me, Kate.The production will be directed by Scott Ellis (She Loves Me) and will begin performances in February 2019, Roundabout said Monday.The nonprofit did not announce a theater or other members of the cast.The musical, featuring songs by Cole Porter, tells the story of two once-married actors who fight, flirt, and fend off gangsters as they prepare to stage a musical adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew.Ms. OHara will play the leading role of Lilli Vanessi/Katharine.With a book by Bella and Sam Spewack, the show originally opened on Broadway in 1948 (and won five Tony Awards, including for best new musical); a revival, with uncredited revisions by the playwright John Guare, opened in 1999, won the 2000 Tony Award for best musical revival, announced a closing in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and then managed to run a bit longer after a voluntary cast pay cut.Ms. OHara is one of Broadways most loved contemporary performers, and has led well-received Lincoln Center Theater revivals of South Pacific and The King and I.She won a Tony Award in 2015, for The King and I, and had previously been nominated five other times, including for a 2006 Roundabout revival of The Pajama Game.Last year, Ms. OHara performed in a staged reading of Kiss Me, Kate, also directed by Mr. Ellis, to benefit Roundabout.In that production, the male lead was played by Will Chase.
Hear a Newly Found Kurt Weill Song That Surprised Experts:::::Mr. Juchem said he didnt believe the archivist at first, but when he saw the handwriting, My jaw dropped.Photo Then the search for the songs origin began.Lenya had mentioned the song before, but under a different title, Song of the Blind Maiden.In the 1960s, she attempted to find the song but came up empty.Nowhere to be found, she said at the time.Probably buried in some basement.Weill scholars thought the song Lenya remembered was written for Das Lied von Hoboken, a German translation of the American play Hoboken Blues that starred Lenya at the Volksbhne in 1930.But, Mr. Juchem said, the lyric by Gnther Weisenborn didnt quite fit in the context of the play.So Mr. Juchem looked into the name of the Weimar-era faith healer mentioned in the song, Joseph Weissenberg (1855-1941), who was a charismatic evangelist with thousands of followers in Berlin and used cottage cheese and prayer as treatment.He formed a real sect, and he was a constant feature in the Berlin tabloids at the same time that Kurt Weill was reaching the height of his fame as a young composer in the city, Mr. Juchem said.It was in newspapers that Mr. Juchem eventually found the origin of Song of the White Cheese, which Weill wrote for a politically charged revue to benefit actors who had been laid off from the Volksbhne in November 1931.(Other artists who participated included Brecht and the composer Hanns Eisler.)Photo The song tells the story of a blind girl treated unsuccessfully by Weissenberg.It jokingly nods to the Lutheran chorale Lord, Take My Hand and Lead Me and ends with the girl wondering whether it would be better for everyone to be blind, so nobody would have to see whats currently going on in this world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the time, Germany was in a political crisis as the Nazi party rose to power, and aftershocks of the Great Depression had reached Europe.Song of the White Cheese is very much a song of its time a zeit song Mr. Kowalke said.Although the songs satire was easy to grasp for Berliners of the time, much of it would be lost on most people today.What do we do if the topical references have disappeared?Mr. Kowalke said.He added that when it is published and recorded in English, We might probably put an alternative lyric for Weissenbergs name.How the song ended up in Gerda Schaefers collection is still a mystery.One theory, Mr. Juchem said, is that Lenya, who had to begin performances for the Berlin production of Weill and Brechts Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, may have sung in the revue only once or twice, then passed on the song to Schaefer.That the song was never published isnt unusual for Weill, who was often so busy he didnt take the time to do that even for more major works like Das Berliner Requiem, Mr. Kowalke said.
Performance Space 122 to Return to Its East Village Home:::::Photo Performance Space 122, one of New York Citys downtown bastions of innovative visual art, dance and theater, will return to its home in the East Village in January, after six nomadic years while the organizations building was renovated.Inaugurating the new space will be the 13th and final edition of Performance Space 122s Coil festival the first during the tenure of Jenny Schlenzka, a former Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 curator who became the institutions executive artistic director this year.In an email, Ms. Schlenzka said that Coil would be ending because there is not the same need for a performance festival in January as there was when Coil started.She added that, because Performance Space 122 will once again have a permanent home, we are eager to spread our programming over the entire year.Among Coils events, from Jan. 10 through Feb. 4, are three world premieres: Jupiters Lifeless Moons (Jan. 12-17), a theater piece by the composer and writer Dane Terry; Petra (Jan. 23-27), by the choreographer Dean Moss and inspired by Rainer Werner Fassbinders 1972 film The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant; and he his own mythical beast (Jan. 31-Feb. 4), David Thomsons dance work that draws from a variety of sources including Alfred Hitchcock, James Baldwin and Roland Barthes.
Preet Bharara Goes to the Theater and Sees a Familiar World on Stage:::::His handling of the Cohen case, in particular, in which Mr. Cohens hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, pleaded guilty to insider trading and paid a record $1.8 billion penalty, made him something of a household name, landing him on the cover of Time (as well as on the list of its 100 Most Influential People of 2012) and even reportedly inspiring the character of Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti, in Billions.A New Yorker 2016 profile, headlined The Showman, in print, was more direct in the web version: The Man Who Terrifies Wall Street.That fame only increased after perhaps the most dramatic event in his legal career: being forced out of his position by President Trump on March 11.Mr. Bharara went on the offensive almost immediately, posting his version of events on the Twitter account he had started only five days earlier.I did not resign, Mr. Bharara stated.Moments ago I was fired.Being the US Attorney will forever be the greatest honor of my life.The tweet got 63,000 retweets and 133,000 likes.(He now has 495,000 Twitter followers.)Since that acrimonious parting, Mr. Bharara has begun to build a nascent media empire.In addition to signing on as a visiting professor at New York University School of Law, he is also a paid commentator on CNN, has signed a book contract with Knopf (the thought of the July deadline for his manuscript is a bit scary, he said), and has started a podcast, "Stay Tuned With Preet Bharara, with his brother Vinit, a technology entrepreneur.And he has kept up his gimlet-eyed observations of the Trump administration.If Donald Trump fires Robert Mueller, he should be impeached, Mr. Bharara tweeted on Oct. 31.Period.At the Junk opening, Mr. Bharara, dressed in a Boss suit and a Canali tie (close to, but not quite the Brooks Brothers and Brioni uniform of the predatory Wall Street kings cited in the plays opening lines), seemed as much as celebrity as the some of the actors who had also been invited, among them Gretchen Mol, David Schwimmer, Jonathan Groff and Aasif Mandvi.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the

chance to shake your hand.(And at the after-party at Tavern on the Green, one particularly effusive woman said to Mr. Bharara: You are a buoy in the roiled waters of these troubled times.)Does this kind of thing occur often?Mr. Bharara was asked.Yes, he said.This is what happens when you are fired by the president.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As he walked back to his seat, pointed the way by an usher who said she had once worked for Bear Stearns, Mr. Bharara noticed that the stage was now dominated by a huge Time cover featuring the image of the Steven Pasquale, the actor playing the Michael Milken-like character.My picture was better, Mr. Bharara said, laughing.Once seated, he said that he was enjoying the play (Its quite well written) and added that one scene in particular seemed especially knowing about the world he once inhabited one that showed a government informant fumbling his attempts to draw out incriminating statements from his boss in a wiretapped phone conversation.There is a lot of speculation right now about whether George Papadopoulos was wearing a wire, people saying that if he wore a wire, he must have gotten good information, Mr. Bharara said of the man who recently pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.as part of the Robert Mueller investigation into the 2016 election.And I was trying explain to people that just because someone wears a wire if he was wearing a wire doesnt mean you are going get anything good."Sometimes you have very good actors and they draw other bad guys in, he said.But sometimes you have a halting, nervous, unsuccessful attempt.They go into a meeting and they ask too many questions like that character did tonight and they get told, stop with the questions!and you walk away with nothing.Thats what went on it that scene.It rang totally true.(The playwright and Mr. Bharara had met briefly in the lobby before the play started, with Mr. Akhtar telling Mr. Bharara: You are such a hero to me, not just because our shared background, referring to their South Asian heritage, but also because of all you have done for this country.)At the after-party, a surprising number of people wanted to talk about Mr. Bhararas podcast, which seems to have attracted a devoted following in its short tenure.Preet?You are Preet, arent you?an elegantly dressed woman called out as Mr. Bharara passed by on his way to the buffet station of sliders and french fries.She beckoned him over to her table."I just wanted to tell you I love your podcast, she said.Its just tremendous."Thank you, Mr. Bharara said.Its No.5 on iTunes this week.Then he laughed, and added, Not that Im checking.With that, he was soon out the door, on his way home to Westchester.He left his last words for Twitter,

Review: In ‘State of Siege,’ Resistance to Plague in an Overcoat:::::Photo The disease of extremism rampages through Albert Camuss State of Siege, a deservedly minor 1948 play revived by the director Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota of Thtre de la Ville in Paris and presented by the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.The energetic staging in French with English supertitles is a master class in how to make a bad play better.But not even Mr. Demarcy-Motas stylish interventions can make State of Siege anything more than a hollow allegory.On a breezy summer night in Cadiz, Spain, a ballad plays and couples sway.Then a comet flames across the sky, heralding the arrival of the Plague (Serge Maggiani) and his slinky secretary (Valrie Dashwood), a grim reaper in lingerie.The Plague seizes power in the town, bullying the populace and curbing civil liberties.Truth is a casualty, so is love.Language suffers, too.Words like freedom libert if you dont like looking at the supertitles lose all meaning.How do we understand this Plague, a man who stomps around the stage in a black overcoat?Is he a grave illness or a fascist bureaucrat?Which is worse?State of Siege, which flopped at its Paris debut, can be read as a peculiar companion piece to Camuss 1947 novel The Plague, about a pandemic that overtakes an Algerian town.Here the symbolism is starker, the characters more crudely sketched.Photo Its a political allegory, a form that has lately saturated New York theater.Like several other recent productions 1984, Rhinoceros, Shakespeare in the Parks Julius Caesar State of Siege sometimes misses the symbolic mark and sometimes hits it as squarely as a punch in the nose.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The play takes right-wing extremism as its broad target.Because it is mostly written as parable, Camuss Spanish town could just as easily stand in for Poland or Hungary.But most of the Brooklyn Academy audience probably has Donald Trumps America in mind.

Kevin Spacey to Seek Treatment as Sexual Accusations Grow:::::Former employees of the Old Vic have come forward to say that the theater had known about Mr. Spaceys behavior at the time.We were all involved in keeping it quiet, a former employee told The Guardian newspaper.I witnessed him groping men many times in all sorts of different situations.A spokeswoman for the Old Vic declined interview requests.On Sunday, the Star Trek: Discovery actor Mr. Rapp told Buzzfeed News that Mr. Spacey had invited him to a party at his apartment in 1986, where he had made unwanted sexual advances.Mr. Rapp said that after the other guests had left, Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, took him into his bedroom, and lay on top of him.In a statement that has been widely criticized in part for using this moment to come out, Mr. Spacey said he was horrified by the accusations and did not remember the incident.But if I did behave then as he describes, he said, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.The day after that apology, Netflix announced that the next season of House of Cards, in which Mr. Spacey starred, would be its last.On Wednesday, another man came forward, saying that when he was a teenager, Mr. Spacey had lain on him while he was sleeping.Speaking via a video link in which his face was not visible, the man told Victoria Derbyshire of the BBC that the episode had occurred in the 1980s in New York.The man said that when he was 17, Mr. Spacey had invited him to spend the weekend in New York.He said that Mr. Spacey had asked him to share his bed, but that he had declined and slept on the sofa.He then described waking up in the morning to find Mr. Spaceys arms around him.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I was uncomfortable, at best, traumatized at worst, he said.In a statement posted on Facebook, Roberto Cavazos, a Mexican actor, said that Mr. Spacey routinely made unwanted advances toward young men.It seems that it only took a male under 30 to make Mr. Spacey feel free to touch us, he said.He also said that Mr. Spacey was often seen in the Old Vics bar, squeezing whoever caught his attention.Mr. Cavazos went on to describe his own experience with Mr. Spacey: I myself had a couple of unpleasant encounters with Spacey that were on the edge of being called harassment.
An Important Oscar Wilde ‘Woman,’ and a Drama Where the Playhouse Is the Draw:::::Before her arrival, Jonathan Fensoms handsomely appointed sets are filled with the hum of gossip and one finely honed observation after another, the aperus delivered by a gathering of aristos for whom gently barbed chat flows as naturally as afternoon tea.Nothing succeeds like excess remains surely the plays best-known maxim and is spoken by Lord Illingworth (Dominic Rowan), the very person whom Mrs. Arbuthnot has arrived to seek out.(The caddish diplomat also speaks the plays title a signature moment in any Wilde play.)Photo Hair cascading about her shoulders in keeping with a spirit that wont be easily tamed, Ms. Bests impassioned heroine wants specifically to wrest her son Gerald (the bright-eyed Harry Lister Smith) away from hoped-for employment as Lord Illingworths private secretary.The issue, which this feral mother is eager to keep under wraps, is that the moneyed cad whom she regards as competition for Geralds attention is in fact Geralds father.If Gerald lands under Lord Illingworths sway, Mrs. Arbuthnot will have lost the one truly legitimate love of her life her adored and adoring son.Observing watchfully (some might say overearnestly) as the stakes are heightened is Hester Worsley, the plays lone American, who is courted by Gerald but otherwise exists at odds with the same frivolous English upper crust with which the Dublin-born Wilde was clearly and entirely smitten.A chore at the best of times, the role essentially reduces the teenage Hester to the butt of numerous jokes, and the young American actress Crystal Clarke cant enliven the part beyond staring at the societal swells in her midst with her chin upturned.Photo Its equally possible that Ms. Clarke, in her London theater debut, is simply in awe of her colleagues timing.The distinguished roll call of talent includes the stage veteran Eleanor Bron, who purrs her way through the part of a grande dame with a habit of forever misplacing her husband, and Emma Fielding fondly remembered from the 1993 National Theater premiere of Tom Stoppards Arcadia as a drolly expressive house guest who pronounces that there are only four ideal men in London.Mrs. Arbuthnot would presumably put that number at somewhat less.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Best, by contrast, handles the borderline melodrama of the plotting with ease and makes one see the cost to the soul of Mrs. Arbuthnots intervention, her protective mother a companion piece of sorts to the fallen matriarch whom this actress played so well earlier this year in Terence Rattigans Love in Idleness.Mr. Dromgoole, as director, fills the scene changes with a sequence of sweet cabaret turns by Ms. Bests co-star, Anne Reid, the beloved octogenarian actress-singer whose Lady Hunstanton presides garrulously over proceedings that she can in no way control.(Ms. Reid some years back earned acclaim as Daniel Craigs onscreen lover in the unexpected romance The Mother.)Photo Its Lady Hunstanton during the scenic interludes who proffers the breezily trilled assertion in song that a boys best friend is his mother, but the production deepens the minute Mrs. Arbuthnot confronts her status as a tainted thing.This womans ruin is the productions glory.Ms. Bests elemental quality would be perfect for Ellida, the lighthouse-keepers daughter at the conflicted heart of Ibsens The Lady From the Sea (1889), a play that predates Wildes by only a few years.The role has, this time, landed into the empathic hands of Nikki Amuka-Bird in a ravishingly designed reckoning with a text that keeps one foot in the mystical, just as Tom Scutts painterly set gives the watery landscape of the title its own enclosed perch onstage.Photo The production, at the Donmar Warehouse through Dec. 2, marks a well-timed feather in the cap of its director, Kwame Kwei-Armah, who was appointed in September as artistic director-designate of the Young Vic theater across town.And in filleting a play that, in Elinor Cooks new version, has been relocated from the Norwegian fjords to an unidentified island in the Caribbean of the 1950s, Ibsens vaunted claustrophobia finds release amid a climate of rum cocktails and steel drums.Id have liked a bit more of a sense of place and the rhythms that go with it, in an authorial gambit that puts one in mind of the Trinidadian writer Mustapha Maturas Caribbean reworking of J. M. Synge with Playboy of the West Indies many years ago.But the fine cast includes Tom McKay and Jonny Holden as two of the men at large in the unfolding erotic hothouse and Helena Wilson as the older, more questing of two sisters who move not just between land and sea but between the ever-porous shores of desire and disappointment.After Wilde and Ibsen, what can one say about Agatha Christie beyond reminding those who keep track of such things that her record-breaking The Mousetrap celebrated its 65th birthday last month on the West End.Dame Agatha wrote other plays, of course, among them Witness for the Prosecution (1953), which has pitched up in the unusual setting of the debating chamber of London County Hall for a run through March 11.In taking their seats, the audience becomes the de facto jury inside the very building that was once a seat of London government.(County Hall now consists of a mixture of commercial enterprises, including two hotels.)Christies thriller at this juncture feels, truth to tell, like a hoary curiosity, and Lucy Baileys production could benefit from the outsize fun that has made Billy Wilders 1957 screen adaptation an enduring favorite over the years.(Choice characters like Miss Plimsoll the nurse played in the movie by Elsa Lanchester dont appear onstage.)As it is, one clocks the belligerent Englishness of the piece in both its appeal to national sentiment (we are told several times that England has the best justice system in the world) alongside a casual xenophobia whereby to be foreign is to be evil.It doesnt help that the younger generation comes off as comparatively lightweight, which means that Jack McMullen as the hapless, accused Leonard Vole rarely seems worth the fuss made by his plummy-voiced defense lawyer, Sir Wilfrid Robarts (David Yelland, commendably avoiding the temptation toward camp that must come with the role).That said, the twists are genuinely surprising and the surroundings have a novelty value all their own.Go for the playhouse if not wholly for the play.
Review: ‘Shadowlands,’ a Tale of C.S. Lewis’s Romance, Tackles a Different Tragedy:::::Photo When the public mood is a triple-strength cocktail of anxiety and alarm, there is something to be said for theater as comfort food.Heresy, I know but it can be calming to sit for a while with a sturdily crafted, nicely cast play that was mild even when it was new.Case in point: William Nicholsons anodyne biodrama Shadowlands, which traces the late-blooming 1950s romance between the author and Oxford don C. S. Lewis (his friends call him Jack) and the poet Joy Davidman.Directed by Christa Scott-Reed for the Fellowship for Performing Arts, this is a story of unlikely soul mates.In Jacks succinct phrasing, Joy is a Jewish Communist Christian American.He is Belfast-born, also Christian and as Establishment as they come.Photo Pen pals at first, they meet when Joy travels to Oxford.Jack (Daniel Gerroll) is a 50-something bachelor, already famous for the Chronicles of Narnia series.Emotionally reticent, he has a quiet warmth and a coterie of male friends whose supercilious sexism shifts into high gear at the sight of Joy (Robin Abramson, in her New York debut).Nearing 40, unaware that her marriage is almost over, she is buoyant, likable and unnervingly straightforward.Your letters have been the most important thing in my life, she tells Jack.Oh dear, he says, not unkindly.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They become friends, then marry; bit by bit, Joy infuses him with life.As he tells the audience at the top of the show, the subject on his mind is love, pain and suffering specifically, why a benevolent God allows people to endure horrendous loss.Theological inquiry fascinates Jack and Joy, but this question becomes more than hypothetical for them as tragedy looms.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Theater Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.The plot is wholly unsurprising even if you didnt see the original Broadway production in 1990 (starring Nigel Hawthorne and Jane Alexander), or the television movie that spawned it (starring Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom), or the feature film adaptation (starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger) that came later.
Review: In a Double Bill of Physical Comedy, Laughter Is the Best Reflex:::::This is not, in prcis, funny.Sometimes not in practice, either.Though many bits, like a Pierrot encounter with the moon, are delightfully imaginative, others cross the whimsy line and become cloying.That Marcel draws plenty of laughs anyway is a matter of recognition and also a matter of contrast.We are amused because the indignities we are seeing are: (a) real; and (b) happening to someone else.Still, thats not enough.As the second half of the bill will explain, the emotional givens are only part of the equation.The other key factor is that Mr. Magni, a founder of the physical theater company now known as Complicit, is so precise in his clowning.Considering how many times he smacks his face on the furniture, Id say thats a good thing; there is no room for error.This can make Marcel, and our response to it, feel a bit canned.(Mr. Magni and Mr. Houben have been performing it all over the world since its debut in Paris in 2015.)After the intermission, Mr. Houbens The Art of Laughter helps explain why: We have no choice in the matter.Photo The proof that Mr. Houben provides is pretty much irrefutable.In the manner of a genial professor studding a seminar with lively demonstrations, he shows that he can manipulate our laughter as easily as Marcel manipulated the bowler hat earlier in the evening.If he trips just so, we will laugh.If his shoe flies off x seconds later, we will laugh again.It doesnt matter how many times he explains what he is doing, even spelling out how variations in timing and sequence will affect the outcome: We still respond exactly as he predicts.Surprise, usually thought to be so important to humor, turns out to play second fiddle to our eagerness to laugh and our ever-renewable credulousness.We are all patsies.This is remarkable and yet perhaps not as scientific as the format wants to make it seem.Mr. Houbens astounding mimetic skill he even pulls off an impression of a wheel of Camembert is not just math, its showmanship.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.And also salesmanship.At times his seminar feels like a sample book of comedy components for purchase, to be mixed and matched in other contexts.Some might even seem familiar; Mr. Houben and Mr. Magni made ideal tragicomic vaudevillians in the Theater for a New Audience production of Becketts Fragments in 2011.Not everything on Mr. Houbens syllabus rings true, though.An anatomy of the comic potential of different parts of the anatomy seems reverse-engineered from his own idiosyncratic experience.And Im not sure I bought some of his broader dictums, like the observation that gratuitous violence is only funny between men.Has he never seen Dynasty?But I have to concede Mr. Houbens point that at the heart of most physical comedy is the communal enjoyment of watching dignity brought low.In that sense, he suggests, laughter is a virtue and a virus.Its not only infectious but hard to kill: It wants to keep on living.Thats a hopeful lesson to take home from class and sufficient, for one evening anyway, to mask whatever toothache or heartache you arrived with.
‘The Boys in the Band’ Is Bound for Broadway at 50:::::Photo Mart Crowleys The Boys in the Band is coming to Broadway for the first time next spring in a 50th anniversary production.The play, originally produced Off Broadway in 1968, focuses on gay men in New York City who assemble in an apartment on the occasion of a friends birthday party.As the night wears on, tensions rise and previously unrevealed conflicts emerge.Its first production was considered to be a landmark in the representation of gay men onstage.The play was groundbreaking in its exploration of how gay men treated each other and how they were made to feel about themselves, said Ryan Murphy, one of the producers, in a statement.And while some attitudes have thankfully shifted, its important to be reminded of what we have overcome and how much further we still have to go.Mr. Murphy, a creator of televisions American Horror Story and Feud, is producing the show along with David Stone, whose Broadway productions include Wicked and War Paint.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Several members of the plays announced cast identify as gay, including Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer and Andrew Rannells.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Boys in the Band is scheduled to run April 30 through Aug. 12, 2018, at the Booth Theater.Joe Mantello, a two-time Tony Award-winner, is set to direct.The show had its premiere in April 1968 at the Playwrights Unit, an Off Broadway theater.Originally scheduled for only five performances, it ended up running for over 1,000.It also drew a diverse audience.Jacqueline Kennedy, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev all attended performances.
‘Moulin Rouge! The Musical’ to Open in Boston With Broadway Hopes:::::Photo A stage musical adaptation of Moulin Rouge, Baz Luhrmanns lush dreamscape film that infused a 19th-century love story with contemporary pop music, will get a first production in Boston next summer.Moulin Rouge!The Musical will be the first show at the renovated Emerson Colonial Theater, which, after facing possible conversion into a college dining hall, is instead being refurbished by a large British company, the Ambassador Theater Group, that also operates two Broadway theaters (the Lyric and the Hudson).The production, which will begin performances in Boston in late June, is aiming for Broadway, but did not announce a schedule or a theater commitment.The Colonial, which opened in 1900 with Ben-Hur, is now owned by Emerson College and operated by ATG, and has a long history of pre-Broadway productions, including Anything Goes, Porgy and Bess, Oklahoma!, Annie Get Your Gun, Follies and La Cage aux Folles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Moulin Rouge, set in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris in 1899, is about a writer, Christian, who falls in love with a dancer, Satine, at the Moulin Rouge cabaret hall.The film, released in 2001, starred Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Moulin Rouge stage musical is being directed by Alex Timbers, a two-time Tony nominee (for the book of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson and for direction of Peter and the Starcatcher).The show has just begun a developmental lab in New York, with Aaron Tveit and Karen Olivo in the starring roles; the cast for the Boston production has not been announced.John Logan, who won a Tony for writing the play Red, is writing the musicals book.The score, an anachronistic mix of songs from the last 50 years, will include music featured in the film along with songs released more recently.
For This Playwright, Africa With Laughter, Not Tears:::::It was when she was cast as a cockroach and not even the plays sole cockroach that Ms. Bioh realized that if she wanted better roles, she would have to start writing them.(Her contemporaries Katori Hall and Dominique Morisseau followed a similar trajectory.)Later, at Columbias School of the Arts, where she earned an MFA in playwriting and amassed a small mountain of student debt, she found herself encouraged to write anguished kitchen-sink dramas.They werent a success.Her thesis play: Salt on a Slug.Photo I thought I was being so deep and it was so stupid, she said.Taking a break from playwriting, she knocked on doors and sent rsums and showed up for local casting calls until in 2010 she snagged a part in Mr. Jacobs-Jenkinss Neighbors, playing a character named Topsy, derived from the African-American minstrel tradition.The plays director, Niegel Smith, watched her work with the sound designer to encapsulate 450 years of black female representation in one dance.Jocelyn is go for broke, no stone unturned, Mr. Smith wrote in an email.Shes not an artist to be messed with.Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins went on to write the part of the slave Minnie in An Octoroon specifically for her.Ms. Biohs clever, jaunty performance landed every provocative line.(I know we slaves and evurthang, but you are not your job, Minnie says as she sweeps.)So much of comedy is based on patter, on breath, on lifting the joke out of the text, Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins said in a recent phone interview.Shes just a heat-seeking missile in that way.I dont ever want to let her go.In 2014, Ms. Bioh appeared on Broadway in the ensemble of Curious Incident, playing a punk girl and an unhelpful transit employee.It was the first time in her life shed made a decent salary.But she missed playwriting.So she left the show after a year to concentrate on her scripts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By then Ms. Bioh had realized that her voice was a comic one.Ive always moved through the world comedically, she said.I dont know if Id say Im happy, you know, Disney Channel kind of happy, every time.But I always find humor in everything.This emphasis on comedy set her apart from her peers, but it didnt always sit well with producers.Ms. Bioh recalls a conversation around her play Nollywood Dreams, about a woman cheerfully seduced by Nigerias burgeoning film industry.A literary manager liked the play, Ms. Bioh said, but couldnt understand why all the characters were so happy.Hadnt she read about Boko Haram?Photo Ms. Bioh had.But those werent the stories she wanted to tell.She wanted to write about people like her Ghanaian relatives.Theyre funny and wild and silly, she said.Theyre everyday people who are just trying to pursue extraordinary lives.School Girls was inspired in part by Ms. Biohs mother, who grew up in Ghana and was, as the script notes, a (proud) mean girl when she was in boarding school.MCC, an Off Broadway theater with a penchant for vivid, emotionally resonant comedy, like Robert Askinss Hand to God and Penelope Skinners The Village Bike, learned of the play when Jessica Chase, the artistic producer, attended a reading at the New Black Fest and asked to see more of Ms. Biohs work.The theater decided to produce School Girls, Ms. Chase said, because it explored the impact that beauty standards have on young women in a way that is incredibly funny and urgent.Once MCC had signed on, Ms. Bioh spent the fall furiously rewriting the play even while appearing in In the Blood.(On her Facebook feed, there are pictures of her in costume, typing away.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Set in 1986 at a Ghanaian boarding school, School Girls centers on a group of girls hoping to represent Ghana in the Miss Universe Pageant.The play explores uncomfortable issues colorism, poverty and seethes with teenage emotionalism.But the tone is often light, as when a girl who struggles with reading boasts about having just finished her first chapter book, The Baby-Sitters Club.Really powerful stuff, she says.As Rebecca Taichman, the plays director (and a Tony Award winner earlier this year for Indecent), noted, the play smashes up this real comic point of view with profound sadness and anger.But its lifted through this comic impulse.Always.Ms. Bioh does not appear in School Girls, but even offstage, her love for her characters even the dumb ones, even the mean ones is palpable.During a recent rehearsal she suddenly made a change in the script, putting an unpopular girl on the soccer team.She seemed to think it might cheer the character up.(In Happiness and Joe, her newest play, a character is trying to keep up with the Kardashians, even in the middle of a what might be a genocide.)As a first-generation American, Ms. Bioh said that she feels an incredible responsibility in getting people to understand and empathize and sympathize with all of the characters.Will her mean-girl mother sympathize?Well, she retired to Ghana, so Ms. Bioh isnt sure shell be in town for the play.But if the play is a success, will it at least help to banish Ms. Biohs bad kid reputation?No, said Ms. Bioh.I dont think shell ever forgive me for not being a doctor.
Broadway’s Comic Chameleon Writes a Heartfelt New Tune:::::That, too, was wrong.Mr. Yazbek doesnt smoke.Photo Its a musical chameleons curse, and maybe his protection, that people dont have any idea, sonically or otherwise, who he really is.Those familiar with Mr. Yazbek as Broadways go-to songwriter for comedy film adaptations probably havent heard his solo work as frontman for a series of rock bands with names like Coke Machine, Moon Pudding, Barn and His Warmest Regards.And vice versa: Those who groove to his sulfurous, often cheerfully pessimistic albums, with songs like Monkey Baby Hanging on a Chicken Wire and Ultrasad, would probably be surprised by brassy show tunes like Here I Am and unironic ballads like Breeze Off the River.Which is why its understandable that the talk around Broadway about Mr. Yazbek and The Bands Visit, which opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 9 in a production directed by Mr. Cromer, is so wrong.This delicate, contemplative and thoroughly gorgeous musical, first seen last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not represent, as some say, Mr. Yazbeks unlikeliest disguise to date.Quite the opposite.The Bands Visit is the truest version of him Broadway has yet heard, or is ever likely to.All my life Ive written songs, right?he half-asks, half-demands, lying like an analysand on a couch in the studio he built a few yards from his house in Rockland County.Unlike most people in analysis, though, he noodles gently on a bass as he speaks.Ive made five albums that have nothing to do with musical theater, he continues.And, like most singer-songwriters, my motive for writing them was to tell people what I was thinking and feeling.That usually has to do with human connection and death, in a good way: How life is ennobled by the fact of death, and is deeper than what we run around frittering about all day.He pauses and plinks.But unlike my other shows, in which I had a real but superficial connection to the characters issues, almost every song in The Bands Visit gives me the feeling that Ive expressed something I feel deeply about.Photo Photo If thats a tall order for a musical, The Bands Visit is unusually ambitious, its many comic moments woven like countermelodies into a story of human beings crying from the heart in joy or pain, as Mr. Yazbek puts it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With a book by Itamar Moses, based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, it concerns a ragtag Egyptian police orchestra that gets stranded in the wrong Israeli town en route to a gig at an Arab cultural center.Instead of exciting Petah Tikvah, with a P, they wind up in a stultifying Negev outpost called Bet Hatkivah, with a B like in basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah, as one of Mr. Yazbeks dead-on lyrics puts it.The theme is miscommunication, including the romantic kind: the terrible gap between what we feel and what we say.In The Bands Visit, the only cure is music, and yet it isnt enough.The Egyptians and the Israelis reach out to one another on waves of melody, from ethereal Arab song to thumping klezmer.Two in particular the bands leader, Tewfiq (Tony Shalhoub), and Dina, who houses him (Katrina Lenk) nearly find a common language.But even they eventually have to acknowledge the emptiness, if perhaps a slightly less empty emptiness, that seeps back when melody passes.Video This theme and setting made The Bands Visit a natural playground for Mr. Yazbek, who grew up on Manhattans Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father and a half Jewish, half Italian mother.For a song about the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, he could call on his own memory of her voice on the radio in a cab while visiting his grandfather in Lebanon.To shape the scores swirling contours, he did not have to study Middle Eastern scales or Egyptian instrumentation; he was already handy on darbouka (a goblet-shaped drum) and oud (a short-necked lyre).He was also in a good position to translate what he calls the sound of Israeli sarcasm.But he had a surfeit of other sounds as well.Growing up surrounded by every kind of music Kiss Me, Kate and Miles Davis on the stereo, the polyrhythms of congas in Central Park he developed an early and eclectic ear.He started his first band, whose name cannot be published here, when he was 12; played gigs for a thousand students at college block parties; landed a solo recording contract at 28.Another lifetime later, at 57, though married (to Elizabeth Doberneck, a meditation teacher) and with a son, Omar, in college, Mr. Yazbek retains the slightly hassled aura of a man who has almost made peace with his work or, maybe more accurately, a man who remakes that peace every day.(He, too, meditates.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This is a vast improvement over the person who seemed to be jumping out of his skin when I first encountered him in the Full Monty era.Back then, he seemed embarrassed that, of all the roads open to him, hed found his biggest success on the one that led to Broadway, with its corny philosophies and unprovoked belting.Among the roads less taken was comedy.Directly out of Brown, he wrote for David Letterman, part of a Late Show team that won an Emmy Award in 1984.(His favorite bit was called The Most Dangerous Game, in which a pack of bloodhounds searched 30 Rock for the announcer Bill Wendell.)And his career as a solo musical artist never took off the way he had planned though that was, he says, his own fault.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I made my own bed when I decided not to tour all the time, he explains.There were guys like Ben Folds and Dave Matthews who started off at the same time, doing what I should have done: get in a van with a baby grand, go up and down the East Coast circuit and make a subsistence living while developing a fan base.But if I doomed myself by staying home, it turns out it was a great doom.Now all those guys are sick of touring and want to write musicals.Even so, for a long time the regret was easily read on his face.The man-dudes in his poker game, hoping to annoy him into making mistakes, insisted on calling him Broadways David Yazbek.That taunt would have been incomprehensible during the so-called Golden Age of musicals.Loesser, Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim, three of Mr. Yazbeks idols, could aspire to nothing higher than Broadway success though Mr. Sondheim, coming at the end of the line, eventually grew so disheartened that he threatened to give up musicals for murder mysteries or video games.Its worth noting that what toppled theater music from its position as the prime engine of popular culture was the same trend that Mr. Yazbek was hoping to ride: the rise of the rock singer-songwriter.Mr. Yazbek has played both sides of the fence, bringing to each discipline the skills and, well, the discipline of the other.Thanks to rock, he writes musical theater lyrics that arise from their stories at unexpected angles and with a looser diction than most of the classics.The rhymes in The Bands Visit are accurate enough to get laughs (awful/falafel; marrow/Pharaoh) but not obsessively mitered.Thanks to musical theater, his rock songs are tighter and better structured than almost anyones.And after decades in which critics openly prayed for a savior to resuscitate theater music with the primal energies of pop, perhaps we can now see that Mr. Yazbek has been doing it, insufficiently heralded, for years.(He received Tony Award nominations for all three of his previous Broadway scores, but has never won.)In the shadow of The Producers, The Full Monty was a marginal hit; Dirty Rotten Scoundrels recouped only on the road.Women on the Verge, through no fault of Mr. Yazbeks, was a major flop (though a revised version met with more success in London).Even The Bands Visit, despite its Off Broadway raves, is nobodys idea of a sure thing.Mr. Yazbek would, of course, love a hit, but his pleasure in the work itself acts as a kind of professional prophylaxis.He has nearly completed the score for a musical version of the 1982 hit film Tootsie as flat-out a musical comedy as you could imagine and is working on the lyrics to Henry Kriegers music for a show about the evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker.The luxury of writing only what he wants, while recording the occasional solo album, is enough, he says, to service my pretensions.Servicing his spiritual aspirations is a different matter.This used to require performing in public: The connection you make while sharing in the creation of music with other people in real time, he says, is the closest metaphor for the actual connection that every sentient being has, way beneath the surface, at the root of truth.Photo Now, he says, he can achieve that connection without so much performing.Still, after certain performances, when company members gather outside the Barrymore or beneath its stage for a jam session of Arabic music, Mr. Yazbek sometimes joins in.On a recent evening, after a two-show day, he grabbed a spare drum from the darbouka player Ossama Farouk, while George Abud, who plays Camal in the musical, improvised on his oud, with Ms. Lenk on violin.They fed one another melodies like canaps.A few rugs and lanterns could not disguise the grimness of what was actually the musicians locker room, with costume racks pressing in.But as the four worked through El Hayah Helwa (Life Is Beautiful) by Farid al-Atrash, and an Umm Kulthum song called Awedt Ainy, which Mr. Abud translated as Im Addicted to You, all the discomforts disappeared.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And so, after a while, with a huge smile, did Mr. Yazbek.He got what he wanted, and was gone.
5 Shows to See if You’re in New York in November:::::Photo New Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be.This citys theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places.Consider some of the new productions opening this month.Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America.And, oh yes, space as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.The Bands Visit Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel.But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies.A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.Tickets: thebandsvisitmusical.com Brigadoon Photo Perhaps the ultimate escape from New York fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress.City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location.Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of An American in Paris, and the cast includes Kelli OHara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too).Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of Brigadoon will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tickets: nycitycenter.org The Wolves Photo First seen in a Playwrights Realm production last year, Sarah DeLappes high-voltage drama of young women coming of age on AstroTurf is being remounted at the Mitzi E.

ACLU responds to Taylor Swift's lawyer regarding negative article:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- The American Civil Liberties Union has commented on the demands of Taylor Swift's lawyer who wants a negative article about the singer taken down.The article titled "Swiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation," was posted onto blog PopFront and discusses the appropriation of Swift by white nationalists and how the pop star's silence regarding politics "could be construed as her lending support to the voices rising against embracing diversity and inclusion emblematic of Trump supporters."Attorney William J. Briggs II, who said he represents Swift, sent a letter in October to PopFront executive editor Meghan Herning asking for the piece to be retracted under the threat of a lawsuit."The story is replete with demonstrable and offensive falsehoods which bear no relation to reality or the truth about Ms.Swift.It appears to be a malicious attack against Ms.Swift that goes to great lengths to portray Ms.Swift as some sort of white supremacist figurehead, which is a baseless fiction masquerading as fact and completely misrepresents Ms.Swift.As further shown below, PopFront is substantially liable to Ms.Swift for defamation," Briggs writes in the letter shared by the ACLU.Briggs and a representative of Swift's did not respond to requests from NPR to confirm the letter and Briggs' authenticity.The ACLU of Northern California in response noted that PopFront will not adhere to the letter's demands and that the blog has protections against a defamation lawsuit due to Swift being a public figure."Criticism is never pleasant, but a celebrity has to shake it off, even if the critique may damage her reputation," the ACLU wrote in response while referencing Swift's 2014 single "Shake It Off" and her upcoming sixth studio album Reputation.Reputation will be released on Nov. 10 and will include the songs "Look What You Made Me Do," "...Ready For It?""Gorgeous" and "Call It What You Want."

Nazi art trove goes on display at Swiss museum, heir to Gurlitt collection:::::BERN (Reuters) - Some 150 art works from a massive trove amassed by a German collector during the Nazi era went on public display for the first time on Wednesday in the Swiss capital, amid lingering questions about the origins of the collection.German art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt built up the collection after being enlisted by the Nazis to sell so-called degenerate modern art they had seized from German museums.His son Cornelius Gurlitt inherited the art and then kept it stored in his Munich apartment for decades.The Kunst Museum Bern was stunned to learn in May 2014, the day after Gurlitts death, that it had been named as the sole heir to 1,500 works, including paintings by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.Its exhibition Degenerate Art - Confiscated and Sold is composed mainly of drawings, lithographs and paintings confiscated by the Nazis from museums and acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt.For the most part we know exactly when the works were confiscated, from which German museum, Nina Zimmer, director of the Bern Art Museum, told Reuters Television.We only have taken works where we are 100 percent sure they were not looted (from private owners), she said, adding that a further 300 degenerate works were awaiting clarification of their ownership as intensive research continued.Art, after 70 years, needs to see the light of day and the public needs to reconnect with the art works, Zimmer said.A separate exhibition of works from the Gurlitt collection will open in the German city of Bonn on Friday with the title Nazi Art Theft and Its Consequences.A man takes a picture of the lithograph "Fischerkinder" from 1926 by late German artist Emil Nolde during a media preview of the exhibition "Dossier Gurlitt: Degenerated Art confiscated and sold" at the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland November 1, 2017.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann EXEMPLARY WORKS At a news conference to mark the opening of the Bern exhibition on Wednesday, Zimmer said the gouaches and works on paper - by leading avant garde German artists of the 1920s and 30s banned by Adolf Hitler - represented exemplary works of symbolism, constructivism and objectivism.Slideshow (10 Images) They include 20 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, such as Liebesszene (Love Scene), a 1908 color lithograph depicting two nude women embracing.Woodcut prints by Emil Nolde, horses painted by Franz Marc and colorful female portraits by Otto Dix are other stand-outs.German tax inspectors discovered Cornelius Gurlitts art collection during a raid on his Munich home in 2012, after a customs inspection on a train from Zurich triggered a tax evasion probe.A task force set up by the German government to determine the ownership history of the works said in Jan. 2016 that only five had been wrongfully taken from Jews, drawing criticism from Jewish groups.Paintings by Matisse, Max Liebermann and Camille Pissarro have been restored to the rightful heirs.Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, told the German daily Die Zeit on Wednesday: There are still museums and collections that do not do provenance research.And unfortunately the archives are still not as accessible as they should be.Some institutions prefer to hide behind data protection regulations.A Paul Cezanne painting, whose exact provenance is being determined amid discussions with the French artists descendants, is expected to go on display in Bern before the current exhibition ends in March, Zimmer said.We do hope for feedback, perhaps a person will remember seeing a painting, or someone remembers a letter about a work.So it is highly justified to show these works of art, she said.
Albanians view antique communist-era spyware in 'House of Leaves':::::TIRANA (Reuters) - In the days of communist Albanias near-total isolation, Saimir Maloku used his technical knowhow to gain illicit glimpses of the outside world.Unluckily for him, as he and his father watched forbidden Italian television, the regime was watching him.Tourists visit "House of Leaves", the museum of secret surveillance in Tirana, Albania, November 2, 2017.Picture taken November 2, 2017.REUTERS/Florion Goga Maloku was jailed for nine years in 1976 after the secret police bugged his home.Four decades on, he can visit a unique Tirana museum and see for himself the kind of listening devices that betrayed him.At the Museum of Surveillance, created in the former headquarters of the feared Sigurimi security service, Albanians can now inspect some of the spying paraphernalia used by dictator Enver Hoxhas totalitarian state as well as the files kept on many of them.Until now nothing had been done to show how Albanians were spied upon and kept in check, so this is a good step to illustrate the history of spying we were the victims of, Maloku, now 71, told Reuters.Visiting the museum, Maloku told the story of how he had wanted to help his paralyzed father by broadening his television viewing beyond the drab daily four hours of Albanian state broadcasts.Tourists visit "House of Leaves", the museum of secret surveillance in Tirana, Albania, November 2, 2017.Picture taken November 2, 2017.REUTERS/Florion Goga An electronic engineer, he built a device he called the can to convert UHF signals from Italys RAI television so they could be viewed on an Albanian set.The can opened a window into the West for the Albanians.I made them free of charge for my friends, but later learned some of them had denounced me, Maloku said.Slideshow (7 Images) The Sigurimi planted a listening device in a wall to gather evidence against him.The same model of device - once attached to a broomstick to spy on the Italian embassy in Tirana - is on display in another museum depicting the work of the communist-era interior ministry.In the age of the smartphone, both Malokus and the Sigurimis electronic gizmos now look quaintly crude - but they did their jobs, and Maloku went to prison convicted of hostile agitation and propaganda.He remembers singing Rolling Stones and Beatles songs in his underground cell to preserve his sanity.Before the collapse of Albanian communism in 1990, the building that now houses the Museum of Surveillance was known as the House of Leaves - a pun referring to both its ivy-clad walls and the leaves of secret police files kept on citizens.During World War Two it was used by the Gestapo of the occupying Nazi forces.

Rare, hidden portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots revealed:::::EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A rare, unfinished portrait believed to be of Mary, Queen of Scots has been found underneath another 16th-century painting after an X-ray revealed a ghostly likeness of the executed queen.An unfinished portrait of a woman, thought to be Mary Queen of Scots, and a portrait of John Maitland, are displayed at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery during a media view, in Edinburgh, Scotland October 27, 2017.Conservator Caroline Rae discovered the unfinished portrait hidden beneath the painting of Maitland, using X-rays during a research project conducted at the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) and the Courtauld Institute of Art.REUTERS/Russell Cheyne A woman with distinct similarities to near-contemporary depictions of Mary was revealed during an examination of a portrait of Sir John Maitland, attributed to Adrian Vanson, a Dutchman who was court painter to Marys son King James VI of Scotland (James I of England).The X-ray showed the shape of a womans face and the outline of her dress and hat beneath the upper layers of paint in a pose and a likeness similar to those of the queen at the time.Mary was forced to abdicate in 1567 after she was implicated in her husbands murder and was then imprisoned in England by her cousin Elizabeth I from 1568 and executed in 1587.The painting usually hangs in the National Trusts Ham House southwest of London.Vansons portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it, said David Taylor, Curator of Pictures and Sculpture at the National Trust.It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing, he added.The portrait and X-ray images will be on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery from Saturday.

'Justice League' must battle film critics as well as villains:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Saving Metropolis and Gotham City from the clutches of super-villains might be enough pressure for the average caped crusader but the cast of the forthcoming Justice League film also face another equally-terrifying foe: film critics.The film is the latest installment from the DC comics stable of super-heroes - a series which, with the notable exception of this summers Wonder Woman, has met with a less than positive critical response and has failed to match the box office of rival Marvels biggest super-hero offerings.The film features a host of major DC characters and box office stars including Ben Affleck as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Ezra Miller as the Flash.Gadot won both critical plaudits and box office success for Wonder Woman, which was directed by Patty Jenkins, and she is confident that the experience from that film helped her reprise the character in Justice League.I had almost no transition from Wonder Woman because I finished Wonder Woman and the next day I went to set to start working on Justice League, she told Reuters.The cast poses for photographers at the Justice League photocall, at The College, in London, Britain November 4, 2017.REUTERS/ Peter Nicholls I was already in the character and I only had to serve the story and the context of every scene and just you know be there and serve the directors vision.Momoa was hopeful for the films prospects, telling Reuters I really hope that the fans enjoy what Zack (Snyder, the director) and I have done with Aquaman.Slideshow (3 Images) The films predecessor, 2016s Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, grossed just over $870 million at the global box office according to film revenue website Box Office Mojo, but received a 27 percent rating on film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.Another recent entry in the DC franchise, 2016s Suicide Squad, opened to an equally poor critical reception, and took around $745 million at the global box office.While both totals are not insubstantial, they are dwarfed by Marvels big hits - 2012S The Avengers and 2015s Avengers: Age of Ultron, which took $1.5 billion and $1.4 billon respectively.Audiences in 2017, however warmed to Wonder Woman, which grossed over $80 million more at the U.S. box office than Dawn of Justice, as well at proving a hit with critics, garnering a 92 percent Rotten Tomatoes score.

Fox held talks to sell most of company to Disney: CNBC:::::(Reuters) - Rupert Murdochs Twenty-First Century Fox has held talks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co, which would gain new programming and expand its international reach, CNBC reported on Monday.The Twenty-First Century Fox Studios building is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Foxs shares jumped 9.9 percent to close at $27.45 on Nasdaq, and Disney shares climbed 2.0 percent to $100.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.The two sides are not currently talking, but had held talks in the last few weeks, CNBC reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.The discussions reflect a view among Fox executives that the media company could not reach the size needed to compete with Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and other major media players, according to CNBC.cnb.cx/2hgHcPA Representatives of Disney and Fox had no comment.For Disney, a deal could bring additional programming it could use to lure audiences as the company tries to navigate consumers rapid migration to digital viewing and compete with heavy spending by technology companies pushing further into Hollywood.It also could extend Disneys reach into international markets.Disney, which under U.S. rules could not own two broadcast networks, would not purchase all of Fox, CNBC reported.It would not seek to buy Foxs sports programming assets for fear of running foul of antitrust laws with its own ESPN network, and also would not buy Fox News or Foxs broadcast network or local broadcasting affiliates, the report said.It did discuss buying Foxs movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and European pay TV provider Sky Plc, CNBC said.The Twenty-First Century Fox Studios building is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Fox has bid $14.5 billion to acquire the remaining 61 percent of Sky it does not own, but the acquisition has been delayed by British regulators.I see lots of synergies for Disney.Its a no-brainer, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said.The confusion is what it means for Fox.Traditional media giants are scrambling to increase their scale and add new businesses, particularly after AT&Ts bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner Inc, which is awaiting regulatory approval.Other media companies also could be interested in Foxs assets, Wieser said.Slideshow (2 Images) Credit Suisse analysts said the talks increase uncertainty around the Sky transaction.Disney may want Sky as part of an international streaming strategy, but a deal also would deepen its exposure to traditional businesses that have been under pressure.It is not clear whether the main Disney shareholders will agree and give their support to management on this point, the analysts said in a research note.Disney has been struggling with subscriber declines at ESPN, its biggest network, and is planning to launch direct-to-consumer video streaming services to reach younger audiences that have shunned traditional cable and satellite offerings.Chief Executive Bob Iger has said he plans to retire from Disney in July 2019, and the company is searching for a successor.Much of Foxs revenue has come from its cable division, which houses Fox News, FX and other channels.Fox said in August that it expects to see high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth every quarter in fiscal 2018.Fox and Disney are co-owners of Hulu, a streaming service that offers on-demand and live TV packages.Hulu also is partially owned by Comcast Corp and Time Warner Inc.

Netflix cuts ties with Kevin Spacey after sexual misconduct allegations:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc severed ties on Friday with Kevin Spacey, one of its biggest stars and the lead in its popular drama House of Cards, after a number of allegations of sexual misconduct against the Oscar-winning actor.FILE PHOTO: Cast member Kevin Spacey poses at the premiere for the second season of the television series "House of Cards" at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles, California February 13, 2014. .REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.Netflix will not be involved with any further production of House of Cards that includes Kevin Spacey, the company said in a statement late on Friday.Spaceys publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spaceys behavior on the set of House of Cards, he has been suspended, effective immediately, Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus, it said.The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the shows future.Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14.CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of House of Cards, who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.It said Spacey had willingly participated in a training process and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.Netflixs move to cut ties with Spacey went beyond House of Cards.The company will not release the film Gore, which was in post-production and was produced by Spacey, its statement said.Spacey plays the late writer Gore Vidal.
New York City police say gathering evidence for possible Weinstein arrest warrant:::::(Reuters) - The New York City Police Department said on Friday that it had a credible narrative from an unidentified woman who has made a rape allegation against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and was gathering evidence for a possible arrest warrant.FILE PHOTO: Harvey Weinstein kicks off the Film Finance Circle conference with an informal discussion at the inaugural Middle East International Film Festival in Abu Dhabi, UAE on October 15, 2007.REUTERS/Steve Crisp/File Photo Reuters requests for comment from Weinsteins representative and his lawyer were not immediately answered.New York City Police Department Deputy Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told a news conference that the alleged victim put forth a credible and detailed narrative.We have an actual case here, Boyce said.He said the police department became aware of the accusation on October 25.Boyce said it was a seven-year-old case and we have to move forward gathering evidence.Boyce said that because Weinstein was out of state the police department would need a court-ordered warrant for any arrest.More than 50 women have claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades.Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.Boyce said police had spoken to the woman and we found corroboration along the way.He said the NYPD was working on the case with the Manhattan district attorneys office.Right now he (Weinstein) poses no threat to anybody in New York City.Hes out of state.So its a continuing investigation, Boyce told the news conference.Earlier on Friday, in response to media reports, Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., told Reuters, A senior sex crimes prosecutor is assigned to this investigation, and the Office has been working with our partners in the NYPD since the new allegations came to light.Police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and London have also said they are investigating sexual assault allegations against Weinstein but no charges have been brought against him.
The end of 'House of Cards' would hammer Baltimore and wipe out 2,000 jobs:::::A couple thousand people in Maryland have a lot riding on "House of Cards."Michael Piekutowski, who has worked as an electrician on the series since Season 4, waits to see whether the hit Netflix drama will survive star Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct scandal."House of Cards," which for five seasons has been filmed in and around Baltimore, is one of the state's biggest productions.Piekutowski told CNN the show helps the city's economy, not just those who work on set."There are local businesses that are benefiting from a major studio production, like caterers, dry cleaners, transportation companies," he said.Last week, Netflix cut ties with Spacey, who was also an executive producer for the series, a day after CNN published new allegations of sexual harassment from several current and former members of the "House of Cards" production staff.One member of the production staff also accused Spacey of sexual assault.Spacey's representatives did not reply to a request for comment on the new allegations in CNN's report.They also did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story."Netflix will not be involved with any further production of 'House of Cards' that includes Kevin Spacey," a spokesperson for the network said."We will continue to work with [Media Rights Capital] during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show."Media Rights Capital is the production company behind "House of Cards."Actor Anthony Rapp first made allegations against Spacey in a story published by BuzzFeed last week in which he said Spacey made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986 when Rapp was 14 year old.Spacey issued a statement apologizing to Rapp, who appears on CBS's "Star Trek: Discovery."Spacey claimed he did not recall the incident, but offered "the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior."Netflix suspended production on Season 6 of "House of Cards" -- set to be the show's last -- as a result.Sources told CNN that the decision, while made public after the first accusation against Spacey, had been known by the production team for months.The Emmy-winning series has proved a boon to the state of Maryland, where recognizable landmarks have made their way into "House of Cards" episodes.Fans will recognize Patterson Park in Southeast Baltimore as the place where Spacey's character, Frank Underwood, likes to ride his bike.The Baltimore County Historic Courthouse in Towson has subbed for the halls of Congress and viewers can venture to the nearby caf, Cunningham's, to see the site where the character Seth Grayson takes a meeting in Season 5.For Season 4 alone, almost 2,700 cast, crew and extras were hired from Maryland, and the production bought or rented goods or services from almost 2,000 Maryland vendors, according to the Maryland Film Office.A final audit by the state found that Season 5 of "House of Cards" contributed $129 million to Maryland's economy in the form of purchased goods and services from more than 1,750 Maryland businesses and the hiring of more than 1,800 local actors, crew and extras.The state has awarded almost $60 million in tax credits to "House of Cards" over the years (which included a $7.5 million grant in Season 3).Making Hollywood magic is sometimes seasonal work, Piekutowski said, and some people depend on "House of Cards" to make it through."One of the nice things about 'House of Cards' is it shoots from fall till spring and fills in the gap for people through the winter," Piekutowski said."We are all like squirrels, in a way, throughout the year and try to get as much money in the spring and summer and live off that in the winter."Jena Richardson, a 28-year-old day player -- a backup crew member on heavy production days -- has worked on the show since Season 2.She says she will have to leave Maryland if "House of Cards" work runs dry because "people in the film industry go where the work is."Richardson considers Baltimore home and says it's where she wants to start a family."If the show leaves, that means that a lot of my friends who have become my set family will have to leave to find work as well," she said."So if we can keep the work here, then everybody can stay here and provide for themselves and their families throughout the holidays."Roger Voter says the loss of "House of Cards" would be a "huge detriment."The show provided staffers with opportunities to learn skills commonly found in jobs in Los Angeles."It's the most detailed TV show, more than what we have usually in the local Baltimore area, like unique small jobs like camera operators, operating booms, prop jobs," said the 27-year-old technology assistant, who worked on Season 5."Having Baltimore locals being trained in these jobs under the masters of LA is great for their careers."Legendary casting agent Pat Moran knows all about the importance of having and retaining such series in her hometown of Baltimore.Moran, who has three Emmys, including one for her work on HBO's hit comedy "Veep," told CNN that TV and film production has dropped off considerably from the days when she was casting for such series as HBO's "The Wire" and NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street.""We at one time were in the top five [production locations] in the country," Moran said."It seems that a lot of stuff that was shot here gained national recognition with big directors, big studios, big shows.That's nonexistent now because the industry is pretty much gone."Moran said her own son had to relocate from Baltimore to New Orleans to get work and a former assistant is thriving in the New Orleans and Atlanta markets.Moran's son is a prop master on "NCIS: New Orleans," she said.In 2015, "Veep" moved its production to Los Angeles after four years in Maryland."Maryland has been home to many vital HBO projects, from 'The Corner' to 'The Wire' to 'Game Change,' and the support has always been extraordinary," HBO said in a statement at the time."The producers and HBO would like to thank Maryland for making the last four seasons of 'Veep' such a success.We look forward to returning with another production in the future."Debbie Dorsey, director of the Baltimore Film Office, told the Baltimore Sun after the announcement that "Veep" leaving "hurts not only Baltimore's creative culture, but it hurts our economy as well."She said the show hired about 1,000 locals each season and created an economic windfall of $114 million over three seasons."Veep" also worked with 1,000 businesses each season, 400 of which were small businesses in Baltimore City, Dorsey said.Moran said her show simply received a better deal for tax incentives from California and opted to go."It's show business and it's all about the bottom line," she said."[Film and TV production] is basically nonexistent now [in Maryland], which I'm still scratching my head about because it is an industry and all states are looking for new industries, right?"
Spacey film pulled from festival lineup after actor faces allegations:::::(CNN) Plans for Ridley Scott's "All the Money in the World" to screen as part of AFI Fest have been scrapped as actor Kevin Spacey, who co-stars in the film, faces mounting allegations of sexual harassment and assault.The film was supposed to screen on the closing night of AFI Fest, which is taking place in Los Angeles from November 9-16."'All the Money in the World' is a superb film and more than worthy of its place of honor in the AFI Fest.But given the current allegations surrounding one of its actors and out of respect for those impacted, it would be inappropriate to celebrate at a gala at this difficult time.Accordingly, the film will be withdrawn," TriStar Pictures, a division of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, told CNN in a statement.The film is based on the 1973 abduction of John Paul Getty III.Spacey plays Getty's billionaire grandfather.Charlie Plummer, Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg also star.Read More

Diddy is not really changing his name:::::Story highlights Diddy said on his birthday he was changing his name to "Brother Love" He now says he was just kidding (CNN) Everyone can relax.Diddy is still Diddy.The mogul born Sean Combs set the internet a-Twitter over the weekend when he announced on his birthday he was changing his name to "Brother Love."I decided to change my name again!My new name is LOVE aka Brother Love.#TakeDat pic.twitter.com/gArAXusygG Sean Diddy Combs (@diddy) November 4, 2017 "I'm just not who I am before, I'm something different," he said."So my new name is 'Love,' a.k.a.'Brother Love.'"Given that Combs has at various points in his rap/fashion/entrepreneurial career gone by Puffy, Puff Daddy, Puff, etc.it seemed entirely feasible.But Diddy posted a video Monday on his official Instagram account saying he was just kidding and remarking, "Well, ladies and gentlemen, today I've come to the conclusion that you cannot play around with the internet."Read More
Swap Kevin James for Kevin Spacey?:::::There is an online petition suggesting just that -- believe it or not -- and as of Tuesday, nearly 30,000 people have signed on to endorse the idea."Losing a great show is hard, no matter the circumstances," the petition reads."However with hardship comes the opportunity for a great show to become one of the greatest television shows of all time.I think Kevin James can elevate 'House of Cards' to a globally adored franchise like 'Game of Thrones' and make the entire world focus on one of the most important Netflix original series there is."It's doubtful one Kevin will replace the other, but let's not pretend that television hasn't pulled big swaps before.Here are a few examples: Donna's death on "Kevin Can Wait" James is currently starring in the CBS sitcom "Kevin Can Wait," which recently killed off his character's wife, played by Erinn Hayes.Now, killing off a character is not out of the ordinary, but the show managed to make this particular plot twist especially awkward.Some "Kevin Can Wait" viewers complained that series treated the character's death too lightly, making a joke about her gym sending a postcard saying she was missed.James's character tells his daughter not to toss the card because "on the bottom, there's a coupon for a Kung-Fu lesson.I want to go there."So they killed the wife/mom on #KevinCanWait ???Wow!And they addressed @hayeslady departure in 2 lines.So disrespectful and savage af.pic.twitter.com/by0e9ojyLF Kelena Sothersby (@Tua_motu) September 26, 2017 James's former "King of Queens" costar, Leah Remini, was added to the cast, effectively making the show feel like "King of Queens 2.0."Original vs. new Becky on "Roseanne" Fans still like to argue over who was the better Becky on the hit 1990s sitcom "Roseanne."Actress Lecy Goranson played the eldest Conner child for the first five seasons, before leaving to go to college.Sarah Chalke was then recast in the role for Season 6, which some viewers didn't love.Goranson tried to work with the show -- reprising her role in Season 8 -- but ultimately Chalke became Becky full time.The whole thing turned into a running gag on "Rosanne," which would sometimes include jokes about the missing Goranson.The forthcoming "Roseanne" revival is set to have Goranson back as Becky and Chalke in another role.What happened to Judy on "Family Matters?"Judy Winslow went upstairs to her room one day and was never seen or heard from again.At least that's how fans of ABC's "Family Matters" felt like it all went down.The sitcom, which ran from 1989 to 1997, made the character Steve Urkle famous.But it was the disappearance of young Judy after four seasons that many viewers still talk about.Jaimee Foxworth, the actress who portrayed Judy, is now 37."The producers felt that they could do it [disappear her character] and no one would notice," Foxworth recently told The Root "They'd done it with previous shows they had," she said."They figured no one would really care.My fans took notice of it."A tale of two Morgan Matthews on "Boy Meets World" "Boy Meets World" thought they could pull one over on us when they swapped out actress Lily Nicksay, who played the scene-stealing sister Morgan, for actress Lindsay Ridgeway.Well, the second Morgan became forever known as "the other Morgan."Disney gave the 1990s show a bit of a reboot in 2014 with "Girl Meets World," which at the end of Season 3 brought both actresses back for the finale.Feeny.Turner.Shawn.Eric.Alan.Amy.Minkus.Harley.Both Morgans.All stop by and help us make a decision.Girl Meets Writers (@GMWWriters) July 27, 2016 It got ugly with Aunt Viv on "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" The original Aunt Viv, Janet Hubert, was beloved by fans for the first three seasons of the series which debuted in 1990.But the actress departed the NBC sitcom in 1993, and cast Daphne Maxwell Reid to play rapper Will Smith's aunt."He said 'We're just going to replace her and act like nothing happened," Hubert said at the time."Well, honey, that is not what happened is it?""I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be 'The Aunt Viv of Bel Air Show,' because I know she is going to dog me in the press," he said."She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to nothing.She's mad now, but she's been mad all along."
Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' canceled this week after his mother's death:::::New episodes of "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon" will not air this week after Fallon's mother, Gloria, passed away Saturday."On behalf of everyone at NBC, we extend our deepest condolences to Jimmy and all his family at this time of enormous loss," NBC said in a statement."Our hearts go out to Jimmy and everyone else whose lives were so touched by Gloria Fallon's love, kindness and support."The network said reruns will air this week in place of new episodes.A taping of Fallon's show had already been canceled last Friday so the host could be by his mother's side in the hospital.She died the next day at the age of 68."Our prayers go out to Jimmy and his family as they go through this tough time," a Fallon spokesperson told CNN.The person did not disclose the nature of her illness.Fallon said in a statement that he lost his "biggest fan."Love and support for the host poured in from fans and colleagues on social media.Mom is the first audience and the best.Remembering Jimmy Fallon and his family in our prayers today.Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) November 5, 2017 "Mom is the first audience and the best," tweeted Stephen Colbert on Sunday.The CBS "Late Show" host lost his own mother in 2013."Remembering Jimmy Fallon and his family in our prayers today."Miley Cyrus, who performed each night on the "The Tonight Show" for a week last month, also offered her condolences.I'm sad to say my friend Jimmy's mother has passed away... sending him all the love in my heart ...

Harvey Weinstein banned for life from TV Academy:::::Harvey Weinstein has been banned for life from yet another Hollywood organization.The board for the Television Academy -- an organization with more than 22,000 voting members from across the TV industry and helps award the Emmys -- on Monday voted to permanently expel the movie and TV mogul from the organization, following a string of sexual harassment and assault allegations that have come to light in the last month after explosive stories in the New York Times and the New Yorker."After a hearing today, the Television Academy's governance has voted to expel Harvey Weinstein from the Academy for life," the organization said in a statement."The Academy supports those speaking out against harassment in all forms and stands behind those who have been affected by this issue."To date, more than 60 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment.A spokeswoman for Weinstein has repeatedly denied allegations "of non-consensual sex."Weinstein has also apologized for "the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past."Weinstein-produced television shows, like "Project Runway" and "Project Greenlight," have earned 17 Emmy nominations.Just last week, the Producers Guild of America voted in favor of banning Weinstein for life.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and its British academy counterpart, BAFTA, have also distanced themselves from Weinstein.Related: A month after accusations surfaced, the 'Weinstein effect' ripples around the world The Television Academy began what it called "disciplinary proceedings" against Weinstein late last month.Since the allegations against Weinstein first surfaced, the entertainment industry has been rocked by a string of similar accusations brought against other prominent figures in Hollywood."The unfolding and widespread examples of this horrific behavior are deeply disturbing to the Academy's leadership," the Television Academy added in its statement."We are determined to play a role in protecting all television professionals from predatory harassment, ensuring they are able to practice their craft in a safe environment."
'Damnation' mines bleak Depression-era class warfare:::::(CNN) Bleak and nasty, "Damnation" brings a "Mr.Robot" vibe to the Depression era, wrapping class warfare and hostility toward wanton capitalism in a drab, dusty package.The result is a bracing look backward informed by present-day parallels, in another show that feels like an outlier for USA -- one that should have critical admirers but might struggle to satisfy TV's capitalist demands.HBO's "Carnivale" is among the dramas that have taken a stab at this period, and that was filtered through a supernatural prism.By contrast, "Damnation" is mired in realism, even if the motives and backgrounds of its characters remain purposefully opaque in the early going.Set in Iowa in 1931, the story centers on Seth Davenport (Killian Scott), who is masquerading as a rabble-rousing preacher.His real objective, however, is to rally workers against the moneyed status quo, leading a farmers' strike.Those plans, however, are dealt a setback with the arrival of a paid strikebreaker, Creeley Turner (Logan Marshall-Green), hired by a wealthy industrialist to quell the dissent.The increasingly bloody jockeying also involves the local sheriff (Christopher Heyerdahl), whose true motives, like almost everyone else here, are suspect.The '30s provide a jarring backdrop to all of this discontent, a time when making reference to a "Bolshevik uprising" actually wasn't all that long ago, and the action unfolds with a western vibe, where people are as apt to get around on horses as in cars.Read More

Netflix cuts ties with Kevin Spacey:::::Netflix is cutting ties with "House of Cards" star Kevin Spacey as the actor faces a growing number of allegations of sexual harassment and assault.The actor has also been suspended from the show.In a carefully worded statement, the streaming network made clear that it would not continue to be involved with the show if Spacey has any part in the drama's future."Netflix will not be involved with any further production of 'House of Cards' that includes Kevin Spacey," a spokesperson for the network said."We will continue to work with [Media Rights Capital] during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the show."MRC, which produces "House of Cards," followed up with its own statement, announcing the actor's suspension from the series."While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey's behavior on the set of 'House of Cards,' he has been suspended, effective immediately," MRC said.Netflix has also decided not to proceed with the release of the film "Gore," which stars and is produced by Spacey, the statement said.The film had been in post-production.The decision comes one day after several current and former members of the "House of Cards" production staff came forward with allegations of sexual harassment in a CNN report.One also accused Spacey of sexual assault.Actor Anthony Rapp first made allegations against Spacey in a story published by Buzzfeed this week.Rapp, who appears on CBS's "Star Trek: Discovery," alleges Spacey made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986.Rapp was 14 years old at the time.Spacey issued a statement claiming he did not recall the incident, but he apologized for what he said would have been "deeply inappropriate drunken behavior."Production on "House of Cards" was halted on Tuesday, a little more than two weeks after filming for Season 6 began in the Baltimore area.News that the show would be ending after Season 6 was made public in the days following the first Spacey allegation, but sources told CNN the decision had been known by the production team for months prior.Spacey is currently seeking unspecified treatment, according to a statement from his representative released on Wednesday.His publicist and talent agency, CAA, have since cut ties with him."House of Cards" is a five-time Emmy nominee for outstanding drama.Spacey has also earned five Emmy nominations in the outstanding actor in a drama category.On the series, Spacey played a morally bankrupt politician who climbs the D.C. power ladder.In the final episode of Season 5, Spacey's Frank Underwood resigns from office and his vice president and wife Claire Underwood assumes office.The finale set the stage for a power struggle between the couple.CNN's Chloe Melas contributed to this report.

'House of Cards' employees allege sexual harassment, assault by Kevin Spacey:::::Kevin Spacey made the set of Netflix's "House of Cards" into a "toxic" work environment through a pattern of sexual harassment, eight people who currently work on the show or worked on it in the past tell CNN.One former employee told CNN that Spacey sexually assaulted him.The former production assistant, whose account has never previously been disclosed, told CNN that Spacey sexually assaulted him during one of the show's early seasons.All eight people, each of whom spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional repercussions for speaking out, described Spacey's behavior as "predatory," saying it included nonconsensual touching and crude comments and targeted production staffers who were typically young and male.The new accusations follow an explosive article published less than a week ago by BuzzFeed News, in which actor Anthony Rapp said Spacey made sexual advances toward him in 1985, when Rapp was 14 years old.On Monday, Spacey released an apology in response to Rapp's account."I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago," Spacey said."But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."Related: Kevin Spacey seeking treatment after sexual assault allegations Spacey's publicist said in a statement on Wednesday that the actor is seeking unspecified treatment following Rapp's allegations.On Thursday, that publicist -- Staci Wolf -- said she and Creative Artists Agency were parting ways with the actor.Production of Season 6 of the series was shut down this week.Netflix and the production company Media Rights Capital issued a joint statement Tuesday to say that they are reviewing the "situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew."Spacey is also one of the show's executive producers.The former production assistant who spoke with CNN said Spacey sexually assaulted him one afternoon when the assistant was assigned to drive to an offsite location to pick up Spacey and bring him to the "House of Cards" set, which is located about 30 miles outside of Baltimore.Related: House of Cards' production halted The production assistant says that when he and Spacey were just minutes away from the set and while the car was moving, Spacey, who was driving, put his hands down the production assistant's pants.The production assistant told CNN that the touching was nonconsensual."I was in a state of shock," he said."He was a man in a very powerful position on the show and I was someone very low on the totem pole and on the food chain there."The production assistant asked that what happened next in the car not be described, for fear that it would identify him.Once they had arrived on set, the production assistant says he helped the actor take his belongings from the car to Spacey's trailer on set.While the two men were in the trailer, the production assistant says, Spacey cornered him, blocked his exit and made inappropriate contact with him."I told him, 'I don't think I'm ok with this, I don't think I'm comfortable with this,'" the production assistant said.That's when the actor became "visibly flustered," fled the trailer, got in his car and left for the remainder of the day, according to the production assistant.The production assistant did not report the incident to any managers of the series or the police, but he did tell a coworker at the time.CNN has spoken to the coworker to corroborate the production assistant's story.Related: London theater calls for information after Kevin Spacey allegations The alleged sexual assault came months after the production assistant had, he told CNN, complained to a supervisor that Spacey was sexually harassing him.The supervisor's solution was to never let the production assistant be alone with Spacey while they were on set, the production assistant says.The assistant said the harassment then stopped for long enough for him to feel comfortable driving with Spacey to the set."I have no doubt that this type of predatory behavior was routine for him and that my experience was one of many and that Kevin had few if any qualms about exploiting his status and position," he said."It was a toxic environment for young men who had to interact with him at all in the crew, cast, background actors."The other people who worked on "House of Cards" with whom CNN spoke all supported the idea that the set could be toxic for young men because of Spacey.A crew member who worked on the show for all six seasons said that Spacey routinely harassed and touched him."He would put his hands on me in weird ways," the crew member said."He would come in and massage my shoulders from behind or put his hands around me or touch my stomach sometimes in weird ways that in normal everyday conversation would not be appropriate."This crew member said he did not "feel comfortable" telling Spacey to stop."That's the worst part about this whole thing.I would love to be able to speak out about this kind of stuff and not fear."Related: Kevin Spacey criticized for how he came out CNN spoke to a close friend of the crew member, who says that the crew member had told him about Spacey's behavior over the course of the six seasons of the show that it happened.When asked on Thursday about the new allegations, Netflix said in a statement to CNN that they sent a representative to the "House of Cards" set on Monday.Spacey did not respond to CNN's request for comment about the new allegations."Netflix was just made aware of one incident, five years ago, that we were informed was resolved swiftly," the statement said."On Tuesday, in collaboration with MRC, we suspended production, knowing that Kevin Spacey wasn't scheduled to work until Wednesday.Netflix is not aware of any other incidents involving Kevin Spacey on-set.We continue to collaborate with MRC and other production partners to maintain a safe and respectful working environment.We will continue to work with MRC during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the production, and have nothing further to share at this time."MRC, the production company behind "House of Cards," told CNN in a separate statement on Thursday that they have implemented "an anonymous complaint hotline, crisis counselors, and sexual harassment legal advisors for the crew.""We are deeply troubled to learn about these new allegations that are being made to the press concerning Kevin Spacey's interaction with members of the crew of House of Cards," the MRC statement said."As the producer of the show, creating and maintaining a safe working environment for our cast and crew has always been our top priority.We have consistently reinforced the importance of employees reporting any incident without fear of retaliation and we have investigated and taken appropriate actions following any complaints.For example, during our first year of production in 2012, someone on the crew shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey.Immediate action was taken following our review of the situation and we are confident the issue was resolved promptly to the satisfaction of all involved.Mr. Spacey willingly participated in a training process and since that time MRC has not been made aware of any other complaints involving Mr.Spacey."MRC did not elaborate about the complaint it cited in the statement.They added that they will continue to investigate all claims brought to their attention.Other people with whom CNN spoke describe behavior similar to that recounted by the crew member.A former camera assistant, who said he witnessed Spacey's behavior but was never harassed by Spacey, said the touching largely occurred in an open space and that "everybody saw.""All the crew members commented on his behavior," the former camera assistant said."What gets me is we have to sign sexual harassment paperwork before the start of the show and apparently [Kevin Spacey] doesn't have to do anything and he gets away scott-free with this behavior."CNN confirmed that Spacey was given guidelines regarding sexual harassment in the workplace.Colleagues never complained because they were afraid of losing their jobs, the former camera assistant said."Who is going to believe crew members?"he said."You're going to get fired."Related: Seth MacFarlane joked about Kevin Spacey on 'Family Guy' episode years ago A former female production assistant who worked on several seasons of "House of Cards" said she witnessed Spacey's sexual misconduct with crew members on set."It was very known that Kevin was inappropriate, and males I worked with complained to me about how they felt uncomfortable," she said."Kevin does this thing which was play fights with them in order to touch them."She said she saw Spacey approach "multiple people" to "say hello, greet them, shake their hand and pull their hand down to his crotch and touch their crotch.I have friends say he reached up their shorts on set."Spacey also made sexually-charged comments on set, according to a former crew member."There was one instance [when] a grip bent over to pick something up and his ass crack was showing, and Kevin Spacey made a sexual comment about it," he recalled, adding that the comment Spacey made was "nice ass."The allegations about Spacey also come as the entertainment world is reckoning with fallout from the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal.Dozens of women have accused him of sexual harassment and police are investigating assault claims.Weinstein has apologized for his behavior, but he denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
Latest Weinstein allegations could lead to arrest:::::(CNN) The latest sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein could result in the first criminal charges against the movie mogul, an NYPD source familiar with the investigation told CNN."This is the strongest case we've had that fits within the statute of limitations," the source said, adding some detectives believe they have enough evidence to arrest Weinstein.At a press conference Friday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce described actress Paz de la Huerta's case as credible because of her "ability to articulate each movement of the crime, where she was, where this happened."The Manhattan District Attorney's office told CNN they have a sex crimes prosecutor assigned to an "active investigation" into the alleged incidents.De la Huerta, who has appeared in "A Walk to Remember" and the HBO drama "Boardwalk Empire," alleges Weinstein raped her in her apartment on two separate occasions in 2010.Read More
Jennifer Lawrence's crazy Kim Kardashian West interview:::::(CNN) Can we please get Jennifer Lawrence added to the cast of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians"?The Oscar-winning actress and self-professed Kardashian super fan was the guest host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"on Thursday, and she snagged her dream interview with Kim Kardashian West.Right out of the gate, Lawrence hit a home run by asking the reality TV star about one of her famous exes, NFL player Reggie Bush."Do you think it's a coincidence that Reggie Bush's wife looks just like you?"Lawrence asked."I don't."Kardashian West laughed that one off, but the interview was off and running from there.Here are a few of the tidbits we learned: Naked in Kris Jenner's closet Kardashian West recalled what happened when Lawrence, admittedly "obsessed" with the Kardashian-Jenner clan for more than a decade, came over for dinner recently at mom Kris Jenner's house."I've never seen my mom more drunk in our lives," Kardashian West said."It was so funny."Lawrence apparently had her fair share, too, confessing she "drank five martinis and wound up naked in (Jenner's) closet."The actress said she just wanted a makeover from Kardashian West and her fashion label-owning rapper-husband, Kanye West."You said, 'I'm not joking.I really want Kanye to style me and so I said, 'OK,' " Kardashian West said."I come back in and you're fully butt naked.I said, 'Umm, I'm going to intercom downstairs and tell (Kanye) not to come up.'"

'Alias Grace' brings hypnotic Margaret Atwood novel to Netflix:::::(CNN) Sarah Gadon's mesmerizing performance defines and elevates "Alias Grace," a six-episode Netflix miniseries based on Margaret Atwood's historical novel.Slow at first, the understated project gains momentum behind its central mystery, as well as Gadon's star-making turn as the 19th-century heroine, which suggests her name should be much better known once people get through bingeing it.While Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale" explored the societal plight of women through a dystopian future, "Alias Grace" probes similar terrain by examining the past -- specifically, a true story about a salacious crime, set in the wilds of Canada in the 1840s.An unreliable narrator of her own tale, Grace -- an Irish immigrant who becomes a housemaid -- has been convicted of murdering her well-to-do employer and his housekeeper (the latter played by "True Blood's" Anna Paquin).While the stable boy (Kerr Logan) also involved in the slayings has been executed, Grace's life was spared, though she remains a source of curiosity as she serves her life sentence. "allowfullscreen> Enter Dr. Simon Jordan (Edward Holcroft), a doctor who becomes fascinated with Grace's case, and, through a series of conversations, seeks to pull the truth out of her.Yet as she impassively recounts her star-crossed history, Grace's version of events complicates Holcroft's attempts to help her.Having bounced around for years as a possible feature, "Alias Grace" proves better suited to this more expansive and leisurely adaptation, written and directed by actress Sarah Polley and Mary Harron, respectively, and impeccably adorned in the mud-spattered trappings of the times.(Gadon, a Canadian, previously appeared in the Hulu miniseries "11.22.63.")Read More
Brett Ratner files suit against accuser:::::Story highlights Ratner is accusing Melanie Kohler of defaming him Spokesman said she will not be intimated (CNN) Director and producer Brett Ratner has filed suit against a woman he says defamed him by alleging he raped her.The suit was filed Wednesday in a Hawaii federal court, the same day the Los Angeles Times published an article in which six women, including actresses Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge, accused Ratner of allegations ranging from sexual harassment to assault.Ratner denied the allegations outlined in the report to CNN through his attorney, Martin Singer."Brett Ratner vehemently denies the outrageous derogatory allegations that have been reported about him, and we are confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims," the statement read."He understands the seriousness of this issue and the importance of addressing the concerns of victims of sexual misconduct both in the entertainment industry and beyond."Read More
Robert Durst, Elizabeth Smart featured in Lifetime's latest:::::(CNN) After dallying with some higher-quality fare, the Lifetime movie's tawdry, true-crime roots are showing with this month's premieres of "The Lost Wife of Robert Durst" and "I Am Elizabeth Smart."There's a degree of symmetry in that, since Durst's story, as told in HBO's reality show "The Jinx," combined with Netflix's "Making a Murderer" to help spur TV's current crime wave, both of the scripted and unscripted variety."The Lost Wife of Robert Durst," arriving this weekend, is easily the more compelling of the two, plugging in details of the story that transpired long before the events that eventually put the peculiar real-estate heir behind bars.(A third movie, "Oscar Pistorious: Blade Runner Killer," about the Olympian convicted of killing his girlfriend, will air between them.)An appropriately creepy Daniel Gillies (CW's "The Originals") plays a younger Durst, who meets Kathie ("Scorpion's" Katharine McPhee) because she's an attractive new tenant in one of his buildings.Ignoring his quirks, she falls for him, resulting in a whirlwind romance and marriage that quickly turns sour and abusive. "allowfullscreen> In keeping with the title, "Lost Wife" also involves Kathie going missing, and authorities turning their attention to her husband, without ever finding a body or cracking the case.Durst is also shown interacting with his friend Susan Berman, whose death later would prove his undoing.Read More
'Last Flag Flying' earns heartfelt salute:::::(CNN) "Last Flag Flying" is a low-key gem, a sober reflection on grief that connects the Iraq and Vietnam wars, burnishing Richard Linklater's credentials as one of the day's most gifted filmmakers.With a terrific trio in Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell and Laurence Fishburne, additional salutes might come when award time rolls around.The movie's backstory is almost as intriguing as the film itself.Darryl Ponicsan's novel was written as a sequel to "The Last Detail," itself turned into a memorable film starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young.Although the characters roughly line up, "Last Flag Flying" dispenses with that connection, even if familiarity with the 1973 movie enriches the experience.It's the first year of the Iraq war, and former Marine Sal (Cranston) is minding his own business running a bar when Carell's Larry "Doc" Shepherd ambles back into his life, 30 years later.A sad-sack sort who spent time in a military brig, Doc has looked Sal up to accompany him on a terrible mission, retrieving the body of his son -- slated for burial at Arlington Cemetery -- who was killed in Iraq.Sal agrees, and Doc has one more pickup in mind, enlisting Sal's long-lost buddy Mueller (Fishburne), a one-time wild-man and partner in crime who turned his life around and, much to Sal's amusement, became a pastor.What ensues initially looks like a standard-issue road movie, with the three getting into mild misadventures and marveling over (relatively) new technology, like mobile phones.Linklater (who wrote the script with Ponicsan) brings a theatrical quality to their banter, teasing out the characters' shared history while engaging in thoughtful debate about the war, trusting the military and the lies people tell, or don't, in their contortions to comfort loved ones.Read More
Wendy Williams explains why she fainted on-air:::::Story highlights Talk-show host says she became overheated when she fainted She says paramedics found she was low on electrolytes (CNN) Wendy Williams did not have a stroke nor was she pulling a stunt when she collapsed live on her daytime talk show this week.So Williams said during a segment Wednesday on "The Wendy Williams Show."Williams got emotional explaining why she passed out Tuesday while dressed as the Statue of Liberty for a Halloween episode on the syndicated show."A lot of people thought that was a joke, me fainting on my set," she said."No, that was not a joke.I'm a tall woman, and it's a long way down."Williams explained that she began to feel faint about 48 minutes into the show as her producer was briefing her on what was coming up next.Read More
'Thor: Ragnarok' flexes its comedy muscles:::::(CNN) Marking an ambitious detour into comedy, "Thor: Ragnarok" conjures sparks but doesn't quite catch lightning in a bottle.Sporadically fun and visually impressive, this third film works a bit too hard at flexing its laugh muscles, while bogging down in a midsection built around the enticing prospect of Thor versus the Hulk.Part of the problem, frankly, is that Marvel has done perhaps too good a job marketing the movie, to the extent most of the best lines and moments (like Thor seeing the Hulk and enthusiastically shouting, "He's a friend from work!")have played repeatedly in the trailer.Even Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song" makes a slightly incongruous appearance.To its credit, the movie makes the most out of an inordinately strong ensemble, surrounding Chris Hemsworth with reliable scene-stealer Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki, Cate Blanchett as the villainous Hela and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, a fearsome warrior.Throw in a cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr.Strange and a meatier role for Idris Elba as the stoic sentry Heimdall, and there's a lot of power on screen even before the CGI pyrotechnics kick in.It all starts promisingly enough, with Thor -- after what amounts to a James Bond-like pre-title sequence -- returning home to Asgard, where a newly freed Hela, the Goddess of Death, is on her way to lay siege. "allowfullscreen> Failing to stop her, Thor is inadvertently cast onto a dystopian planet Sakaar, presided over by Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, in fully manic mode), who forces his prisoners to engage in gladiatorial combat.Determined to win his freedom and face Hela, Thor is pleasantly surprised to discover that the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) has landed there as well -- at least, until the first punch lands.Read More
Rolling Stone rocks music, culture in HBO documentary:::::(CNN) Rolling Stone has earned its place in history as a publication at the center of music, pop culture and politics.Yet despite fascinating moments, "Rolling Stone: Stories From the Edge" -- a four-hour documentary, produced in conjunction with the magazine -- feels a bit too much like a licensed product to be fully and consistently compelling.Like "The Defiant Ones," another music-themed, multi-part HBO documentary about Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, directors Alex Gibney and Blair Foster use Jann Wenner's creation as a filter through which to examine a diverse array of musical and cultural forces.Those range from the rise of rock 'n roll and punk to Hunter S. Thompson's legendary fear and loathing on the trail during the Nixon campaign.Split into two parts, the first half is easily the strongest, with a fresh-faced Wenner describing his new venture as "sort of a magazine, sort of a newspaper," one that became the voice of a youth culture experiencing its own awakening along with the music.Presented episodically through pieces that ran in the magazine, "Stories From the Edge" feels somewhat inevitably uneven.The directors chronicle everything from the close relationship with John Lennon -- and Annie Leibovitz photo taken right before his death -- to the discovery of Bruce Springsteen, from Cameron Crowe famously writing for Rolling Stone as a teenager to the kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst and the insane access the magazine's reporters gained to those involved. "allowfullscreen> Other highlights include televangelist Jimmy Swaggart railing against rock magazines that he dubbed "pornography," followed by his very public exposure of hypocrisy; and Rolling Stone becoming "the home of the new journalism" by championing writers like Tom Wolfe and Thompson, who described his brand of "gonzo journalism" as involving "total subjectivity" and "participation."Read More
'Thor: Ragnarok' is the 17th straight number one opening for Marvel:::::Make that 17 for 17 for Marvel."Thor: Ragnarok," Marvel Studios' seventeenth film, opened on top of the box office this weekend.That keeps the perfect streak alive for Disney's (DIS) superhero studio.It has never had one of its films fall short of opening in the number one spot.The film, starring Chris Hemsworth as the god of thunder Thor and Cate Blanchett as the goddess of death Hela, brought in an estimated $121 million in 4,080 theaters in North America this weekend.That makes "Ragnarok" the fourth-largest opening of the year in the U.S.It is also by far the biggest opening for the character, which has never really had the popularity or box office might of other Marvel heroes like Iron Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy.In fact, the opening earnings for "Ragnarok" -- the third "Thor" film -- marked 41% increase over the opening of the series' second installment, 2013's "Thor: The Dark World.""Ragnarok" also saw a 84% increase over the opening of the original film, 2011's "Thor."Related: 'Thor: Ragnarok' flexes its comedy muscles The film has so far nabbed $427 million globally since opening in international markets last week.In total, Marvel Studios films have now made more than $5 billion domestically and $13 billion worldwide at the box office."Ragnarok" had a lot working in its favor.The buzz around the film has been strong ever since its teaser trailer debuted earlier this year.It was helped by the surprising inclusion of a Led Zeppelin track and a much-talked about battle between Thor and the Incredible Hulk.The film also had strong reviews from fans of the Norse god and from critics."Ragnarok" brought in an "A" CinemaScore from audiences and a 93% score on the review site Rotten Tomatoes.That makes it one of the best-reviewed Marvel films in the brand's nearly decade-long run.

NPR CEO on medical leave amid Oreskes harassment scandal:::::NPR chief operating officer Loren Mayor will run the organization for at least the next month while embattled CEO Jarl Mohn is on a medical leave, Mohn said Tuesday.The news comes nearly one week after Mohn forced out Michael Oreskes, the public radio organization's senior vice president of news, amid a harassment scandal.Many staffers were disappointed that Mohn did not take action against Oreskes sooner.Mohn has repeatedly apologized to the staff and pledged to make improvements.Still, there has been open speculation about his future as NPR CEO.On Tuesday, Mohn wrote to the staff: "As many of you know, last March, I suffered a nearly fatal ruptured aorta.I returned to work with the blessing of my physician with one important caveat -- I cannot allow my blood pressure to rise.Regretfully, the hypertension has returned to a dangerous level, and I have been instructed to take medical leave until my health returns to normal, at a minimum of four weeks."Mohn said NPR's board of directors has tapped Mayor to "continue to manage" day-to-day operations during his absence."She will do so with the full support of, and with guidance from, the board," Mohn wrote.Any decision about a change in leadership would come from NPR's board, which includes the heads of local radio stations from across the country, plus outside executives and consultants.The board is expected to review Mohn's handling of the Oreskes matter with the help of an outside law firm.At issue is whether Mohn and his lieutenants took concerns about Oreskes' conduct seriously enough.Allegations of harassment were first shared with NPR in 2015.More accusers were motivated to come forward in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal last month.In interviews with CNN and other news outlets, women alleged that Oreskes used his leadership position to try to curry favor with young women.Multiple women who interacted with him at NPR described his behavior as "boorish" and "intimidating."Some said they felt that the human resources department was not responsive to their concerns.In late October, word spread within NPR about the allegations against Oreskes.CNN reported last week that Mayor was one of the senior managers who urged Mohn to take action, but Mohn pushed back.A Washington Post story on October 31, detailing two of the allegations in Oreskes' past, caused even more turmoil inside NPR and led to Oreskes' exit the next day.Since then, more accusers have come forward.David Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent, said on CNN's "Reliable Sources" on Sunday that he has "spoken to nine women, some of them still at NPR, from a reporter in her 20s to a producer in her 50s," who alleged misconduct.The incidents were "not as severe" as what Weinstein stands accused of, Folkenflik said, but "nonetheless add up to an insidious pattern -- an abusive, sort of hierarchal authority, using his position in journalism to try to get proximity to women who might be susceptible to his appeals."Oreskes said in a statement last week that "my behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility."Regarding the new complaints against Oreskes, Mohn said in Tuesday's memo, "we are taking each of them seriously," NPR initially sidestepped calls for an independent investigation by saying that Oreskes was no longer an employee.But that position changed on November 2.Mohn acknowledged the widespread dissatisfaction within NPR by saying "I am committed to fixing what is broken.As one step, I am hiring an outside law firm to conduct a review of how we handled the matter."His description of this review changed after a contentious town hall meeting with staffers on November 3.In a new memo on November 4, he said NPR's board "is engaging an outside law firm to undertake a thorough review of what happened, when, and how."He said "the results of that review will go to the board, and we will share with you a summary of that review and the recommendations that come out of it."His latest memo, on Tuesday, reiterated that the board, not his office, is working with the unnamed law firm to "review our handling of this situation."Mohn's message about his health also revealed new information about Orekses' conduct."Concerns were raised linked to inappropriate expenses," he wrote.Specifically, some accusers had said that Oreskes spent corporate money on meals that he treated as dates."We investigated and he recently reimbursed NPR for about $1,800 in invalid expenses," Mohn wrote, calling the spending another sign of Oreskes' "bad judgment."
Showtime mass shooting docuseries 'too relevant,' says producer:::::Before an episode of Showtime docuseries "Active Shooter: America Under Fire" airs, the title cards the text shown on screen at different given points -- must be finalized.A few weeks ago, the show's fifth episode, about the Pulse Nightclub shooting, required a last-minute change.At one point, the Orlando shooting, in which 49 people were killed, was referred to as the worst mass shooting in modern American history.That was no longer true.In October, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.Fifty-eight people were killed and almost 500 people were injured.It became the new deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history."If there was ever a case of making a TV series that was perhaps too relevant, it might this one," Aaron Saidman, one of the executive producers of "Active Shooter," told CNN in a recent interview.On Sunday, another shooting took place.This one at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.Twenty-six people were killed while attending a church service.Eight of the victims were from the same family.When Saidman learned on Sunday that yet another mass shooting had taken place, the second since the show debuted in late September, he was not surprised."It saddens me that it's not shocking to me, having worked on this show for over a year," Saidman said.The shooting in Texas took place just two days after Showtime aired the sixth episode of "Active Shooter," this one about the mass shooting in Santa Monica in 2013.Every episode of the docuseries highlights a different mass shooting and explores "a diverse range of issues and topics that are sparking the violence," according to Saidman.As a veteran nonfiction storyteller, Saidman sees it as his job to reflect what's happening in society, but even he knows "Active Shooter" is difficult to watch."We're asking people to process these incredibly gripping but painful stories while new ones are unfolding in front of our eyes and on the front pages of newspapers," he said."That's really difficult in some ways, but we think that's what makes this series all that more important for people to see."In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Showtime pulled a repeat of "Active Shooter" from its schedule.Saidman said producers supported the move, but remain committed to starting a conversation.Inaction, he said, is "obviously not working.""The idea that we've accepted these incidents as a normal part of American life is regrettable, but, more importantly, it's tragic," he said.This week's installment, about the shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, is scheduled to air as planned, according to Showtime.The eight-part docuseries explores mass shootings through the eyes of victims and first responders people who are often forgotten after the news cycle has moved on to other matters or other shootings, Saidman said.The result is a series that, as a whole, presents a flood of heartbreaking accounts and disjointed stories that end up feeling interconnected.As Saidman sees it, in many ways, they are."It's almost like there are fewer than six degrees of separation, and the more of these that happen, the more you will either know someone who's affected by it or you will know someone who knows someone who's affected by it," he said."I'm wondering...if there isn't a tipping point, where it's too close to home to too many millions of Americans.[Will] that not be the thing that urges us into more action on the issue?I'm pessimistic of that, but I wonder."
Disney ends L.A. Times ban following backlash from news outlets:::::Disney will no longer ban the Los Angeles Times from advance screenings of its movies following a backlash from critics groups, news outlets and journalists, who were boycotting those same screenings in protest."We've had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at The Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns, and as a result, we've agreed to restore access to advance screenings for their film critics," a Walt Disney Company spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.In a statement of its own released shortly afterward, the Times said, "The Los Angeles Times has covered the Walt Disney Company since its founding, here in Los Angeles, in 1923.We look forward to reporting on Disney well into the future."The lifting of the blackout follows an outpouring of solidarity for the Times after the paper's film coverage was blacked out by Disney due to a story that examined the business relationship between the company's flagship Californian theme park, Disneyland, and the city of Anaheim.Disney had said that the Times "showed a complete disregard for basic journalistic standards" with that story, though it has not publicly claimed there were any errors in the article.On Monday, entertainment sites like The A.V.Club and Flavorwire, as well as a pop culture writer for the Washington Post, said they would skip the screenings until the ban on the Times was lifted.Related: Journalists and critic groups boycott Disney films in solidarity with the L.A. Times The New York Times joined the growing boycott on Tuesday afternoon, not long before the reversal of the ban was announced."A powerful company punishing a news organization for a story they do not like is meant to have a chilling effect," the New York Times said in a statement."This is a dangerous precedent and not at all in the public interest."The NYT joins boycott of preview screenings for Disney movies in solidarity with the LAT, which was barred following investigative series.pic.twitter.com/S2RlGUfQjS Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 7, 2017 Critics groups like the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics also jointly denounced Disney's decision.They also voted to disqualify Disney's films from year-end awards consideration."It is admittedly extraordinary for a critics' group, let alone four critics' groups, to take any action that might penalize film artists for decisions beyond their control.But Disney brought forth this action when it chose to punish The Times' journalists rather than express its disagreement with a business story via ongoing public discussion," the groups said in a joint statement."Disney's response should gravely concern all who believe in the importance of a free press, artists included."
Fox News pulls pro-impeachment ad, citing negative viewer reaction:::::Fox News said on Monday that it would no longer air an ad calling for President Trump's impeachment, a move that came after Trump seemingly responded to the 60-second spot by attacking the billionaire Democratic donor featured in it on Twitter."Due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers, we could not in good conscience take their money," Jack Abernethy, co-president of Fox News, said in a statement.A Fox News spokesperson declined to say exactly how the network measured the negative reaction the ad drew and how it determined the negative reaction met a threshold that necessitated no longer airing it.Television networks have wide latitude about the commercials they air.Ads with totally false claims are occasionally rejected.But Fox's decision -- shelving an ad because viewers complained -- is highly unusual.The ad, produced by a group backed by Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer called Need To Impeach, features Steyer outlining a case for impeaching Trump, framing the president as a "clear and present danger" who is "mentally unstable and armed with nuclear weapons."It directs viewers to sign an online petition.The ad has been running elsewhere on TV, including CNN and MSNBC and some local broadcast TV stations, including ones owned by Fox's parent company.There is also an online component to the ad campaign.The 60-second spot ran on Fox News three times on October 27.After one of the ads aired during "Fox & Friends" that morning, Trump seemingly responded to it, labeling Steyer in a tweet as "wacky & totally unhinged."On Friday, Steyer announced on MSNBC's "All In With Chris Hayes" that Fox News was refusing to air week two of his ad buy.Need To Impeach, which had purchased seven slots to air that week, said in a press release that it was first informed by Fox News of its decision on October 31.A representative for Need To Impeach said the group was told it would be refunded for the second week of its ad buy since none of the ads ran.It's unclear whether Fox News, which said it "could not in good conscience" take money from the group, would refund Need To Impeach for the three ads that did run on its network.The Need To Impeach representative said it has not received any refund thus far.A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment.Brad Deutsch, an attorney representing Need To Impeach who sent a letter to Abernethy on Friday accusing Fox News of breaching its contract, told CNN he believed that Fox News' decision to pull the ad raised larger questions about the network's programming."Fox News is admitting that they don't provide their viewers with information if the information will upset their audience (i.e., impact their bottom line by losing audience)," Deutsch said in an email."It makes you wonder whether they are making the same calculations with decision about news content," he continued."Is Fox setting news judgment aside and censoring news stories because they fear a 'strong negative reaction" from their audiences?"Fox's decision may have ultimately drawn even more attention to Steyer and his ad campaign.He tweeted on Monday: "Fox News trying to silence the 1.7 million who have already signed our impeachment petition."Then he promoted a link to the petition.

In Hot Water: Baldwin's Trump Takes Jabs at Manafort, Weinstein in 'SNL' Cold Open:::::Days after the first Russia probe indictments, "Saturday Night Live" continued to show the Trump administration in hot waterthis week's the cold open ended with President Donald Trump and his team in the shower.Alec Baldwin's Trump secretly visited a former adviser who has been indicted in the Russia probe, offering little advice, but: "Hang in there, Paul."After complimenting former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, played by Alex Moffat, on his expensive suit and oriental rugs (a reference to the items purchased by the real Manafort with laundered money), Trump expressed concern."You're screwed.You're so, so screwed," he said.The real Manafort was indicted on 12 charges Monday as part of the special counsel's probe into Russian ties to Trump's presidential campaign.As Trump met with Manafort, Air Force One flew from Hawaii to Asia, mirroring the trip that the real President Trump is currently on.Baldwin's Trump fooled the world into thinking he's traveling.First lady Melania, played by Cecily Strong, sat next to a doll version of the president, and "for the first time in 10 years" it was quiet enough for her to talk."Who knew that just by keeping your mouth shut you could seem so presidential," Melania said to the doll.Meanwhile, Baldwin's Trump and Moffat's Manafort got in the shower to talk privately, after the president checked him for a wire.As they spoke, Vice President Mike Pence, played by Beck Bennett, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, played by Kate McKinnon, joined them.While they were unable to pardon Manafort in the shower, they had a backup plan: "We're gonna wait a few weeks and dress you like a turkey, and then we'll pardon you."And Baldwin's Trump couldn't resist weighing in on the recent Hollywood sexual assault scandals."What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is.He could've gotten away with all of it, if only he had gotten himself elected president," he said.The real Donald Trump has been accused of sexual assault by a number of women."Weekend Update" also opened with indictment news, Colin Jost calling it part of a "Robert Mueller surprise party" for the one-year anniversary of Trump winning the election."I don't know what [Manafort] is guilty of, but it's definitely not nothing," Jost said."No one has three passports, a burner phone and good intentions, except maybe Santa Claus."Michael Che recapped Trump's tweets on the probe, saying he's "tired of watching the president of the United States have an emotional breakdown on social media like he's Tyrese.""Indictments are important and you work for us," Che said, speaking to Trump."So go put on your baggy suit, fold your hair nice and answer all of our questions face-to-face like the public servant that you are."Jost also touched on Trump's call to end a visa program after one of its recipients carried out a terror attack in New York City on Halloween."Obviously this attack was awful, but I'm not sure we should get rid of an entire immigration program based on the actions of one deranged individual," he said."I mean, we don't look at Trump and say, 'We should get rid of all presidents.'"Host Larry David revived his Sen. Bernie Sanders impression for a celebrity edition of "The Price Is Right.""We're gonna win this thing the Bernie way, which means if I lose, I'll bring everyone else down with me," David's Sanders said.After being asked to offer a best guess on the price of a washing machine, he decided to point out the "real problem.""The real problem in this country is American consumerism," he said."Who needs a washer?When I need to wash the one suit I own, I just wait until it rains, I stand outside for 15 minutes and then I jog behind a bus until the exhaust dries me off."White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, played by Aidy Brayant, took questions from reporters, but as they got more difficulton indictments, chief of staff John Kelly's remarks on the Civil Warher daydreaming got more vivid.In her mind, she was Demi Lovato singing her pop hit "Confident," which seems to give her a boost to answer questions.In Larry David's opening monologue, he did not shy away from Hollywood's biggest controversy."You know, a lot of sexual harassment stuff in the news of late," he said."And I couldnt help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging, which is that many of the predatorsnot all, but many of themare Jews."To that, David said, "Oy vey izmir," which means "Woe is me.""I want 'Einstein discovers the theory of relativity,' 'Salk cures Polio,'" David said, talking about headlines he would prefer Jews to have."What I dont want: 'Weinstein took it out.'"The "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star said he strives to be a "good Jewish representative."Musical guest Miley Cyrus performed two songs, "Bad Mood" and "I Would Die for You."

Colton Dunn Relishing His 'Super' Break:::::Actors Ben Feldman and Laura Ash join NBC 5 to talk about the third season of "Superstore" before Thursday night's premiere of the comedy.(Published Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017) Comedian and actor Colton Dunn loves that he's finally getting recognized on the street, but admits its weird when fans approach him when hes wearing boxer briefs and flip-flops.He's drawing attention for playing the wheelchair-bound, sarcastic scene stealer, Garrett McNeil on NBCs Superstore.The show, about a group of zany employees working for a big-box akin to Costco, premiered on NBC in 2015 and has gained a legion of loyal fans.Dunn, who originally hails from Minnesota and currently lives in California, is no stranger to being on TV.Hes appeared on Parks and Recreation, MadTv and the popular Comedy Central sketch series Key and Peele, which earned him three primetime Emmy nominations for writing.'Late Night': Pompeo Talks 300 Episodes of 'Grey's Anatomy' Ellen Pompeo tells Seth Meyers about how she thought every year would be the last year of "Grey's Anatomy.""I can't believe people aren't sick of me yet," she says as the show celebrates its 300th episode (Published Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2017) But Superstore is Dunns first series regular role and he loves playing the witty Garrett."I think hes the most normal person in the cast of characters Dunn said.I think hes coolest guy on the show and hes the most handsome guy on the show.The McNeil character is paralyzed from the waist down.Dunn, who is able-bodied, says he wants to bring the character to life without highlighting the fact that hes in a wheelchair.But he understands that some may be offended by him portraying someone in the disabled community.I definitely agree with the sentiment that more people with a disability should be represented on screen, Dunn said.When youre auditioning a bunch of people, youre looking for types and people who kind of fit the types in the script, but what you're looking for in a comedy is a kind of a chemistry.He said that he auditioned against disabled actors for the role and eventually won out.Despite not being disabled, his hope is to represent the community respectfully and believes the show is the perfect vehicle to showcase that.Its a character and it has an opportunity, for what the show is, to have a really diverse set of characters that you dont see on a lot of shows, he says.The show also stars "Ugly Betty" alum, America Ferrera, who serves as executive producer of the series.Ferrera recently revealed she was sexually harassed when she was 9 years old, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.Dunn describes Ferrera as "powerful" and "amazing" and expressed support for the women who are vocal about whats happened to them.I think it was really braver for everybody who shared their story, he said.I think its really important, especially for younger women, to see that its okay.He also challenges men to speak up among themselves when inappropriate comments are made toward women.We have to stop laughing at some of the jokes that you call locker room talk, Dunn said.Theres sort of a mindset I think, that men need to work together to really understand that women are our equals.

Alex Trebek Meets His Match – Again:::::Austin Rogers left "Jeopardy!"Oct. 12 in fifth place for most money won on the storied game show ($411,000).But the 12-time victor exited first in a category unlikely to ever to make it onto the "Jeopardy" game wall: Butts of Alex Trebek's Naughty Jokes.Now Rogers is set to return as the annual Tournament of Champions kicks off Monday.It marks a rematch of sorts for him not against any of the other quiz whizzes, but against Trebek.The oddball New York City bartender initially threw Trebek with his wisecracks and show-openings antics.Rogers variously mined making a phone call, blowing up a balloon and pitching a baseball during the introductions, when most contestants just smile stiffly as the "Jeopardy!"theme plays.But he ultimately charmed Trebek, who teased Rogers as "Mr. Show Biz," bantered with the contestant about his thrift-shop wardrobe and returned his high-five.It represented a departure of sorts for Trebek, whose haughty smugness as the man who holds the questions to the answers punctuated the show for much of his 33-year run.In the 1990s, that image earned him a parody on "Saturday Night Live" in which Will Ferrell portrayed Trebek as the flustered, victim of "Celebrity Jeopardy!"contestant Sean Connery's (Darrell Hammond) crude taunts.The truth is Trebek has mellowed somewhat in these recent, post-mustache years.Proof rests in the juvenile joke he cracked, inadvertently or otherwise, during Rogers' finale.Rogers buzzed into a category where the question needed to include the name of a tree.When called upon to deliver a nickname for a detective, Rogers said, "What is a dick?"Trebek snapped: "I've never seen a dick tree."(While "dick" is old-school lingo for a detective, the correct question is "What is a gumshoe?"as in gum tree.)The exchange set the Internet ablaze.It also clearly amused Rogers.With the Tournament of Champions, he earns an opportunity to expand his entry in the trivia books as the man who got the world to see another side of Alex Trebek.Hester is Director of News Products and Projects at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism.He is also the author of "Raising a Beatle Baby: How John, Paul, George and Ringo Helped us Come Together as a Family."Follow him on Twitter.Copyright NBC Owned Television Stations

John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, tweeted: "Truly heartbreaking news in #Sutherland Springs.Please say a prayer for First Baptist congregation, first responders & the community there" San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich spoke to reporters after his team's Sunday night victory, directing attention away from the game and to the shooting in the nearby town."We won a basketball game.Considering whats gone on today, it's pretty meaningless," Popovich said in his brief postgame remarks."When you think about the tragedy those families are suffering, it's inconceivable and impossible to put your head around.So, I think talking about basketball is probably pretty inappropriate.So, you guys have a good night."Here is a look at how some other public figures responded to the Texas shooting:
In Hot Water: Baldwin's Trump Takes Jabs at Manafort, Weinstein in 'SNL' Cold Open:::::Days after the first Russia probe indictments, "Saturday Night Live" continued to show the Trump administration in hot waterthis week's the cold open ended with President Donald Trump and his team in the shower.Alec Baldwin's Trump secretly visited a former adviser who has been indicted in the Russia probe, offering little advice, but: "Hang in there, Paul."After complimenting former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, played by Alex Moffat, on his expensive suit and oriental rugs (a reference to the items purchased by the real Manafort with laundered money), Trump expressed concern."You're screwed.You're so, so screwed," he said.The real Manafort was indicted on 12 charges Monday as part of the special counsel's probe into Russian ties to Trump's presidential campaign.As Trump met with Manafort, Air Force One flew from Hawaii to Asia, mirroring the trip that the real President Trump is currently on.Baldwin's Trump fooled the world into thinking he's traveling.First lady Melania, played by Cecily Strong, sat next to a doll version of the president, and "for the first time in 10 years" it was quiet enough for her to talk."Who knew that just by keeping your mouth shut you could seem so presidential," Melania said to the doll.Meanwhile, Baldwin's Trump and Moffat's Manafort got in the shower to talk privately, after the president checked him for a wire.As they spoke, Vice President Mike Pence, played by Beck Bennett, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, played by Kate McKinnon, joined them.While they were unable to pardon Manafort in the shower, they had a backup plan: "We're gonna wait a few weeks and dress you like a turkey, and then we'll pardon you."And Baldwin's Trump couldn't resist weighing in on the recent Hollywood sexual assault scandals."What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is.He could've gotten away with all of it, if only he had gotten himself elected president," he said.The real Donald Trump has been accused of sexual assault by a number of women."Weekend Update" also opened with indictment news, Colin Jost calling it part of a "Robert Mueller surprise party" for the one-year anniversary of Trump winning the election."I don't know what [Manafort] is guilty of, but it's definitely not nothing," Jost said."No one has three passports, a burner phone and good intentions, except maybe Santa Claus."Michael Che recapped Trump's tweets on the probe, saying he's "tired of watching the president of the United States have an emotional breakdown on social media like he's Tyrese.""Indictments are important and you work for us," Che said, speaking to Trump."So go put on your baggy suit, fold your hair nice and answer all of our questions face-to-face like the public servant that you are."Jost also touched on Trump's call to end a visa program after one of its recipients carried out a terror attack in New York City on Halloween."Obviously this attack was awful, but I'm not sure we should get rid of an entire immigration program based on the actions of one deranged individual," he said."I mean, we don't look at Trump and say, 'We should get rid of all presidents.'"Host Larry David revived his Sen. Bernie Sanders impression for a celebrity edition of "The Price Is Right.""We're gonna win this thing the Bernie way, which means if I lose, I'll bring everyone else down with me," David's Sanders said.After being asked to offer a best guess on the price of a washing machine, he decided to point out the "real problem.""The real problem in this country is American consumerism," he said."Who needs a washer?When I need to wash the one suit I own, I just wait until it rains, I stand outside for 15 minutes and then I jog behind a bus until the exhaust dries me off."White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, played by Aidy Brayant, took questions from reporters, but as they got more difficulton indictments, chief of staff John Kelly's remarks on the Civil Warher daydreaming got more vivid.In her mind, she was Demi Lovato singing her pop hit "Confident," which seems to give her a boost to answer questions.In Larry David's opening monologue, he did not shy away from Hollywood's biggest controversy."You know, a lot of sexual harassment stuff in the news of late," he said."And I couldnt help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging, which is that many of the predatorsnot all, but many of themare Jews."To that, David said, "Oy vey izmir," which means "Woe is me.""I want 'Einstein discovers the theory of relativity,' 'Salk cures Polio,'" David said, talking about headlines he would prefer Jews to have."What I dont want: 'Weinstein took it out.'"The "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star said he strives to be a "good Jewish representative."Musical guest Miley Cyrus performed two songs, "Bad Mood" and "I Would Die for You."

Off-Broadway Production of 'Too Heavy For Your Pocket' Spotlights 1960s Black Resistance Movement That Still Strikes Chords Today:::::Tucked away in the sub-basement of the Roundabout Underground in Times Square, just a few blocks away from where some are paying otherworldly ticket prices for "Hamilton" or Bruce Springsteen's one man show, may be one of Off-Broadway's best kept secrets."Too Heavy For Your Pocket," a new play written by Jirh Breon Holder starring Brandon Gill, Hampton Fluker, Eboni Flowers and Nneka Okafor, was just extended one week and will now conclude its run at Roundabout's Black Box Theatre on Nov. 26.The play chronicles the lives of two African American couples in the early 1960's during the heat of the civil rights movement.Their futures are thrown into turmoil after one of their group decides to forsake a life-altering college scholarship to join the Freedom Riders.The original Freedom Riders consisted of 13 African American and white civil rights activists who launched the Freedom Rides on May 4, 1961 -- a movement that consisted of a series of bus trips through the American South to protest segregation in interstate bus terminals.The Freedom Riders attempted to integrate facilities at bus terminals along the way into the Deep South.African American Freedom Riders tried to use whites-only restrooms and lunch counters, encountering violence from white protesters along the route while drawing international attention to their cause.Gill, who the plays the character of Bowzie Brandon, was introduced to the project when the playwright said the part was written specifically with him in mind."The writer was a friend first and he writes to your strengths.So there are a lot of characteristics between Bowzie and myself that we definitely share," Brandon says."There are similarities in terms of being a dreamer and wanting to reach outside the little space that you grew up in."Flowers, who plays Gill's bold and sassy wife Evelyn, says the material spoke to her in a deeply instinctual way."As a southerner, especially being from Montgomery, I feel like these conversations and dialogue were always prevalent in my family," she says."So I was familiar with Dr. King's journey and that of the Freedom Riders and the four little girls [murdered on Sept. 15, 1963 after a bomb detonated beneath the steps of the 16th Street Baptist Church].These have always been active conversations in my family.So this is just a deeper dive into the narrative."Both performers believe that while the play focuses on the events of the 1960s, it has never been more relevant than it is today, in 2017, as professional athletes take a knee in the face of social injustices and women across the country speak out against sexual harassment and abuse in the form of the #MeToo movement."There's never an opportune time for people of color to speak out against adversity," says Gill. "It always seem an inconvenience to privilege or disrespectful in some way.At the same time it has to be done.So just do it when you're ready."Adds Flowers, "It doesnt stop with the Freedom Riders.They are part of a much bigger picture.I think about #MeToo and the women's struggle thats happening right now with being transparent about things that have been going on.There are so many different things to be active about, including being a black person, and the things that we need and want and the dignity that we continue to fight for."The extension week will include three special performances reserved for New York City students from schools affiliated with Roundabout's expansive education program.Information regarding tickets for the show can be found on the Roundabout website.

Sia releases nude photo to foil possible paparazzi plot, she says:::::Sia doesnt often show her face, but she's showing off a whole lot more on Twitter.The star said that since there may be a plot to sell nude paparazzi photos of her, she decided to post one of the photos first.The photo, which appears to be a paparazzi-style photo that may have been taken without her knowledge, features her naked backside.Someone is apparently trying to sell naked photos of me to my fans, she captioned the shot.Save your money, here it is for free.Everyday is Christmas!The last line in her tweet is a reference to her new holiday album, which comes out November 17.The singer, 41, is famously private and often wears a wig to cover her face.Last year, the "Chandelier" singer said in an interview with "Good Morning America" that the look has allowed her to live more freely."It's for fun and for privacy," she said about her black-and-white hairpiece."I've been walking around New York this whole time.I don't need security detail.I don't need anything special.I just walk around and I can do that and that's a real luxury when you're in my industry."
Harvey Weinstein hired elite intelligence agency to target accuser Rose McGowan, others: Source:::::Harvey Weinstein hired an elite private agency run by former intelligence officers to gather information on women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, and specifically targeted accuser Rose McGowan, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News.The use of the company -- called Black Cube -- was first reported by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker.Farrow appeared on "Good Morning America" Tuesday to discuss his latest New Yorker piece and what he calls "an international campaign" on behalf of Weinstein to keep his accusers from coming forward."This was elaborate and expensive," Farrow said."This was all conducted in secrecy ...I think the story makes it clear that they were focusing on everyone trying to get word out about this."A spokeswoman for Weinstein told The New Yorker about this new report, It is a fiction to suggest that any individuals were targeted or suppressed at any time.Farrow's latest piece alleges Weinstein hired multiple firms -- including Black Cube -- to gather information from the accusers and from reporters working on stories.The report claims that one Black Cube operative, whose real name was not used in the story, reached out to McGowan, posing as an activist launching an initiative to combat discrimination against women in the workplace.The story adds that the same investigator also contacted a reporter for New York magazine saying she had allegations against Weinstein to share.That reporter, Ben Wallace, told The New Yorker, the woman, using a different name than the one she used with McGowan, asked him about the status and scope of my inquiry, and about who I might be talking to, without giving me any meaningful help or information.Farrow said he used a photograph of this operative to conclude that McGowan and Wallace were talking about the same woman.The operative also allegedly emailed Farrow himself and New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor under an assumed name when they were working on Weinstein stories.Kantor was one of the reporters on the Times story back on Oct. 5, alleging Weinstein reached confidential settlements with some harassment accusers over several decades.Furthermore, a source familiar with the alleged investigative work done for Weinstein confirmed to ABC News that McGowan was specifically targeted and that Black Cube secured a part of the transcript of McGowan's upcoming memoir "Brave" through its undercover agent.McGowan has been outspoken on social media, accusing Weinstein of sexual assault.Black Cube was hired to find out about the people who were launching a campaign against Harvey Weinstein.Shareholders, partners, journalists and Rose McGowan," the source told ABC News.Black Cube ended the contract in July.A couple loose ends were tied up in August, but the contract ended in July.They felt that they could not help him anymore.This source information comes after an official statement to ABC News from Black Cube that did not admit to working with Weinstein, but did say they work on uncovering negative campaigns.However, the company had said it does not get involved in sexual harassment cases.It is Black Cubes policy to never discuss its clients with any third party, and to never confirm or deny any speculation made with regard to the companys work," the company said in a statement."Black Cube supports the work of many leading law firms around the world, especially in the U.S., gathering evidence for complex legal processes, involving commercial disputes, among them uncovering negative campaigns.The company does not get involved in family disputes or sexual harassment cases.It should be highlighted that Black Cube applies high moral standards to its work, and operates in full compliance with the law of any jurisdiction in which it operates -- strictly following the guidance and legal opinions provided by leading law firms from around the world.Since the first Times report on Weinstein in early October, dozens of women have made allegations of harassment and abuse against the former studio head in the New Yorker, on social media and in other media outlets.There have been serious repercussions after the allegations: Weinstein was terminated by his eponymous company, and he later resigned from its board; he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other organizations; and his wife, Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman, announced last month that she was leaving him.Additionally, he is under investigation by police in four jurisdictions -- New York City, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and London.Weinstein has denied "any allegations of nonconsensual sex" via his spokeswoman."Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual," according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson."Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.
How faith, family and music helped Luke Bryan rebound from tragedy:::::At 41 years old, country superstar Luke Bryan has had enough success to last four lifetimes.But he's also had his fair share of tragedy, something the Georgia native has taken in stride.The "That's My Kind of Night" singer welcomed Robin Roberts into his home for the ABC special "Living Every Day: Luke Bryan" and gave the "Good Morning America" co-anchor unfettered and exclusive access to the real Bryan, who just happens to be the same fun-loving guy millions of fans have enjoyed on stage."There is no act," Luke Bryan's wife, Caroline Bryan, told ABC News.But Luke Bryan credits Caroline Bryan with putting "the family dynamic first," even through five hit studio albums, more than a dozen top Billboard singles and millions and millions of albums sold worldwide."I think sometimes you get wrapped up in, you're career and all that," Luke Bryan told Roberts."She doesn't buy into what old Lukey boy is selling her a lot."Next month, the duo will celebrate their 11th wedding anniversary and if it really is Luke Bryan's college sweetheart who has shown him that family comes first, he's truly followed her lead.After losing his brother, Chris Bryan, in a car accident more than 20 years ago and then his sister Kelly Bryan more than a decade later, tragedy struck his family yet again in 2014.Courtesy Luke Bryan Courtesy Luke Bryan We never thought twice about it ... We just did it.Kelly Bryan's husband, Ben Lee Cheshire, died unexpectedly and Luke Bryan's nieces and nephew were suddenly without a father or a mother.Luke and Caroline Bryan decided to take in their three children with no questions asked."We never thought twice about it," Caroline Bryan added about taking the children into their family."You know, it was never something that he and I had to sit down and talk about, you know, should we take this on?We just did it."But something that took a little getting used to was raising a teenager in nephew Til, now 15."Were buddies now, though, kinda," Luke Bryan joked."Until he makes me ... that's when I get onto him, I'm like, 'Alright, you're making me be an adult, don't make me be an adult!'"But being 15 also means learning to drive and independence."He's just slow poking around, and I'm like ...I mean, I'm like the worst parent, because I'm like, 'C'mon boy, go!'"Luke Bryan added.You just gotta have faith beyond faith.Along with the love and support of his wife, Luke Bryan said his faith helps him "appreciate every day."Along with Bryan's tragedies, Caroline also lost her niece, Sadie Brett, in early 2017 when she was just seven months old."I've watched my family go through ebbs and flows where we get mad at God and we get mad at why this has happened," he admitted."Well, you keep going and you try to, try to be as positive as you can, and you try to appreciate every day.You'll never get back to 100 percent.You'll always be working to get back to 75 percent."John Shearer/Getty Images The "Drink a Beer" hitmaker said that while he's had his fair share of tragedy, he knows how blessed he is in other aspects of his life."Me and my family have gotten together and celebrated and cried over winning entertainer of the year," he explained."It certainly makes it special when we're all together and we know that people are smiling down, and they're, they're with us, celebrating these amazing moments ... music has certainly helped us through this old, this old crazy ride of life."WATCH: "Living Every Day: Luke Bryan": A Robin Roberts special presentation, airing Monday, Nov. 6, at 10 ET/9 CT on ABC.
'Dancing With the Stars' recap: On trio night, Jordan Fisher gets 2 perfect scores, Terrell Owens goes home:::::Week 8 of "Dancing With the Stars" heated up the dance floor Monday night with trio night, with stars performing a traditional pair dance and then a trio dance a special guest.Past trio dances added a second professional dancer, but on Monday night's show, the couples were joined by season 17 runner-up Corbin Bleu and past winners Kelly Monaco from the first season, Kristi Yamaguchi from season 6, Alfonso Ribeiro from season 19, Laurie Hernandez from season 23 and reigning Mirror Ball champion Rashad Jennings from season 24.Former NFL star Terrell Owens kicked things off with a lively Charleston that earned him compliments from the judges and a score of 27.But he also closed the show when it was announced he was eliminated."I think Terrell is just a hard worker.This is why I love working with athletes, because they don't take anything I say too personal, and I'm pretty tough ... but that's because I see potential in Terrell," his partner, Cheryl Burke, said today on "Good Morning America.""I knew that he had it in him, and so I just kept fighting until I got it, and I had no idea we were going to make it all the way to week 8, so I'm super proud of him," she said.Owens said his emotional side shined through more in the ballroom, as opposed to on the football field, where, he said, "I showed it when I was in between the lines."The night belonged to Broadway star Jordan Fisher.He earned two perfect scores, which put him at the top of the leader board.His quickstep with partner Lindsay Arnold to "Chuck Berry" by Pharrell Williams was a knockout performance that made often surly judge Len Goodman stand up and applaud.Later, Fisher and Arnold were partnered with "High School Musical" star Bleu and turned in a sensational performance with a salsa to "Que Viva la Vida" by Wisin.Interestingly, both Fisher and Bleu have performed on Broadway in musicals by Lin-Manuel Miranda: Fisher in "Hamilton" and Bleu in "In the Heights."Among the night's highlights was a performance from insecure Frankie Muniz, who is always filled with nerves for the show but has proved himself a good dancer.His Viennese waltz with partner Witney Carson was good, and his trio dance featuring Ribeiro was great fun and prompted Goodman to say, "A lot of this competition is about confidence ... You're a good dancer, Frankie.Come out and perform," which brought cheers from the audience.With the semifinals next week, only five couples remain: Fisher and Arnold, Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas, Victoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy, Drew Scott and Emma Slater, and Muniz and Carson.Here are the combined scores for the night: Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold, 60 Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas, 54 Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson, 53 Terrell Owens and Cheryl Burke, 51 Victoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy, 48 Drew Scott and Emma Slater, 47 "Dancing With the Stars" returns next Monday night at 8 p.m. on ABC.
Judge ignores recommendation, sends Meek Mill to prison:::::Rapper Meek Mill was sentenced to two to four years in prison on probation violations Monday by a Philadelphia judge who said the musician had wasted several chances to clean up his act following a 2009 gun and drug case.The sentence rounded out a roughly decade-long back and forth between the 30-year-old musician and Common Pleas Judge Genece Brinkley that has dogged Mill's career as he had been jailed and called to court multiple times on various infractions."I've been trying to help you since 2009," Brinkley said, citing a failed drug test, failure to comply with a court order restricting his travel and two other unrelated arrests."You basically thumbed your nose at me."The handing down of the sentence came after a prosecutor recommended that Mill not be imprisoned for the violations, saying that he has been clean since January and that he has grown as a person since his original crime.Brinkley said the prosecutor was too new to the case to understand how Mill just "does what he wants."Mill owned up to the violations in his only statement during the hearing and said that jailing him would likely end his musical career.He said that he has battled addiction to the prescription painkiller Percocet and that he has only tried to escape a life of crime."I may have made a mistake but I never had the intention of disrespecting you," he said.His lawyer, Brian McMonagle, restated the prosecutor's recommendation of no prison sentence back to the judge as Mill emptied his pockets and removed jewelry from his wrists.With a court officer looming behind him, Mill turned his head and looked backed in the direction of his mother before standing up and being led out of the room by the officer.McMonagle vowed to appeal the decision as more than a dozen friends and family members stormed out of the courtroom.Mill has served short stints in jail and home confinement following his conviction on gun and drug possession charges that could have resulted in a five to 10 year prison sentence.He also was recently arrested two times once in St. Louis for a fight in an airport where serious charges against him were later dropped and the other for reckless driving in New York City.
Egyptian activists pan US actress Helen Hunt in open letter:::::Egyptian activists condemned American actress Helen Hunt on Tuesday for her participation in a government-organized youth conference they say is whitewashing authorities' appalling human rights record and suppression of free speech.The open letter by Mona Seif and other well-known human rights advocates gained nearly 300 signatures by Tuesday afternoon.They included Mohamed Zaree, who last month won the prestigious Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, and Aida Seif el-Dawla, whose Nadeem Center treats victims of torture and trauma and was shuttered by the government earlier this year.The letter follows a flurry of online criticism against this week's "World Youth Forum," hosted under the patronage of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, 62, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.Hunt, 54, was a keynote speaker at the opening ceremony.The event's official Twitter hashtag #WeNeedToTalk has become a battleground for opposing viewpoints, with critics overwhelming the thread with images of Egyptian police beating and chasing down youths during el-Sissi's rule alongside portraits of young jailed activists."This isn't just any forum that you chose to endorse," the letter to Hunt read."This is a youth forum with the slogan 'We Need To Talk' called for by a dictator who cannot stand any form of opposition or real criticism.He jails journalists for doing their jobs, youth for expressing their opinions, writers for writing fiction that violates 'public morality,' gays for coming out, supporters of LGBTQ for daring to support diversity, and he has blocked more than 400 different websites and media platforms."Egypt has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent under el-Sissi, a former general who led the military overthrow of his elected but divisive Islamist predecessor in 2013.Thousands have been imprisoned, with some rights advocates putting the number as high as 60,000.Activists and organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented enforced disappearances, widespread torture and a recent arrest campaign targeting people authorities believe are gay.The authorities have blocked hundreds of independent news and critical websites.El-Sissi denies that Egypt tortures or has any political prisoners, and maintains that human rights are only one among several pressing issues his government is addressing, such as improving the economy and providing stability.The forum, which lasts until Nov. 10, has been broadcast nearly all day long on state and private television since its opening ceremony Sunday night.It has been widely promoted with slick television ads in Egypt, where several major Western PR firms advise and work for the government.A giant billboard hovers over Cairo's Tahrir Square, epicenter of the youth-led 2011 uprising.Hunt, an Academy Award-winning actress who now directs films, delivered a speech Sunday in which she criticized the U.S. justice system for its high incarceration rates and voiced support for the online anti-sexual harassment movement #MeToo.That, however, did not deflect criticism from Seif and other Egyptian feminists."Unbelievable Hypocrisy!@Helenhunt speaks of "Women Rights" in a PR circus for a general who justified forced virginity tests," Seif tweeted, referring to the military's "virginity tests" conducted on a group of women protesters detained in 2011.El-Sissi, who was the chief of military intelligence at the time, was quoted then as saying the tests were necessary to head off possible allegations that the women were sexually assaulted by soldiers.Others accused Hunt, the most famous Western celebrity at the event, of selling out to el-Sissi, pointing out a string of websites that advertise her as a for-hire speaker with fees between $50,000 to $1 million.Hunt did not respond to a social media request to discuss her efforts in Egypt.El-Sissi delivered his opening address to the Youth Forum shortly after Hunt, and since then has spoken at length to the major televised panels each day, mainly emphasizing the country's war on terrorism.Follow Brian Rohan on Twitter at: www.twitter.com/brianrohan

Bono among figures named in leak of tax-haven documents:::::Leaked papers revealing investments in tax havens by the world's wealthy suggest U2 frontman Bono used a company based in low-tax Malta to buy part of a shopping mall in Lithuania.The Guardian newspaper said Monday that the "Paradise Papers" document trove, obtained by it and other news organizations, reveals that the singer was an investor in Maltese company Nude Estates, which bought the Ausra shopping center in 2007.Bono's spokeswoman told the paper that the rocker, whose real name is Paul Hewson, was a "passive minority investor in Nude Estates Malta Ltd., a company that was legally registered in Malta until it was voluntarily wound up in 2015."The Irish band, well known for its poverty-fighting efforts, has faced past criticism over its tax arrangements.U2 was heavily criticized in 2006 for moving its corporate base from Ireland to the Netherlands, where royalties on music incur virtually no tax.In 2011, protesters inflated a giant balloon reading "U Pay Tax 2?"during U2's set at the Glastonbury Festival.The Ausra shopping center is located in the town of Utena, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius.The 3,700 square-meter (40,000 square-foot) mall was built in 2006 and sold to unknown foreign investors in 2007.Its management has told reporters they were not aware Bono's involvement in the property's ownership.Tax officials in Lithuania said Monday they've started to investigate papers and documents belonging to UAB Nude Estates 2, a Lithuanian registered company owned by Nude Estates Malta Ltd. and listed as the mall's owner.Ruta Asadauskaite, spokeswoman for Lithuania's state tax inspectorate, declined to provide further details.Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, contributed to this story.
Colony Capital no longer in running to buy Weinstein Co.:::::Colony Capital, the firm run by President Donald Trumps close friend and confidant Tom Barrack, is no longer in the running to buy the Weinstein Co., a source familiar with the deal told ABC News.Colony never provided the Weinstein Co. with a cash infusion because it couldnt come to terms.Negotiations broke down, the source said, in part because of uncertainty over the role Harvey Weinstein will play in his namesake company.Mark J. Terrill/AP Photo Colony did not want a cash infusion to benefit Harvey Weinstein, who retains an ownership stake, the source said, adding that the Weinstein Co. resisted Colonys desire for a fund to compensate victims.This information follows the continued fallout for Weinstein as he was voted out of the Television Academy on Monday night amid swirling allegations of sexual misconduct."The Television Academys governance has voted to expel Harvey Weinstein from the academy for life," the organization told ABC News via statement."The academy supports those speaking out against harassment in all forms and stands behind those who have been affected by this issue ... We have been in contact with leaders across the industry and share with them a deep sense of responsibility to provide clear workplace benchmarks reflecting decency and respect."The statement from the organization that hosts the Emmy Awards added, "As a result, we are expediting an already-begun detailed review and revision of our Television Academy membership codes of conduct.We are determined to play a role in protecting all television professionals from predatory harassment, ensuring they are able to practice their craft in a safe environment.Steve Crisp/REUTERS Since the reports came flooding in early last month about Weinstein's alleged sexual harassment and, in some cases, sexual assault as claimed by dozens of women, the disgraced producer was also expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild.He was also fired from his company and his wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him.There are also open investigations into allegations of rape against Weinstein.New York City Police Department Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce said last week that there is not yet enough information to seek an arrest warrant, though "we have an actual case" and possibly probable cause to arrest Weinstein.Through his spokeswoman, Weinstein has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex."Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual," reads the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson."Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.Representatives for Harvey Weinstein and the Weinstein Co. did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.Colony declined to comment.ABC News' Sabina Ghebremedhin and Lesley Messer contributed to this report.

Harvey Weinstein hired elite intelligence agency to target accuser Rose McGowan, others: Source:::::Harvey Weinstein hired an elite private agency run by former intelligence officers to gather information on women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, and specifically targeted accuser Rose McGowan, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News.The use of the company -- called Black Cube -- was first reported by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker.Farrow appeared on "Good Morning America" Tuesday to discuss his latest New Yorker piece and what he calls "an international campaign" on behalf of Weinstein to keep his accusers from coming forward."This was elaborate and expensive," Farrow said."This was all conducted in secrecy ...I think the story makes it clear that they were focusing on everyone trying to get word out about this."A spokeswoman for Weinstein told The New Yorker about this new report, It is a fiction to suggest that any individuals were targeted or suppressed at any time.Farrow's latest piece alleges Weinstein hired multiple firms -- including Black Cube -- to gather information from the accusers and from reporters working on stories.The report claims that one Black Cube operative, whose real name was not used in the story, reached out to McGowan, posing as an activist launching an initiative to combat discrimination against women in the workplace.The story adds that the same investigator also contacted a reporter for New York magazine saying she had allegations against Weinstein to share.That reporter, Ben Wallace, told The New Yorker, the woman, using a different name than the one she used with McGowan, asked him about the status and scope of my inquiry, and about who I might be talking to, without giving me any meaningful help or information.Farrow said he used a photograph of this operative to conclude that McGowan and Wallace were talking about the same woman.The operative also allegedly emailed Farrow himself and New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor under an assumed name when they were working on Weinstein stories.Kantor was one of the reporters on the Times story back on Oct. 5, alleging Weinstein reached confidential settlements with some harassment accusers over several decades.Furthermore, a source familiar with the alleged investigative work done for Weinstein confirmed to ABC News that McGowan was specifically targeted and that Black Cube secured a part of the transcript of McGowan's upcoming memoir "Brave" through its undercover agent.McGowan has been outspoken on social media, accusing Weinstein of sexual assault.Black Cube was hired to find out about the people who were launching a campaign against Harvey Weinstein.Shareholders, partners, journalists and Rose McGowan," the source told ABC News.Black Cube ended the contract in July.A couple loose ends were tied up in August, but the contract ended in July.They felt that they could not help him anymore.This source information comes after an official statement to ABC News from Black Cube that did not admit to working with Weinstein, but did say they work on uncovering negative campaigns.However, the company had said it does not get involved in sexual harassment cases.It is Black Cubes policy to never discuss its clients with any third party, and to never confirm or deny any speculation made with regard to the companys work," the company said in a statement."Black Cube supports the work of many leading law firms around the world, especially in the U.S., gathering evidence for complex legal processes, involving commercial disputes, among them uncovering negative campaigns.The company does not get involved in family disputes or sexual harassment cases.It should be highlighted that Black Cube applies high moral standards to its work, and operates in full compliance with the law of any jurisdiction in which it operates -- strictly following the guidance and legal opinions provided by leading law firms from around the world.Since the first Times report on Weinstein in early October, dozens of women have made allegations of harassment and abuse against the former studio head in the New Yorker, on social media and in other media outlets.There have been serious repercussions after the allegations: Weinstein was terminated by his eponymous company, and he later resigned from its board; he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other organizations; and his wife, Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman, announced last month that she was leaving him.Additionally, he is under investigation by police in four jurisdictions -- New York City, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and London.Weinstein has denied "any allegations of nonconsensual sex" via his spokeswoman."Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual," according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson."Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.
Sia releases nude photo to foil possible paparazzi plot, she says:::::Sia doesnt often show her face, but she's showing off a whole lot more on Twitter.The star said that since there may be a plot to sell nude paparazzi photos of her, she decided to post one of the photos first.The photo, which appears to be a paparazzi-style photo that may have been taken without her knowledge, features her naked backside.Someone is apparently trying to sell naked photos of me to my fans, she captioned the shot.Save your money, here it is for free.Everyday is Christmas!The last line in her tweet is a reference to her new holiday album, which comes out November 17.The singer, 41, is famously private and often wears a wig to cover her face.Last year, the "Chandelier" singer said in an interview with "Good Morning America" that the look has allowed her to live more freely."It's for fun and for privacy," she said about her black-and-white hairpiece."I've been walking around New York this whole time.I don't need security detail.I don't need anything special.I just walk around and I can do that and that's a real luxury when you're in my industry."
Stranger Things cast respond to fan criticism and "gross" sexualisation:::::Image copyright Netflix Netflix's hit show Stranger Things returned last week, bringing back its cast of monster-fighting kids.They've had a lot of attention since the show started last year - not all of it welcome.A furore has erupted after some of the young stars were sexualised in the press and social media, while others have experienced the glare of fame in everyday life.As a result, one of the cast's older stars came out to defend them, asking the media and public to respect how young they are.Shannon Purser, who plays Barb in the series, responded to one Twitter user who criticised her co-star Finn Wolfhard after the 14-year-old failed to stop for photos outside his hotel and was branded "rude" by the user.In a number of tweets, she expressed how she too gets the same treatment from over-excited fans, but is better equipped to deal with it."I'm an adult.I can't imagine being inundated with all this attention at his age.It's intimidating," she wrote."So, from one big sister to the world, don't you dare make young actors feel guilty or indebted to you because they couldn't say hi."Image copyright Netflix Image caption Gaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin and Finn Wolfhard star in Stranger Things Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner also backed him up in a lengthy thread, writing: "It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first.Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe."Wolfhard, who plays Mike, hasn't responded to the comments about him greeting fans, but did have something to say about a flirtatious message from model Ali Michael.The 27-year-old said in an Instagram post that he should "contact her in four years", when he will be 18.He said in a video published by TMZ that being propositioned in that way was "nuts" and that he found Michael's comments "gross".The model later apologised, saying in a statement to Teen Vogue that it was "never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form".Purser's comments from the weekend sparked a wider debate about the show's young actors are portrayed.One of the show's teen stars, 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, has been listed as one of the reasons TV is "sexier than ever" by W magazine, among a group of much older actors including Nicole Kidman and James Franco.Brown, who plays Eleven, also had her pictures shared on social media, with users commenting on how much she had grown up and how old she looks.Mara Wilson, who starred in Matilda and began acting when she was five years old, gave her response to how young stars are treated.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
BBC sees 'spike' in sexual harassment complaints:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Not all cases are thought to relate to current BBC staff The BBC has said it is dealing with a "spike" in complaints of sexual harassment.The deputy director general told MPs there had been a recent increase in the number of cases after the BBC encouraged staff to come forward.Anne Bulford said the corporation is currently investigating 25 individuals for alleged sexual harassment.Last year only three cases were investigated, with just one case in each of the two years before that.In a statement, the BBC said: "Since the Harvey Weinstein revelations, we've been actively encouraging staff to come forward with any concerns."We hope other employers are doing the same, and when allegations are made, we have well-established processes to investigate."Image caption Director general Tony Hall said there is a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment Anne Bulford told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that the BBC is looking into "25 live cases".However, not all are thought to relate to current staff.A number of the allegations are believed to be historic, involving people who have worked for the BBC or for third parties associated with the BBC in the past.The deputy director general said: "We have to continue to encourage people to speak.Whether they're current or whether they're historic in relation to sexual harassment, the important thing is people come forward."Ms Bulford also confirmed that issues raised by staff working with independent production companies and third party suppliers would be supported by the BBC's confidential helpline, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.Director general Tony Hall commented: "As far as harassment, bullying and... sexual harassment goes, we should have zero tolerance.That means making it as easy as possible to do the very difficult thing of coming forwards and calling out behaviour."Asked how many staff were currently suspended pending an investigation into sexual harassment, the BBC responded: "We can't comment on individuals but treat any allegations seriously and have processes in place for investigating them."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

JAY Z sells $6 tickets to US gigs to cut out touts and resale rip-offs:::::Some tickets for JAY Z's concerts in America are being sold for as little as $6 (4.50) in a bid to cut out touts.It's led to some fans asking whether deals to see the 4:44 album tour on primary and resale sites are real.By charging more for VIP tickets and less for cheap seats, concert promoter Live Nation hopes to drive touts out because there are more available.It means secondary ticket sites and scalpers are left with lower priced tickets, often in the upper levels.The Weeknd, One Direction, Radiohead, Tool, U2 and Coldplay have all used similar strategies to try to cut out expensive resale tickets.However, it's unclear how the low prices will stop touts from buying up all the cheap tickets and selling them for more.Earlier this year, JAY Z signed a 10-year deal with Live Nation, which is reportedly worth $200m (155m)."Live Nation and I entered unchartered territory in 2008.Over nine years, we have travelled the world producing historic music experiences," JAY Z said in a statement at the time."For the next 10 years, we will continue redefining the live event landscape."There has been some confusion over the cheap tickets.Some believed JAY Z's gigs weren't selling well.However, Live Nation told US magazine Billboard, that just three dates in, the 4:44 tour was the rapper's highest grossing solo tour ever beating his 2013 Magna Carter concerts by up to 21%.A number of superstars have tried to counter the problem of tickets being sold for higher prices on resale websites.Taylor Swift was criticised for an anti-ticket tout scheme in the US, which required fans to earn "boosts" to improve their chances of getting tickets to her concerts.The boosts included posting about her on social media, watching her new video and buying her album or merchandise.A spokesperson says the singer wanted to "reward fans for being fans".Ed Sheeran used strict rules around entry to try to counter the problem.He asked fans to bring four forms of ID for his most recent UK tour.We've asked Live Nation whether they will be using the same strategy if JAY Z tours the UK but we haven't had a response yet.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Lindsey Stirling: The 'dubstep violinist' gets festive:::::Image copyright Cara Robbins Image caption Lindsey shot to fame in the US after appearing on America's Got Talent How early is it acceptable to start listening to Christmas music?Maybe you already are.Maybe, like us, you start hammering Christina Aguilera's classic 2000 album My Kind Of Christmas around July.No?Oh.Just us."I usually wait until mid-November," says the much more sensible Lindsey Stirling, who's just released her first Christmas album."Maybe early November, but that's as early as I'll go."The violinist is among a string (here all week etc.)of artists releasing Christmas albums this year - including Gwen Stefani, 98 Degrees, Hanson and Sia.But Lindsey has enlisted some friends to help out - and as a result her album, Warmer In The Winter, features guest vocals from the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Becky G. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sabrina Carpenter and Becky G sing on Warmer in the Winter "Christmas music was such an important part of our family.It brings all the feelings to life, whether you want to feel happy and jolly or spiritual, romantic or reminiscent," she says."I've never done so much homework for an album as I have for this one.I spent a solid week sitting on my couch listening to Christmas music, picking up my violin, and really finding the songs that created a nice emotional arc through the album, but also finding songs that I really enjoyed and had memories for me."Lindsey adds that she had to look for songs which "really sang on a violin, because not every melody sings as well on different instruments".The final set list of Warmer In The Winter includes 13 tracks - many of which are the classics you'd expect: Jingle Bell Rock, Silent Night, Let It Snow and a brilliantly jazzy rendition of You're A Mean One, Mr Grinch.The original songs include the super-catchy Christmas C'Mon and the title track - which features Trombone Shorty, who you can probably tell from his name alone is someone you need in your life.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trombone Shorty: Not actually that short This is Lindsey's fourth album since she shot to fame as a quarter-finalist on America's Got Talent in 2010.While she now says she "wouldn't change anything" about her musical journey, she adds that the series "was a really hard experience for me"."It almost caused me in a way to give up.I was so discouraged after that show.I thought it was going to be my big break and yet it didn't turn out how I wanted."I got off the show and nothing happened.I thought, 'Someone's gonna call, some record label, some producer's going to be interested', but nobody was.And I think that's because what I was doing was so different.I don't think anyone really knew what to do with it."It wasn't until half a year later that I discovered YouTube and started to explore that world, and that's what changed everything for me.It certainly did.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Modern Family's Sarah Hyland presented with Lindsey at 2014's Billboard Awards Lindsey's channel currently has nearly 10 million subscribers.Her most popular video to date, Chrystallize - which saw her style herself as the "dubstep violinist" - has notched up 181 million views.Who needs a sneezing panda."YouTube has done everything for me - I don't think I ever would've made it if I hadn't had it," Lindsey says."It was the perfect platform for me as an artist.I was having a hard time getting anyone to understand this art form, and then I found YouTube and I was so excited because I didn't have to wait for someone to believe in me, or a record label to invest in me.""I thought, 'I know how to edit video, I know how to create content, I was a film major in college' and I had lots of film friends so I started making these little music videos, putting them online and it was amazing for me, the reaction was very strong.And this time I was in my own court, I could direct them."Image copyright Getty Images Lindsey's career may now be going from strength to strength, but she hasn't shied away from speaking openly about her struggles along the way.In an article published in The Telegraph earlier this year, she explained how a habit of counting calories when she started university led to a battle with anorexia, which saw her drop to a "dangerously unhealthy" weight."When I first realised I had depression and anorexia, I felt like it was such a black mark," she tells the BBC."Like, how could I have these really horrible mental diseases?I just remember feeling so different suddenly to everybody else.Very hopeless."So my biggest message to anyone struggling is that it's actually very normal.Everybody goes through it, it's natural, I think to some degree every single person has to cope with and deal with it throughout their lives."It doesn't mean you're tainted or have a black mark on you or that you're never going to be happy ever again - it's quite the opposite, it's something everyone can work through."Image copyright Getty Images Warmer in the Winter by Lindsey Stirling is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Why George Orwell is returning to the BBC:::::Image copyright PA Image caption The George Orwell statue has been unveiled outside BBC New Broadcasting House The BBC headquarters in London has got a new resident: he's tall, bronze and likes a smoke.A statue of novelist George Orwell now adorns the exterior of New Broadcasting House, a few minutes from where Orwell worked as a radio producer during World War Two.But what was the author of Nineteen Eighty-Four doing in the BBC?And did he like it?For decades, its staff have delighted in the suggestion Orwell took his notion of absolute hell from two years spent at the BBC.Near the end of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Winston Smith finds himself trapped in the Ministry of Love's Room 101, "many metres underground".He must face the worst thing in the world (which turns out to be a rat).Since the book came out in 1949, some have suggested it was Orwell's comment on a similarly-numbered room at Broadcasting House, where he had to tolerate endless dull meetings.War work The idea appeals to writers trying to make sense of what seems an unlikely part of Orwell's career - his time on the BBC staff from August 1941 to November 1943.But Orwell didn't even work at Broadcasting House.When, aged 38, he became a talks assistant in the Overseas Empire Department and was based in premises, the BBC had moved into 55 Portland Place.Image copyright PA Image caption George Orwell worked at the BBC for two years After a year, he became a talks producer at the Overseas Eastern Service, working in a basement the wartime BBC had acquired from the gents clothing department at the store Peter Robinson.(Today he would be on Oxford Street, smack in the middle of Urban Outfitters or possibly Schuh.)Orwell was already a well-known journalist and novelist.But he wasn't world-famous, as he later became with Animal Farm (in 1945) and with Nineteen Eighty-Four.His biographer DJ Taylor believes Orwell was genuinely keen to join the corporation."His health was already shot to pieces and it became clear he would never be called up to fight in the war.I think he saw the BBC as a form of war work."Propaganda without lies Initially a lot of Orwell's time was spent writing a weekly news commentary aimed primarily at India, to be read on air by Indian members of the department.The typescripts were rediscovered and published in the 1980s.They're summaries of how the war was going and there was no pretence of being great literature.His news commentary 75 years ago this week, for instance, focused on events around El Alamein: "The Battle of Egypt has developed into a great victory for the United Nations.The Axis forces are not yet destroyed, but they are in great danger..." Taylor thinks Orwell was an energetic propagandist."It may seem strange because now we think of Orwell as the most truthful of writers.But he knew the war needed winning and that good propaganda would be a part of that.When later he grew disillusioned, which clearly he did, it was because he feared the propaganda simply wasn't effective.Image caption Sculptor Martin Jennings says Orwell "was the last person to be on a plinth" "He had no problem with the concept of propaganda for a cause which was morally right, so long as you didn't tell lies.But there is an irony that he was a propagandist for a regime at war with another regime - and in that surely we see the roots of Nineteen Eighty-Four."After about a year, those in charge seem to have decided that because Orwell was a known supporter of Indian independence it would go down well in India if his name became more associated with the broadcasts.Orwell's presence on air made the propaganda seem less like propaganda.He invited the likes of TS Eliot and EM Forster to broadcast to Asia and was permitted to go on air himself - although in January 1943 BBC mandarin JB Clark wrote a tart memo highly critical of Orwell's "unattractive" voice.A long line of documentary-makers have been aghast to find that somehow none of the programmes in which Orwell took part ever made it to the BBC archive.Simon Rooks, who runs that archive, says it's a disappointment but no surprise."In Orwell's time very few things were recorded: radio was essentially a live medium.But in the war the BBC started to broadcast far more to other parts of the world."And if you're broadcasting to India, which Orwell often was, some parts of the output have to be transmitted in the middle of the night.There would have been recordings to facilitate that.'Cabbage-patch hair' "But those functional recordings were on acetate discs: they only had a thin lacquer coating and could play a handful of times before wearing out.Recordings were sometimes transferred to more robust archive discs for permanent use.But very few overseas programmes were ever kept - and sadly nothing with George Orwell."Image caption George Orwell felt working for the BBC was doing his bit for the war effort Orwell died in 1950, aged 46, so the voice is one reference point which hasn't been available to Martin Jennings, who was commissioned to make the new sculpture.His John Betjeman and Philip Larkin were both much praised."I've been an admirer of Orwell for years so I suppose it's my knowledge of the writings which is the basis of the piece.I was delighted to be approached by Ben Whitaker who was behind the whole idea."(Whitaker, a human rights lawyer and former Labour MP, died in 2014.)"The BBC is donating a wonderful home, though the funding has all been from private donors.But when I knew where it was going, that had implications.It's standing against a particularly tall Portland stone wall and will be elevated on a plinth."But it seemed to me that Orwell was the last person to be on a plinth.So I have made him stoop rather to the viewer - so perhaps it's more that he's on a soapbox, engaging an audience."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm made him globally famous The location where Orwell is placed has been an unofficial smokers' corner ever since Broadcasting House was extended in 2013.So it's appropriate that Jennings' Orwell has a roll-up in one hand.He's also given the tall, gangling, slightly cadaverous writer ill-fitting clothes and cabbage-patch hair which he thinks were characteristic."But the placing also seemed to demand words on the wall behind Orwell: it would have seemed incomplete otherwise.In the end Ben Whitaker came up with the right choice."The quotation is from a proposed preface to Animal Farm, which was never used: "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear."Jennings says they're "an interesting and quite a challenging selection of words for a public service broadcaster".He says: "It's both Orwell talking to the political journalists of the BBC, and it's the BBC expressing what it stands for to the general public."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Paradise Papers: Bono linked to tax probe in Lithuania:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Bono, also known as Paul David Hewson, co-founded U2 in 1976 A Lithuanian shopping mall partly owned by U2's Bono is under investigation for potential tax avoidance, following a probe prompted by the Paradise Papers.The mall allegedly avoided paying 47,000 euros (41,500) in local taxes using an unlawful accounting technique.The company running the mall, in the city of Utena, denies any wrongdoing.The leaked documents show that Bono owned a stake in a Maltese holding company that bought the mall, via a Lithuanian holding company, in 2007.In a statement, the Irish entertainer and anti-poverty campaigner, also known as Paul David Hewson, said he had been "assured by those running the company that it is fully tax compliant".He emphasised that he had previously campaigned for more transparency surrounding the ownership of offshore companies, and was in favour of public registries.Earlier, a spokeswoman told reporters at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that Bono was a "passive, minority investor" in the Maltese entity, which was "voluntarily wound up in 2015".Paradise Papers - exposing the tax secrets of the ultra-rich In recent years, Bono, one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, has received international recognition for his social justice activism and philanthropy, even receiving an honorary knighthood from the Queen in 2007.In the wake of the Panama Papers leak, the ONE Campaign, a charitable organisation fronted by Bono, repeatedly called for more transparency on the ownership of "shell companies" and offshore trusts, and decried the effect of lost tax revenues on developing economies.Image copyright Lukas Balandis/15min.lt Image caption The mall in Utena at the centre of a tax probe Utena, which has a population of roughly 27,000, is a growing city in north-east Lithuania which has recently attracted tens of millions of dollars in foreign investment, mostly in the manufacturing sector.The 3,700-square-metre Ausra mall, which currently contains 20 food and clothing shops, was built by Eika, one of Lithuania's leading developers, and opened its doors in 2006.In April 2007, Eika announced it had sold the mall to an unnamed "foreign investor".The buyer was a Lithuanian company named UAB Nude Estates 2.Records uncovered by the Lithuanian journalist Sarunas Cerniauskas, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian show that the company was ultimately part-owned by Bono, via a series of companies in foreign jurisdictions.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption U2 toured this year to mark the 30th anniversary of their Joshua Tree album Between 2007 and 2012, the Lithuanian firm UAB Nude Estates 2 was owned by a similarly named Maltese company, Nude Estates Malta Ltd.Leaked registry documents reveal that the Maltese company was partly owned by Bono, along with two other businessmen.In 2012 ownership of the Lithuanian company was transferred to another offshore company, named Nude Estates I Ltd, this time in the British Crown dependency of Guernsey.In a written response to questions from the ICIJ, a spokeswoman for Bono, Kathy McKiernan, said the U2 frontman is currently "a passive, minority investor" in the Guernsey company, Nude Estates I, and had held a minority stake in Nude Estates Malta, which has since been wound down."Malta is a well established holding company jurisdiction within the EU," Ms McKiernan added.'Crude violation' The Lithuanian company that runs Ausra mall, Nude Estates 2, declared a loss of more than 3 million euros (2.6m) in 2010.According to analysis by tax expert Ruta Bilkstyte, the loss was achieved by a write-down of the company's fixed assets, the largest of which was the mall building itself.The company carried that loss forward until 2016, paying no tax despite posting profits for five of those six years.In a statement sent to news site 15min.lt, the Lithuanian tax office confirmed that Nude Estates 2 had not paid tax on its profits since at least 2011.Ms Bilkstyte, who was not told of Bono's connection to Nude Estates 2, estimated that the company likely avoided paying 47,000 euros in tax to date, and was set to avoid almost 400,000 euros (353,000) more.Image copyright fide.lt Image caption Lithuanian tax expert Ruta Bilkstyte This, in her view, amounted to a deliberate and "crude violation" of the tax code.After 15min.lt reporters brought Nude Estates 2's filings to the attention of the Lithuanian State Tax Inspectorate, the agency said it was launching an investigation into the company.A spokeswoman for the Inspectorate told the BBC it had "commenced control procedures", and that such an action was usually undertaken on the "evaluation of risk of tax breaches"."Taxpayers having offshore transactions more often score higher points of risk," she added.Sigitas Jautakis, the Lithuanian director of Nude Estates 2, said he was unaware of Bono's connection to the mall and denied his company had engaged in illegal activity.He added that if found to have underpaid tax, the company would make up the shortfall - but cautioned that the authorities "hadn't carried out any inspections or anything"."But they should, first of all, delve deeply into the entire situation," he said.Find out more about the words and phrases found in the Paradise Papers.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term Bono's statement in full: "I would be extremely distressed if, even as a passive minority investor in UAB2 in Lithuania, anything less than exemplary was done with my name anywhere near it."I've been assured by those running the company that it is fully tax compliant, but if that is not the case I want to know as much as the tax office does, and so I also welcome the audit they have said they will undertake."I take this stuff very seriously.I have campaigned for the beneficial ownership of offshore companies to be made transparent."Indeed, this is why my name is on documents rather than in a trust.The fact is I welcome this reporting.It shouldn't take leaks to understand what's going on where."There should be public registries so that the press and public can see what governments, like Guernsey, already know."The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including The Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only).Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Strictly: Aston's exit shocks fans but who's to blame?:::::Image caption Aston had enjoyed some of the highest scores of the series in previous weeks Strictly fans are calling it the biggest shock in the show's history following the exit of Aston Merrygold on Sunday's show.Aston landed a score of four from judge Craig Revel Horwood and found himself second bottom on the leaderboard with partner Janette Manrara.After the public vote, the pair ended up in the dance-off alongside Mollie King and partner AJ Pritchard.Head judge Shirley Ballas chose to save Mollie and AJ.Aston and Janette performed a Viennese waltz, while Mollie and AJ danced the foxtrot.Who's to blame?Despite the public vote being responsible for who ends up in the dance-off, fans took aim at Craig, Shirley and Janette for Aston's early demise.Former judge on the show, Alesha Dixon, was one of those fans.Shirley also came in for criticism, with some saying: "I reckon #ShirleyBallas may be finishing off the show for good!We need #Len AGAIN!"although others defended her, with one fan describing the head judge as "a class act."Image copyright PA Image caption Shirley replaced Len Goodman as head judge earlier this year Some pointed out that people couldn't moan if they hadn't bothered to vote.One fan questioned the "lousy choreography" of Aston and Janette's dance and the decision to do a "Viennese waltz in a Michael Jackson costume".But others laid the blame firmly at Aston's door.Strictly champion Harry Judd wrote that while a score of four from Craig was too low, Aston didn't do himself any favours.Gabby Logan empathised with Aston - she caused a stir when she was sent home from the show back in 2007 after a dance-off with Penny Lancaster.Aston himself has been upbeat about his exit, saying "life is great, I'm gutted obviously but...I'm not sad that it's over, I'm happy that it got to happen!"But BBC reporter Betty Redondo said: "There was a palpable shock among all the other contestants,".The official BBC Strictly Twitter account even posted: "Gone too soon", and ran clips of the other celebrity contestants, seemingly bewildered by the decision."I was crying my eyes out...I can't believe they're gone," said fellow contestant Debbie McGee.Alexandra Burke's dance partner Gorka Marquez admitted he was "heart-broken" to see the pair leave.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Meek Mill 'sentenced to two to four years in prison for probation violations':::::Rapper Meek Mill has been sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating his probation, according to US media reports.It's after he was jailed in 2008 on drug dealing and gun charges.He's been on probation ever since and was arrested in March after a fight in an airport and again in August for reckless driving, but both charges were dropped.However, a judge said both arrests were a breach of his probation.Prosecutors also provided evidence of failed drugs tests.Jay-Z, who's Roc Nation company represents Meek Mill, called his punishment "unjust and heavy handed".This isn't Meek Mill's first run in with the law.In 2015, his girlfriend at the time Nicki Minaj promised judge Genece Brinkley that she would keep him on the straight and narrow after lawyers argued that he changed his travel schedule without court approval and had missed a drug test.His imprisonment is a surprise.Lawyers had recommended that Meek Mill, whose real name is Robert Williams, not be imprisoned for the probation violations, noting he'd been off drugs since January and has complied with most requirements of probation, according to CBS.However, Judge Brinkley is reported to have said that she's been trying to help Meek Mill for 10 years but the rapper does what he wants.Meek Mill's lawyer says they'll appeal against the sentencing.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat

Fox News broke the UK's broadcasting rules:::::Image copyright PA Image caption The Manchester attack happened at an Ariana Grande concert Two Fox News broadcasts in the UK have been found in breach of Ofcom rules over impartiality.A January edition of the Hannity programme discussed US President Donald Trump's ban restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.Ofcom said the US-made show was largely pro-Trump and did not sufficiently reflect alternative viewpoints.Tucker Carlson Tonight was also found in breach for a broadcast in May following the Manchester terror attack.Regarding Hannity, Ofcom said they had taken into account "that Fox News is a US news channel, directed at US audiences, which is available in the UK.The people who watch it in the UK are aware that it is a US channel and their expectations are different."It is not a main source of news in the UK.However, we were also mindful that, in our view, this particular programme dealt with major matters relating to current public policy that, as well as being of international significance, were of particular relevance and significance to UK viewers."Ofcom said the Tucker Carlson Tonight episode accused various public bodies and individuals in the UK , including Prime Minister Theresa May, of "doing nothing to counter terrorism; stop radicalisation; protect citizens from terrorism; or protect 'thousands of underage girls' from rape and abuse".'Official lie' The programme also criticised public leaders, saying that "their inaction was motivated by political correctness; they valued how people saw them over the lives of children; and they were forcing an 'official lie' on citizens, which was 'totalitarian' and 'wicked'".Ofcom said there was no reflection of the views of the UK Government or any of the authorities or people criticised, "which we would have expected given the nature and amount of criticism of them in the programme".The media watchdog also noted that "the presenter (Carson) did not challenge the views of his contributors, instead, he reinforced their views".Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on 22 May.Fox News is a channel originating in the US which stopped broadcasting on Sky in the UK in August and surrendered its licence to Ofcom on 1 November.Sky said the decision to axe the channel was down to low audience figures.Ofcom said it was "appropriate" to publish its rulings against Fox News, even though it is no longer a licensed television service falling under its jurisdiction.The decision was not related to Fox's takeover bid for Sky, a source told the BBC.Culture secretary Karen Bradley has referred the bid to competition regulators, the CMA.21st Century Fox is offering 11.7bn for the 61% stake in Sky it does not already own.Critics of the merger, which gives 21st Century Fox access to Sky's 22 million customers in Europe, fear it will mean Rupert Murdoch has too much control of the UK media.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

H&M: How the high street wins the designers:::::Image copyright H&M Not many high street stores can boast huge queues, crashed websites and social media hysteria whenever they release a new collection.For H&M, this is something they have come to expect every time they drop a collection with one of the world's biggest fashion houses.It all started with Karl Lagerfeld's collaboration in 2004 and has grown to include the likes of Stella McCartney, Versace and Isabel Marant.Image copyright Uniqlo Image caption Uniqlo released their collection with J W Anderson in September Other high street stores have taken inspiration from the Swedish retailer's cross-over vision, including Uniqlo, which has released collaborations with the likes of J W Anderson and Jil Sanders.Topshop has also created sell-out designer ranges that have included Mary Katrantzou and Beyonce's brand Ivy Park.H&M's creative advisor Ann-Sofie Johansson tells the BBC that success lies in allowing the designers to let their true flair for design shine through."Designers see we can really pull the collections off, we really want their aesthetics and they are free to do what they want," she says."It is a true collaboration - we really do want their design and creativity."Image copyright H&M Image caption Erdem's H&M collaboration saw the designer create menswear items for the first time She oversaw the entire process of creating H&M's collection with Erdem, which showcases the designer's signature floral prints, lace detailing and classic tailoring.The clothing collection, which was accompanied by a Baz Luhrmann video campaign, has already sold out online and in most British stores."You can see we're working with Erdem as their aesthetic feels real," Johansson says."The collection is really strong, we wanted to be able to create timeless pieces you can keep in your wardrobe."Anger as items resold for inflated prices By Laura Lea, BBC News Image caption Erdem x H&M for sale on online marketplace Depop on Friday morning While a solid stream of shoppers celebrating their coveted purchases took to social media, others were expressing frustration that items from the latest collection were being resold, only hours after selling out in store.Hundreds of garments have appeared on second-hand marketplaces websites like eBay and Depop, with some put on sale for almost ten times the original retail price."Not fair!"cried one Twitter user, "it shouldn't be allowed," said another.A sequin dress - as worn by British model and fashion designer Alexa Chung - was one of the most popular pieces of the collection, on sale for 149.99.By Friday, however, there were numerous eBay listings advertising it for 500 and up to 1,100 on Depop.Another seller advertised a floral embroidered suit - originally sold in store for 199.98 - for 1,000.Shoppers in store were only allowed to buy one of each item, but could buy as many different items as they wanted.There is no law against people selling second-hand clothes as a private individual.But H&M said it "prefer(s) trading to take place in our stores or on our website".Erdem is run by Erdem Moralioglu, who was born in Canada and moved to London permanently in 1999 to work for Vivienne Westwood.Like Matthew Williamson and Balmain, Erdem was given the opportunity by H&M to branch out from womenswear into a men's collection for the first time.Johansson says this is one of the reasons why designers have agreed to collaborate, as it provides them with a fresh challenge."Erdem's inspiration [for the menswear collection] was feminine meets masculine," she says."He talked a lot about how his family had dressed and he looked at old pictures, so for him it was very personal."Image copyright H&M Perhaps the most obvious reason the collections do so well is because customers can get something created by their favourite designer, but for a fraction of the price.Johansson says designers have been able to create items they never normally would as part of the collaboration, like T-shirts, hoodies and pyjamas, which are sold at accessible prices.Other items, like dresses and coats, are sold at higher price points than usual for H&M but are still significantly cheaper than their catwalk counterparts."We give people the possibility to buy into a designer that they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise, and the designers like reaching out to more people than usual," Johansson says."Whether it's high end or high street, with really great fashion it doesn't matter where it comes from".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Models including Alessandra Ambrosio and Bella Hadid pose ahead of the Balmain x H&M launch party in October 2015 Perhaps H&M's most successful collaboration of all time was with Balmain, a French fashion house with Olivier Rousteing at the helm, in 2015.Balmain dresses are infamous in the celebrity world, known for their heavy embellishment and extreme attention to detail.The catwalk creations retail for tens of thousands, but H&M was able to reproduce them for a fraction of the price.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Models Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Jourdan Dunn fronted the marketing campaign, while Alexa Chung and Kylie Jenner turned out in the designs at the LA launch party Fans camped outside H&M stores overnight, with the UK flagship in Oxford Street having to close due to health and safety concerns.Johansson says the Balmain collection encapsulated everything H&M wanted to achieve with their designer collaborations."Balmain had so many followers on social media and the brand is expensive - this meant young admirers could buy into the collection and Rousteing thought that was great."Johansson says in the future she'd like to work with young designers and says the company's design award, which was won by British designer Richard Quinn earlier this year, provides a great platform for fresh talent.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Paradise Papers: Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'diverted £2m in offshore tax dodge':::::Three stars of hit BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys diverted more than 2m into an offshore tax-avoidance scheme, Paradise Papers documents show.Patrick Houlihan and Martin and Fiona Delany transferred their fees into companies in Mauritius and sent money back as loans.Similar tax avoidance schemes have been subject to investigation and challenges by HMRC in recent years.The actors have not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.Houlihan told the Irish Times he had joined the scheme after receiving professional advice without fully understanding it.Roy Lyness, who put the stars in touch with the advisers behind the set-up, was the accountant behind the similar tax avoidance scheme used by comedian Jimmy Carr.Paradise Papers - exposing the tax secrets of the ultra-rich Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Richard Bilton asks Mrs Browns Boys star Fiona Delany about the offshore scheme.The revelation in 2012 that Carr had used a Jersey-based tax shelter attracted criticism from then-Prime Minister David Cameron.It led to the comedian saying he had made "a terrible error of judgement".The leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby show how the three Mrs Brown's Boys stars put their fees from a production company owned by Brendan O'Carroll, the creator and star of the show and real-life father of Fiona Delany, in companies they controlled in Mauritius.Mr O'Carroll said neither he nor his companies have been involved in a tax avoidance scheme or structure and the actors' wages were paid into a UK company bank account.Mr O'Carroll's production company is registered at accountant Mr Lyness's office in Oldbury in the West Midlands.Mr Lyness said he was "bound by client confidentiality as well as duties under the Data Protection Act not to divulge confidential information concerning my clients' financial affairs".Worldwide hit Mr O'Carroll plays Irish matriarch Agnes Brown in Mrs Brown's Boys.Patrick Houlihan is one of the boys - Dermot.Fiona Delany stars as Mr Houlihan's nurse wife Maria, and her real-life husband, Mr Delany, stars as Trevor Brown, the youngest son.Image caption The show's creator, Brendan O'Carroll, stressed he had never been involved in a tax avoidance scheme or structure The sitcom started life as a radio show on RTE 2FM in the Irish Republic and became a worldwide hit after being turned into a TV series by the BBC and RTE in 2011.There is also a successful stage show which tours the world.A film, Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie, came out in 2014, and the show's Christmas specials are among the UK's top-viewed festive programmes.Investment advisers The Paradise Papers documents suggest the actors' fees from their work connected to Mrs Brown's Boys was sent offshore to avoid income tax and national insurance.Source document Image caption The leaked documents show the trail of money being transferred to the actors via Mauritius They show: Brendan O'Carroll's production company pays a UK-based company for the actors' work the UK company transfers the money to a trust set up in Mauritius by Appleby the actors were self-employed contractors for the trust, which took a 12.5% cut of their fees, before transferring the money into three companies in Mauritius the actors each had effective control over the companies they took on the role of investment advisers, "recommending" their earnings be sent back to their personal bank accounts in the form of loans the loans had been structured to avoid triggering rules brought in by the UK government to prevent similar schemes from operating - with the money paid into the accounts through a third party.Documents for the 2014-15 financial year show Martin Delany's offshore company received 448,095 and Fiona Delany's received 448,168.No figures are available for Paddy Houlihan, as his company's accounts for that period are not in the data.But a spreadsheet for the next financial year shows in December 2015 Mr Houlihan's company had assets of 696,349, Fiona Delany's 715,122, and Martin Delany's 725,030.Accelerated payment notices In official guidance issued in 2016, HMRC said it would investigate and challenge such practices."Scheme promoters will tell you that the payment is non-taxable because it's a loan, and doesn't count as income," it said."In reality, you don't pay the loan back, so it's no different to normal income and is taxable."So if you're using one of these schemes and being paid this way you're highly likely to be avoiding tax."Image caption Comedian Jimmy Carr's use of a tax avoidance scheme came to light in 2012 HMRC has the power to send people using these sorts of schemes "accelerated payment notices" - which require them to repay the tax immediately, while their case is investigated.Told of the type of scheme being used by the Mrs Brown's Boys stars, MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: "If it's not outside the actual rules it's certainly... way outside the spirit of the rules."She added: "A decade ago perhaps it wasn't so much in the public domain, but now I don't think anybody with any sense would be just taking the advice of a tax adviser without asking certain questions... That's just common sense... these people ought to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves whether it's really fair what they're doing."In a statement on the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby said it was a law firm which "advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business.We operate in jurisdictions which are regulated to the highest international standards".The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
Sir Paul McCartney: President Trump's resistance to climate change is madness:::::Sir Paul McCartney has criticised President Trump's attitude towards climate change, stating that some of his actions are "madness".He's accused the American leader of turning around "a lot of the advances that have been made" to help the environment.The former Beatle is continuing his long running vegetarianism campaign.In June, President Trump announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement to cut global emissions.He said one of the reasons was to seek a new deal that would not disadvantage US businesses.However, there have since been mixed messages from the US government over whether it would actually stay in the agreement.President Trump also once said the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese in order to make American manufacturing less competitive.Sir Paul, who rarely gives interviews, was speaking exclusively to Radio 1 Newsbeat about a new short film that looks at the impact animal agriculture has on the planet.He's encouraging people to go meat-free for one day a week, arguing that reducing the need to eat meat would help the environment.Warning: Third party videos may contain adverts "It's not the total solution, but it's part of the solution.A lot of people have been saying this for a long time but there's resistance."Particularly when you've got someone like Trump who says that it (climate change) is just a hoax."A lot of people like myself think that's just madness so it's maybe a good time now to try and focus people's attention and say 'look, forget about him we can do something'."A long-time vegetarian, Sir Paul says what started out as a "compassionate thing for animals" has now grown into an "environmental element".In 2016, a study found that global agricultural emissions must be slashed to prevent the planet warming by more than 2C over the next century.Following another recent climate change report, a spokesman for the White House said it supported "rigorous scientific analysis and debate" but added that the climate was "always changing".Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat

Meet Muna: The 'queer pop' band who caught Harry Styles's eye:::::Image copyright Sony Music Image caption Muna (L-R): Josette Maskin, Katie Gavin, Naomi McPherson Since September, pop band Muna have been setting the scene at Harry Styles's solo gigs.The trio, who identify themselves as a "queer band", were hand-picked by the singer after he fell in love with their debut album, About U, for its messages of inclusivity and acceptance (oh, and also the amazing, arms-aloft choruses).It's fair to say the band were stunned."It was funny," says guitarist Josette Maskin."I'd never really thought about Harry Styles too much - but the week he asked us to go on tour, we'd been listening to Sign Of The Times and spoken about him a lot."His vibe was in the oeuvre of our lives and then this happened.""The 'oeuvre of our lives??!'"cackles her bandmate, Naomi McPherson "Josette!"Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption Josette Maskin: "People have found solace in something we made.That's a crazy feeling to have, as an artist" When we speak, Muna are on a day off from Styles' tour, preparing for their own, Hallowe'en-themed, headline show at London's Heaven Nightclub.They're sparkling company, painting each others' nails black and decanting mini Mars bars into a plastic bag which, later that night, will be flung into the audience during a cover of Michael Jackson's Thriller."I love being an opening act," enthuses singer Katie Gavin, "but playing for our fans makes me feel like I'm getting recharged to carry our message to people who haven't heard us."The last two months have been an eye-opener for the band, who quickly came to appreciate the passion of Styles's fans."I had no idea how visceral this experience is for some of them," says Katie."They pass out, out of being overwhelmed by being in the same room as him.""I don't think we realised until we started that every night is a night thousands of people have been waiting for," adds Naomi."It's so cool for us to be part of that."Image copyright Sony Music Image caption The group have been compared to Haim and Fleetwood Mac - but they call themselves a "punk Wilson Phillips" Muna formed at the University of Southern California in 2013, bonding over their shared love of '80s funk-pop - Janet Jackson, Chaka Khan, Talking Heads, Prince.Coincidentally, their tutor at USC turned out to be Patrice Rushen - who had her own 80s hit with Forget-Me-Nots, and who inspired Prince to write I Wanna Be Your Lover."She's our mentor," says Josette."She has the funk.""She is the funk," corrects Katie.Rushen gave Muna a hand as they self-produced their first album - adding a bell part to the shimmering break-up song Winterbreak, for instance.But the group take a more political stance than the artists who inspired them.Recent single Crying On The Bathroom Floor deals with the psychological impact of abusive relationships, and how "survivors form strong attachments to their abusers".And their electrifying signature song, I Know A Place, is "about the rich LGBTQ history of turning bars and ballrooms into safe havens".Although it was written before the nightclub shootings in Orlando last year, it has taken on added resonance since.Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption Naomi McPherson: "We don't feel pressured to be anything other than exactly what we are" "It's interesting, because the song deals so much with imagination and hope - but there's a downside to that, which is not seeing these things coming, not being prepared when they happen," says Katie."But then, thank God we had a song for it, do you know what I mean?""Everything that's happened is so terrifying, but at least people have found some kind of solace in something we made," adds Josette.Performing on Jimmy Kimmel's US TV show this January, I Know A Place mutated again when Gavin added new lyrics addressing Donald Trump's travel ban."Even if our skin or Gods look different, I believe all human life is significant," she sang, as her bandmates muted their instruments."I throw my arms open wide in resistance.He's not my leader even if he's my president."It's since become a permanent fixture in the song and, surprisingly, the band haven't seen a backlash in their Twitter mentions."It was actually more positive than the crazy hate," says Katie."The only reaction that I had, other than being impressed and proud of Katie, was I saw someone had made it into a gif," Naomi laughs."I was like, 'We're a gif now!We've made it!'"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Katie Gavin: "We want to be somebody's favourite band" If you're thinking Muna's message is stronger than you'd normally expect at a Harry Styles gig, you'd be right.But the band think they were chosen for a purpose."He's using us as a way of saying something without actually saying it, which is actually very smart," says Naomi."We are so happy to be a queer band and invite our audience to explore queerness, and I think he's kind of the same," adds Katie."Having us on the tour was like an invitation."Meanwhile, the former One Direction singer has echoed Muna's politics in his own set.On the opening night in San Francisco, a fan threw a rainbow-coloured Pride flag onstage, which Styles has had wrapped around his microphone stand ever since.Playing in London last Sunday, the star told the audience: "Please feel free to be whatever it is you want to be in this room," and encouraged everyone to "find someone you don't know and embrace them".Image copyright Instagram / @harrystyles Image caption Fans have started bringing rainbow flags to all Styles' gigs Styles's fans have embraced Muna in a way they never expected.Their Twitter followers have doubled, and audiences have actually been paying attention to their songs."They're very open listeners," says Naomi."There's a lack of entitlement that I've seen, at least, as opposed to crowds in other places. ""It feels like the first time we're on tour.Everything's very intriguing and interesting," adds Katie."And there's so much bread in Europe!"laughs Josette."I've eaten more pastries this week than I have in the last two years combined."When the European leg of the tour ends next week, Muna will head back to LA to work on their second album."We want to make 'an album,'" says Josette."Even though no-one gives a stuff about albums any more.""Yeah, I don't know how much of a pipe dream it is to expect people to listen to an album any more," says Katie."I think we're romantics in that sense.Because we want to be somebody's favourite band.And, so far, people have been quite obliging."Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Teen Vogue: How will going online-only affect readers?:::::Image copyright Conde Nast Image caption Millie Bobby Brown (from Netflix's Stranger Things) was a recent cover star Clicks don't lie.And Teen Vogue gets a lot of them.A highly-successful website.Six million Facebook likes.A huge following on Snapchat.Three and a half million Twitter followers.There's no doubt Teen Vogue's digital game is strong.The quarterly print magazine, however, hasn't been having quite the same impact recently.So they're closing it.Parent company Conde Nast is planning to focus on Teen Vogue's digital content instead - which has been going from strength to strength.The brand has increased its political coverage and social activism in recent years while still delivering its entertainment, fashion and beauty content.Image copyright Conde Nast A visit to Teen Vogue's website gives you some idea about why the formula has been so successful.(Warning: Doing this can make you lose hours from your day).Its headlines are light and relatable, with many written in the first person."Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Just Cuddled in Coordinating Outfits.""Cats Can Get Acne Too and Now I Feel Less Alone.""Dove Cameron Freaked Out Over Pink Dressing as Her for Halloween and Honestly Same.""Louis Tomlinson Savagely Trolled Niall Horan and I Can't Stop Laughing."While the above headlines, all from this week, might make zero sense to anyone outside the target audience, they do a great job of making many of us go 'Ooh that sounds interesting' - *click*."They've got a fantastic product and content," says Sarah Penny, Fashion Monitor's head of content.Image copyright Conde Nast "For the demographic they are targeting, they really push the boundaries and provide something new that isn't just celebrity, fashion and beauty for teens."But, she adds: "They're also not ones to sit on the fence - you only have to look at any of their Trump commentary.""They really came into their own during the election and the fact that they provide accessible current affairs for a young audience is really pioneering and exciting for a teen magazine, which in turn is alluring for their target audience."This might explain the social media reaction to the news that the print magazine was closing: We contacted Teen Vogue, who stressed the growth and expansion of the digital brand, adding that they'll likely still do the occasional print special."Though the quarterly print editions will cease publishing on a regular schedule, we will explore re-imagined special issues timed to specific moments, as we do in social," a spokesman told BBC News."As audiences continue to evolve around content consumption, we will modernise and calibrate how, where and when we produce and distribute our content to be in sync with the cultural moments and platforms most important to our audiences."The closure of the print edition is likely to result in up to 80 job losses, according to Variety, and it's not the only changes Conde Nast announced this week.Some of their other titles like GQ, Allure and Glamour will drop from 12 to 11 print issues per year.Image copyright Conde Nast Image caption Glamour has also announced this month that it will be going online only Teen Vogue's move to an exclusively online product follows in the footsteps of the British version of Glamour, which did the same thing earlier this year."Conde Nast is doing all of a sudden and dramatically what most major magazine publishers have been doing steadily and quietly for the last 10 years - cutting their cost base to match their reduced revenues," says David Hepworth, whose magazine career has included editing Smash Hits and launching Just Seventeen, Q, Empire and Heat.But, he cautions: "There are very few cases of magazines going digital-only and managing to retain the lustre on their brand.Once you let paper go you're just another website.You're just more space junk floating around out there."(The term 'space junk' definitely isn't used enough these days is it.)Teen Vogue has seen its online operation grow under Philip Picardi, who joined as digital editorial director in 2015.Image copyright Reuters / Getty Image caption Katy Perry and Ariana Grande have both appeared on the cover of Teen Vogue "Because of the amount of attention we've received in the press and I think on social, we are looked at as a brand that is safe to pitch for, if you have a story that's not been told before," Picardi told Business of Fashion this month about the brand's digital success."Now we feel empowered to be more activist and be bolder about the statements that we're making and the stances that we're taking.And so that's a completely different ballpark to be playing in."And bolder they have been.Teen Vogue, as BoF points out, has been taking strong stances on politics, LGBTQ issues, the gender pay gap and birth control.Pretty good for a publication that was once dismissed has having little to offer beyond mascara reviews.But while its digital operation is growing, Hepworth thinks Conde Nast may end up regretting closing the physical edition."All this talk about migrating from print to digital ignores the monetary facts," he says."Unless you've come up with a fundamentally different way of doing business - and the fact that this announcement comes so suddenly suggests Conde Nast haven't and are just hoping - you're exchanging pounds for pennies.Image copyright Conde Nast Image caption Teen Vogue's content has become much more political in recent years "If you give something away, the only revenue you make is from advertising and the value of online advertising has been falling for years."He advises Teen Vogue readers: "Remember, if you pay for something, you're the customer.If you get something for free you're the product."Penny thinks, though, that there was only so much money that could be made from print anyway, and points out the decline in physical sales of magazines in general."Print is a very difficult medium to sustain, particularly within this Generation-Z readership," she says."They're really the first demographic to have grown up with a digital presence from birth so naturally have an incredibly strong affinity with online consumption -

Mabel: 'I wrote a hit song on my way to the gym':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mabel performs Finders Keepers on Sounds Like Friday Night A couple of months ago, R&B singer Mabel was trying to kill time while she waited to go to the gym."I'd booked some dumb exercise class at eight o'clock and it was six - so my brother was like, 'Just get on the piano and see what happens.'"Forty-five minutes later, the 21-year-old had written Finders Keepers, a song that's now firmly lodged in the Top 10."It's amazing," she tells the BBC."I just wanted to make something fun for me and my friends."Mabel has been making waves since 2015, when she released the slinky, sensual Know Me Better, with its seductive refrain: "I could go all day wearing nothing but your kiss".But she's been around music all her life.Her parents are hip-hop legend Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey.Born in the mountains of Malaga, she was raised between Spain, London and Stockholm, learning piano at the age of five and choreographing routines to Destiny's Child with her sister.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mabel said she was initially intimidated by her mother's musical success She's no stranger to the recording studio either, accompanying McVey when he produced the Sugababes' debut album, One Touch, in 2000.At the tender age of four, she managed to sleep through the whole thing."Do you know what?It's still a problem!"she laughs."The vibrations of the bass make me so cosy.The other day I had a blanket in the studio and my brother was like, 'You need to move.You're not writing, you're napping!'"The habit has earned her the nickname Lil' Bassy - and it's not just confined to the studio."It's concerts as well!"she says."If I put earplugs in, the muffled sound of a gig gets me."Not at my own shows though," she clarifies."[There's] no sleeping if I'm on stage."Image copyright Polydor Records Image caption Mabel is currently working on her debut album Given her background, Mabel's success might seem like a fait accompli.But for a long time, she avoided making music."I felt quite embarrassed by being my mum and dad's daughter," she once said."I thought, 'People will never take me seriously.'"She eventually overcame that fear and enrolled to study production and music theory in Stockholm.After graduating she moved to London.There she was cast for a photo shoot in i-D magazine.That caught the attention of Skepta, who put her in his video for Shutdown.Mabel's hip-hop tinged debut, Know Me Better, went viral soon afterwards, propelling Mabel onto the BBC's Sound of 2016 list.'These things take time' But she's purposefully taken her time, touring with Years & Years and crafting an impressive catalogue of singles."These things take time," she says, noting that new artists need longer to nurture an audience in the slow-burn streaming era."It's more like America, where sometimes it takes years to break a record."This is especially true of Finders Keepers, which first came out in March and later featured on Mabel's Bedroom EP - a 21st take on the '90s R&B of Brandy and Aaliyah.Lyrically, the EP discusses control within relationships - "how one minute you can be in the driving seat, then that flips and you're very much out of control."It's also about balancing out the male-dominated narrative of R&B - which is where Finders Keepers comes in."There's so many R&B songs where guys are talking about a clingy girl, like: 'I don't want a girlfriend and this girl's so clingy and blah blah blah.'"But I'm a woman and I've been in situations that have been the reverse of that, so I wanted to tell that story."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mabel has toured with pop group Years & Years and Skepta's grime collective Boy Better Know Finders Keepers stands out even more because it's Mabel's first uptempo track."I really struggled with it before," she says."I'm really good at the '90s slow jams.I've got that down.But I love to dance, so why wouldn't I make something I could dance to?"The song's success, she says, "surpassed everyone's expectations and every other song I've ever done" - and it spurred her to write more in the same vein."I have like Finders Keepers fever now!"the singer says."Sometimes I go in the studio and I'm like, 'That worked so well, and I wrote it in 45 minutes so if I try wearing the same outfit and playing on the same piano it'll happen again.'"But you know what?That's why I love music - because I'm such a control freak and it's the only thing that I can't really control."It's like magic."Mabel's Bedroom EP and her Ivy To Roses mixtape are out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Toyah Willcox: 'I'd rather have been a 70s punk than be young today':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Toyah Willcox is known for her chart hits and acting roles After playing a member of the anarchic and murderous girl gang in the 1978 punk film Jubilee, actress and singer Toyah Willcox is revisiting the story in its first stage version.Is she still punk, 40 years on?"I can't live in a world of dullards," Toyah says."So I think on that level, I'm definitely punk."Toyah, who forged an acting career while also making her name as a pop star, is still rebelling against the expectations of society - in her own way."For me, it's non-conformist," she says."I'm just not interested in the norm.The only example I can give you is I can't go to a hairdresser and talk about holidays.I just don't live in that world.It's not me."Being punk means something different in 2017 compared with 1977.But the world's a different place now, and Toyah is almost 60.As a 19-year-old, she played the orange-haired pyromaniac Mad in the original Jubilee.She's not returning to that role on stage - this time, she's playing Queen Elizabeth I, who travels forward 400 years to find her country falling apart.Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption Toyah in rehearsals for Jubilee at the Royal Exchange theatre In the film, the semi-fictional Britain the queen visited was terrorised by punks who had overthrown the establishment and who revelled in murder and mayhem.It has been brought up to date for the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester, with the mob now made up of gloriously outrageous modern youths who are at various points on the gender spectrum.While the world may be a different place, as another generation simmers with anger and resentment at the hand they've been dealt by the establishment, some things have stayed the same.In the 70s, Toyah was pushing against being "gender specific, which I certainly wasn't back then," she recalls."I had no interest in people telling me to be feminine, to be ladylike, to wear dresses - it just made me rebel completely."But in comparison to today, it was quite an innocent rebellion.Punk 40 years ago was rebelling against conservatism - well, wham, bam, here we are again."Image caption Toyah on Top of the Pops in 1981 During rehearsals, Toyah says she's been given a steep lesson by her fellow cast members in what it's like to be young today.She's decided things are more difficult and complicated in many ways."If I was given the choice to be 20 now, I would say, no, I'm happy with where I am.And having experienced that incredible revolution, it felt like a really successful participating revolution," she says."People today are fighting for their space on social media all the time.I just find social media such a robotic experience, whereas punk was right in your face."Society is more fractured, too, meaning it's harder for cultural movements like punk to take hold.Whatever else it was responsible for, punk gave artists like Toyah a living through music and acting."There were people who wanted to come and see us perform in their 10s of thousands," she says."We didn't starve."Whereas I'm seeing for the first time in this generation the potential for well-educated people to starve, and my eyes are wide open about this and I'm finding it very frightening."Image caption Director Derek Jarman gave up his fee so Toyah could be in the film Toyah got the role in the original Jubilee after being introduced to director Derek Jarman by Chariots of Fire actor Ian Charleson, with whom she had acted at the National Theatre.Going to Jarman's flat in Earls Court for the first time was an eye-opening experience."A naked man called Yves, his French boyfriend, answered the door," she recalls."Yves was the most extraordinarily languid, relaxed human being, who would drape himself over furniture completely naked.Two more naked men were in the kitchen cooking."Derek ushered us into a lounge and we sat on the sofa and we had tea and cake."Soon after offering her the role of Mad, Jarman faced funding problems and cut her character to save money.But he later reinstated her, instead deciding not to pay himself."So he gave up his fee," Toyah explains."He said, 'I could just tell I'd removed the earth from under your feet.'That was it.We were in love."The film caused controversy when it came out in 1978 - mainly among punks themselves.Image caption Toyah also narrated the opening and closing lines of Teletubbies It prompted Vivienne Westwood to write an open letter to Jarman on a T-shirt, describing it as "the most boring and therefore disgusting film I had ever seen".When Jubilee came to be shown on Channel 4 eight years later, there was outrage that it was being beamed into millions of homes.The outraged included Winston Churchill's grandson, also called Winston and also an MP, who wrote to The Times to complain about this "corrosively vicious trash".Now, the stage version has its own controversy.Lines describing Moors Murderer Myra Hindley as "a true artist" and a "hero" - which were in the film - have been cut from the theatre script for fear of offending the audience in Manchester, where Hindley and Ian Brady preyed on children.Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption Rose Wardlaw plays Crabs in the new version of Jubilee The original film set out to shock and offend, as did many punks themselves.But Toyah says they came to realise they had taken some things too far."This is what punk was about at this time - it was about shocking," she says."And I think as punk grew, it intellectually grew as well, and it examined its roots."You can find pictures anywhere of punks in swastikas.We very quickly as a unified group policed that, because we knew the history was wrong."With much of the film's sex and violence intact, the play is still hoping to shock - and to prove that punk lives on in 2017.Jubilee runs at the Royal Exchange until 18 November and then at the Lyric, Hammersmith, from 15 February to 10 March 2018.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
How I threw away a work of modern art:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A work by French street artist Invader on display at an exhibition in Los Angeles To me, it looked like a child's crude attempt at a mosaic.About a dozen small square tiles of different colours.Glued to the wall in a geometric design vaguely resembling a face with two square eyes.It stood out in the otherwise empty and dingy Paris flat.Once my home, I was moving back in, after nearly 20 years away.My tenants, three young single men, were showing me round before they left."What's that?"I asked, pointing at the cluster of tiles."That's by Invader," my tenant replied."He's a street artist.He's like a French Banksy."I quite liked Banksy, but the young man must have seen that I didn't appear overly impressed by his French counterpart."You must leave this," he said earnestly."One day it will be worth a lot of money."Image copyright Alamy Image caption The tiled pieces such as this one in London are inspired by the 1978 video game Space Invaders Being British, I nodded politely - but inwardly I chortled at the notion that a few tiles stuck on a bedroom wall could ever be considered a work of art.Trying to prove I wasn't too old to get it, I said: "It reminds me of something."After struggling for a few seconds to recall exactly what, I exclaimed triumphantly: "Tetris!"Now it was his turn to look dubious, so I explained: "You know, the video game from the 80s.""Not Tetris," he said, mock-patiently."Space Invaders.The mother of modern video games."He added: "The artist came to one of our parties and ended up staying a few months.It was his way of saying thank you.Now we're leaving it for you."Read more about Invader My neighbours had complained over the years - with varying degrees of indignation and perhaps envy - that the three young men had thrown raucous parties nearly every weekend.The flat was such a wreck that my tenant admitted that, when he was working during the week as an up-and-coming executive, he stayed at his girlfriend's.Now he was getting married, while I was about to transform the bachelor party pad back into a respectable bourgeois home.The wall was stripped, replastered and painted a tasteful shade of blanc cass I duly promised the young men that I would look after the artwork and thanked them for leaving it.But then the builders came to replaster and repaint the room."I might leave that," I told them.They looked at me sceptically."Why do you want to keep it?It will look strange," the painter said.I hesitated, but only for a moment.The wall was stripped, replastered and painted a tasteful shade of blanc cass - off-white, far more aesthetically pleasing than a bunch of multicoloured tiles.That was nine years ago, when I was moving back to France.Find out more From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, get the podcast or listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST As the years passed, I noticed more of the Space Invaders mosaics on buildings around Paris.Never did I feel a twinge of regret for destroying the one in my flat.Then, two years ago, it began to dawn on me what I'd done.I reported on how one of the distinctive mosaics of the French street artist known as Invader was about to be displayed - on board the International Space Station.The European Space Agency said it would - in their words - highlight the bridges between art and space.It was bigger, but otherwise similar to the one I'd unceremoniously stripped out of my flat.Image copyright ESA/NASA Image caption Artwork by Invader has turned up on the International Space Station and European Space Agency ground installations Invader was a global phenomenon, famous in New York, Hong Kong, London, and of course Paris.Then came the real blow.To my horror, I learned that one of his works had sold for more than 200,000 (178,000; $233,000).The mosaics I'd once scoffed at are now so sought-after that thieves posing as municipal workers in high-visibility vests went around Paris this summer carefully removing them.Theft and vandalism have always been problems for Invader, a graduate of the Paris School of Fine Arts who was born in 1969, the year man landed on the Moon.But there's a fightback: fans known as "reactivators" photograph his works and reconstruct those that get damaged or disappear.Had I taken a picture of the one in my flat, I could have called in the reactivators.Now, I'll just have to live with the fact that I tossed out a valuable work of art because I preferred a smooth, blank, white wall.Perhaps I could try to market a piece of that as a work of art.But hold on a minute - hasn't someone already come up with that concept?
Meet the singer Taylor Swift calls 'little sis':::::Image copyright Sony Music / Black River Image caption Kelsea Ballerini: "I grew up on a farm in Eastern Tennessee and country is where my roots are" Earlier this year, Kelsea Ballerini got to go to the Grammys for the first time.The 24-year-old was up for best new artist, and scheduled to perform with Lukas Graham - but she was still a little star-struck."My mum was my date - and we were both sitting there fan-girling like, 'Oh my God, that's Adele!Don't look!Don't look!'"Ballerini, it turns out, is not the sort of person who keeps her cool when she meets an idol."The first time I met Carrie Underwood was at the Opry, before I had a record deal," she recalls."I was waiting backstage with a bunch of people to say hello and finally it was my turn."I was going to say something normal - but then I saw her and went "Girl!You got so much sooouul!"."Of all the things I could have said, that's what I chose," she grimaces."It was very weird."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The singer promised her mum, Carla, she'd take her to the Grammys when she was 13 years old Awkward celebrity encounters aside, Ballerini has been living in a fairytale for the last few years.She released her debut album, The First Time, in 2015 and watched its first three singles go to number one on Billboard's country airplay chart - an historic achievement for a female artist.The bubbly, vivacious melodies and autobiographical lyrics of Love Me Like You Mean It and Peter Pan won comparisons to Taylor Swift, who quickly befriended the artist (she calls Ballerini her "little sis") and invited her onto her 1989 world tour.That led to her Grammy appearance and, at next week's Country Music Association Awards, a nomination for female artist of the year.All told, it's turned out pretty well for someone who was shunned by the establishment when she first arrived in Nashville."I could not get into a room with a hit writer to save my life," she recalls of making her first album."I was a new girl, on an independent label and those were two strikes against me.No-one would write with me."It turned out to be a blessing.Left to her own devices, Ballerini, whose first concert was Britney Spears, channelled her love of pop and R&B into the album, giving her songs a vitality and immediacy that's sometimes missing from traditional country.The star's co-producer, Forest Glen Whitehead, even refers to her as a "country Beyonce"."I grew up on a farm in Eastern Tennessee and country is where my roots are," explains the singer, "but I listen to rap and I listen to R&B and I love pop."I've always been open about that because, as a songwriter, I always want to make sure that I'm trying new things."Image copyright Sony Music / Black River Image caption The singer moved to Nashville aged 15 with her mother but struggled to be accepted by the country music establishment Despite the strength of her singles, Ballerini still faced an uphill struggle in the insular world of country.Her debut came out in the midst of what's been called "tomato-gate", where radio consultant Keith Hill advised stations not to play too many songs by women and not to play two women back to back."If you want to make ratings in country radio, take females out," he told trade publication Country Radio Aircheck."They're just not the lettuce in our salad.The lettuce is Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton, Keith Urban and artists like that.The tomatoes of our salad are the females."Like many others, Ballerini was perplexed by his comments."When you think of country music history obviously you have George Jones, Garth Brooks, George Strait - all these iconic males.But you cannot talk about the history of country music without Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Shania Twain.I mean some of the biggest artists in country music history are female."In the end, she thinks, the uproar over Hill's comments helped her cause."Love Me Like You Mean It was in the top five when tomato-gate came out - and I think radio stations went, 'Well, watch this!'and helped me get to number one."Image copyright Getty Images But how do you follow up such a successful debut?With great difficulty, says Ballerini."I didn't know how to make my second record for a long time."The first one worked so well that I was like, 'How do I make that record again?'And then I realised I can't.That's not who I am any more."The answer was simple: Write an album about the person she's become - and luckily Ballerini had a lot of material to draw on.No more love songs?Unapologetically, released this Friday, is the chronological story of the last two years, as the singer left behind a "gross break-up" and got engaged to fellow country singer Morgan Evans.One of the first tracks is Miss Me More, a slinky stomp in which the singer describes how her ex-boyfriend slowly eroded her identity."I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it," she sings."I didn't wear my high heel shoes / 'Cause I couldn't be taller than you.""In a lot of young relationships, you fall in love for the first time and you give every part of yourself to make it work," she explains."But sometimes, when it's not treated right, that's how you lose yourself."I think it's really a beautiful moment when you get to the other side, and you're looking in the mirror and you're like, 'Huh, I thought I was going to miss him but - actually - I miss me!'"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ballerini will duet with Reba McIntyre at next week's CMA Awards Ballerini says she found it easier to write those "super dark" lyrics than the love songs that close the album.In fact, she's so bad at the soppy stuff that she came up with a track called I Hate Love Songs.A pastiche of saccharine 1950s doo-wop hits, it opens with the lyric: "I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting.""Do I really hate Ryan Gosling?Lord no!"she screeches."He's a beautiful man!"But I love that song.It talks about that heart and head battle.I don't want to be a cliched person in love; but I kind of am turning into that."Then the next song [on the album] is Unapologetically, where it's finally like I'm fully in love.I love the tension of those two together."With its pop leanings and infectiously catchy choruses, Unapologetically looks destined to bring Ballerini to a wider audience - and the UK in particular.Lead single Legends has been playlisted by BBC Radio 2, while the singer is booked to play the Country to Country festival in London and Glasgow next March.She'll also perform a duet with country legend Reba McIntyre ("it's going to be so cool") at the CMA Awards, which will be screened later in the month on BBC Four.Just don't expect Ballerini to stop being star-struck as her own star rises."I still freak out when I'm around Carrie Underwood," she laughs, "and now I see her all the time."Unapologetically is released on Friday, 3 November.Highlights of the CMA Awards will be broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on Sunday, 11 November and later in the month on BBC Four.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Is this what real beauty looks like?:::::Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Mihaela took these photographs in Kathmandu in Nepal (left) and Reykjavik, Iceland "Go to Google Images right now," says photographer Mihaela Noroc, "and search 'beautiful women'."I do as she tells me.Millions of results come back."What do you see?"she asks."Very sexualised images, right?"Yes.Many of the women in the top pictures are wearing high heels and revealing clothes, and most fit into the same physical mould - young, slim, blonde, perfect skin."So beauty all the time is like that," Mihaela says."Objectifying women, treating them in a very sexualised way, which is unfortunate.Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption L-R: Portraits taken in Germany, Italy and France "Women are not like that.We have our stories, our struggles, our power, but we just need to be represented, because young women, they see only images like this every day, so they need to have more confidence that they can look the way they look and be considered beautiful."But," she adds, "Google is us, because we are all influencing these images."Mihaela has just released her first photography book, Atlas of Beauty, which features 500 of her own portraits of women.Image copyright Mihaela Noroc, India Image caption Pushkar, India: "I was happy to see women have joined public forces all over the world" Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Mihaela took these photographs in Colombia (left) and Milan, Italy The Romanian photographer's definition of beauty, however, appears to be that there is no definition.The women are a variety of ages, professions and backgrounds."People are interested in my pictures because they portray people around us, everyday people around the street," Mihaela explains."Usually when we talk about beauty and women, we have this very high, unachievable way of portraying them."So my pictures are very natural and simple.And this is, weirdly, a surprise.Because usually we are not seen like that."Each of the book's 500 portraits has a caption with information about where it was taken, and, in many cases, the subject.The locations are varied, to put it mildly.They include Nepal, Tibet, Ethiopia, Italy, North Korea, Germany, Mexico, India, Afghanistan, the UK, the US, and the Amazon rainforest.Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Sisters Abby and Angela were photographed in New York Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Captain Berenice Torres is a helicopter pilot for the Mexican Federal Police Some locations, however, proved more problematic than others."I approach women I want to photograph on the street.I explain what my project is about.Sometimes I get yes as an answer, sometimes I get no, that really depends on the country I'm in," she explains."When you go to a more conservative society, a woman is going to have a lot of pressure from society to be a certain way, and her day-to-day life is carefully watched by somebody else."So she's not going to accept being photographed very easily, maybe she's going to need permission from the male part of her family.Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption A guide at a military museum in Pyongyang, North Korea Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Mihaela met Pinar, a Turkish Cypriot actress, in Istanbul "In other parts of the world they are extremely careful because there might be issues concerning their safety, like in Colombia.Because they had Pablo Escobar and the mafia for so many years."So they say 'OK, so you're going to take my picture but I'm probably going to be kidnapped after that because you're part of the mafia and you're not who you're saying you are'."She adds: "If somebody were to start this project just with men, it would be much easier, because they don't have to ask permission from their wives, sisters or mothers."Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Left: Pokhara, Nepal.Right: "This is what shopping looks like for many people around the world," Mihaela says of her portrait taken in Nampan, Myanmar Mihaela says she occasionally puts pictures through Photoshop, but not for the reasons you might think."When you take a picture, it's usually raw, and that means it's very blank, like a painting, you don't have the colours you had in the reality."So I try to make it as vibrant and colourful as it was in the original place.But I'm not making anyone skinnier or anything like that, never, because that's very painful."Because I also suffered as a woman growing up from all kinds of difficulties, I wanted to be skinnier, look a certain way, and that was also related to the fake images I saw in day-to-day life."Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Idomeni Refugee Camp, Greece: This woman and her daughters fled the war in Syria It's safe to say Mihaela's photography book is quite different tonally to, say, Kim Kardashian's 2015 book of selfies."These days, the bloggers, the famous people of our planet have set this unachievable and fake beauty standard, and it's very difficult for us as women to relate to that," she says."Kim Kardashian has 100 million followers on her Instagram page and I have 200,000, so imagine the difference - it's astonishing.But slowly, slowly, I think the message of natural and simple beauty will be spread around the world."Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption L-R: Portraits taken at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Omo Valley in Ethiopia and Delphi, Greece So what's the best piece of advice Mihaela could give to anyone keen to get into photography?Buy a good quality camera?Learn about lenses and angles?Not exactly."Buy good shoes," she laughs, "because you're going to walk and explore a lot."Image copyright Mihaela Noroc Image caption Lisa was backpacking through Berlin when Mihaela met her Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
