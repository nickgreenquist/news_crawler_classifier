Trump's surprise trip to DMZ canceled due to bad weather:::::In a surprise attempt to visit the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea, President Trump was turned away early Wednesday after fog rolled through the area.Trump, who is currently overseas as part of a trip meeting leaders across Asia, was not scheduled to visit the DMZ amid heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear program.However, the White House press pool was summoned earlier than originally scheduled and told by press secretary Sarah Sanders they were going to the border between the North and South.This is where were going, Sanders said, as she held up a sheet of paper that had a handwritten DMZ on it.She told the press that was how she had been instructed to tell them where they were going.Once there, a bad weather call by the U.S. Secret Service and the military stopped Trump -- who was flying on Marine One -- from visiting the border due to safety reasons.South Korean President Moon Jae-in had already landed about a 20-minute drive away from the DMZ.Sanders said the president was disappointed he couldn't make the trip -- and "pretty frustrated."Sanders said Wednesdays trip was planned before Trump left Washington, D.C., despite a confirmation from a senior administration official late last month that there wouldnt be enough time for Trump to visit the DMZ.A White House official had also said DMZ visits have become "a little bit of a clich."Every president but one since Ronald Reagan has visited the DMZ.Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, visited during a 2012 trip to Seoul and told troops stationed at the border that "the contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity."TRUMP'S ASIA TRIP: STOPS IN JAPAN, CHINA AND BEYOND Trump, along with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, visited military base Camp Humphreys on Tuesday, roughly 40 miles south of Seoul.His trip comes amid escalating rhetoric and taunts against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the country's nuclear program.Fox News' Serafin Gomez, John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
DNC chair Perez vows to unite party in wake of Donna Brazile allegations:::::Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier" on Tuesday that voters "want to move forward" from the allegations in former DNC boss Donna Brazile's new tell-all, vowing to unite the party."Im working hard to make sure we build a party that works for everyone, that unites everyone and weve seen the party coming together in places like Virginia," Perez told Baier as polls closed in the commonwealth's gubernatorial race.Brazile's book included allegations that the DNC had struck a deal with Hillary Clinton's campaign giving it partial control over the party's financial resources.Brazile implied that the agreement gave Clinton a major advantage over Bernie Sanders and other candidates in last year's primary race, though she has since denied claims by Sanders supporters that the primary was rigged against the Vermont democratic socialist."[I] havent gotten one question about Donna Brazile," Perez said Tuesday."What Ive gotten from voters is unity.They want to move forward ... As for me at the DNC, Im all about making sure we do everything, every day to earn the trust of our voters."Perez also defended the DNC's financial relationship with Fusion GPS, the firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele to produce the now-infamous "dossier" of Trump's alleged ties to Russian officials."As I understand it, youre doing opposition research in the course of a presidential campaign," he said."We had a law firm doing that research ... the DNC and the Clinton campaign were paying for that research and as part of that research, they obtained this information.""If youre not doing opposition research in a presidential campaign, youre committing malpractice, especially when youre talking about Donald Trump who had a lot of very, very irregular ties in Russia," the DNC head added."And because he wouldnt release his tax returns or business records, we had to do what we had to do."
Fusion GPS official met with Russian operative before and after Trump Jr. sit-down:::::The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trumps son, Fox News has learned.The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clintons campaign paid for that research.Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBIs investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign making Fusions 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period.At that time, Fox News has learned that bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom, a confidential source told Fox News.Court records reviewed by Fox News, email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pairs presence together.The source told Fox News they also were together after the Trump Tower meeting."What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington."- Marc Thiessen, former Bush Administration official Simpsons presence with Veselnitskaya during this critical week in June -- together with revelations about Fusions simultaneous financial ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign and Russian interests -- raise new questions about the companys role in the 2016 election.Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Trump Tower meeting as part of his probe of Russian interference in last years election.Simpson and Fusion GPS were hired by BakerHostetler, which represented Russian firm Prevezon through Veselnitskaya.Veselnitskaya has said she sought the Trump Tower meeting in order to lobby the candidates team against Russian sanctions, but the initial approach included an offer of compromising information on candidate Clinton.Lawyers representing Fusion and Veselnitskaya did not respond to requests for comment lodged on Friday.Senate Judiciary Committee investigators interviewed Simpson for more than 10 hours on Aug. 22.A spokesman for the committee had no comment on whether Simpson confirmed his contact with Veselnitskaya during the closed-door session.The DNC and Clinton campaign hired Fusion in April 2016 through lawyer Marc Elias, who was general counsel for the Clinton campaign.Fusion, in turn, paid Steele $168,000 for the dossier, memos from which were shared with the FBI in the summer of 2016.Fusion officials said last week Steele's money came from $1.02 million it received in fees and expenses from Elias' law firm Perkins Coie.Prior to contracting with the DNC, Fusion had been conducting research into Trump and other Republican candidates on behalf of the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon.NBC News first reported that Veselnitskaya and Simpson were both at a hearing centered around another Fusion client, Russian oligarch Denis Katsyv.His company, Prevezon Holdings, was sanctioned against doing business in the U.S. for its alleged role in laundering more than $230 million.Fox News obtained audio records from that hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.The wrongdoing had been uncovered by Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested for probing Prevezon and other companies with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.In December 2012, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act was passed into U.S. law, freezing Russian assets and banning visas for sanctioned individuals.Fusions Simpson is believed to have been working with Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet counter-intelligence officer turned Russian-American lobbyist, to overturn the sanctions.Akhmetshin also attended the June 9 Trump Tower meeting, along with about a half-dozen others including Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, publicist Rob Goldstone, Natalia's Russian translator Anatoli Samochornov and Ike Kaveladze from a Russian-American real estate agency.Muellers interest in Fusion is unclear, but the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of several related congressional probes, recently struck a deal to gain access to Fusions bank records after initially issuing a subpoena.The records show that the DNC funded Fusions dossier effort.Over the weekend, Fusion GPS sought a new restraining order after the House panel requested additional records that could reveal if Fusion was paying media companies or reporters for planting stories."What we are finding out is that there is a lot of Russian influence in Washington, and a lot of money flowing in to influence our political process in Washington," Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former Bush administration official, said."It's going into Hillary Clinton.It's going to Fusion GPS.It's going into a lobbying campaign up on Capitol Hill against Magnitsky."Meanwhile, a request from Veselnitskaya and Katsyv for a new "temporary immigration parole" to return to the U.S. for a Nov. 9 Prevezon hearing in New York was denied, according to court documents reviewed by Fox News.A Senate Judiciary Committee spokesman told Fox News they are "encouraged" that Veselnitskaya has "signaled a willingness to cooperate" with the committee.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC)

Virginia voters share Gillespie's view on Confederate statues: Fox News Voter Analysis:::::Virginia voters overwhelmingly say Confederate statues should stay up, putting them more in line with Republican candidate Ed Gillespie in Tuesdays gubernatorial race, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis.The analysis a new polling technique Fox News is testing to improve coverage is taking the pulse of voters in Virginia and New Jersey.The latest numbers show 63 percent in Virginia say the Confederate monuments should stay up, while 35 percent say they should be taken down.Gillespie has said its up to local jurisdictions to decide how to handle the controversial statues, while Democratic nominee Ralph Northam initially said they should be taken down, before easing off that position.The voter analysis may show voters more in line with Northam on immigration, another big issue in Tuesdays race.According to the analysis, 57 percent say immigrants do more to help the U.S. than hurt it.Meanwhile, the analysis show most voters think the state of the Virginia economy is excellent or good despite President Trump tweeting Tuesday morning that the economy has been terrible under Democratic control.Despite that optimism, the economy is still a top priority, along with health care.The voter analysis also reflects some fatigue over this cycles tough campaign ads.Forty-nine percent say Northam has attacked Gillespie unfairly, while an even higher 60 percent say Gillespie attacked Northam unfairly.In New Jersey, almost 70 percent of voters said they believe the Garden State is moving in the wrong direction after eight years of outgoing Gov.Chris Christie.A majority of voters also said they have a negative view of the state economy with 62 percent giving it a not-so-good or poor rating.Sixty-five percent of voters said Trump was not a factor in their decision but said Christie was.Democrat Phil Murphy is running against GOP Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno in the state.The Fox News Voter Analysis is based on a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with Virginia/New Jersey registered voters.The poll featured interviews from a probability sample drawn from a registered voter list and interviews from a non-probability sample, and includes both voters and non-voters for enhanced analytical purposes.The data collection was multi-mode (landline, cellphone, and online).
GOP Reps. Ted Poe, Frank LoBiondo announce retirement:::::GOP Reps. Frank LoBiondo and Ted Poe announced Tuesday that they will retire at the end of their terms, adding to the list of Republican lawmakers bowing out after 2018.Poe, R-Texas, announced late Tuesday that he will not run for reelection in the midterms next fall, saying he is looking forward to spending more time in his district and with his family.I am grateful for the honor and privilege to represent the best people in America, Texass Second Congressional District.Thanks to the good Lord, Im in good health, but its time for the next step, Poe said in a statement, which he shared on Twitter.I am looking forward to spending more time in Texas, especially with my 12 grandkids who have all been born since I was first elected to Congress.Poe, who was first elected to the House in 2005, said that he was proud of the work his office has accomplished, and listed giving crime victims a voice, helping combat human trafficking, and fighting for our constitutional rights and individual liberty.I will continue this work every day until I retire at the end of this term, Poe said.And thats just the way it is.LoBiondo, R-N.J., 71, announced his retirement earlier Tuesday, but said his decision was not motivated by electoral fears.Poe declared that our nation is consumed by increasing political polarization, and said there is no longer middle ground.His departure gives Democrats a shot at the seat in a district that President Barack Obama won easily in two elections.Democrats made clear they will try to win the district as they aim to retake control of the House next year.Democrats must pick up two dozen seats to win back the House.LoBiondo was elected to Congress in 1994 as part of the so-called "Republican Revolution."He represents a wide swath of southern New Jersey and serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation panel in the House.Last month, LoBiondo was one of 20 House Republicans to vote against a $4 trillion budget framework for tax reform over plans to limit state and local tax deductions.In his statement, LoBiondo insisted he was not motivated by electoral fears.Instead, he pointed to term limits on a couple of his committee roles and said that made it the right time to leave.He also delivered an indictment of the current political climate in Washington and Congress."As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers," he wrote."In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation."Fox News' Brooke Singman, Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
Jeff Flake, Donald Trump Jr. clash on Twitter over gun laws in wake of Texas shooting:::::Republican Sen. Jeff Flake clashed with President Trumps eldest son on Tuesday over the outgoing Arizona lawmaker's proposed gun legislation in the wake of the deadly Texas church shooting.Flake, who announced last month he would not seek re-election when his term ends in 2018, tweeted on Tuesday that he is co-sponsoring a piece of proactive bipartisan legislation that would ban anyone convicted of domestic violence from purchasing a firearm.Writing a bill w/ @MartinHeinrich to prevent anyone convicted of domestic violence be it in criminal or military court from buying a gun, Flake tweeted.The proposed legislation, being written with Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, follows revelations that the U.S. Air Force did not report Texas church shooter Devin Kelleys domestic violence conviction to the FBI, even though it was required by the Pentagon.That left the door open for Kelley to buy weapons.But Donald Trump Jr. didnt seem to think the senators bill was all that proactive.Incredibly proactive considering that law has been on the books since the mid 90s, Trump Jr. said in a sarcastic Twitter reply.Trump was referring to the Lautenberg Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1996.The federal law was designed to prohibit people convicted of domestic violence from buying or possessing a firearm regardless of whether the crime was a felony or misdemeanor.Kelley, who killed at least 26 people when he opened fire at a church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday, received a bad conduct discharge from the military in 2014 after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and reportedly fracturing his stepsons skull.He was convicted on two charges of domestic assault, served 12 months in confinement at the Naval Consolidated Brig in California, and was later given the bad conduct discharge.Flake hit back.If being proactive means closing the #DomesticViolenceLoophole exploited by the #SutherlandSprings Texas shooter, you're right, Flake replied.An Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said Monday that Kelleys conviction was not submitted to the FBIs Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database that is used to conduct background checks on would-be gun purchasers.But Trump Jr. struck back yet again.Wrong.Govt employees, like you, failed to do their job.He did a year for abuse & fracturing his kids skull.Should not have had a gun!he tweeted.In announcing his retirement, Flake has stepped up his criticism of the Trump White House.We were not made great as a country by indulging in or even exalting our worst impulses, turning against ourselves, glorifying in the things that divide us and calling fake things true and true things fake, Flake said on the Senate floor last month, seemingly pointing to Trump.Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Presenting your Virginia gubernatorial race guide:::::**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?Sign up here.** On the roster: Presenting your Virginia gubernatorial race guide - Party paid to keep Schultz fat and happy - Reprising ObamaCare role, Pence takes lead on taxes - Trumps former body man to testify on Russia - Rotten tomatoes, indeed PRESENTING YOUR VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE GUIDE Whatever happens in Virginias much-watched gubernatorial election today, you will have the chance to interpret it in such a way as to reinforce your existing political views if thats how you roll.The great thing about living by the crackling fire in the open hearth of ultra-partisanship is that you never need to be wrong.It may not make any difference in real life or advance any particular policies, but it is sure cozier than a pair of cashmere socks at a hardcore hygge session.If you are sticking hard and fast by President Trump, a win for Republican Ed Gillespie is proof that the president and his party remain on a winning streak.That view is sweetened by the fact that Gillespie has embraced a campaign strategy that Steve Bannon called Trumpism without Trump.Conversely, if Gillespie loses, you can simply say that Gillespie was too squeamish about the Trump part of Trumpsim.Deep draughts of liberal tears will be your reward tonight either way.If youre on the other pole of the spectrum and are a liberal, Bernie-Sanders-supporting Democrat, you can have the same heads I win, tails you lose approach to Democrat Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam.If he wins by even a point, you can claim the rising wave of #resist is finally starting.And if Northam loses, simply dismiss him as too moderate to fire up the Democratic base.The dankness of your memes will be unaffected by actual election results.The same goes for the establishmentarians of both parties who will claim moderation again ascendant if their guy wins or denounce radical rogues if he loses.Tribalism means never having to say youre sorry.Heck, tribalism means youre not even allowed to apologize.But what if youd actually like to know what may happen and what it would mean for future contests?What if youd like to know about, you know, the election?By Jove, that may just be crazy enough to work.... TWO VIRGINIAS No were not talking about the 1861 division of Virginia into two states, West and plain, but the fact that there are really two elections in the commonwealth today.One takes place in a small, affluent, Northeast Corridor Democratic state.The other in a medium-sized, mostly prosperous Southern state.If you take Northern Virginia out of Virginia (and Lord, do the Republicans wish they could), you get a pretty typical GOP state.If you factor out the four counties and five cities of NoVa about 28 percent of the overall votes cast Trump would have won Virginia by about 3 points, close to his margin in neighboring North Carolina.Conversely, Hillary Clinton did even better in those counties and cities than she did in neighboring deep-blue Maryland.But like Maryland, these are precincts where Republicans can sometimes actually win.Gillespie should be well suited to the terrain.Hes a Beltway stalwart and a longtime resident of affluent Fairfax County.His almost upset of Sen. Mark Warner in 2014 was supercharged by a strong showing with their suburbanite neighbors.But more instructive for us here is not Gillespies record but how the GOP has been faring in these counties in the commonwealths off-year contests.With the odd cycle and governors limited to only one term, the elections are ultra-low turnout affairs.To wit: turnout was 29 points higher in 2016 than it was for the state race three years earlier.Gillespie wont be able to rely on lukewarm moderates and independents this time, and will have to count on the most active (i.e.partisan) voters this time.This explains why he has run television commercials so rank in subject and tone that parents are sent scrambling for the remote during football games.Virginia Republicans picked former state attorney general Ken Cuccinelli in 2013 and he got smoked in these counties, but not by so much that he didnt almost pull off a win himself.People forget that despite his firebrand status, The Cooch kept it relatively close less than 3 points statewide.But while Cuccinelli did better than Trump would go on to do in Northern Virginia, thats still where he lost the race.Cuccinelli lost the region, which represented 28 percent of the statewide total, by about 138,000 votes.He won the rest of the state excluding the D.C. suburbs by about 81,000 votes.Had Cuccinelli just been able to replicate the 2009 performance of former Republican Gov.Bob McDonnell in the swing outer suburban counties of Loudoun and Prince William he would have been almost home.Gillespies advantage is that suburbanites should like him better than they did the cantankerous Cuccinelli, but the 2017 nominee has to make sure that he doesnt lose too much of his predecessors statewide margin.The trick for Gillespie is to have convinced voters in places like Pittsylvania and Wythe counties that a Roman Catholic guy who grew up in New Jersey now cares deeply about preserving Confederate heritage while simultaneously letting NoVa know that he doesnt really mean it.Northam has the inverse challenge.Can he, a moderate Southern Democrat, fire up NoVa singletons, African American voters in the Tidewater region and other core Democratic constituencies without sounding like so much of a hothead that the outer Washington suburbs dont snap back to red?WHY WE CARE SO MUCH We love polls, but the simulation is no substitute for the real thing.Other than just being happy to get back to some daggone real politics instead of just endless partisan jawboning, this race is our best chance since the 2016 stunner to see how voters really feel.We know how Americans generally feel lousy about politics now and seem to mostly agree that Trump is a bad leader.But thats not what determines elections.Surveys are grand, but elections are about who really shows up to vote.The Democrats have shown spunk in their losing special election bids since last November, but this is a statewide race in a competitive place with two candidates who function pretty well as a Generic Republican and a Generic Democrat.And we also have good comparable data.Yes, Northam would like to do better than Clinton did a year ago.But the real pass-fail for Democrats is whether Northam can do better than his 2009 running mate, Gov.Terry McAuliffe.McAuliffe disappointed Democrats by only beating right-winger Cuccinelli by 2.5 points.Virginia, like the rest of America, would prove to be a heckuva lot more Republican than Democrats living in the Obama re-election afterglow were ready to believe.Tonight we find out which team is in for an education, courtesy of the Mother of Presidents.KEY COUNTIES Heres where you should be watching to see how things are shaping up this evening.Chesterfield County 2013: D 40.9%;

Weekly Standard: If you want to hear the anguished, soul-wracked keening of a man whose ox was just gored, pull up a chair and sit a spell.Youve come to the right place.For I am that unfortunate species that Republicans want to pretend doesnt exist: the middle-class schlub who will not feel tax relief, but tax pain, even as they attempt to re-cut the tax pie so that corporations get a 43 percent tax reduction (from 35 percent to 20 percent), while my top tax rate stays the same (25 percent) and I lose the lions share of my itemized deductions.Meaning my taxes, unlike most corporations, are going up, even as Ill be getting taxed at a higher rate than Applewhose 2016 revenue was $215.6 billion.TRUMPS FORMER BODY MAN TO TESTIFY ON RUSSIA Bloomberg: As Donald Trumps longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller had a front row seat to key moments of Trumps presidency, campaign and rise as a reality TV star.Now, Schiller is being asked to divulge sensitive information he learned about the president to congressional investigators.Schiller, who started working for Trump in 1999, will be questioned Tuesday behind closed doors by members and staff of the House Intelligence Committee looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.He brings a much more intimate knowledge of Trump, his candidacy and presidency than past witnesses.Before leaving the White House in August as head of Oval Office operations, Schiller was often the first and last aide Trump would see each day.During the campaign, Schiller heard nearly every conversation and phone call as he sat in cars by Trumps side, traveling between rallies, former campaign aides said.He was also the conduit Trumps allies outside the White House would use to reach the president.Email shows contradiction from Carter Page on his meeting with Russian official - WaPo: Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to President Trumps campaign whose visit to Moscow during the election has drawn scrutiny, sent an email to fellow Trump aides during his trip describing a private conversation with a senior Russian official who spoke favorably of the Republican candidate, according to records released late Monday by congressional investigators.Page also wrote that he had been provided incredible insights and outreach by Russian lawmakers and senior members of Russian President Vladimir Putins administration during the trip.The email appeared to contradict earlier statements by Page, who had said he had only exchanged brief greetings with the senior Russian official, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, after he delivered a speech at a Russian university.Comey softened language on Clinton email case statement - Fox News: Newly reported memos to Congress released Monday showed that language was softened between an early draft and the final copy of former FBI Director James Comeys statement closing out the Hillary Clinton email case.Originally Comey accused the former secretary of state of being grossly negligent in handling classified information in a draft dated May 2, 2016, but that was modified to claim that Clinton had been extremely careless in a draft dated June 10, 2016.Comey stuck to that modified language when he announced in July 2016 that there would be no charges against Clinton.Federal law states that gross negligence in handling the nations intelligence can be punished criminally with prison time or fines, according to The Hill, which first reported on the memos.Ross adviser held position with Kremlin-linked client - Politico: A top adviser to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross served on the board of Navigator Holdings, a shipping company whose clients include a Russian energy company with Kremlin ties, while she was working in the Trump administration.Wendy Teramoto retained her seat on Navigators board after joining Commerce in mid-March as a part-time adviser to Ross, one of the most influential voices in President Donald Trumps ear on global trade and economic policy.She also continued to serve as an executive of Rosss private equity firm WL Ross & Co. after becoming a government employee.Teramoto didnt resign her seat on Navigators board until July 17, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.She left WL Ross that same month.On Aug. 1, she was formally named Rosss chief of staff.PLAY-BY-PLAY The story behind the attack on Sen.

Love, Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. [Ed.note: Now, now, Mr. Love!I gather from your remarks that you are a Republican, and I assure you that Im not anti-you, or really, anti-anybody.Maybe the people who came up with vegan pork rinds.Those people, I am anti.As to the question of picking different winners and losers, I certainly take your point inside the concept of a zero-sum game.If we assume that spending and revenue have to exist within a narrow bandwidth then, yes, tax reform would be a matter of deciding which individuals and behaviors the government would seek to reward or punish.I am suggesting, however, that Republicans had an opportunity in this case, much as they did in their abortive efforts to replace ObamaCare, to change the debate.Rather than talking about raising taxes on some and lowering taxes on others, Republicans could have looked for a plan that would have lowered taxes for all, even if it meant giving up on some of the social-engineering deductions that politicians of both parties prize.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.ROTTEN TOMATOES, INDEED M Live: Plenty of Michigan State fans planned to turn East Lansing upside down after the Spartans big win over Penn State on Saturday night.East Lansing Police put a stop to most of that.But those who decided to take things a little too far probably had their Sunday hangover plans ruined as well.Weve taped Stranger Things spoilers all over the walls of our jail this week.Some extra motivation for you to not end up there.The comical Tweet is a reference to Stranger Things, Netflixs hit show about a group of kids battling a supernatural threat in 1980s Indiana.Season two of the topsy-turvy show premiered on Oct. 27, which means theres plenty of people out there who dont know where the series is heading.Fans that ended up behind bars do, though.Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.Brianna McClelland contributed to this report.Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?Sign up here.

Jeb Hensarling, R-TX., announced on Oct. 31 that he will not run for re-election in 2018."Today I am announcing that I will not seek re-election to the US Congress in 2018.Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned," Hensarling, 60, said, according to the Dallas Morning News.Hensarling also added that he wants to spend more time with his family.Lynn Jenkins Rep.

Gillespie, Northam in dead heat in Virginia governor's race; Dem leads in NJ:::::Early returns show a tight gubernatorial race between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam in Virginia, where conservatives are hoping for an upset and liberals want to notch their first major win after a string of losses since Donald Trump was elected president.With 48 percent of precincts reporting, Northam has 51 percent to Gillespie's 48 percent.It is too early to project a winner in the state, where the Fox News Voter Analysis also shows a close race.Meanwhile, polls have closed in New Jersey, where voters are deciding who will succeed outgoing Republican Gov.Chris Christie, who is term-limited after eight years in office and has seen his approval numbers take a drastic hit.Democratic nominee Phil Murphy has a strong lead over Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno in the contest, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis.Ahead of Tuesdays elections, the president repeatedly tweeted his support for Gillespie in the race to replace Democratic Gov.Terry McAuliffe in Virginia, while staying quiet about Guadagno in New Jersey.Polling in recent weeks has shown Gillespie gaining ground on Northam in Virginia, the only southern state lost by Trump in 2016.FULL ELECTION DAY COVERAGE Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been campaigning on issues embraced by Trump during the presidential campaign, vowing to crack down on sanctuary cities and the MS-13 gang.Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia, Trump tweeted from Asia, where hes on a foreign trip.Hes weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment and has been horrible on Virginia economy.Vote @EdWGillespie today!In Virginia, the race between Gillespie and Northam has gotten particularly nasty in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of running ads that are out of line and racially tinged.VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE GUIDE Last week, a liberal group called the Latino Victory Fund released a television ad showing immigrant and minority children in Virginia being chased down the road by a man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie bumper sticker.Republicans decried the ad, accusing Democrats of fear-mongering.The group behind it eventually took the ad down after last weeks terrorist attack by truck in New York.Meanwhile, Democrats have repeatedly protested ads from Gillespie accusing Northam of voting for bills that would lead to sanctuary cities and a threat increase from the MS-13 gang.In a video posted on Twitter after he voted Tuesday, McAuliffe warned about a possible Republican upset and called on voters to reject the bigoted, racist ads that Ed Gillespie has run against Ralph Northam I do not want you waking up like you did after the presidential election last November and saying, how could this possibly happen?McAuliffe said.VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES SPAR OVER SANCTUARY CITIES Gillespie and Northam have also sparred over the highly charged issue of removing Confederate monuments in the state.Northam's campaign attempted to tie Gillespie to the white supremacist violence this summer in Charlottesville, something Gillespie's campaign called an "ugly character smear."Northams team has tried to portray the race as a referendum against Trump, labeling Gillespie Trump's chief lobbyist because of his former lobbying career.But the so-called liberal resistance against Trump has failed to successfully use that strategy in a series of special House elections this year that Republicans have won.The election comes as the national Democratic Party finds itself in disarray over former DNC interim chairman Donna Braziles new book claiming the DNC rigged the nomination for Hillary Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders in 2016.In New Jersey, the gubernatorial race could have national implications, as the states Democratic senator, Bob Menendez, is on trial for federal corruption charges.The winner of the race could have the opportunity to appoint his replacement if Menendez is convicted and resigns.He maintains his innocence.Like Gillespie, Guadagno has spent the campaign railing against sanctuary cities, releasing an ad drawing attention to Murphys comments in support of New Jersey being a sanctuary state and telling the story of an illegal immigrant who was convicted of killing several students in 2007.Murphy doesnt have our backs, the ads narrator says.Referencing criminal illegal immigrants, the narrator continues: He has theirs.Like Northam in Virginia, Murphy has responded by accusing Guadagno of channeling Trump.Kim Guadagno should be ashamed of herself for the way shes politicizing the deaths of three children and painting a community with the broad brush of a murderer, a tactic she must have gleaned from President Trump, Murphy said in response to the ad.To say the least, these are not New Jerseys values.
Kim Davis to seek re-election as Kentucky county clerk:::::The Kentucky county clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples will run for re-election in 2018, facing voters for the first time since her protest against gay marriage launched a national uproar from rural Appalachia.An attorney for Kim Davis confirmed she will seek a second term.Filing for Kentucky's 2018 election cycle opens Wednesday."She loves her job and she loves the people," said Mat Staver, founder of the Florida-based law firm Liberty Counsel that has represented Davis."I'm sure (the election) will probably have more attention because of who she is, but you know she doesn't have any major concerns about it."A spokeswoman for Liberty Counsel said Davis was unavailable for comment because of a medical procedure.Davis stopped issuing marriage licenses in 2015 after a U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.Five couples sued her, and a judge ordered her to issue the licenses.Davis refused and spent five days in jail.When she was released, she altered the marriage license form so it would not include her name.The state's Democratic governor at the time agreed to recognize the licenses.The state legislature then changed the law so clerks did not have to sign their name on the licenses.Davis was elected as a Democrat, but switched parties to become a Republican shortly after the controversy erupted.Rowan County is a Democratic stronghold.While its voters overwhelmingly elected Donald Trump for president, nearly all of the local elected officials are Democrats.Lincoln Caudill, vice chairman for the Rowan County Democratic Party, said no one has announced they will challenge Davis yet.Caudill plans to run for judge-executive, the county's top elected position."I know (Davis has) created a controversy in the county and the farthest I can stay from giving an opinion on it, that's what I plan to do," he said.
Eliminating state and local tax deductions will create a more level playing field: GOP senator:::::Sen. David Perdue on tax bill: This is what America wants 5 Hours Ago | 03:16 While eliminating state and local tax deductions will "hurt in some places," it's something that has to be done, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., told CNBC on Tuesday.While the Senate Finance Committee is working on its version of the tax bill, the draft of the GOP House tax bill released last week included the repeal of the deductions for state and local income tax (SALT) payments."There's no reason in the world that a couple with two children in Iowa pay more federal tax than the same couple with two children, same income, same deductions, in California," Perdue said in an interview with "Power Lunch.""We're going to clean that up.Create a more level playing field, both on the individual side and on the corporate side as well."New York, California and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of the deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump's plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector.House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady has said lawmakers would have a chance to propose changes to the bill.The House is marking up, or debating and amending, the legislation, this week.Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it.Meanwhile, it's unclear when Senate Republicans will release their tax bill.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it would be out on Friday, but his spokesperson later said he misspoke.Earlier in the day, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, told NBC News the proposal would be released Thursday.McConnell also said the chamber will aim to mark up its legislation next week.Ultimately, the Senate bill would have to be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to President Donald Trump to sign.Perdue told CNBC he's optimistic Republicans will wind up with tax legislation that will cause the economy to "really pop," noting that this is "what America wants.""We're in a good position to get this across the line.The president wants to get this done in the House and Senate, get it passed by Thanksgiving so it's on his desk by Christmas."On Tuesday, Fitch Ratings said the proposed cuts will not pay for themselves through growth and will "significantly" add to the long-term U.S. debt.CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Reuters contributed to this report.
Gary Cohn says the 'Paradise Papers' don't worry him at all:::::Gary Cohn on connection to Paradise Papers: That's the way the world works 3 Hours Ago | 01:28 Among the major business figures recently identified with activities in the tax haven of Bermuda is White House economic advisor Gary Cohn and he says he doesn't mind a bit.Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who directs President Donald Trump's National Economic Council, was named in the leaked "Paradise Papers" from a Bermuda-based law firm as an officer of 22 business entities in the island nation.He described their creation as a routine part of commerce in a globally integrated economy."I found out about them in the newspaper," Cohn explained in our Speakeasy interview."Goldman Sachs had them.Because I worked at Goldman Sachs, in the division I was running at the time, I became an officer of those companies by the mere position I had.I didn't have money in them."The purpose, he said, was to use Bermuda as a gathering spot for investors from different countries.
Wall St. analyst concerned for Trump's health: 'Loathes exercise,' sleeps 4 hours, never eats fruit:::::As if he doesn't have enough to worry about, questions are coming up over President Donald Trump's personal health.The president is a notorious junk-food junkie and not known as much of a fitness buff outside his regular rounds of golf.There already have been many articles written and opinions offered on the state of Trump's health.The latest concerns come from Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, whose views on Wall Street and Washington are widely followed.In his daily note Tuesday, Valliere offers a number of concerns: Trump is "at least 50 pounds overweight," an estimate that may be a bit of an overshot.During a taping with Dr. Oz during the 2016 campaign, Trump was found to be 6 feet 3 inches tall and weigh 236 pounds, which would put him right on the border of "obese," with a body mass index of 29.5, meaning he would need to lose 36 pounds to get to a "normal" BMI.He "loathes exercise," uses a cart for golf and struggled to walk up a hill during the last G-10 meeting.A Secret Service agent source of Valliere's professed that "he has never seen anyone with worse dietary habits" and "never saw him eat a piece of fruit."Trump's food choices tend to well-done steaks, cheeseburgers and french fries.The president only sleeps four hours a night, is "angry most of the time" and "profanely berates aides.""He has not, to our knowledge, had a physical in over a year, or if he has, the results of have not been disclosed," Valliere said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Again, Valliere is hardly the first to raise concerns about Trump's diet and health and probably won't be the last.(The New York Times delved into the president's lifestyle in this piece last year.)"We would reiterate that we wish Donald Trump a long and healthy life," he wrote."But there are serious danger signs, and we hope the president and his family will address them."
GOP tax cuts will not pay for themselves, add 'significantly' to US debt: Fitch report:::::The proposed Republican tax cuts will not pay for themselves through growth, and add "significantly" to the long-term United States debt, Fitch Ratings said in a Tuesday report.The estimates from the credit rating agency undercut a key argument of the GOP bill: that chopping tax rates will spark major economic growth and cancel out most or all lost revenue.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House aims to pass as early as next week, cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, while moderately reducing household income tax rates.It changes some popular provisions such as the mortgage interest deduction, but leaves others like the 401(k) tax benefit unchanged.GOP lawmakers are allowing for the bill to add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over a decade.But they argue that economic growth will boost tax revenues over time, making up for that gap.Fitch contradicted those assumptions.It revised its medium-term debt forecast higher because it expects that Congress will pass some version of the bill.In its report, Fitch said the tax cuts "may lead to a short-lived boost to output."However, they "will not pay for themselves or lead to a permanently higher growth rate," according to the agency."Fitch believes the tax package will be revenue negative, even under generous assumptions about its growth impact," the report said.The U.S. federal debt was 77 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the last fiscal year.Fitch expects it to rise to 120 percent of GDP by 2027 "under a realistic scenario of tax cuts and macro conditions."On Sunday, House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News that he was "absolutely convinced" the proposed cuts would help to grow the U.S. economy.The White House's chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, has gone as far as saying GOP tax cuts will be paid for entirely through economic growth.However, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady on Monday said economic growth from tax cuts "alone won't get us back to a balanced budget."A House Ways and Means Committee spokesperson on Tuesday said the current bill meets the requirements set out in the budget passed by the House and Senate.It will boost growth and generate additional revenue in the coming years, the spokesperson said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Fitch report.
One year later, here's how the Trump stock market rally compares with those of past presidents:::::Since last year's election, stock market investors have been betting big that President Donald Trump will enact policies that will boost corporate profits, cut taxes, slash regulations and sustain a postelection rally not seen in decades.Now, many investors are still waiting for the White House and GOP Congress to deliver on Trump's campaign promises.At the first anniversary of Trump's Nov. 8 election, the subsequent stock market's gain ranks No.3 in first-term, postelection markets since Dwight Eisenhower won the 1952 election.Over these decades, though, stock market rallies in the early days of a new administration aren't necessarily a great predictor of investor returns over the full term of the incoming president.The stock market's jubilant response to Trump's election, for example, was initially compared to the reaction to Ronald Reagan's 1980 defeat of Jimmy Carter.Both Trump and Reagan campaigned on a platform that promised tax cuts and sweeping deregulation, a prospect that investors assume will help companies boost profits.But Reagan's postelection rally fizzled within weeks, thanks to an aggressive series of interest rates hikes in late 1980 aimed at snuffing out double-digit inflation.Between Election Day and the end of the year, short-term rates surged from 14 percent to above 20 percent.
NY Rep. Collins says donors told him to get tax reform done 'or don't ever call' again:::::A House Republican is stating the political necessity for Republicans to deliver tax overhaul legislation this year.New York Rep. Chris Collins said Tuesday, "My donors are basically saying 'get it done or don't ever call me again."'President Donald Trump and the Republicans need to show a tax bill as a major legislative accomplishment to protect their majorities in next year's elections.Meanwhile, Democrats on the House's tax-writing committee plan to propose a battery of revisions to the Republican tax overhaul bill that focus on middle-class concerns like childcare and home buying.As the committee works on the legislation, an initial amendment proposed by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., would shut down the plan's tax cuts if in two years the $20 trillion national debt had increased.The amendments, without chance of approval by the Republican-dominated Ways and Means Committee, focus attention on the issue of whether the middle class would benefit from the tax plan.
Syria plans to join Paris climate agreement, isolating US:::::Syria plans to join the 2015 Paris agreement for slowing global warming, isolating the United States as the only country opposed to the pact, delegates said on Tuesday at U.N. climate negotiations in Germany.Syria and Nicaragua were the only two nations outside the 195-nation pact when it was agreed in 2015, under former U.S. President Barack Obama.Nicaragua, which originally denounced the plan as too weak, signed up last month.Syria's delegation told a meeting of almost 200 nations on climate change in Bonn that their country, torn by civil war, would sign up for the agreement to curb rising temperatures by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, delegates said.The move will isolate Washington.President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubts that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the prime cause of global warming, announced in June that he intended to pull out and instead promote U.S. coal and oil industries."We need everybody on board," Ronald Jumeau, of the Seychelles, told Reuters."We want the United States in too.We take no pleasure in the United States being out."Nick Nuttall, spokesman for the U.N.Climate Change Secretariat which is organising the meeting, said that Syria had not yet formally submitted any documents about its plan."Syria's decision shows the breadth of support for the Paris agreement," Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Reuters of the moves by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Meyer said businesses, mayors, cities and other groups were also stepping up actions to limit a rise in temperatures that scientists say are stoking more downpours, heat waves and rising sea levels.David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute think-tank, noted that Trump's climate views had previously isolated him in the Group of Seven and the Group of 20."Now he'll be isolated from all nations," he said.The Paris agreement seeks to limit a rise in temperatures to "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, ideally 1.5.The U.N.'s weather agency said on Monday that this year is on track to be the second or third warmest since records began in the 19th century, behind a record-breaking 2016.The Bonn meeting, from Nov. 6-17, is seeking to write a detailed "rule book" for the Paris agreement, including details of how to report and check all nations' greenhouse gas emissions.
Record level of sign-ups for Obamacare plans reported despite Trump administration opposition:::::The number of people who signed up for Obamacare plans more than doubled on the first day of enrollment compared with the prior year, according to a new report.That potential record for enrollment levels comes despite opposition to Obamacare by the Trump administration, and despite sharp defunding of sign-up outreach efforts and advertising by the administration.TheHill.com reported that last Wednesday, the first day of open enrollment for individual health plans, more than 200,000 people selected an Obamacare plan for 2018.That compares with only around 100,000 for the same day last year, according to TheHill.com, citing a source close to the enrollment process.There was also a sharp uptick in visits to HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace that sells Obamacare plans in much of the United States.More than 1 million people visited that sign-up site last Wednesday, compared with about 750,000 visitors on the first day of open enrollment in 2016.Earlier this week, ACASignups.net, which tracks Obamacare-related data, reported that enrollment activity on Covered California, the largest state-run health exchange in the nation, was also markedly higher.Last Wednesday, nearly 6,000 people selected a plan on Covered California, about 25 percent more than did on the same day last year, ACASignups.net said.Enrollments on another state-run exchange, Maryland Health Connection, were up even more by 70 percent on opening day.The Baltimore Sun reported that exchange officials said that more than 1,800 people signed up on Maryland's marketplace, compared with 1,055 on the first day of enrollment last year.HealthSherpa.com, an online health insurance brokerage, said it had seen a 200 percent increase in the number of enrollments submitted on its site last Wednesday compared with the first day of open enrollment in 2016.George Kalogeropoulos, CEO of HealthSherpa.com, said that a major reason for that increase in sign-ups was recently approved technology that made it easier and faster for web-based brokers to enroll Obamacare customers in plans sold on HealthCare.gov.A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Obamacare, declined to comment to CNBC when asked for an official sign-up tally for the past week, and how it compares with the same time period last year.The spokeswoman noted that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an HHS division, plans to release snapshot enrollment data throughout the sign-up season as CMS has done in the past.Lori Lodes, who had been communications director at CMS during the Obama administration, told CNBC, "The great start to open enrollment proves just how much people value health coverage and that people are finding coverage they can afford.""There's only five weeks to go before the final deadline of Dec. 15 so we've got a lot of work to do to enroll even more people," said Lodes, referring to the sign-up deadline for HealthCare.gov.Other states, including California and New York, have deadlines weeks later."Imagine how many more people would be signing up if the administration stopped their efforts to undermine the law and actually got the word out about open enrollment," said Lodes, who co-founded a group called Get America Covered to promote sign-ups this season.The Trump administration in late August said it would slash the Obamacare advertising budget by 90 percent, and the budget for in-person enrollment by 41 percent.In September, the administration told HHS' 10 regional directors not to participate in state-based events promoting Obamacare enrollment, after years of having done so.Those moves still could lead to lower enrollment on Obamacare exchanges by the end of the sign-up season.The exchanges sell health coverage, often at subsidized discounts, to people who do not have insurance through a job, Medicare, Medicaid, or other sources.Lodes' fellow co-founder at Get American Covered, Joshua Peck, recently estimated that the administration's pullback on enrollment promotion efforts will lead to at least 1.1 million fewer people signing up for Obamacare plans this season compared with last season.That estimate by Peck, former chief marketing officer of HealthCare.gov, is a best-case scenario.Peck told CNBC that the impact of the Trump administration's moves "is pretty grim."
Forbes says Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross lied about being a billionaire:::::Turns out Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may have greatly exaggerated his wealth, according to a report from Forbes.Just a year ago, Forbes listed Ross' net worth at $2.9 billion and included him in the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans by net worth.The new report says Ross had just under $700 million in assets.It cited financial-disclosure forms filed by Ross after being nominated for his Commerce secretary.After Forbes learned about this, the magazine said, it wanted to remove Ross from the Forbes 400.Ross protested, according to the report, telling the magazine it wasn't taking into account some trusts created for his family, which add "more than $2 billion" to his net worth and which he did not have to disclose in federal filings.But the magazine said that after "one month of digging," it is confident that the more than $2 billion never existed.It said it removed him when it updated its list of richest Americans last month."It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004," Forbes' report said.A Commerce Department spokesman told CNBC in a statement: "Secretary Ross's disclosure documents were compiled by legal counsel and accountants.The relevant rules were followed, and the documents were closely reviewed and approved by ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and the Office of Government Ethics.We regret any earlier miscommunication."Ross is listed on the "The World's Billionaires" list from March 2017 on Forbes' website.In it, he is No.814, with a worth of $2.5 billion, just above private equity titan David Rubenstein.As of Tuesday, Forbes estimates Ross' net worth at $700 million.Click here to read Forbes full report.
Hard-fought Virginia governor's race to test Trump's clout:::::A bitterly fought governor's race in Virginia leads a slate of state and local elections on Tuesday that offer an early test of President Donald Trump's political influence and possible strategies for both parties in next year's midterm elections.New Jersey voters also will pick a new governor to replace outgoing Republican Chris Christie.Several big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended.The marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood.Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year.A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump.
Trump says extreme vetting on guns wouldn't stop mass shootings:::::President Donald Trump said Tuesday that extreme vetting of U.S. gun owners would have made "no difference" to the Texas church shooting.Speaking at a joint press conference alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Seoul, Trump was asked by a reporter whether he had considered extreme vetting for U.S. citizens seeking to buy a gun.He replied: "If you did what you are suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago."At least 26 people were killed and about 20 others wounded after a gunman opened fire during a Sunday service at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.The victims ranged in age from five to 72-years-old.The U.S. president also said the suspect might not have been stopped if the "very brave person" attempting to "neutralize" the assailant was without a firearm."I can only say this, if he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead you would have had hundreds more dead... so that's the way I feel about it."
Trump, at North Korea's doorstep, says solution must be found to nuclear standoff:::::The White House says Trump's trip is intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over his hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats, but many in the region fear further bellicose presidential rhetoric could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict on the Korean peninsula.Meeting with military commanders about the North Korea issue, Trump told reporters: "Ultimately it will all work out, it always works out, it has to work out".He did not elaborate.Trump praised president Moon, hailing him for "great cooperation," despite differences over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.Pyongyang's recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump's presidency.Three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups will exercise together in the Western Pacific in the coming days in a show of force rarely seen in the region, U.S. officials said.On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea.Trump was greeted with applause and a few cheers as he and president Moon entered the mess hall at lunch hour.
Donald Trump in Seoul: South Koreans anxious over US alliance:::::"There's just a lot of anxiety growing in South Korea about where the alliance is headed," said Jenny Town, the assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute in Washington and managing editor at 38 North, a website that provides analysis on North Korea."A lot of South Koreans just feel like they're not part even of the deliberations and as an alliance they are not consulted."Concerns about potential U.S. military action against Pyongyang increased in September after Trump hinted of force in a tweet.The president also recently said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was "wasting his time" on diplomacy.The world's largest economy has also been flexing its military might in recent weeks: the Navy has three carrier strike groups operating around Asian waters while B-1B bombers have been conducting exercises over the Korea Peninsula.Moon, who has been pushing for dialogue with Pyongyang, has repeatedly said he wants no military action without Seoul's approval."The thing that has been sucking the wind out of the room of North Korean discussion has been, will the U.S. conduct a preventive attack" said Bruce Klingner, former chief of the CIA's Korea branch and now senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center.According to Klingner, another concern is that the Trump administration will abandon Seoul once North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shows the ability to hit the U.S. with an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Former Trump advisor testifies that he met Russia's deputy PM last year:::::"It was a very brief interaction.It was some nice pleasantries.I cannot recall the precise words I said, but it was sort of best wishes, and, you know, that's about it," Page said in response to several questions about the contact.The testimony was part of the committee's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether it is linked to Trump's campaign.Page's trip raised questions just as the FBI began its counterintelligence investigation into the Russian meddling in the summer of 2016, and he has offered contradictory accounts about whom he met there at one point telling The Associated Press that he hadn't met with Dvorkovich.But his testimony on Thursday was under oath.Page was interviewed in March for several hours as part of the FBI probe, before special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take it over.Page wouldn't answer questions about his contact with Mueller.The House panel released the transcript as part of its agreement with Page, who was subpoenaed by the committee in early October.Parts of the transcript are redacted, even though lawmakers started the discussion by saying it would be unclassified.Page told the panel he had informed some members of the Trump campaign about the Russia trip, including then Senator Jeff Sessions.He said he mentioned in passing to Sessions, who is now attorney general, that he was preparing to visit Russia and Sessions "had no reaction whatsoever."The testimony could raise more questions about the extent of Sessions' knowledge about interactions between Trump campaign aides and Russians.Sessions recused himself from overseeing an investigation into the Trump campaign in March after acknowledging two previously undisclosed conversations with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign.Since then, Sessions has downplayed his own knowledge about communications between campaign aides and Russian officials and intermediaries.
GOP tax plan would increase federal deficits beyond the limit, new analysis shows:::::UPDATE: The Tax Policy Center has issued a statement saying it found an error in its analysis involving the child tax credit component of the proposed legislation.The center said it is revising its analysis and will release a corrected version soon.A new nonpartisan analysis highlights a pitfall of the House GOP tax plan.The report shows that the House GOP bill would increase federal deficits substantially in the short and long run in ways that would vastly increase the difficulty of passing it in the Senate.The report comes from the University of Pennsylvania's Penn-Wharton economic model directed by Kent Smetters, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush.The Penn-Wharton model shows that the House GOP tax bill would reduce tax revenue by $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years.That exceeds the $1.5 trillion permitted under the budget "reconciliation" rules that allow Senate Republicans to sidestep Democratic filibusters.
Think tank pulls study of Republican tax plan, citing error in its analysis:::::The Tax Policy Center, an influential non-partisan think tank, pulled its study of the Republican tax plan on Monday, saying it found an error in its analysis.The center issued the following statement on its website.TPC staff found an error in the preliminary distributional tables and analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that we released today.This error involved the additional child tax credit component of the proposed legislation.TPC staff are in the process of revising the analysis and will release a corrected version as soon as possible.TPC has removed all related analyses from our website.And we urge users to refrain from referring to the incorrect figures.I, and the whole TPC staff, regret this error and we will be providing corrected analyses as soon as we can.TPC is committed to providing the highest-quality information about America's tax system.However, we know we fell short this time.We appreciate the support that all of you have provided to TPC over the years and we will work hard to make this right.The study had found that the Republican tax reform bill currently being marked up on Capitol Hill would raise taxes for many low and middle income Americans, while slashing taxes on the richest.The analysis would undermine Republican claims that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced last week would primarily benefit the middle class over the wealthy.According to the preliminary report, in 2018 the top one percent of taxpayers those making more than $730,000 would receive 22 percent of the total cuts, or an average tax cut of $37,000.Middle income families (those making between about $48,000 and $86,000) would receive an average tax cut of $700 next year.Across the board, tax cuts in the bill would increase overall after-tax income by 1.5 percent next year, the report found, although it notes that the greatest benefits would go to would go to those with higher incomes.Some taxpayers, however, would pay more under the plan, a fact that has dogged Trump administration officials since they began the push for tax reform earlier this year.The new TPC analysis found that 12 percent of taxpayers would pay more in taxes next year.By 2027, the number of taxpayers who would pay more jumps to 28 percent, or nearly one in three households.This is due to a combination of factors, including the expiration of a proposed $300 family credit and the way certain credits are indexed for inflation.The Republican backed bill would accrue even more benefits to the top one percent of taxpayers in 2027 than it would in 2018, the report found: As much as 50 percent of the total tax benefits, or an average increase in after-tax income of 2.2 percent.Democrats were quick to highlight the new analysis Monday as evidence that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was little more than a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations."As the years roll on, wealthy taxpayers and corporations reap huge windfalls while middle class taxpayers get stuck with the bill," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement following the release of TPC's report."It's no wonder Republicans are trying to rush this bill through the more scrutiny it gets, the worse it looks," he said.President Donald Trump is traveling in Asia this week, but many of his chief economic policy advisers remained in Washington to help hammer out the details of the tax reform bill.
Trump praises Saudi king after crackdown:::::President Donald Trump praised Saudi Arabia's King Salman Bin Abdulaziz in a Tweet on Monday, days after the Saudi leader removed a number of prominent officials in an anti-corruption crackdown.Over the weekend, King Salman arrested a number of royals and businessmen.Officials have called it an anti-corruption initiative, while some outsiders have criticized it as a power move.Regardless, Trump backed the king on Monday.
Republicans begin revising tax bill as Democrats sharpen attacks:::::Republican lawmakers on Monday began revising their proposed overhaul of the U.S. tax code, as Democrats pointed to the loss of popular deductions as proof the legislation was an assault on the middle class.A draft bill unveiled last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives, if enacted, would be the biggest restructuring of the tax system since the 1980s and the first major legislative victory of the Trump presidency.Although Republicans generally support the bill's broader themes, including a sharp cut in the corporate income tax, there are rumblings of dissent over other elements, including repeal of the deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments.New York, California and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of that deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump's plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector."There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who will be big losers under this bill," Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said as the tax-writing panel convened to consider the bill.The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.The linchpin of the plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishment of a 25 percent tax rate for "pass through" businesses, which currently pay income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent.An analysis of the plan released on Monday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the wealthy would be the biggest beneficiaries, while more than one-quarter of taxpayers would see a tax hike over 10 years.The top 1 percent of earners, with annual incomes of more than $730,000, would receive a $37,000 tax cut, representing 22 percent of the total tax cut for individuals in 2018.By 2027, they would get 50 percent of the total benefit, according to the analysis.With Democrats united in opposition to the plan, Republican defections from a few traditionally Democratic-leaning states could be enough to torpedo it in the House.Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax-writing panel, pledged that lawmakers would have a chance to propose changes to the bill."Let me assure you this is the beginning of the tax reform process," he told the committee.Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it.In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Brady said another change would be a "carried interest" provision that lengthened to two years the time assets need to be held in order to be eligible for a lower tax rate.Carried interest is a share of an investment fund's profits typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors that goes to the general partners of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds.Under current law, high-income fund partners pay the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent on their carried interest income, instead of the 39.6 percent individual tax rate that applies to the ordinary wage income of high earners.President Donald Trump promised to close the loophole, which has benefited some of Wall Street's wealthiest financiers.
Al-Sisi says Trump has given US more Middle East influence:::::US has regained Middle East influence thanks to Trump: Egypt president 5:00 PM ET Mon, 6 Nov 2017 | 00:23 The president of Egypt has praised the efforts of his U.S. counterpart, claiming that President Donald Trump is improving the fragile security situation in the Middle East.Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is viewed as an American ally and was previously described by Trump as a leader who had "done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation."Speaking to CNBC over the weekend Al-Sisi returned the compliment, dismissing a suggestion that the U.S. promise to tear up a nuclear deal with Iran could destabilize the region.The Egyptian, who came to power as a military leader, instead insisted that security in the Middle East had improved under the stewardship of Trump.
New Jerseys next governor could be a Democrat who worked at Goldman Sachs:::::In a political era marked by populism, a former Goldman Sachs executive and major Democratic donor is the front-runner to become New Jersey's next governor.On Tuesday, New Jersey voters will choose between Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Kim Guadagno, the state's lieutenant governor.Murphy, the former bank executive, holds a comfortable lead in all recent polls.Murphy, 60, has had to defend his more than 20 years at Goldman while pushing a progressive platform.He has focused partly on boosting the working class and holding Wall Street firms in check.Murphy has also tried to avoid the shadow of the state's last Democratic governor, the unpopular Jon Corzine, who was Goldman's CEO before becoming a New Jersey politician.While Guadagno has cast Murphy as an out-of-touch "Goldman Sachs millionaire," the association appears to have done little to hamper his chances.Still, it remains to be seen how Murphy's Goldman past would affect his ability to enact worker-driven policy in New Jersey.Murphy's allies see a candidate who knows how to fix capitalism's flaws due to his work at the top reaches of the U.S. economy."I think he sees himself differently from some of the people who succeeded on Wall Street.I just think he sees the world differently than a lot of people on Wall Street do," said Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who chaired the Democratic National Committee when Murphy led its finance arm.The Murphy campaign did not respond to CNBC's requests for an interview or comment.Associations with Goldman or other Wall Street firms have opened candidates to attacks in recent races.In last year's presidential election, President Donald Trump targeted both Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and Republican primary opponent Sen. Ted Cruz for connections to the firm.Democrats have since hit Trump for filling the top ranks of the executive branch with wealthy former Goldman officials.After the surprise success of Sen. Bernie Sanders' populist presidential campaign and struggles in 2016 national elections, the Democratic Party appeared set to embrace more progressive candidates.Both Democrat and Republican rivals in the governor's race have criticized Murphy for failing to fit that mold due to his wealth amassed at Goldman.After joining the Wall Street titan in the early 1980s, Murphy spent more than 20 years there.During his career, he led the firm's Frankfurt, Germany, office and served as president of its Asia division.At Goldman, Murphy was reportedly renowned for his deal-making ability, which helped him advance through the company.His work in Asia, though, has sparked controversy.A investigation by the Star-Ledger newspaper in New Jersey showed that his division profited from an investment in a shoe manufacturer that had dismal working conditions.Murphy's campaign denied he had a role in Goldman making the initial investment.Before and after leaving Goldman in the mid-2000s, Murphy gave millions of his personal fortune to Democratic candidates and national and state party committees.He served as the party's finance chairman from 2006 to 2009, where he worked closely with Dean.Dean said he liked Murphy "instantly" the first time he met him.He described Murphy as charismatic and smart and said he listens and manages people well.After his DNC role, Murphy became the U.S. ambassador to Germany from 2009 to 2013.As a diplomat, he faced backlash over his sharp criticism of German officials in documents published by WikiLeaks.In one instance, he called German Chancellor Angela Merkel "insecure."Murphy's campaign has largely downplayed his work at Goldman, his role in Germany and his past as a major Democratic fundraiser.The candidate for governor has highlighted his working-class upbringing.His campaign website says he made his way through Harvard University by working part-time jobs and taking out loans.Guadagno has repeatedly cast Murphy as unable to identify with the average voter due to his wealth.At a debate last month, she called him a "Goldman Sachs millionaire" and tied him to Corzine, the state's "last Goldman Sachs governor."Corzine lost his 2009 re-election bid to Republican Gov.Chris Christie as the New Jersey economy reeled during the Great Recession.The attacks on Murphy's Goldman past have resonated little with voters, according to Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.Murphy entered the race as a relative unknown, so Guadagno faced a challenge in educating voters about his past at the firm and then making them care about it, he said.Guadagno "has not been able to make as much hay out of Murphy's past perhaps as she could have," Murray said.In a Monmouth poll last month, only 28 percent of New Jersey voters said they associated Murphy with his Goldman career.Thirty-four percent said they were unaware that he worked there.Seventy percent of voters said his Goldman work would have no effect on their choice for governor.As a Republican, Guadagno has likely faced more headwinds because of Christie's dismally low approval rating, Murray added.Murphy has struck a progressive tone in his campaign.Among other policies, he has called for investments in infrastructure and colleges, raising the minimum wage and mandating earned sick leave.Murphy has pushed for creating a public bank and divesting New Jersey pension funds from hedge funds and private equity.He has also called for a "millionaire's tax" and more aggressive prosecution of financial fraud.Dean contended that Murphy's experience on Wall Street has shown him why a progressive platform is necessary.Said Dean: "Sometimes, it takes someone who knows capitalism to fix it.I think Phil completely gets that because he's been on both ends of that."
The Trump Fed: New faces, but less experience and so bigger chances for a market disruption:::::There are three openings yet to be filled on the Fed's seven-member board of governors four if Yellen decides to step down after she is replaced as chair.There's no guarantee that Trump will pick a centrist in the Powell image to fill those other seats In fact, the president is facing a "very fierce" lobby from congressional Republicans to nominate Stanford economist John Taylor for a vacancy, said Larry McDonald, a veteran Wall Street bond pro and founder of "The Bear Traps Report" investor newsletter.Taylor would be expected to follow his eponymously named rule that prescribes where the Fed's benchmark funds rate should be based on economic data.Many Republican Fed critics favor a rules-based approach to policy, and in Taylor's case that could result in considerably higher rates."They look at this like the Supreme Court.The conservatives want a Gorsuch in there," McDonald said, referring to Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointment."They don't want another labor market economist quasi-socialist who wants to use the bank as a social engineering platform.They want a rules-based mechanism."McDonald, who said he met with three key senators on Capitol Hill last week, said the GOP would look favorably on Taylor or former Governor Kevin Warsh, who once was considered a front-runner for the Yellen seat and also is expected to take a more hawkish view.Neither Taylor nor Walsh responded to requests for comment."The market is probably a little complacent towards a rules-based shift," McDonald said.Warsh carries the experience of being on the Fed during the financial crisis, though Taylor would be a newcomer.Powell himself only came on board in 2014, which was after the Fed had halted its monthly bond buying program that bloated the balance sheet, and just before it was about to come off the zero interest rate policy that had prevailed since late-2008 during the worst of the financial crisis.
Paul Manafort's Trump Tower condo becomes the latest sticking point for prosecutors:::::The value of Paul Manafort's apartment in New York's Trump Tower is at issue in the prosecution of President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman and his longtime associate Rick Gates, both of whom face 12 counts related to money laundering and foreign lobbying.Manafort and Gates each pleaded not guilty.Special Counsel Robert Mueller questioned in a motion on Sunday whether the apartment, which Manafort bought in 2006, is actually worth as much as Manafort claims.Manafort's lawyers included the Trump Tower condo in a list of properties that Manafort was willing to put up as collateral to convince a judge to grant more favorable terms for his house arrest, which currently require that Manafort wear a GPS ankle monitor.Manafort asked for permission to travel between Virginia, Florida, Washington, D.C., and New York, as well as the removal of the GPS monitor.In a motion filed Saturday, Manafort's attorneys claimed that the Trump Tower condo has a fair market value of $6 million and a mortgage of $3 million, making the net asset value of the apartment about $3 million.But the government responded the following day, writing to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson that it "does not presently have sufficient information to assess the claimed net asset value of this property, or even to be confident that the property has equity in it at all."The problem with Manafort's claim that his condo is worth $6 million, they wrote, is that it isn't based on any appraisal or estimate of the actual apartment.Instead, Manafort used an appraisal for a different apartment in the building that he said was worth $4.5 million, and then he tacked on an extra $1.5 million because, he said, his apartment is on a higher floor, making it more valuable."Meanwhile, the government has searched open source real estate value estimators and found one that lists the value of Manafort's own unit as $2.5 million, and another that lists the value as $2.7 million," wrote Mueller's team.If this turns out to be accurate, then the $3 million mortgage that Manafort has on the property would make the apartment a liability, not an asset.Jackson agreed with Mueller's assessment on Monday, calling the Manafort property appraisal "a good start," but one that "doesn't begin to comply" with the rules for such bonds.Manafort's lawyers said they would work on developing a firmer appraisal for the Trump Tower condo.Prosecutors said they were comfortable with the appraisals of other properties in the bond package, however: An apartment on Baxter Street in New York City with an asset value of $3.5 million, and Manafort's home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which was valued at $1.5 million.Until Manafort's lawyers can reach a new deal with Mueller's team that is approved by Berman Jackson, Manafort and Gates will remain under house arrest.
Fed's Dudley appeals to Congress to 'do no harm':::::The Federal Reserve's point-person on Wall Street appealed to Congress on Monday to "do no harm" as it considers slicing back regulations put in place to protect the U.S. economy in the wake of the financial crisis.New York Fed President William Dudley, who announced Monday morning he would retire earlier than expected in mid-2018, said that while there were some rules that could be adjusted the main tenets of stronger capital, liquidity and clearing standards must be protected.U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress aim to loosen requirements on banks and financial markets in general to free up capital flow and encourage economic growth.But Dudley and other regulators have warned not to go too far in revamping rules and laws put in place to avoid a repetition of the 2007-2009 crisis and deep recession."As we reflect on potential changes to the U.S. regulatory regime, we should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions of people losing their jobs and homes," said Dudley, 64, a close ally of outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen."We had a woefully inadequate regulatory regime in place, and while it is much better now, there is still work to do," he added at the Economic Club of New York."We should finish the job as quickly as possible, and we should do no harm as we adjust our regulatory regime to make it more efficient."Dudley, among the most influential members of a central bank in the midst of a sweeping leadership overhaul, did not comment on monetary policy in his prepared remarks.Nor did he mention retirement from the New York Fed, which serves as the central bank's eyes and ears on Wall Street.
Trump reportedly prepped executive order that could gut Obamacare's individual mandate:::::Trump: Texas shooting is a 'mental health problem,' not about guns 10:42 AM ET Mon, 6 Nov 2017 | 01:19 If the penalty attached to the mandate disappears, many health people might drop their coverage, leaving the exchange plans heavier with sicker people who have high medical bills.That in turn would lead to ever-increasing insurance premiums, and further customer defections, a phenomenon known as a death spiral.House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News on Sunday that the repeal of the ACA's so-called individual mandate might be included in the GOP's tax bill."We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill," Ryan said in that interview."And that's one of the things that's being discussed."The Washington Examiner, citing an unnamed Republican senator, said that Trump decided not to sign his executive order on the mandate, for now, after hearing that Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., was proposing to repeal the individual mandate in the tax bill.Such a repeal would make it clear the mandate is no longer the law of the land.Trump's order would reportedly stop short of that because there would still be a requirement that most people have some form of health coverage but would effectively stop enforcing the penalty associated with not complying with the law.But if the GOP adds repeal of the individual mandate to the tax bill, it could make it more difficult to pass than it already might be.The bill has already drawn concern from deficit hawks in Congress for increasing the federal debt, and also has been criticized for capping the limit on deductions for mortgage interest and for repealing the deductions on one's federal income taxes for state and local income taxes.And the Republican Party's track record on full or partial repeal of Obamacare's provisions is dismal.Although Trump has promised to sign a repeal-and-replace bill, his fellow Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed to pass such a bill, despite having majorities in both the House and Senate.A White House spokesman declined to comment on the Examiner's report when contacted by CNBC.The spokesman said the administration does not "get ahead" of potential executive orders.In 2015, almost 6.7 million taxpayers were subject to the individual mandate penalty, and paid the government more than $3 billion as a result.Millions more claimed exemption from the mandate for a wide variety of reasons.In 2017, the tax penalty for not having health insurance coverage of some kind is the higher of 2.5 percent of household income, or $695 per adult.Trump last month signed an executive order that directed federal agencies to explore making a series of moves that could undercut the Affordable Care Act.Those potential actions included loosening restrictions on the offering of insurance plans by small business and on the duration of short-term insurance plans.On the same day Trump signed that order, his administration announced that it would cease paying Obamacare insurers crucial reimbursements for discounts those insurers by law must grant to low-income customers for their out-of-pocket health charges.The reimbursements are worth billions of dollars annually to insurers.Many health plans had raised their premium rates higher for 2018 than they otherwise would have because Trump had threatened for months to kill the payments.Although the administration's decision will save the federal government an estimated $10 billion in payments next year, it actually will lead to an increase in overall federal payments to Obamacare insurers.That's because when premiums rise for Obamacare plans, as they did in anticipation of the cutoff and will in future years, the federal government spends more on subsidies that reduce the premium prices for low- and middle-income customers.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal deficit will increase by almost $200 billion over the next decade as a result of Trump's decision to end the cost-sharing reduction reimbursements.
Tax cut-driven economic growth alone won't wipe out the deficit, top House tax writer Brady admits:::::Economic growth generated by GOP tax cuts won't be enough by itself to wipe out the federal budget deficit, top House tax writer Rep. Kevin Brady said Monday on CNBC."We know tax reform done right can grow the economy in a big way.But that alone won't get us back to a balanced budget," said the Texas Republican, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee."You have to eliminate dozens, if not hundreds of provisions out of the code to lower those rates and move us back to a balanced budget.""Growth alone, I acknowledge, won't get us back there," Brady admitted on "Squawk Box."The Trump administration has suggested previously the proposed tax cuts will be paid for entirely through economic growth and the cuts would not increase the budget deficit.Critics counter by saying that Republicans can't count on the economic growth to pay for the tax cuts, and that the GOP package as designed would add to the deficit and put the federal budget further out of balance.The House Ways and Means Committee is set to begin revising its tax reform plan on Monday to help ease some Republican lawmakers' concerns about the bill, which was unveiled last week.House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday that he expects the broad outlines of the bill to remain the same.Republicans are aiming to pass their tax legislation by Thanksgiving.In the CNBC interview, Brady also said he's looking to effectively close a tax loophole used by hedge funds by increasing to two years "the holding period on carried interest."This would make the tax rule less profitable to exercise.The provision, being utilized in the short term by hedge funds, was designed to reward longer-term investments like real estate.
Senator Paul suffers five broken ribs after assault: Reports:::::U.S.Senator Rand Paul's return to Washington may be delayed after he suffered five broken ribs during an assault at his Kentucky home, media reported on Sunday, citing a senior adviser to the Republican lawmaker.Paul's neighbor, Rene Boucher, has been charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury in connection with the incident on Friday, according to authorities.Boucher, 59, was released on bond."Senator Paul has five rib fractures including three displaced fractures.This type of injury is caused by high-velocity severe force," Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, said in a statement, according to multiple media reports."It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying," the reports quoted Stafford as saying.He added that the senator's type of injury could lead to life-threatening injuries.Paul, 54, also has lung contusions, Stafford said in the statement, according to the reports.The Bowling Green Daily News, citing an arrest warrant, said Paul told police his neighbor came on to his property in a gated community just east of Bowling Green and tackled him from behind.Paul had injuries to the face and trouble breathing because of a rib injury, the newspaper said.It was not clear what motivated the altercation and Paul did not go to the hospital, police said.Paul was mowing his lawn at the time of the attack, television station WAVE-TV in Kentucky reported."Kelley and I appreciate the overwhelming support after Friday's unfortunate event.Thank you for your thoughts and prayers," Paul said on Twitter on Sunday morning, referring to his wife.A man who answered Boucher's phone on Sunday, when a Reuters reporter asked to speak with him, said: "I'm sorry.I can't talk."Kentucky State Police said on Saturday that Paul and Boucher were acquaintances.The suspect is a retired physician, the Bowling Green Daily News said.The New York Daily News reported that a Facebook page for Boucher contained numerous postings critical of Republican President Donald Trump.Paul, an ophthalmologist, ran for the Republican presidential nomination before dropping out of the race in February 2016.
Trump boasts: 'The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me':::::Trump boasts: 'The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me' 11:09 AM ET Mon, 6 Nov 2017 | 00:45 President Donald Trumponce again claimed that he is responsible for the U.S. stock market's yearlong rally.Onboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters that he's the reason major equity indexes are trading at record highs."The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me," the president said."I've always been great with money, I've always been great with jobs, that's what I do.And I've done it well, I've done it really well, much better than people understand and they understand I've done well."It's not the first time the president has boasted that his presidency has propelled the market higher."Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25% increase," Trump tweeted last month.Many corporate executives agree that Trump should get some credit for the rally.In September, more than three-quarters of respondents to the CNBC Global CFO Council poll said Trump deserves at least some of the credit for the stock market's record run in 2017, with 17.1 percent saying he deserves "most of the credit."The CNBC Global CFO Council represents some of the largest public and private companies in the world, collectively managing more than $4 trillion in market capitalization across a wide variety of sectors.The quarterly poll was conducted Sept. 5-13.CNBC's David Spiegel contributed to this report.
Top House tax writer Kevin Brady says he's effectively closing the loophole for hedge funds:::::House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told CNBC that he plans to add on Monday an increase to the holding period on carried interest contained in the Republican tax bill, effectively closing a loophole that's been exploited by hedge funds by making it less profitable to exercise.Brady said on "Squawk Box" that the new holding period will help ensure the rules encourages "long-term, traditional real estate partnerships."He said the change also would seek to benefit "venture capitalists that are long-term as well," ahead of what's expected to be the beginning of revisions to the GOP tax reform bill to ease some concerns of holdout lawmakers.Monday evening, Brady introduced his proposed amendment which extended the holding period to three years.That figure is up from the proposed two-year holding period he had given CNBC earlier in the day.Carried interest is a rule in the tax code that lets the managers of some types of private investment funds hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, real estate and other types of vehicles pay a lower rate than most individuals.Carried interest has been U.S. law for more than 50 years as an incentive for long-term investment.Here's how hedge funds have used carried interest in the shorter term: Usually they charge 20 percent of gains in their funds in any given year on top of a 2 percent annual management fee they get, regardless of performance.For investments held for more than one year, profit is taxed at the lower capital gains rate of 23.8 percent, not the ordinary income rate of 39.6 percent.Profitable investments held less than one year are short-term gains taxed as ordinary income.Under the proposed change in the GOP reform package, hedge funds would still be able to take advantage of the carried interest rule as long as they adhere to the holding periods, Brady said.House Republicans unveiled their tax plan last week.The current bill would lower personal and corporate tax rates as well as seek to simplify the U.S. tax code.House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Sunday that he expects the broad outlines of the bill to remain the same.Republicans aim to pass their tax reform legislation by Thanksgiving.CNBC's Liz Moyer and Reuters contributed to this report.
New York Fed President William Dudley to retire in mid-2018, well before term ends:::::New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley, a key figure in the unprecedented government response to the financial crisis, will retire in mid-2018.Dudley, who has headed the bank since 2009, will likely retire sometime in the spring or summer of 2018 when his replacement is found and approved, sources told CNBC.His term ends in January 2019.A search committee has already been formed.The New York Fed confirmed the plans Monday morning.Dudley, who will be 65 next year, took the helm of the New York Fed when the banking system was still in the throes of the worst financial crisis of the post-war era.He previously had headed the New York Fed's markets group, a critical job that oversees the trades and market operations required to set the Federal Funds Rate.In both positions, Dudley was a principal player in Fed decisions concerning the demise of Lehman Brothers, AIG and Bear Stearns, along with emergency measures taken by the central bank to stanch a meltdown in the financial system.Largely under Dudley, the New York Fed was responsible for accumulating the trillions in assets the Fed purchased as part of the quantitative easing program, bringing its balance sheet up to $4.5 trillion.It is now responsible for the market operations underway to reduce the balance sheet.Dudley had told several colleagues he was planning to leave in 2018, and his departure is said to not be related to the decision last week by President Donald Trump to name Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the next Fed chairman.In doing so, Trump declined to renominate current Chair Janet Yellen, with whom Dudley has worked closely over the past several years.Dudley's departure comes at a time of dramatic change at the Fed.In addition to a new Fed chairman, Vice Chairman Stan Fischer left his post in October, and there are currently three open seats on the seven-member Board of Governors.That number may rise to four if Yellen leaves the board when Powell is confirmed and before others are nominated and confirmed by the Senate.As president of the New York Fed, Dudley holds a special spot among the dozen regional bank presidents.The incumbent always serves as vice chairman of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee and always votes at policy meetings; other regional presidents have a rotating vote.The choice of Dudley's replacement will be made by the New York Fed's board of directors and approved by the Federal Reserve board."I would especially thank Tim Geithner, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen for giving me the opportunity to work closely with them during the crisis and the subsequent economic recovery," Dudley said, in a Monday morning statement."I am extremely proud of the work we have done in New York, and as a System, from our efforts to help the nation navigate the financial crisis to beginning the process of normalizing the balance sheet to our work on reforming the culture of the financial services industry."Prior to joining the New York Fed, Dudley served Goldman Sachs as chief U.S. economist and a managing director.
Did President Trump block Jon Bon Jovi's bid to buy NFL team?:::::Before Donald Trump was president, he was in the running to buy the Buffalo Bills, along with rock star Jon Bon Jovi.Now, three years later, some organizers are saying Trump was behind efforts to block Bon Jovi's bid.Michael Caputo, a PR consultant for the NFL team who went on to work on Trump's presidential campaign, now says that the billionaire investor-turned-president asked Caputo to start a grassroots fan campaign called 12th Man Thunder which organized a fan petition to keep the team in Buffalo."Mr. Trump was convinced that the community wouldn't stand for a move," Caputo told the AP."So he sent me off to try to organize something with local fans to get that rolling."This fanned rumors and speculation that Bon Jovi's intention should he purchase the Bills was to move the team to Canada.More from USA Today: Vin Scully: 'I will never watch another NFL game' Owners to be deposed in Kaepernick case Cam Newton thinks comparing Panthers' season to the Titanic is a compliment "At the time I wish I could have told people," said Charles Pellien, one of the group's leaders."I just wanted to blurt out, 'Donald Trump is behind this!'" Neither the White House nor the Trump organization responded to requests for comment on the claim, which was first mentioned on a Buffalo-area radio show in March and reported last month by GQ magazine.Bon Jovi's reps also declined to comment.Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula ended up with the Bills, which still play in Buffalo.Contributing: The Associated Press
Domestic Abusers Are Barred From Gun Ownership, but Often Escape the Law:::::After that breach, Congress struck a delicate bargain with the National Rifle Association and passed legislation offering states grants to add more mental health records to the instant-check system.A domestic violence update could be next, especially for violators in or discharged from the military.An online repository of active records maintained by the F.B.I.s Criminal Justice Information Services shows that the Department of Defense had reported just one case of domestic violence as of Dec. 31, 2016.Although federal law lists 11 criteria that would bar someone from purchasing a gun including being the subject of a protective order for domestic violence or conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor all but a tiny handful of the militarys 11,000 reported cases were in one category: dishonorable discharge.Mr. Blumenthal, long a proponent of expanding gun safety laws, said that if the records in the online repository are accurate, it would be a major lapse.A 2015 Inspector General review faulted the Defense Departments level of compliance with the Lautenberg Amendment, as the 1996 law is known, but focused on vetting current and future service members, not on how military domestic violence cases were reported to the federal database.Laura Cutilletta, the legal director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said her group had reviewed multiple military documents pertaining to compliance with the Lautenberg Amendment and had not found a procedure for reporting convictions to the F.B.I.Clearly, they do have a process, she said, but theyre only sending the dishonorable discharges.Experts who investigate mass shootings say a history of domestic violence is often a missed clue.One example: the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.The wife of Omar Mateen, the gunman, described him in an interview with The New York Times as someone who angered easily, beat her and lived his life in secret.Photo We have seen over and over this pattern where in these notorious mass shootings, it is a very common thread where the person had a particular history of domestic violence, said Billy Rosen, the deputy legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety.A history of this particular kind of conduct may really demonstrate that someone has dangerous propensities and should not be allowed to have guns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Using F.B.I.data and other publicly available information, Everytown analyzed mass shootings in the United States that occurred from 2009 to 2016, defining a mass shooting as one in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter.Of 156 shootings that fit that category, 54 percent were related to domestic or family violence, the analysis found.In the case of Mr. Kelley, he entered a pretrial agreement much like a plea bargain in the civilian world where he pleaded guilty in return for capping his maximum sentence at 18 months.He was sentenced to a year of confinement, a reduction in rank from airman first class to airman basic and was discharged for bad conduct, according to Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force at the time.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Christensen said he believed that the assault case disqualified Mr. Kelley on two separate grounds under federal law from owning a gun.The first was pleading guilty to a crime with a maximum punishment of more than a years confinement; the assault on the stepson would have had a maximum of five years.The second, he said, was the Lautenberg Amendment.The real story is why, with these offenses, was he still able to buy a gun?Mr. Christensen said.He clearly should not have been able to.He noted that the military justice system uses different terminology than civilian criminal courts, which could explain why Mr. Kelleys conviction was not reported.That could be part of the problem here, our use of archaic terms that dont translate well to the civilian world, he said.When Congress adopted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996, the nation was in the mood to enact gun safety laws, said Richard Aborn, a longtime advocate for gun safety and the former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control.Lawmakers had already adopted a ban on military-style assault weapons that law has since lapsed and prohibited the purchase of large-capacity ammunition magazines.But the Gun Control Act of 1968, which regulated the purchase of firearms, stipulated that only convicted felons could be prohibited from buying guns.The question kept coming up, what about domestic violence, because its often a misdemeanor, and we knew that there was a linkage between gun violence and domestic violence, Mr. Aborn said.That was the birth of the whole conversation.But the laws definition of who is a domestic abuser is quite specific, said Mr. Rosen, of the Everytown group.The measure requires, for example, that the victim and the abuser have to have been married or have had a child together, or have lived together.Thus the Lautenberg Amendment does not apply to people who are dating, which gives rise to what advocates call the boyfriend loophole.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has introduced legislation that would close that loophole, and would also prevent stalkers from having guns.A 2014 report by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress reviewed conviction records in 20 states, and found that nearly 12,000 people across the country had been convicted of misdemeanor-level stalking, but were still permitted to own guns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Lautenberg Amendment was bare bones, said Kim Gandy, the chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence.There are a lot of gaps in the instant criminal background check system; the data is only as good as what goes into it.So if the data is not in the system, obviously there is a giant loophole there.
Trump Administration Will Support Work Requirements for Medicaid:::::She heaped criticism on the Obama administration, saying it had focused on increasing Medicaid enrollment rather than helping people move out of poverty and into jobs.Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration, Ms. Verma said.Those days are over.Jason A. Helgerson, the Medicaid director in New York State, said on Twitter that Ms. Vermas comments were absolutely awful.It was absurd for her to suggest that she was ushering in a new day for Medicaid by taking it away from millions of people, he said.Ms. Verma worked for years as a consultant to state Medicaid officials.With her guidance, her home state of Indiana expanded Medicaid eligibility under the governor at the time, Mike Pence, while emphasizing personal responsibility by requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums and contribute to health savings accounts.In her remarks on Tuesday, Ms. Verma did not renew Republican calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act.But she criticized the laws expansion of Medicaid, an option that has been taken up by 31 states.The thought that a program designed for our most vulnerable citizens should be used as a vehicle to serve working age, able-bodied adults does not make sense, Ms. Verma said.Average monthly enrollment in Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office, has climbed by nearly one-third, to 77 million people, since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that at least six states Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin have pending waiver requests that would require work as a condition of eligibility for some Medicaid beneficiaries.New Hampshire submitted its own proposal last week.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Community engagement is a broad term that states define in various ways.It can include not only paid employment, but also volunteer activities, going to school, job training, searching for jobs, caring for elderly relatives and even treatment for drug or alcohol abuse.Donna Checkett, a former Medicaid director in Missouri, said Ms. Vermas position on requiring such activities was 180 degrees different from that of the previous administration.Cindy Mann, who was the top federal Medicaid official under Mr. Obama, said Ms. Vermas objections to Medicaid coverage of working age, able-bodied adults were upsetting and disturbing.The Affordable Care Act gave states the flexibility and financing to cover that population in diverse ways, without seeking a federal waiver, Ms. Mann said.And she noted that the expansion of Medicaid had been defended by Republican governors including Chris Christie of New Jersey, John R. Kasich of Ohio, Rick Snyder of Michigan, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Brian Sandoval of Nevada.Ms. Verma also announced changes to speed the review of state requests for waivers of the federal Medicaid law.She said the Trump administration could approve some waivers for 10 years.Waivers have typically been approved for five years, with the possibility of an extension for three years.In addition, Ms. Verma said, if we approve an idea in one state and another state wants to do the same thing, we will expedite those approvals.She said the Trump administration would issue a scorecard measuring and comparing states performance in improving the health of people on Medicaid.The federal government and the states together spend more than $550 billion a year on Medicaid, and people deserve to know if the money is producing positive results, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Matt D. Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said state officials agreed with Ms. Verma that they should focus on Medicaid beneficiaries and the outcomes of the care provided.But, Mr. Salo said, we have a lot of disagreement with the contention that Medicaid should not be serving able-bodied adults of working age.State officials said that many Medicaid beneficiaries had low-wage jobs that did not provide health insurance for them or their family members.Ms. Verma insisted that the Affordable Care Act had given states perverse financial incentives, paying a higher share of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries.The A.C.A., she said, moved millions of working-age, nondisabled adults into a program that was created to care for seniors in need, pregnant mothers, children and people with disabilities, stretching the safety net for some of our most fragile populations, many of whom are still on waiting lists for critical home-care services while states enroll millions of newly eligible able-bodied adults.
Major Takeaways From Carter Pages Congressional Interview on Russian Election Meddling:::::Photo WASHINGTON A congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election released a transcript late Monday of a seven-hour interview lawmakers conducted last week behind closed doors with Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.Some details from the interview were previously known, including the fact that Mr.Page traveled to Russia in summer 2016, when he was part of the campaign.But the interview revealed new information about who in the campaign knew about the trip, what Mr.Page reported to the campaign and other trips he took last year.Below are excerpts and key takeaways from the transcript.It was widely known in the Trump campaign that Mr.Page was going to visit Russia in July 2016.Mr.Page testified that he told at least four members of the campaign about his trip.Among the officials were the presidents first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; Jeff Sessions, who served as a senior campaign official at the time and is now the attorney general; Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman who now serves as the White House communications director; and J. D. Gordon, a foreign policy adviser.MR.PAGE: I had just mentioned that I forget the exact specifics, but I had mentioned to them, it was Corey Lewandowski and I believe Hope Hicks and J. D., just that I had received this invitation, you know, just wanted to let you know.And I forget the exact terminology.MR.PAGE: So Corey said, if you have interest, you know, if its I forget the exact terms, but, you know, if you have Ill add that to the record.But essentially he said, we can if youre not going to you know, it has nothing REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY, REPUBLICAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA: I dont know.Thats why Im asking.MR.PAGE: No, not not if you know, if youd like to go on your own, not affiliated with the campaign, you know, thats fine.Mr.Page contradicted his previous public statements that he never met with Russian government officials during his trip.REPRESENTATIVE ADAM B. SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA: So, Dr.Page, two days ago, you told the public on television you had no meetings with anyone except essentially the man on the street, correct?MR.PAGE: Yes.MR. SCHIFF: Two minutes ago, you said you had no private meeting with Arkadiy.Is that correct?MR.PAGE: Yes.MR. SCHIFF: And now you say you did have a private conversation with him on the subject of U.S.-Russia relations.After meeting with government officials in Russia, Mr.Page reported to the campaign about his contacts.MR. SCHIFF: Following your meeting, your trip to Russia, did you send a memo back to the campaign that conveyed the results of your trip to Russia?MR.PAGE: I did offer some thoughts about some of my takeaways and experiences there, yes.MR. SCHIFF: And in that document, Dr.Page, didnt you state, on Thursday and Friday, July 7 and 8, 2016: Campaign Adviser Carter Page youre referring to yourself in the third person presented before gatherings at the New Economic School, N.E.S., in Moscow, including their 2006 commencement ceremony.Russian Deputy Prime Minister and N.E.S.board member Arkadiy Dvorkovich also spoke before the event.In a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems?This is a document Bates stamped Dr.Page, did you write that?MR.PAGE: I did.It was a general sentiment of, you know, hope for the future.Thats all he expressed in that brief hello.Mr.Page had difficulty recalling why he went to Budapest for the meetings and whom he met with.Along with traveling to Russia last summer, Mr.Page went to Budapest, where he met with Hungarian government officials, including the Hungarian ambassador to the United States at the time, whom he had met that July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.MR. SCHIFF: And was the purpose of your trip to Budapest in the late summer to visit with the ambassador?MR.PAGE: It was Ive actually been working on a renewable energy project.Or its one of the projects weve been looking at.And so theres an energy entrepreneur theres geothermal springs and developments going on in Hungary, and theyve been pitching that for quite some time to me.And so, when she mentioned she might be there that time and, you know, itd be interesting to just offered to meet up and maybe meet with a few people, I figured that might be a good opportunity to do something which I had been hoping to do for some time.MR. SCHIFF: So this conversation you had with the Hungarian ambassador at the Republican convention, you discussed a potential energy-related project with her?MR.PAGE: I cant remember if I we were talking more just foreign policy things.Mr.Page raised the possibility with campaign officials of Mr. Trump traveling to Russia to take Mr.Pages place at the graduation where Mr.Page was scheduled to deliver a speech.I got another idea, Mr.Page said in an email to Mr. Gordon and Walid Phares, also a campaign adviser.If hed like to take my place and raise the temperature a little bit, of course Id be more than happy to yield this honor to him.Mr.Page told lawmakers that for Mr. Trump, the trip would be similar to the one that Barack Obama made to Germany during the 2008 presidential campaign.Around the time that Mr.Page proposed the idea, George Papadopoulos, another foreign policy aide, was also pushing for Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to meet President Vladimir V. Putin.Mr.Page told lawmakers that he did not know that Mr. Papadopoulos was pushing a similar idea.
Trump Says Tougher Gun Laws Couldve Worsened Texas Death Toll:::::Photo SEOUL, South Korea President Trump said on Tuesday that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the shooting in a Texas church that killed 26 people and that they could have driven the death toll into the hundreds, since the gunman was shot by an armed bystander.Mr. Trump was asked during a joint news conference with the president of South Korea whether he would support extreme vetting of gun buyers, comparable to the vetting his administration has sought to impose on visitors from some predominantly Muslim countries.If you did what youre suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago, the president replied, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.If he didnt have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead, Mr. Trump said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump did not address the fact that the Air Force has said it should have entered the assailant, Devin P. Kelley, into a federal database after he was court-martialed on domestic violence charges years ago.That would have prohibited him from legally buying the military-style rifle he used to kill 26 parishioners on Sunday inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex.
Case Is Dropped Against Activist Who Laughed at Jeff Sessionss Hearing:::::Ms. Fairooz was arrested on Jan. 10 with two other demonstrators with Code Pink, a women-led rights group, on charges of disorderly and disruptive conduct, and parading or demonstrating on Capitol grounds both misdemeanors carrying a maximum possible sentence of six months in jail and $1,000 in fines.In May, a jury convicted Ms. Fairooz of both counts.But in July, Judge Robert E. Morin of the United States Superior Court of the District of Columbia ordered a retrial for Ms. Fairooz.He rejected the notion that her laughter alone could be a sufficient basis for a conviction, as federal prosecutors had argued at the trial.And the judge was uncertain if she had been convicted because of the laughter or because of her outburst as she was led away, Mr. Bogash said in July.During Mr. Sessionss confirmation hearing, Ms. Fairooz, who at one point held a sign that said, Refugees Welcome Stop Sessions, laughed when Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said Mr. Sessionss record of treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented.Ms. Fairooz was immediately removed by officers.She did not go easily.Her outburst as she was dragged out of the room Jeff Sessions is evil!she yelled, among other things was captured on video and used against her at trial.The United States Attorneys Office had argued in a motion that Ms. Fairooz had let out a loud burst of laughter, followed by a second louder burst of laughter.The police then tried to quietly escort Ms. Fairooz from the room, but she grew loud and more disruptive, eventually halting the confirmation hearing, the motion said.The two other demonstrators, Tighe Barry and Lenny Bianchi, were dressed as Ku Klux Klan members and stood up ahead of the hearing.They were acquitted on a count of disorderly conduct but were convicted on charges of parading or demonstrating, and were each sentenced to 10 days in jail with the time suspended on the condition that they successfully complete six months of unsupervised probation.As for Ms. Fairooz, she is happy and relieved, Mr. Bogash said on Tuesday, though he added that she felt it was a waste of resources.She feels that she didnt do anything that merited the amount of government time and money that went into trying this case.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It solidifies her political opinion against the people shes protesting, he said.Ms. Fairooz did not immediately respond to calls on Tuesday.Ms. Fairooz said in July she hadnt let out a burst of laughter, but rather that it was a giggle.I just couldnt hold it, she said.It was spontaneous.It was an immediate rejection of what I considered an outright lie or pure ignorance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Fairooz said she had not intended to disrupt the hearing.None of us planned to get arrested, she said.We just wanted to be a visible symbol of dissent.She also said she would continue to protest the Trump administration.
Top E.U. Diplomat Rejects Trumps Call for New Iran Nuclear Deal:::::Administration officials have sought in recent months to play down the nuclear deal and instead build a policy that seeks to confront Tehrans other activities in the Middle East, including its support for Hezbollah and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.But Mr. Trumps repeated denunciations of the accord he has called it a disaster, the worst deal ever and embarrassing to the United States have made the pact impossible to ignore.Photo After Mr. Trump declared his intention not to certify Irans compliance with the deal, a number of proposals began circulating in Congress, ranging from effectively dismantling the agreement to simply ending the requirement that the president certify it every 90 days.Ms. Mogherini acknowledged that the proposed options made this a delicate moment but refused to indicate which might violate the Iran accord, saying it was a domestic political matter.But changing or tinkering with an agreement that she said already permanently bars Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons as Mr. Trump has demanded was not going to happen, she said.And she emphasized that the deal took nearly 12 years to negotiate and includes 104 pages of extraordinarily technical details that make it unusually powerful.If you reopen one part of it, the entire agreement is reopened and you will probably enter into another 12 years of renegotiations, she said, adding that none of the other parties to the agreement Britain, France, the European Union, Russia and China would agree to such a step.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Mogherinis statements came in her third visit to Washington this year.On each trip, she has made barbed comments about the current administration, a reflection of widespread unhappiness in Europe with Mr. Trump and his message of America First.On Tuesday, for instance, she noted that the defense of human rights and democracy was a central pillar of the European Unions foreign policy.Here, I know, the thinking has gone in a different direction, she said.Critics of the Iran nuclear agreement have argued that Mr. Trumps threat to scuttle it would force Europe to renegotiate its terms not only in fear that Tehran would pursue nuclear weapons once the United States walked away, but also that American sanctions reimposed in the aftermath would hurt companies in the bloc.European diplomats have insisted for months that they would not buckle to such pressure from Washington, and Ms. Mogherini repeated that promise.We have made it clear that the European Union and its member states will protect European interests, Ms. Mogherini said.She implied that if the United States imposed sanctions that hurt European companies, the bloc would respond in kind.
Informant Earned $7 Million for Role in Benghazi Prosecution:::::Already, a jury has heard dramatic accounts from C.I.A.officers in disguises and other Americans who survived the attacks.Two other Libyans also provided damaging details about Mr. Khattala as federal prosecutors tried to paint an a damning picture of his activities before and after the attacks.In his lengthy testimony, Mr. Majrisi talked about how the Americans paid him $5,000 a month to spy on Mr. Khattala and arrange his capture at a seaside cottage about 20 miles southwest of Benghazi.Once Mr. Khattala was in American custody, Mr. Majrisi received the hefty reward, paid in two installments, and was relocated to Texas.He received other compensation from the F.B.I.too, paying for his familys expenses.Mr. Khattalas defense lawyer, Michelle Peterson, suggested Mr. Majrisis testimony was financially motivated.Its hard to keep track of all the money the U.S. government was paying you, wasnt it?she said.He said it was hard to remember because the events he recounted moved rapidly.Ms. Petersons cross-examination seemed to frustrate the informant at times on Tuesday.Mr. Majrisi provided a pivotal piece of the prosecutions case: He linked the Benghazi attackers to Mr. Khattala.As prosecutors played surveillance footage of the attack on the diplomatic compound, Mr. Majrisi identified a number of men and said three were very close to Mr. Khattala.The informant said the men were part of a hit squad that carried out killings on Mr. Khattalas behalf.The informant said Mr. Khattala himself could also be seen on surveillance video minutes after the attack began and later at the door of the diplomatic mission, holding an AK-47 assault rifle.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Peterson asked the informant whether he had special training when it came to recognizing faces on grainy video.He responded he had a very strong memory.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Later, Mr. Khattala began sharing incriminating information as the informant gained his trust.He even once showed the informant documents and computers, suggesting the materials had been taken from the diplomatic mission and that he knew the names of Libyans who had visited the American ambassador.On another occasion, Mr. Khattala showed Mr. Majrisi a mortar and shells he kept in his garage.Mr. Khattala told the informant he was expert in the use of mortars and bragged about his ability to hit targets even under the most difficult circumstances.A mortar was used to attack the C.I.A.base after the diplomatic compound had been overrun, its fire killing two C.I.A.contractors and wounding two other Americans.Mr. Khattala also spoke of his plans in the attacks, making reference to an American rescue force that had been delayed at the Benghazi airport after arriving from Tripoli.I intended then to kill everyone there even those who were at the airport, Mr. Majrisi recalled Mr. Khattala saying.During his testimony, the informant said Mr. Khattala told him the Americans were using a facility to spy on people in Benghazi, a possible reference to the base the C.I.A.had been using.Mr. Khattala suspected the American government was seeking to arrest him, according to the informant.He testified that Mr. Khattala told a group of militants at a mosque in Benghazi that he was wanted by the Americans.Mr. Majrisi said that after the capture of an Al Qaeda suspect in October 2013 in Tripoli, Mr. Khattala became paranoid, rarely leaving his house.When he did, he traveled with a group of men for safety reasons.He often changed his phone number and the vehicles in which he traveled.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The informant also said that Mr. Khattala was close to Mustafa al-Imam, who was apprehended late last month in Libya as a suspect in the Benghazi attacks.Mr. Majrisi said Mr. Khattala and Mr. Imam had been imprisoned together in Libya and that Mr. Imam was frequently at Mr. Khattalas house.He repeatedly identified Mr. Imam on the surveillance video from the attack.Mr. Majrisi said he began working in Libya with the Americans at the end of 2012, lasting until Mr. Khattala was apprehended in June 2014.Ms. Peterson said Mr. Majrisis American contacts worked for the Defense Department.Former American officials familiar with the operation said that operatives from the militarys Joint Special Operations Command debriefed the informant, instead of F.B.I.agents.Mr. Majrisi said he met with his American handlers every four months.His secret work, Mr. Majrisi said, was not without risks.He worried about his life.And he had frustrations with the pace of the operation.It took too long, he said.It wore me out, and accompanying him put me under suspicion.The informant suggested killing Mr. Khattala himself, so I can be at rest finally and my city would be at rest, because this person is a murderer.But that did not happen.Finally, the Americans designed an operation to capture Mr. Khattala.It was a comprehensive plan, Mr. Majrisi said.The informant said that the Americans bought a house on the coast, a place where Mr. Khattala would feel safe from rival forces headed by a former C.I.A.asset.One night Mr. Majrisi drove Mr. Khattala to the cottage, where members of the Armys Delta Force and an F.B.I.agent with the Hostage Rescue Team were waiting.The Americans detained Mr. Khattala while Mr. Majrisi went back to his car.He slept for hours.He later drove to Tripoli and met with American officials who gave him money.He then made his way to Tunisia and eventually, with the help of the F.B.I., he moved to United States with his family.
Care About Kids? You Should Want to Save This Tax Credit:::::My husband and I adopted our children through a private agency, Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children.As a nonprofit organization, it relies on client fees as well as donor support to do its work.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.The fees are significant, but are appropriate.Spence-Chapins clients are some of Americas most vulnerable citizens: babies.If a new mother is considering an adoption plan for her child, the agency can assume temporary guardianship of that newborn, ensuring that it is clothed and cared for and given medical attention, while its mother is provided with medical and counseling services as well as logistical support.Whether that mother determines that its best to be a parent herself or to place her child with a family that wants one, the agency will have fulfilled its mission: to care for the child.The time and expertise of the social workers, doctors, lawyers and others involved in this work should not come cheap.We were able to pay some fees associated with adoption in cash.With our older son, now 8, we became parents much more quickly than wed anticipated, and shuffled the balance of the expenses onto a credit card.That piece of debt quickly became abstract, as debt tends to; it was simply part of the larger financial picture that became more complicated once we had a small baby: health insurance, child care, clothes, diapers, those ridiculous swim and music classes that parents like us always seem to fall for.It was helpful to remember that this credit was in the offing; claiming it, and watching my tax bill effectively eliminated, felt like magic.Giving money to charity or converting your home to green energy are behaviors deemed beneficial enough to society that theyre worth encouraging via tax credits and deductions.Since 1996, the federal government has determined that making a family via adoption is similarly beneficial to society, and rewarded that choice with a tax credit.The decision to eliminate this benefit now feels as showy and insubstantial as the decision to close national parks whenever theres a budget impasse.It is uniquely galling that Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, one of the authors of the current tax plan, is himself a father by adoption.Representative Brady was not eligible for the credit because his family income is too high, so perhaps hes simply unable to imagine what a tax credit means to a middle-income family.My familys security and survival were not contingent upon this credit by any means, but we are undoubtedly better off for it, a rung higher on the ladder to the middle class, an inch nearer to being able to send our sons to college.I am pained to imagine the family that wants to adopt but decides it cant because of the costs.Agencies like Spence-Chapin promote the tax credit, and rightly so; pointing out that adoption is less financially burdensome than it might seem is simply good advertising, just as making adoption less financially burdensome is simply good social practice.Contemporary families can be made in many ways.You might step up when relatives or friends are unable to meet their obligation to their children.You might marry someone who is already a parent.Or you might, as in my case, yearn to create a family and decide to adopt.Adoptive parents are not saviors deserving of some special subsidy.(Though I would argue that those families who adopt children with special needs, which is not what my family has done, deserve the wholesale financial support of the federal government.)But tax incentives reward actions that positively affect society.Creating stable family units which will, in turn, raise yet another American taxpayer is as worthy as installing rooftop solar cells or leaving your fortune to your church.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the context of the federal budget, the $355 million that this credit costs the country is a paltry sum.No politician who is willing to discard this tax rule can claim to have the interests of American families at heart.
House Moves Ahead With Tax Bill as Pushback Mounts:::::Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, said Republicans would focus on clarifying what is in the bill as the House tries for a floor vote next week.The challenge to the American public is what is the truth about this bill, Mr. McCarthy said.I think whats most important is we should state the facts.The White House dispatched its top economic and legal adviser to meet with Democrats on Tuesday as President Trump sought to curry favor for the Republican bill.Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Marc Short, the head of legislative affairs, met with a dozen Senate Democrats on Tuesday afternoon at the Library of Congress to make a late plea for bipartisanship on the tax plan.Mr. Trump, who is traveling in Asia, called into the meeting and made a personal pitch for Democrats to support the bill by making the case that the tax plan would not help the wealthiest Americans.The president said this bill is really bad for rich people, said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who was in the meeting.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, said that Mr. Trump told the senators that the bill did not benefit him personally and that he was happy with that because it meant it was tough on the rich.Democrats generally disagree with the presidents assessment.According to Mr. Brown, Mr. Trump said that Republicans had to repeal the estate tax because there was nothing else in the legislation to benefit the rich.I think he may think that, Mr. Brown said.But nobody else in the room did.The House Ways and Means Committee opened a second day of debate on the bill, which will continue through this week.The committee chairman, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, said on Tuesday morning that he expected the bill to pass out of committee on Thursday and to move quickly to the House floor.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an interview on Hugh Hewitts radio program, Mr. Brady said that the bill would not be subject to amendments on the House floor.But he also said that Republicans were still considering further changes to the bill, including possibly restoring tax breaks to encourage adoption and including a provision to repeal the Affordable Care Acts requirement that most people have health insurance.Well work to continue to improve it at every step, Mr. Brady said, including as we send it to the House floor.That may be an uphill battle, as key groups begin coming out in opposition to parts of the bill, including a proposed excise tax of 20 percent on payments made by American companies to foreign affiliates.The provision is aimed at preventing American companies from shifting profits abroad through payments, such as royalties, made to subsidiaries or other foreign affiliates.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.American multinational corporations are especially concerned about the proposal, which would raise just more than $150 billion over a decade.They say the tax will wind up harming American companies and their consumers.The American Forest and Paper Association said it was very troubled by the provision, which it said would lead to massive overcollection of tax in the United States.The provision is also coming under fire from pharmaceutical companies and the small-government advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire Republican megadonor brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who are trying to generate opposition to the excise tax from other conservative groups.Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers and their network of donors, called the provision misguided.Tax specialists at multinational firms have spent the past several days struggling to calculate what their new effective tax rates would be under a change that most did not see coming.As currently structured, the provision probably is not administrable and could also be gamed by taxpayers, said Itai Grinberg, an international tax policy professor at Georgetown University Law Center.Separately, the rule alters the purposes of financial accounting in ways that may create incentives for abuse.Mr. Brady said lawmakers continue to make improvements at every step and are working with multinational companies to address their concerns.But make no mistake, he said, we have to have safeguards in place so that companies arent encouraged to shift their earnings and their profits off shore and to low tax havens, and we need strong guardrails to make sure theyre not importing deductions, exclusions and other tax rate issues.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Senate bill may drop the tax entirely and replace it with a different measure aimed at discouraging companies from shifting production overseas and then selling back into the United States, according to multiple lobbyists with knowledge of the discussions.A prominent conservative group, the Club for Growth, criticized the House bill on Tuesday for what it called four serious shortcomings, including maintaining the existing top tax rate on millionaires and phasing out the estate tax instead of repealing it immediately.But other groups continued to praise the bill, even as they worked behind the scenes to shape it more to their liking.The Business Roundtable, an influential lobbying group in Washington, announced a multimillion dollar national advertising campaign, including television, radio and digital ads, urging members of Congress to approve a bill.The ad features the line, Congress promised tax reform, and Congress needs to deliver.With the process underway in the House, business groups and other lobbyists began turning much of their attention to the Senate, which is expected to introduce its own version of the bill on Thursday.The Senate bill will probably eliminate deductions for state and local income, sales and property taxes for individuals, according to multiple lobbyists with knowledge of the deliberations.The future of the estate tax also remains unclear.While the House bill would phase out the tax that generally affects only the rich, some senators are skeptical that doing so is fiscally responsible.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said, The president is interested in repealing the estate tax, but suggested that Mr. Trump has bigger priorities in the tax bill.
Syria Joins Paris Climate Accord, Leaving Only U.S. Opposed:::::Photo WASHINGTON Then there was one.Syria announced during United Nations climate talks on Tuesday that it would sign the Paris agreement on climate change.The move, which comes on the heels of Nicaragua signing the accord last month, will leave the United States as the only country that has rejected the global pact.According to several people who were in a plenary session at the climate talks in Bonn, Germany, a Syrian delegate announced that the country was poised to send its ratification of the Paris agreement to the United Nations.This is the very last country that actually announced, so everyone has joined and the U.S. is now so isolated, said Safa Al Jayoussi, executive director of IndyAct, an environmental organization based in Lebanon that works with Arab countries on climate change.A White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, pointed reporters to a statement the administration made when Nicaragua joined the pact, noting there had been no change in the United States position.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.As the president previously stated, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms the are more favorable for our country, the statement said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story President Trump announced in a Rose Garden speech this summer that the United States would quit the deal, calling it bad for Americas economy.
The Paradise Papers Hacking and the Consequences of Privacy:::::Last month, the international law firm Appleby announced it had been the victim of a hacking and that information on its clients was in the hands of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the news gathering organization that broke the story of the Panama Papers in April 2016.On Sunday, material from that hacking became public.The Paradise Papers exposed the hidden financial dealings of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Queen Elizabeth and the athletic apparel company Nike, among many others.As revelations about tax-dodging airplane purchases and secret Russian ownership in tech companies came to light, Appleby declared that it takes its clients confidentiality seriously and billed itself as not the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act.In an age in which personal consumer data is routinely plundered for profit, its smart public relations for law firms like Appleby and the tax havens in which their clients hide their assets to present themselves as victims of a global crime epidemic.There is also genuine belief operating here.Jrgen Mossack and Ramn Fonseca, the founders of the law firm whose hacked files formed the heart of the Panama Papers, described their work as safeguarding their clients fundamental right to privacy in their financial affairs.Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca insisted that when their customers asked them to set up hundreds of thousands of anonymous companies, trusts and foundations, it too was in the interest of privacy.Photo However, in the world of offshore finance, privacy long ago became a corrosive secrecy.Appleby is a major player in a global offshore industry that helps multinational corporations and the mega-wealthy legally move money beyond the reach of the taxman through a network of tax havens and secret financial centers.As a lawyer at Mossack Fonseca candidly wrote in a confidential internal memorandum, 95 percent of our work is selling vehicles to avoid paying taxes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The amounts involved are staggering.An estimated 8 percent of household financial wealth is held offshore, representing a loss in annual global tax revenue of about $190 billion.But this pales in comparison to the tax avoidance and tax evasion by the large multinational companies that use this system.All told, more than $7.6 trillion may well be hidden in tax havens around the world, according to Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the issue.
No War Threats From Trump, Who Tells Koreans It Will All Work Out:::::Plans for an unannounced visit by Mr. Trump to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea were foiled on Wednesday morning by bad weather.Dense fog prevented the presidents helicopter from landing near one of the worlds most dangerous borders.Mr. Trump, who visited with American and South Korean troops on Tuesday at Camp Humphreys south of Seoul, the South Korean capital, noted that the United States military had positioned three aircraft carriers and a nuclear submarine in the Pacific.We have many things happening that we hope, we hope in fact, Ill go a step further we hope to God we never have to use, Mr. Trump said.When pressed by a reporter, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he still thought negotiations with North Korea would be a waste of time, making an uncharacteristic effort to avoid a remark that might have inflamed tensions.I dont want to say that I just dont want to say that, Mr. Trump said.You can understand.His visit to Seoul was the most diplomatically challenging leg of Mr. Trumps 12-day, five-country trip through Asia, bringing him face to face with a public and a president wary of his combative approach on North Korea.To many of Mr. Moons progressive supporters, Mr. Trump poses as much of a threat to peace as Mr. Kim, if not more so.Dont come, Trump!You talk about war whenever you open your mouth, a large banner read during a protest near the United States Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday.Go away, Trump!hundreds of labor activists and other progressives shouted in downtown Seoul, where thousands of police officers were deployed to keep security.No Trump, no war!Advertisement Continue reading the main story A short distance away, across a police blockade, hundreds of conservatives welcomed Mr. Trump with South Korean and American flags.South Korean conservatives are deeply skeptical of Mr. Moons approach, calling it nave.They back Mr. Trumps hawkish view of the North, although they, too, stop short of supporting war on the Korean Peninsula.We believe in Trump!their signs read.Mr. Trumps restrained tone may have an easy explanation: He has been at odds with Mr.Moon, who took office in May this year, about how to deal with the North, and he was eager to avoid any public demonstration of the split.Video When Mr. Trump this summer threatened North Korea with pre-emptive strikes or what his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, warned could be a necessary preventive war Mr.Moon went in the other direction.He said that he had been guaranteed a veto over any offensive military action against the North, and that he would not allow such action.War with North Korea, he assured his public, was unthinkable.Mr. Trump and his aides fumed, and the president suggested Mr.Moon was practicing appeasement.The White House view is that the only way the North will relent is if it believes Mr. Trump is perfectly willing to order a strike on the countrys nuclear facilities, even if that risks hundreds of thousand of casualties.But to let that difference in approach spill out into the open would have played right into North Koreas hands.It has tried, over nearly seven decades, to break the alliance.So the two leaders decided to stick to common, long-range goals.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Trumps change in tone notwithstanding, his advisers have been making the case that North Koreas ambition is to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force, and that traditional deterrence cannot stop the North once it has a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.Many observers are skeptical of both assertions, especially in South Korea, which would suffer greatly if a pre-emptive strike on the North led to all-out war.They argue that the leaders of North Koreas Communist government are not planning to use nuclear weapons to attack the United States or its allies, because they know that Washington would launch an overwhelming counterattack.Rather, they say, North Korea is building its nuclear weapons out of fear, hoping that the arms will protect the country from invasion or from outside intervention, in the case of a domestic uprising allowing the North to focus on economic development.The view that North Korea would start war to communize Korea doesnt make sense anymore, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.North Korea knows that if it ever uses a nuclear weapon, it means self-destruction.South Korean officials said they hoped that Mr. Trumps visit to this densely populated capital of 10 million people would bring home to him the consequences of a potential war.Mr.Moon supports Mr. Trumps call for maximum sanctions and pressure, but says that those alone will never persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.Advertisement Continue reading the main story American officials in the region, too, were hoping the presidents trip would help Mr. Trump gain a new perspective on how Seoul and Tokyo view the threat from up close; the regional trends affecting Asia beyond North Korea, including Chinese assertiveness; and the costs and consequences of military action, according to one American official.From a dining hall at Camp Humphreys, where Mr. Trump had lunch with troops, to the Blue House, where he met with Mr.Moon, everything he saw on Tuesday could become a fiery battlefield in the event of a military exchange with North Korea.But if the firsthand experience left an impression on Mr. Trump, he did not show it.At times, his tone was almost blithe.Before being briefed by American and South Korean military commanders, he said of the confrontation with the North: Ultimately it will all work out.Because it always works out has to work out.Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, the American commander, wore a grim expression as he listened to the president.Mr. Trump also reprised his role as a chief salesman for the American defense industry.South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense, Mr. Trump said.And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.Mr. Trump, who is scheduled to travel to China on Wednesday, added about North Korea, It is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.But in a reminder of the challenge that Washington faces keeping even its allies on the same page, South Korea invited an 88-year-old Korean comfort woman, or a former sex slave for Japans World War II military, to Mr. Trumps state banquet and put on the menu a dish of shrimp said to have been caught in waters near a set of disputed islets.The sex slave issue is one of the most contentious dividing Japan and South Korea, and the islets known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan lie at the center of a bitter territorial dispute.The Japanese government protested the banquet arrangements, accusing South Korea of moves that could negatively affect the close coordination among the allies.As Mr. Trump arrived in Seoul, there was renewed evidence of activity at a site in North Korea where the North has conducted underground nuclear tests.It was not clear, however, whether the activity suggested another imminent test or merely construction on a tunnel that could be used for tests.
Why Is America Wasting So Much Energy?:::::Yet many of the federal efficiency programs stimulating this progress are under threat in Washington.The Trump administration has proposed killing Energy Star and all but eliminating other efficiency programs, with cuts averaging nearly 80 percent.Congress wisely rejected these proposals initially for the short term, but legislation recently passed by the House isnt much better, proposing to cut many of these money-saving and job-creating programs nearly in half.A House subcommittee was scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss altering Energy Star in ways that could compromise the program, which supporters call one of Americas most successful public-private partnerships.The government-backed effort estimates it has saved consumers and businesses $430 billion on their utility bills since its launch in 1992, and it has grown to 16,000 partners (including a wide range of manufacturers, retailers, builders and utilities).Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Eliminating or weakening Energy Star and other efficiency programs is absolutely going in the wrong direction.Energy efficiency is not new it was our grandparents energy policy: Dont waste.Save as much as you can for later when you, or future generations, might need it.We need energy efficiency to accommodate emerging technologies and population growth, which are putting demands on our electricity grids that our grandparents never imagined.We can do so much more than shutting off our lights or keeping a close eye on the thermostat.Thats where smart policy and programs come into play.Our federal agencies run some of the most innovative efficiency programs in the world.They work with American manufacturers on the latest efficiency technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness.They develop efficiency standards for household appliances, saving families an average of $500 per year.They provide testing and expertise to local and state governments trying to adopt the most effective building-efficiency codes for homes and commercial buildings.This is not federal bureaucracy run amok.Its good government that will save taxpayers money and drive our economy.To critics who say that government intervention isnt needed to save energy or efficiency standards are intrusive federal mandates, the best response is simply to invoke a decades-long record of economic and environmental success across the nation, dating back at least 30 years, when the first legislation authorizing federal efficiency standards was signed by President Ronald Reagan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today, according to the Energy Department, energy efficiency supports 2.2 million American jobs from contractors weatherizing houses to workers manufacturing more efficient appliances and equipment.Imagine how many more jobs could be created if we were to turn our waste into opportunity.Evidence shows that Americans of all stripes want reasonable energy efficiency policies.Shortly after the November 2016 election, a poll released by the Conservative Energy Network found that 94 percent of respondents said policies supporting energy efficiency were important.Among those who supported Donald Trump, the number was 90 percent.Its hard to beat those numbers.Congress should come together and deliver strong funding for federal efficiency programs.Energy efficiency presents both Republicans and Democrats with an opportunity to reach consensus on an issue that is good for their constituents and the environment.Taxpayers and customers win.Its a nonpartisan solution to a nonpartisan challenge.
Sutherland Springs Only Happens to Be in Texas:::::Photo HOUSTON Im already feeling sorry for Johnnie Clay Langendorff, who is probably well on his way to a dinner invitation at the Trump White House for driving the car that chased Devin Patrick Kelley out of Sutherland Springs, with an armed sidekick literally riding shotgun.Ive already caught him on several broadcasts, with the word hero running on the banner below the video of Mr. Langendorff respectfully yes maaming and no sir-ing the confounded reporters.I suspect its only a matter of time before the N.R.A.tries to give the kid in the cowboy hat and starched denim shirt whatever award it already has or is currently cooking up for valor under fire.There will, no doubt, be references to the long, tall Texan, his drawl and his style.That bull skull tattoo with the horns curling under his jawline?Central casting could not have done better.Similar accolades will no doubt be lavished on Stephen Willeford, who jumped into Mr. Langendorffs truck and was, possibly, ready to take Mr. Kelley out while they were giving chase.Mr. Willeford had already used his weapon to take a crack at the gunman fleeing the First Baptist Church, and once he hitched a ride with Mr. Langendorff, he kept a bead on Mr. Kelley until the law finally arrived.We will never know whether Mr. Willeford would have had to fire or not, or would have killed Mr. Kelley or not, because Mr. Kelley killed himself somewhere between the church and the ditch he ran his car into.At least, some of us will never know.President Trump seemed to have an answer: Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it wouldnt have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse.And there was our state attorney general, Ken Paxton, crowing about Texas open carry law, which allows anyone to hang out just about anywhere with a gun on their hip.Mr. Paxton put it this way: And so if its a place where somebody has the ability to carry, theres always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So of course it stands to reason that the heroes who get that opportunity are Texans.What a boon for the pro-gun forces!I can imagine these two on Fox News now, assuming they dont turn out to be in favor of something crazy like an assault weapons ban.But we know what will happen next: Mr. Langendorff and Mr. Willeford will have their 15 minutes of fame, and then we will move on to the next mass shooting in another state where any number of people will die because no one can be bothered to go up against the N.R.A.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.But before the two men get exploited for their bravery and before I get pilloried for politicizing a disaster I would like to say that there is nothing particularly Texan about a mass killing these days.People moved heaven and earth to help last week in New York, and before that in Las Vegas.
About 2,500 Nicaraguans to Lose Special Permission to Live in U.S.:::::Many of the more than 300,000 people shielded from deportation under the program have lived in the United States for years and bought homes, embarked on careers and given birth to children who are American citizens.Now they face an uncertain future.People protected under the program will be given six months to leave after their current permissions expire.The temporary status for the 86,000 Hondurans and 5,000 Nicaraguans in the program expires in early January, and Monday was the deadline for the Department of Homeland Security to decide whether to renew that status.It has until Thanksgiving to decide whether to extend the protection for thousands of Haitians.The program covers 10 countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The Trump administrations decisions to rescind the temporary protection status for Nicaraguans is part of its effort to reduce both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.The administration has moved aggressively to enforce the nations immigration laws, arresting and deporting those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes and reducing the number of refugees.Democratic members of Congress and immigration advocates called the move inhumane.Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said that sending tens of thousands of people back to Central American nations still recovering from natural disasters or internal strife could destabilize those countries.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.In a statement, Mr. Cardin said the effort was part of the White Houses radical anti-immigration agenda, which ignored an honest assessment of conditions in each of the countries.A coalition of immigration groups also criticized the Trump administration for ending the protection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump administrations recommendation to terminate temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of people from all over the globe living in the United States is cruel and shameful, Steven Choi, the executive director for the New York Immigration Coalition, said at a news conference on Monday in New York.America will not be greater or safer by sending back people whove made their lives here.Belinda Osorio, 48, who arrived in 1991 in the United States from Honduras seeking work, said she was relieved the news had not been as bad as she had feared.She had read and heard that her temporary protected status would be cut off immediately.Still, it was only a postponement of the panic that was to come.I dont think six months is going to fix anything because what are we going to do after six months?said Ms. Osorio, a housekeeper at one of the Disney World resort hotels in Orlando, Fla.Were not going to leave.Im not going to leave my country.Im not going to take my kids to a dangerous country.She said that she was afraid that if they were forced to return to Honduras, her 14-year-old son would be forced to join a violent gang.Her 72-year-old mother has been threatened by gang members who have demanded money from her, and Ms. Osorio said she feared she and her children, as returnees from the United States, would have it even worse.Like many other recipients of temporary protected status, Ms. Osorio built a life here expecting that she would not be forced to return anytime soon.She had married an American citizen, another hotel employee, with whom she had two children; it was through her job that her family had medical insurance.For years, she said, she had been trying to apply for a green card based on her marriage, and she hoped she would succeed before the temporary program expired.At least I have hope with my husband, but theres a lot of people, they dont have nothing.Their only hope is T.P.S., she said.Its not fair after so many years working so hard in this country, and they just want to get rid of us just like that.John F. Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security and now the White House chief of staff, had extended temporary protected status for Haitians in May, giving them an additional six months to stay in the country.Salvadorans, who make up about 60 percent of those in the Temporary Protected Status program, were first granted protection in March 2001 after a series of earthquakes in the country.Their protective status will expire next year, on March 9.The status is renewed periodically, and recipients have to keep their permits updated to avoid deportation, paying $495 each time.The Obama administration typically granted 18-month waivers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republicans of Florida, and Representatives Frederica S. Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Democrats of Florida, introduced a bill that would try to provide permanent legal status for some Haitians, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Hondurans.
Trump Says Issue Is Mental Health, Not Gun Control:::::As more information became available on Monday, it turned out that the gunman in Texas, identified as Devin P. Kelley, 26, should have already been barred from purchasing firearms because of a domestic violence conviction.While serving in the Air Force, he was convicted of two charges in 2012 by a court-martial after assaulting his wife and breaking his infant stepsons skull.But the Air Force never entered his name in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.The current law also bans gun sales to anyone adjudicated mental defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution or incompetent to handle own affairs.But the database relies on states to transmit such information to the federal government, and compliance is patchy depending on the state.Mr. Trump made no suggestion on Monday that he would follow up his assessment of the Texas shooting with any concrete policy proposals.After the Las Vegas massacre, he indicated that he would consider new restrictions on so-called bump stock firearm accessories that can convert a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic weapon, but so far he has not followed up.Shortly after becoming president, Mr. Trump signed legislation repealing a regulation enacted by President Barack Obama intended to add the names of mentally ill Americans registered with the Social Security Administration to the database for gun purchase background checks.The regulation, a response by Mr. Obama in part to the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., would have affected those unable to work because of severe mental impairment and unable to manage their own Social Security financial benefits.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In February, both houses of Congress passed a resolution revoking the resolution.Mr. Trumps aides said at the time that he signed it because he did not want to deprive law-abiding citizens of their constitutional rights.Critics said Mr. Trumps action in February belied his words on Monday.If this is a mental health problem, it begs the question of why we let people with mental health problems have access to firearms, said Cecilia Muoz, who was Mr. Obamas domestic policy adviser.She acknowledged that it was tricky determining who had a mental illness serious enough to make them a risk and therefore worthy of inclusion in the background check database.It is controversial, she said.Its not easy to figure out where you draw the line.But it is important to draw a line.Others argued that targeting mentally ill people in a broad way would be unfair to millions of Americans who posed no threat to anyone and would not solve the problem.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jeffrey Swanson, a psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor at Duke University, said a study of 82,000 people given a diagnosis of serious mental illnesses in Florida between 2002 and 2011 found that they were no more likely to use a gun to harm others than the rest of the population about 213 crimes annually per 100,000 people compared with 217.Theres this horrible mass shooting, and its so disturbing and so frightening and so irrational and people want an explanation for it, he said.Someone whos capable of going out and massacring so many strangers, they cant be like you and me, they must be mentally ill. And then that gets overgeneralized.Mr. Swanson said Mr. Trumps reference to mental health was a huge dodge to avoid a gun control debate.But Mr. Swanson said that rather than focusing on mental health generally, policymakers should focus on violent history as a better predictor of gun violence.We dont have to tolerate this, he said.We can live in a less violent society.
How the Virginia Governors Race Will Be a Test of Trumps Impact:::::Here are some factors we will be paying attention to as voters go to the polls Tuesday.Virginia Is Becoming Two States in One Virginias politics are becoming sharply bifurcated by region in ways that reflect the countrys political trends.The so-called urban crescent, stretching from the Washington suburbs down to greater Richmond and east toward the Chesapeake Bay, is growing rapidly thanks to an influx of transplants who are transforming it into a Democratic bulwark.The western half of the state, as well as the southern tier bordering North Carolina, are seeing little population growth, and in some places even a decline, while becoming deeply Republican.These trends are turning Virginia from purple to blue, but it is an uneven progression for Democrats because as in much of the country many of their core voters are less likely to vote in nonpresidential years.So while Hillary Clinton carried Prince William County, a booming and ethnically diverse Washington exurb, by 21 points last year, Gov.Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, only won it by eight points in 2013.A Virginia Democrat with rural roots such as Mr. Northam, who still carries the accent of his native Eastern Shore, may be able to outperform Mrs. Clintons dismal numbers in the Republican-trending rural reaches of the state.But even if Mr. Gillespie performs as well as Mr. Trump in the countryside, it will not be enough to win if he cannot cut into the growing Democratic advantage in Virginias population centers, especially in vote-rich northern Virginia.After all, Mr. Trump still lost the state by more than five points even as he dominated rural Virginia.____ The Education Divide Could Still Matter The gulf between college-educated whites and white voters without a college degree was a defining demographic split of the 2016 presidential election, but the divide has not been as pronounced in the elections held since.Still, could the education gap be poised for a comeback?A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll ahead of the race, among other surveys, showed Mr. Northam holding a clear lead among well-educated white voters, while giving Mr. Gillespie a vast advantage edge among white voters without a degree.If Mr. Gillespie struggles to run ahead of Mr. Trump among well-educated voters, it might be a warning sign that even establishment-friendly Republicans cannot count on returning to pre-2016 levels among a group that used to lean their way.And it should worry Republicans in historically conservative, well-educated districts across the Sun Belt, like those in Orange County, Calif., or the suburbs of Dallas and Houston.____ Black Voter Turnout Is Still Crucial for Democrats In Virginia, African-Americans make up 19 percent of the population, the second highest of any state carried by Hillary Clinton.They have lifted Democrats in the urban centers of downstate Virginia, like Richmond or Norfolk, which combine to rival Northern Virginias contribution to statewide Democratic margins.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Democrats have struggled to rally strong turnout among black voters since President Barack Obama was last on the ballot, even as white Democratic turnout surged in a string of special elections across the country.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.More weak turnout among black voters in a regularly scheduled election could be interpreted as a clue that the Obama-era surge is waning, while a stronger turnout would lift Democratic hopes in competitive congressional districts with a sizable African-American population.____ How to Read the Tea Leaves as Returns Come In The early returns in Virginia can often be misleading because Fairfax County, the states most populous locality and a pillar of Democratic strength, typically reports its results late at night.But Loudoun County just next door may offer some better, and earlier, insights about the outcome of the race to say nothing of how high-income moderates are responding to the Trump-era Republican Party.A fast-growing jurisdiction that was heavily farmland until recent decades, Loudoun has become a bellwether for if a Republican can win or even remain competitive in Virginia.When Mr. Gillespie lost by less than a single point statewide when he ran against Senator Mark Warner in 2014, the Republican carried Loudoun by about 450 votes.Another large locality that will be telling is Virginia Beach.A hub of active-duty and retired military, it often favors Republicans, including Mr. Trump last year.But Mr. Northam lives in nearby Norfolk and if he is able to come close to breaking even in Virginia Beach it will greatly complicate Mr. Gillespies path to victory.____ Downballot Races Could Make a Difference While the governors race has gotten the bulk of the attention in Virginia, all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are also up for grabs.Democrats, reeling from their losses last year and determined to cut into the Republican House majority, have fielded candidates against 54 of the 66 House Republicans.And while it is usually the top of the ticket that drives turnout, the two parties have poured so much money into a group of contested House races that there may be something of an updraft in a handful of increasingly diverse districts.This is most likely to happen in Prince William County and a pair of nearby independent cities, Manassas and Manassas Park, which include growing Hispanic populations and have a seen a surge in early voting participation compared to the governors race four years ago.____ Photo How the New Jersey Governors Race Could Go The contest to replace Gov.Chris Christie in New Jersey has largely flown under the national radar because Mr. Murphy has so dominated the race.But New Jersey offers a potential boon to Democrats eager to consolidate control in more liberal-leaning states.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Should Mr. Murphy win, New Jersey would become the sixth state in the country to have Democrats in control of both the statehouse and the state Legislature.Look for Mr. Murphy to exceed previous candidates in the heavily urban northern part of the state, particularly Hudson, Essex and Bergen counties, to lock the election up early.____ What to Watch in Other Races Across the Country There are a number of other regularly scheduled and special elections across the country on Tuesday.In Washington State, if Democrats win a hotly contested State Senate election in the Seattle suburbs, they could take full control of state government and end up with a blue wall along the West Coast.The stakes are somewhat lower in county executive races in Westchester, N.Y. and Nassau County, N.Y., but each will be watched as another indicator of how Republicans are holding up in traditionally Republican, well-educated areas.Here is a breakdown of key issues in New York-area races, including the one for New York City mayor.And there is a Maine ballot measure that would expand Medicaid over the wishes of the states Republican governor, Paul LePage.Not only would it provide health care to thousands of low-income Maine residents, but it will be taken as a measure of the popularity of the Affordable Care Act after Republicans failed to repeal the law this year.
After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Havent Changed Anything:::::Nearly all of the private pollsters interviewed for this article have, at minimum, begun to do something about education.There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last years polls were too favorable to Democrats.Its likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines.The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nations leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the polls final estimate.For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference.It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governors race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll.With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.Education Can Make a Big Difference How the Upshot/Siena College poll of Virginia might have gone if it followed three common public polling methods and used weights for: The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate The Upshot/Siena College methodology without education with education +7 Dem.+2 without education with education +8 Dem.+5 without education with education +5 Dem.+4 with education +3 Dem.The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate The Upshot/Siena College methodology without education with education +7 Dem.+2 without education with education +8 Dem.+5 without education with education +5 Dem.+4 with education +3 Dem.There are a few pollsters in Virginia like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election.Most others werent weighting by education before 2016 and arent weighting by it today.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The disparity can be extreme.Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates.Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll.A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate.A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesnt mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016.By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trumps way appears to have done so.Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters.Theres also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.Education Is a Mystery It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes.But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.Its not completely unreasonable.Last years polling error was an odd one.It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences.There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan.But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent.Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.If pollsters didnt take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error.Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone elses, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump.And most public pollsters didnt conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didnt think education was decisive.Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: Its hard for pollsters to even know if theyre getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont weight to education because its pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education, said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls.Thats not something thats necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.Hes right.Its not easy to weight by education, and its especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files the big data that powers most campaigning polling and analytics.Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate.R.D.D.surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election.Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D.have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files.To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do.Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.Whats the alternative?A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isnt a definitive benchmark for weighting.There still isnt universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: Theres a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters.But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.This is the first time ever that Ive weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018, said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, because education is a pretty damn good predictor.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side.The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now theyre generally doing more.Theres still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.Its kind of a cop-out, said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.You cant say I cant deal with education because I dont know the exact weight of it.You wouldnt not weight on race because you couldnt figure it out.Is It Enough?The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.The cause for debate is simple.Even weighting by education wouldnt have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge.One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.But theres a more ominous possibility.It wasnt just that polls didnt capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didnt get the right less educated white voters.Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas.Maybe they missed those who dont work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture.Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve.Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since baristas arent exchangeable with factory workers, as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it.Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but its nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry.Thats in part because theres limited public evidence to support it at this stage.Its also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible.But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future.But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms.If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, its hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.
Upshot/Siena Poll Gives Democrat Narrow Lead in Virginia Governors Race:::::The poll asked respondents how they voted in last years presidential race, and there was a consistent pattern across demographic groups and geography.The governors race, although reminiscent of 2016, hasnt quite polarized voters to the same extent.White working-class voters said they backed Mr. Trump by a 48-point margin, 67 percent to 19 percent, somewhat wider than Mr. Gillespies 40-point edge.Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points.Its a pattern up and down the ballot.The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year.In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trumps strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clintons showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgias Sixth Congressional District.But the Virginia contest seems to have a distinct dynamic.Mr. Gillespie, with establishment roots as a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has run a campaign plainly intended to rally Mr. Trumps supporters, making the question of whether he can approach Mr. Trumps strong tallies somewhat more interesting.If Mr. Gillespie prevails or runs well ahead of Mr. Trump, it might be interpreted as a sign that establishment Republicans can excel by embracing Mr. Trumps message.According to this view, they could lure white working-class Trump supporters with his message on race and immigration, while maintaining greater support among well-educated voters with their establishment-friendly credentials and tone.Even if Mr. Gillespie loses by a small margin, his campaign could be judged a success, given national political conditions and Virginias Democratic lean.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite.Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governors race, and Republicans have underperformed in this years special elections.Mr. Trumps approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot.These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Mr. Trumps approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent.These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and its weighted to a likely electorate.It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governors race.But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results.The Democratic strength among well-educated voters and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra.The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters.Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters.Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were almost sure or very likely to vote.How the Poll Has Changed The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clintons support in the decisive battleground states.Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls.The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.But a close analysis of last years surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last Novembers election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census Current Population Survey.Theres considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.Its not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys.Thats because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters.Similarly, the modeled turnout score our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016.The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final three surveys in 2016.(That may not be generalizable to other elections.)The methodology, crosstabs and the composition of the electorate are available on GitHub.
Dont Nudge Me: The Limits of Behavioral Economics in Medicine:::::At first glance, behavioral economics the basis of Richard Thalers recent Nobel Prize in Economics seems like a rich field of potential solutions.People tend to do things, like donate organs, when its the default option as opposed to something they need to request.They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs.They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms.Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study.It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication.(Patients adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)Photo Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups.All had recently had heart attacks.One group received the usual care.The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients use of medication.Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.Thats not all.The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didnt take their pills so that they could receive social support.They were given access to special social work resources.There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.This was a kitchen-sink approach.It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management.It failed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups.The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same.So were the medical costs.Even medication adherence the process measure that might influence these outcomes was no different between the two groups.The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future.Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard.In the past, weve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes.That failed.Weve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance.That failed.Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care.There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss although these seemed to disappear over time.Weve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive.They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive.Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is that health has so many moving parts.The health care system has even more.Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse.Behavioral economics may offer us some fascinating theories to test in controlled trials, but we have a long way to go before we can assume its a cure for what ails Americans.
Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon:::::And while the biggest impacts show up in the performances of amateurs and weekend warriors, elite runners are not immune to these effects.When considering the top 20 finishing times at the largest marathons, the assessment found that temperatures in the 50s did not slow them, relative to days in the 40s.But temperatures in the 60s increased their times by three minutes, and those in the 70s increased their times by four minutes.Photo Since temperature has such a big effect on times, would it make sense to adjust marathon times for the weather?If this were done, five of the 25 fastest mens marathon times through March 1, 2017, would beat the current adjusted world record.Indeed, three of them would be more than two minutes faster.The current world-record holder is Dennis Kimetto from Kenya, but the temperature-adjusted record-holder would be Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia, who would move up from No.3 on the list.The second-fastest time would belong to the Ethiopian Tamirat Tola, who would move up from No.18.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women.Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes.Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held.By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How will runners and organizers react?National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.Marathons will be no exception.The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record.So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year.Could a Montreal Marathon be among the worlds most prestigious by 2050?Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well.For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners.Seem far-fetched?They already exist.Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures.For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how.But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater.More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts.These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes as well as acceptance of increased risks.In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon.More time spent training makes for a faster marathon.Its not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance.The time for that is well in advance of the big day.In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future.As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule no pain, no gain.
What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?:::::Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto.His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views.You received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars, said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto.Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.Photo Lesson 2: Doctors like the system as much as patients do Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care.When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian Medicare card.At Womens College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window.The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills.For the entire hospital?Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly.And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments werent free.I didnt have to fill out any forms; I didnt have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive, said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship, he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature.If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited.(Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)Photo Lesson 3: Sometimes, you have to wait At a round-table discussion at Womens College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients cant always get all the care they want right away.Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures, said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines.Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation.What you are arguing correct me if Im wrong is that waiting times are not a problem, and its an issue you are dealing with, he said.In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away.But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective.A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements.The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care thats not life-threatening.The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I.scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didnt see the places where patients might wait.Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If youre very, very rich, youll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, in the interview.If youre working class, if youre middle class, it is a very, very different story.The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July.But Canada did only a little better, at No.9.Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the timeliness of care.(A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.)Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money.Mr. Sanderss Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system.Photo Lesson 4: Even Canadas system has holes Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system.Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system.It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial.In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change.Real change always happens from the bottom up, he said, to big applause.Youve got to struggle for it.Youve got to fight for it.Youve got to take it.And that is the history of all real change in this world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult.The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals.But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and thats a problem, said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Womens College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.Im on my own going to the dentist, said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table.Its the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25.And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work.But even in Canada, its tough to find the resources to expand coverage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have to find the money to fund the program up front, said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.Photo Lesson 5: Canadians seem to value fairness more than Americans do Equity.Fairness.Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes theyd paid to finance their system.Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.I think its a really fair way to do it, said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms.Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier.It also means if youre in a lower economic status or higher economic status, youll get the treatment you need.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether youre rich or whether youre poor or whether youre middle class, you are entitled to health care.In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes.Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isnt going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.When you talk about health care, youre not just talking about health care, he said in his Toronto speech.Youre talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine.Its more than technology.It is about the values that those societies hold dear.
Just Say No to Opioids? Ads Could Actually Make Things Worse:::::Photo In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, This is your brain on drugs.A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects as in the Just Say No campaign appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s.Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging.The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows.At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Why was the original campaign such a failure?In part it suffered from perverse incentives.Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress.But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion.
Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated:::::The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players and, while they were at it, everyone else.The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load.This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradleys alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment.This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelors degrees are earned within six years.The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin.The typical community college student isnt a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.Most community college students are nontraditional adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away.They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees.Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree a good result, but one that wasnt counted for graduation rates.So, following the committees lead, education officials made several changes.They included part-time and returning students in the calculation.They extended the time period to eight years.And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.The results paint a very different picture of community college success.The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008.Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years.North Shore Community College was typical its old graduation rate was 19 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes.In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions community colleges have a graduation rate of 20%.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students.Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.But transfers are where community colleges really shine.Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shores graduation rate to 35 percent.Another 19 percent transferred before graduation.Others were still working toward a degree.All told, more than half of Mr. Burtons students had a successful outcome not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.The for-profit picture is not so rosy.The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment.Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions.Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures.And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere.Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward.The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less.They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.Some for-profit results are catastrophic.Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college.In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined.The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate.But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional.What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent.Add in transfers?8.1 percent.Include those still enrolled?8.5 percent.Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures.Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges.Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate.But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.Not all community colleges look better.San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years.Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent.Most students at San Jose City College are falling short.Many community colleges have room to improve.But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates.The results produced by including all students and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a degree.And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.
How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You:::::If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, whats all the fuss about?The important difference is in how stipend levels are set.Todays stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas.But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate what people generally mean when they use this term would use market signals to set stipend levels.Photo Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program, said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options.That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce the financial burden on future generations.Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables.One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries own money they need to contribute.The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time.Both aspects are hotly debated.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage.In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance.Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy.A lot rides on how the governments support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare, said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis.Geography also plays a role.If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established.Across the variations the C.B.O.examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent.But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare.Under one projection, the C.B.O.estimates, traditional Medicares premium could double.In all the scenarios the C.B.O.analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services.Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O.estimated.Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less.In either case, people would have access to plans that dont cost more than todays.But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket.Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.This worries some health policy experts.Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency, said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live.In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid.In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.In the premium support debate, theres a fundamental lesson: Its conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but its very hard to do so in a way that doesnt increase costs for at least some consumers.To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for.Thats much harder.
Mexicos Record Violence Is a Crisis 20 Years in the Making:::::It makes me desperate, he said, shaking his head at his countrys missteps, because this violence, its increasing.Extreme Measures Photo In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade.A new cartel, La Familia Michoacna, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence.Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.That same year, Felipe Caldern won the presidency by a hair.Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Caldern left him without a strong mandate.Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.Critics say Mr. Caldern sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.Defenders say he had little alternative.Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption.When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges.Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people.But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems Photo Mr. Caldern adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders.This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexicos pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5

officers from conducting investigations drifted.As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion.Predatory crimes spiked.Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.In the process of that fragmentation, we didnt do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces, said Mr. Valds, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding.So we have the worst of the worst.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Key Point of Failure Photo The solution to the problem would seem obvious.Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held

Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the countrys woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before

years of democracy.For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms.And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants often providing the wrong kind of incentives.At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability, Mr. Hope said.That is the key point of failure in Mexico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work, he added.Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement.Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services.Nothing happens.A Frail State Recedes Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to risk pushing for change.I cannot think of a single prosecutor or judge who stands out on fighting corruption, said Paul F. Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary in the press, Mr. Lagunes said.But, he added, Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable.In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded.Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderns drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses.But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.State and Society Atomize This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Caldern did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers.But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed self-defense militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced.Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping.Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism represent a disempowerment of the state.Paralysis Amid Disaster Photo Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous.Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there, said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan.Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the countrys social decomposition.Mr. Valds, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police, he said.We spent years trying to convince the political class.But he found those institutions dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.Whats happening in Guadalupe is whats happening in all of Mexico, Mr. Torjes said.There was a political demand for change, but nothing really changed for us.
When Silver Costs More Than Gold: How Trumps Actions Have Scrambled Insurance Prices:::::It also organized plans on its site in order of their premium price, so that customers who live in a place where a gold plan costs less than the cheapest silver plan would have an easier time figuring that out.If you live in one of the places where the gold plan is cheaper than the silver plan, and you earn more than about $24,000, you should not buy the more expensive silver option.The gold plan will cost less, and have a lower deductible.There are also high-deductible bronze plans that will have substantially lower premiums that you may also want to consider.If you qualify for a government subsidy, those will be your best options.If you earn too much to qualify for federal help buying insurance, you should also steer clear of the more expensive silver plans on HealthCare.gov.But there may be cheaper options in the silver category if you buy directly from an insurance company.A broker may be able to help you examine all of those options.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice.Thats because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan.Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the presidents actions, will protect you from premium price increases.The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year.The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for whats happening with the entire health insurance market.But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types arent rising as fast.Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent.Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well.The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did.In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Our map draws on prices that were published online Wednesday for 2018 plans on HealthCare.gov.The website serves 39 states, and the precise prices we examined were for single customers who dont smoke, age 40, though the trends should be the same for customers with different family sizes and ages.Information from the remaining states, which run their own marketplaces, will become available next week.
The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs:::::Advertisement The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs Image The term pork barrel spending has been around for well over 100 years.It means using government funds on local projects that are primarily used to bring more money to a specific representatives district.Credit Matt Cardy/Getty Images No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions.In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million.(Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, sweeteners or pork barrel spending.The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the Frontier States provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy.In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it.But theres little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be.A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the laws passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign.But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.Thats when Section 508 was added.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospitals location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area.Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments.Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because theyre separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated.About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted.Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A.were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it.On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases high 508 recipient hospitals received a 10 percent boost.How did hospitals spend the extra money?Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients about 8 percent more per year.They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies.But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital.Over all, high 508 recipient hospitals had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have.There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.If you told me in advance that wed find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised, Mr. Cooper said.We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years.But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically.In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in, Mr. Cooper said.Its not that any single one is hugely offensive.Its their accumulation and continuation over time.Although Mr. Coopers research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent.In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the states rural hospitals.The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as rural in Massachusetts on the wealthy island of Nantucket.None of this is surprising.A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected.Passing expansive legislation like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A.is hard, especially when legislators cant point to specific benefits for their constituents.But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.You cant get upset at a snake for having fangs, Mr. Cooper told me.We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives.We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that weve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed.The same argument holds for health care.When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, its too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.Weve been close to a possible solution.The A.C.A.called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs.The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings.But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.Americas increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like.But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits if any go to a favored few.Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system.Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Dhruv Khullar , M.D., M.P.P., is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a researcher at the Weill Cornell Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.Follow him on

I will be president for all Americans. One year ago, Trump promised a presidency that hasnt happened.:::::Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Here are key moments from that speech.(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Here are key moments from that speech.(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) When a triumphant Donald Trump took the stage a year ago to claim victory over Hillary Clinton, cheering from the crowd was Jesse Blanco dressed in a blazer, bow tie and a Make America Great Again hat ready for the president-elect to let loose like he had during so many rallies during the campaign.But a very different politician showed up than the one who shocked the globe with his politically incorrect and unapologetic campaign.Trump lavished praise on Hillary Clinton, laid out a centrist agenda focused on infrastructure projects and growing the economy, and told fellow world leaders that he would seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.Above all, he called for unity as he pledged to represent all Americans.Now its time for America to bind the wounds of division, Trump said about 3 a.m. on Nov. 9 in downtown Manhattan.I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.Blanco was surprised by Trumps tone but liked what he heard.Cheers for Donald Trump at his election-night event in New York as results trickled in.(Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post) It didnt seem like a stump speech, like the rallies he had been at.He was very composed, said Blanco, a campaign intern who was then a University of Pennsylvania freshman and attended the party with his younger brother.The crowd kind of wanted a more prideful speech, but he was very focused.The victory speech was a glimpse of a presidency that might have been.Instead, one year later, Trump finds himself the most unpopular president in modern times amid criticism that he has sought to divide more than unite.[Poll: Trumps performance lags behind even tepid public expectations] He has resumed his attacks on Clinton, barred most of those who criticized him during the campaign from working in his administration and seen rapid turnover in his White House.When he has felt under attack, he has aggressively punched back, going after members of his own party, media outlets, the intelligence community, the widow of a soldier killed in Niger, the cast of a Broadway show and minorities playing professional football who have knelt during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police abuse.He has yet to introduce the sweeping infrastructure plan he promised or implement an economic plan, although he is hopeful Congress will pass some tax cuts before the end of the year.He has repeatedly tried to implement bans on foreigners from several majority-Muslim countries, tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act many of his supporters depend on for health insurance and commissioned prototypes for a massive wall along parts of the southern border despite a lack of funding.Blanco wasnt the only one thinking Trumps victory speech was a sign he would be different as president than he was as a candidate.A cake on display at the election night event in New York.(Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post) I remember thinking maybe, just maybe, all of the people who have been saying that he will change were right, said Trump skeptic Andrew Weinstein who attended a gathering of never Trumpers at Lincoln Restaurant in Washington on election night.Maybe, just maybe hes going to heed their wise counsel.Weinstein a former Republican staffer on Capitol Hill and now the head of a public relations firm said Trump should have followed his victory speech by announcing he was closing his Twitter account, reaching out to Republicans who had opposed him on the campaign trail and working across party lines to launch an ambitious infrastructure plan.He could have done all of those things out of the gate, he said.If he could have taken some simple steps like that ...he could have changed the course of his presidency.Instead, Weinstein said, Trump has validated many of the concerns he and others raised during the campaign about the former real estate developers fitness for office.He compared the president and his party to the fable of the scorpion and the turtle who are crossing a river together when the scorpion stings the turtle, causing them both to drown.Thats his nature, Weinstein said of Trump.He cant help but sting.More than 700 miles west of Manhattan in the small Indiana city of Hammond, Carol Kitchens woke up at 4 a.m. the day after the election to prepare for work in a middle school cafeteria and learned Trump won.She quickly searched for his speech online.I applauded that he held out an olive branch, said Kitchens, an independent who voted for Barack Obama twice and then for Trump.The American people really want that.Kitchens like many people who voted for the president is disappointed in the Trump presidency so far but blames Congress for the lack of progress.She said she voted for Trump because she wanted to see a major change in Washington.But the Republicans and the Democrats are playing the same games that they always play, Kitchens said.Im really disappointed.She cheered the passage of the Affordable Care Act in the memory of her daughter, who was diagnosed with cancer in high school, was kicked off her parents health insurance plan when she turned 18 and then couldnt easily get insurance because she had a preexisting condition.She was surprised when Trump and Republicans followed through on their promise to repeal the health care law without composing a comparable replacement.If they really truly thought anything about their constituents, about the people who put them in office, they would fine-tune it, not get rid of it, she said.Kitchens said Trump appears to be learning more about the presidency and politics in Washington each day and she wishes his opponents and the media would stop nitpicking him.Shes hopeful Trump can once again hold out an olive branch like he did in his victory speech.I am very hopeful for the United States.I am very hopeful for Donald Trumps presidency, Kitchens said.Im not expecting miracles, but I am expecting changes.Congress needs to get their act together and do something.After Trumps victory party in Manhattan ended, Blanco caught a 6 a.m. train back to Philadelphia so he could make it to his early morning classes.He was exhausted but energized by the unexpected victory he witnessed.It was a historical night, he said.It was amazing to be there.It was the strangest thing.I had never seen campus so quiet or muted, said Blanco, now a sophomore who is studying political science, when he returned to school.I wondered: Is it always like this after an election?That atmosphere really lingered for a week, two weeks.Campus was as if a funeral had happened.When he arrived back on campus, he could immediately feel the change in tone.Many morning classes were empty, as students who were disappointed by the election results could not bring themselves to attend.He knew there wasnt much support for Trump on campus, but he was stunned to see campus grind to a halt.Since the election, Blanco said it seems like the country has become even more divided, that politics have become even more tribal.Instead of having heated debates, he said he increasingly finds people not even willing to have a discussion about their differences.As a young Republican, he views his party as having an identity crisis.While he celebrated the appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, new anti-lobbying rules for Trump administration staffers and the healthy economy, hes frustrated that Republicans cant come together to pass legislation and that the president often gets too carried away on Twitter.But hes still hopeful the president is constantly learning more about the job and can steer his tenure toward the vision he laid out on election night.He really has to hold true to his words, Blanco said, and work on behalf of all Americans.Scott Clement contributed to this story.
Trumps attempt at surprise visit to Korean demilitarized zone is foiled by weather:::::President Trump at a news conference Tuesday in Seoul.(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) SEOUL In the testosterone-laden ego contest between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, the winner on Wednesday was Mother Nature.Trump's attempt to make a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone ahead of a speech to the South Korean National Assembly was foiled by bad weather apparently the moderately thick haze that has covered the sky here this week.Secret Service agents made the call minutes after Marine One had taken off, forcing Trump to return to Seoul and abort the 30-mile flight north.After waiting another hour for the skies to clear, the White House canceled the visit to the heavily watched border region that has divided North and South since the halt of the Korean War in 1954.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Trump was scheduled to tour the DMZ with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, which would have marked the first-ever joint visit."He's actually pretty frustrated," she said of Trump.Asked how long the trip had been in the works, she said it had been planned "for a little while," since before Trump left on his Asia trip last Friday.It was "something the president wanted to do," she said.Last week, White House officials had ruled out a DMZ visit, saying it was becoming a cliche and noting that Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had each visited this year.After arriving in South Korea on Tuesday, Trump toured Camp Humphreys, a joint U.S.-South Korean military base about 40 miles south of Seoul, where he ate lunch with troops and was briefed by commanders.Aides said Trump, in his speech to the Korean parliament, will lay out a broad strategy to increase international pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile programs.Trump asserted Tuesday that his administration is making a lot of progress on North Korea, and he urged Kim to make a deal at the negotiating table.I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing, not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world, Trump said during a news conference with Moon after a meeting at the Blue House.I do see certain movement, yes, but well see what happens, he added, without offering any details.The DMZ visit was not announced publicly.The traveling press pool that accompanies Trump was summoned earlier than expected.Sanders met the group with a sign on which the letters DMZ were written and told them that is how she was instructed to inform them of the trip.She explained that the reporters were not permitted to make details public until after the president had visited the DMZ and returned to Seoul, presumably out of security concerns.According to a pool reporter, the group boarded Chinook helicopters along with a half-dozen men in camouflage-patterned tactical gear.The helicopters traveled about 18 minutes before turning around.
Republicans are trying humor to promote their tax plan:::::Johnson says he 'could have been clearer' with remarks on jailed British-Iranian
Trump strikes more conciliatory tone toward North Korea, urges deal to resolve standoff with United States:::::President Trump struck a more conciliatory tone on the North Korea crisis Tuesday, asserting that his administration is making a lot of progress in the peninsula and urging dictator Kim Jong Un to make a deal at the negotiating table on the rogue nations nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing, not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world, Trump said during a joint news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in after a bilateral meeting at the Blue House.I do see certain movement, yes, but well see what happens, he added, without offering any details.Trumps remarks came as he prepared to deliver an address to the South Korean National Assembly on Wednesday in which his advisers said he intends to call on countries to rally against the growing threat from Pyongyang.But at least for one day, speaking just 35 miles south of the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, Trump offered a more optimistic vision for the region a noted contrast to his previous, more bellicose rhetoric.Trump has previously dubbed Kim Little Rocket Man, promised fire and fury if North Korea endangers the United States, and undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweeting that his top diplomat was wasting his time trying to negotiate with the regime.[Trump heads to Asia where concerns are growing over possible war with North Korea] On Tuesday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he will meet in Beijing for a three-day summit starting Wednesday, for being very helpful and added that China is trying very hard to solve the problem.He also offered hope that Russia will likewise be helpful.Trump has said he expects to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at a regional summit later in the week, either in Vietnam or the Philippines.This is not the right time to be doing it, but thats what I got, Trump said, complaining that his predecessors in the White House had failed to solve the issue.This is a problem that should have been taken care of a long time ago.The president avoided the type of heated rhetoric he has employed in the past while talking about North Korea, but he emphasized that the United States is showing great strength.North Korea knows we have unparalleled strength, Trump said.Theres never been strength like this.He also cited the presence of three aircraft carriers and a nuclear submarine in the region, a muscular military presence in the Pacific that belied his more conciliatory tone his first full day in South Korea.We have many things happening that we hope, we hope in fact, Ill go a step further we hope to God we never have to use, Trump said.The president appeared to touch on the themes of his upcoming speech to the South Korean parliament when he urged people all across the globe to come together to confront North Koreas actions and prevent the North Korean dictator from threatening millions of innocent lives.Trump added, He is threatening millions and millions of lives, so needlessly.On Wednesday morning, Trump attempted to make a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone, but his helicopter was forced to turn back because of bad weather.Moon was expected to join to him at the dangerous border, in what White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders billed as a historic moment the first time leaders of both the United States and South Korea would have visited the DMZ together.Sanders alerted reporters traveling with the president about the surprise trip by holding up a piece of paper on which DMZ had been scrawled and announcing, This is where were going.White House officials, at least publicly, had scrapped the idea of a trip to the DMZ before Trump left Washington with one even describing it as a little bit of a cliche but the president had repeatedly hinted at a surprise while in South Korea, and many aides privately said they didnt think Trump would be able to resist a visit and the ensuing photo opportunity.Before their news conference Tuesday, Trump and Moon, whose relationship is more distant than Trumps friendships with Abe and Xi, seemed to bond a bit.The two leaders took a friendship walk, dined together at a state dinner complete with tea blended with hydrangeas from the region where South Korea will host its upcoming Winter Olympics and Moon made a point of praising Trump for the upcoming anniversary of his Election Day victory.The president toured Camp Humphreys, the third military base he has visited since leaving Washington on a 12-day trip to the Asia-Pacific region that began last Friday.Trump landed at the $11 billion base, 40 miles south of Seoul, on Marine One and, after saluting several commanding officers on the tarmac, went to the mess hall to have lunch with troops.He sat down on a bench at a long table in between soldiers dressed in green military fatigues.Trump was accompanied by Moon, as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and national security adviser H.R.McMaster.Wearing a navy-blue suit and a bright blue tie, Trump smiled and waved at reporters.Ultimately, it will all work out.It always works out.It has to work out, Trump said at the start of a briefing with military commanders at the base.The tour of Camp Humphreys comes on the heels of Trumps visits to Yokota Air Base outside Tokyo and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.The United States remains committed to the complete, verifiable and permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, McMaster said last week.President Trump will reiterate the plain fact that North Korea threatens not just our allies, South Korea and Japan, and the United States North Korea is a threat to the entire world.So all nations of the world must do more to counter that threat.But South Koreans are on edge for Trumps visit, and police have worked to keep protesters at bay.Trump has low public approval numbers here amid concerns that his heated rhetoric toward Kim Jong Uns regime could lead to a military confrontation.The president has emphasized that military options remain on the table, although he has declined to be specific.Foreign policy analysts said the stakes are high for Trump to deliver a speech on Wednesday that clearly spells out his administrations North Korea policy.The administration has made progress in ramping up pressure on the North, but analysts said many in Seoul, as well as in Tokyo and Beijing, remain confused because Trump and his senior aides have offered mixed messages.People want clarification, said a former State Department official who worked on Asian affairs during the Obama administration.He spoke on the condition of anonymity because his current job outside government does not allow him to speak on the record.Theres a lot of nervousness in South Korea.A senior administration official said Trump will use his speech to highlight the North Korean regimes long history of human rights abuses against its own people and abroad.Trump lashed out at Kim after the North released Otto Warmbier, an American college student who had been detained for 17 months, comatose.Warmbier died shortly after arriving home in Ohio.In the speech, there will be some focus on the often-overlooked question of the human rights conditions of North Korea, said the administration official, who was not authorized to speak on the record in a briefing for reporters in Tokyo on Sunday.I heard one journalist recently described it as the most totalitarian state in the history of humankind.I dont think thats an overstatement.In Tokyo on Monday, Trump met with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korean agents four decades ago to help the regime learn the Japanese language and culture.Five abductees were released more than a decade ago, but at least a dozen remain in the North, according to the Japanese government.In a news conference Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump dismissed suggestions that his rhetoric has created more risk for the United States and its allies.Trump vowed during a United Nations address in September that his administration is prepared to totally destroy North Korea if necessary, and he has dubbed Kim the Little Rocket Man in tweets.Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong, but look whats happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years, Trump said.Look where we are right now.Yet as he has traveled to the region, Trump also has offered notes of encouragement for North Korean citizens, calling them great people.Theyre under a very repressive regime, and I really think that, ultimately, I hope it all works out, he said.
Sean Hannity got in trouble with British regulators. There is a lesson here for Trump.:::::Fox News host Sean Hannity.(Carolyn Kaster/AP) President Trump said during his campaign for the White House that he wants the United States to adopt the libel standards of England, where protections for journalists are weaker.More recently, he floated the idea of reinstating the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, scrapped three decades ago by Ronald Reagan's administration but still enforced in Great Britain and the rest of the United Kingdom.Perhaps Trump will reconsider the wisdom of emulating the British system after the U.K. regulatory agency Ofcom on Monday cited two of the president's biggest boosters, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson of Fox News, for violating standards of fairness.(Ofcom has lots of rules, by the way.It cited CNN International for a May telecast that included graphic footage of a chemical-weapons attack in Syria, saying the 8 p.m. air time was not late enough to shield young viewers.It cited Fox & Friends for a June 2016 segment about consumer bargains, saying the show did not adequately distinguish between news content and advertising.)Ofcom ruled that a January episode of Hannity's show and a May episode of Carlson's show failed to satisfy three legal requirements, excerpted below: Alternative viewpoints must be adequately represented.Due impartiality must be preserved on matters of major political and industrial controversy.Views and facts must not be misrepresented.From a practical standpoint, Ofcom's ruling doesn't mean much.Fox News's parent company stopped airing the channel in the United Kingdom in August, citing low viewership.Yet the Hannity and Carlson citations are instructive, as examples of the adverse side effects Trump might experience if he were to get serious about further regulations on the media.When the president says, as he did last month, that it's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it, he seems to imagine a crackdown on negative coverage of his White House without considering what might happen to one-sided reporting in his favor.Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very "unfunny" & repetitive material, always anti-Trump!Should we get Equal Time?Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017 Trump's October tweets about equal time for Democrats and Republicans harked back to a time when the Federal Communications Commission required television broadcasters to cover public policy issues and to balance opposing views.The FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 after determining that the doctrine likely violated the free speech rights of broadcasters, led to less speech about issues of public importance over broadcast airwaves, and was no longer required because of the increase in competition among mass media, according to the Congressional Research Service.Note that it was a Republican administration that did away with the Fairness Doctrine.And it was Republicans who pushed for a 2009 vote in the Senate to prohibit reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine, at a time when some Democrats were complaining about the proliferation of conservative talk radio.The ban passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, by a vote of 87 to 11.Hannity called the Fairness Doctrine an assault on the First Amendment at the time.He understood the potential drawbacks of mandatory, government-defined fairness.
Trumps CIA director keeps doing controversial  and suspiciously pro-Trump  things:::::CIA Director Mike Pompeo attends the Foundation for Defense of Democracies national security summit in Washington in October 2017.(Yuri Gripas/Reuters) The Intercept just broke a pretty big story: CIA Director Mike Pompeo reportedly met with the purveyor of a disputed theory about the internal Democratic National Committee emails that were released last year a theory that runs counter to the intelligence community's own long-standing conclusions about the matter.It's not the first example of Pompeo doing something that has been put under microscope.But there is a common thread running through just about every example: Pompeo doing and saying questionable things involving Russia and those questionable things tend to lean in a pro-Trump direction.The most recent example is Pompeo's meeting with William Binney, a former intelligence official who argues that the DNC hack wasn't a hack at all, but rather a leak from within.Binney, of course, isn't the only one who has cast doubt on the intelligence community's conclusions; so too has Trump, who has at times suggested the very idea that Russia interfered in the 2016 election was fake news.And the kicker in the Intercept's story is that Trump, according to Binney and another source, just so happens to be the one who suggested the meeting: In an interview with The Intercept, Binney said Pompeo told him that President Donald Trump had urged the CIA director to meet with Binney to discuss his assessment that the DNC data theft was an inside job.During their hour-long meeting at CIA headquarters, Pompeo said Trump told him that if Pompeo want[ed] to know the facts, he should talk to me, Binney said.The meeting was confirmed by two other sources, while the CIA has declined to comment on Pompeo's schedule, as it generally does.Dean Boyd, a spokesman in the CIA's office of public affairs, told The Post: "The director stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment..." Pompeo has said in public hearings that he believes Russia was behind the hacking.The implications here are pretty big: a U.S. president telling his CIA director to meet with someone pitching what the intelligence community basically regards as a conspiracy theory.The intelligence community's report on Russian interference, from way back in January, is clear that it believes this was a hack: In July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks and maintained that access until at least June 2016.The [Russian foreign intelligence service, or GRU] probably began cyber operations aimed at the US election by March 2016.We assess that the GRU operations resulted in the compromise of the personal email accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures.By May, the GRU had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC.Binney is a former official at the National Security Agency (NSA) who later became a whistleblower and now belongs to Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, a group of former intelligence officials who are skeptical of the intelligence community's conclusions.He has occasionally been a guest on Fox News, where it seems Trump may have seen him, and where host Sean Hannity once seized upon the inside-job theory and tied it dubiously to the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.The appeal of Binney's theory to Trump is clear: It suggests Russia's interference wasn't nearly so broad or influential as the intelligence community contends.And that's where it ties in nicely with Pompeo's other recent controversies.At an event three weeks ago, Pompeo made a highly curious remark, saying that the intelligence communitys assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election.This mirrored a talking point previously offered by Trump and the White House, but that talking point is categorically false.The intelligence report said clearly that it wouldn't weigh in on how much impact Russia may have had, not that it didn't have an impact.Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results.Voting machines not touched!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 That might be a slip of the tongue from an amateur.But how the CIA director, of all people, could get something of such importance something that for him should be completely basic knowledge so wrong sure seemed odd.Separately, Pompeo has also drawn scrutiny for making an agency unit deeply involved in investigating possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia the Counterintelligence Mission Center report directly to him, as the The Post's Greg Miller reported.And previously, Axios reported that he was among the Trump administration officials who had been enlisted by the White House to beat back a New York Times story about the Trump campaign contacts with Russia.All along, intelligence officials have expressed concern about the possible politicization of Pompeo's job.Pompeo's use of a Trump talking point last month, and now his meeting with a high-profile skeptic of the intel community's conclusions at Trump's own request, sure won't tamp down those concerns.
A former New York Times reporter wonders if Weinstein sabotaged her 13 years ago:::::Harvey Weinstein.(Andrew Kelly/Reuters) Harvey Weinstein's attorney, David Boies, hired private investigators to try to kill the New York Times's report on sexual-harassment allegations against Weinstein that the newspaper ultimately published in October.That's just one of the startling revelations in Ronan Farrow's latest New Yorker piece, which chronicles the Hollywood titan's elaborate effort to silence accusers and journalists through deception and intimidation.The attempt to stop the Times from publishing last month's article by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey failed, obviously.Less clear is whether a similar sabotage campaign might have successfully hindered a previous reporting project by the Times in 2004.Don't know, said Sharon Waxman, the former Times reporter who pursued sexual-harassment allegations against Weinstein 13 years ago.But, she added, the New Yorker article has me thinking too, of course.The board behind the Oscars has expelled Harvey Weinstein in the wake of sexual harassment and assault allegations against him spanning 30 years.Weinstein demonstrated his power and influence at the Academy Awards for decades, providing a lens into how he cultivated such strength in the entertainment industry.(Nicki DeMarco,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) Waxman, founder of the entertainment news site the Wrap, has publicly criticized the Times for not publishing the information she collected on Weinstein in 2004.The information included the account of one Weinstein accuser, who would not allow her name to appear in print, and claims by on-the-record sources that one of Weinstein's top executives knew nothing about film and was responsible, instead, for setting up his boss with women.Waxman has reported that Weinstein and Boies met with top editors at the Times in 2004, perhaps to pressure the paper to spike her story.Bill Keller, the Times's executive editor at the time, has said he does not recall such a meeting and defended the decision not to publish Waxman's findings as the result of Waxman's inability nail down sufficient evidence against Weinstein.Keller reiterated his position to me Tuesday.It was 13 years ago, and my memory is hazy, he said.As I've told Sharon, Weinstein was a frequent complainer.On at least one occasion, he showed up with David Boies to vent.I don't recall the topic.I don't have any recollection of Sharon's piece, but by her own account of it, she didn't have the goods, Keller added.I appreciate that she's embarrassed to be scooped years later by the New York Times and New Yorker, but I don't believe Weinstein sabotaged her piece.I asked Boies directly whether he hired investigators to impede the Times in 2004, as he did this year.He did not respond.Particularly alarming, from the Times's perspective, is that Boies a prominent lawyer best known for representing Al Gore during the presidential-election recount of 2000 worked to undermine the paper's recent reporting on Weinstein while he was on the Times's payroll, providing counsel on unrelated matters.We consider this intolerable conduct, a grave betrayal of trust, and a breach of the basic professional standards that all lawyers are required to observe, the Times said in a statement.Speaking to Farrow for the New Yorker piece, Boies said he did not see a conflict of interest between his work for Weinstein and his work for the Times.If evidence could be uncovered to convince the Times the charges should not be published, I did not believe, and do not believe, that that would be averse to the Times's interest, Boies said.Yet the tactics employed by Black Cube and PSOPS, the companies contracted by Boies's law firm, went beyond conventional pushback against reporters' conclusions.Farrow reported that in the months before publication of Kantor and Twohey's article in the Times, a woman using aliases alternately posed as a Weinstein accuser and a women's-rights advocate in interactions with reporters from various news outlets, including Kantor.[Harvey Weinstein hired private spies to silence accusers, journalists, report says] The woman's mission was to extract information about what the journalists knew and to report back to Weinstein's team.The same woman also insinuated herself into the life of a real Weinstein accuser, actress Rose McGowan, befriending McGowan with the aim of learning what the former Charmed star was telling reporters and planning to write in a forthcoming book.I asked Waxman whether she had any contacts with sources in 2004 that appeared innocuous at the time but now seem suspicious, in retrospect.No, not that I recall, she said.In addition, investigators working on Weinstein's behalf probed journalists' backgrounds in search of dirt that could be used to discredit them.And, of course, the investigators sought compromising information about the women who alleged harassment and assault by Weinstein, to keep the women quiet.Waxman could not find women willing to go on the record in 2004.Farrow's new report on Weinstein's suppression techniques might help explain why, but even Waxman can't say for certain.
Democrats fail to force vote on bill establishing select panel on gun violence:::::House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at a news conference at her caucuss issues retreat in Baltimore this year.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Two days after a mass shooting at a Texas church, Democratic lawmakers failed Tuesday to force a vote on legislation establishing a select committee on preventing gun violence.The proposal is among more than 30 pieces of legislation introduced by Democrats this year to combat gun violence and bolster federal funding to research and assist people with mental illness and the effects of gun violence.Of those bills, just four have Republican sponsors, according to a document compiled by Democratic aides and shared with The Washington Post.[Congress hasnt sorted out what to do about bump stocks.The Texas shooting isnt likely to jump-start debate, either.]The measure that Democrats failed to advance Tuesday was introduced by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), who leads a Democratic working group on gun violence established after the 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school.The bill would establish a 12-member committee divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats to study the causes of mass shootings, look at ways to revamp the gun background-check system, research how mentally ill people obtain firearms and explore ways to keep domestic abusers from buying firearms.You know how many special committees theyve created to chase Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama around that dont have any bearing on saving lives of the people we represent?Thompson said in an interview Monday, referring to Republicans.A select committee can determine how we can take steps to enhance gun-violence prevention, but they wont even do that.Thompsons bill is sponsored by 158 other Democrats and no Republicans.As America grapples with the increasing frequency and deadliness of mass shootings, politicians are turning to scripted reactions to respond to the tragedies.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) During scheduled votes on other bills, Democrats used procedural motions to try to introduce the bill on the floor and get a vote.It failed overwhelmingly.But the development is likely to spark fresh Democratic attacks on Republicans for blocking such legislation amid polling that shows a majority of Americans want Congress to take some action on gun violence.While most Americans do not support restricting gun ownership for law-abiding citizens, polls show most support expanding the national background-check system and banning firearms sales to stalkers or violent criminals.The push to pass new legislation follows bolder steps taken by Democrats last year.Shortly before the July Fourth recess, a band of Democratic lawmakers camped out on the House floor demanding up-or-down votes on gun-control legislation, an ultimately futile move that earned a strong rebuke from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).Thompson said Monday that he doesnt expect colleagues to take similar steps in the wake of the most recent shootings.But he dismissed as intellectually dishonest claims by President Trump and GOP lawmakers that the best response to the shooting would be to focus on issues surrounding mental health.This is the same president that is trying to get rid of the mental-health funding, Thompson said.Trumps proposed budget would slash funding for mental-health treatment and research programs funded through the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, among others.If Republicans are serious about addressing mental-health issues, Thompson said, they should restore an Obama-era regulation that would have blocked mentally ill individuals receiving Social Security benefits from being able to purchase firearms.Instead, Republicans voted to repeal that policy this year.Concerns about how gun-control laws are enforced came to light Monday as the Air Force acknowledged that it failed to follow policies for alerting federal law enforcement about Devin Kelleys violent past, enabling the former service member, who killed at least 26 churchgoers Sunday in Sutherland Springs, Tex., to obtain firearms before the shooting rampage.Kelley should have been barred from purchasing firearms and body armor, because of his domestic-violence conviction in 2014 while serving at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.Kelley was sentenced to a year in prison and kicked out of the military with a bad-conduct discharge after two counts of domestic abuse against his wife and a child, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.[The Air Force says it failed to follow procedures, allowing Texas church shooter to obtain firearms] Ryan said Tuesday that the Air Forces oversight will earn congressional scrutiny.After the Texas church shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said on Nov. 7 that the shooter "should not have gotten a gun."(Reuters) This man should not have had a gun....How did this slip through the cracks?...How did he slip through the system and get a gun?Ryan said in his first public comments on the shooting.Ryan added his deep sorrow for the victims, saying, There should be no more safe place from the evils of the world than a house of worship.Also Monday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) announced that his panel would soon hold a hearing on bump stocks, a device used to make some semiautomatic weapons fire like automatic weapons.The device was found on some firearms used in the mass shooting last month in Las Vegas that was the deadliest in modern U.S. history.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is reviewing whether it can reverse an Obama-era ruling that legalized bump stocks or whether Congress would have to enact legislation.ATF officials are set to brief members of the House Judiciary Committee on their review this week.Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.
Senate moves toward mandatory anti-harassment training for members, staff:::::Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) arrives prior to a committee confirmation hearing for FBI director nominee Christopher A. Wray on Capitol Hill in Washington on July 12.(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) The Senate took a crucial step Tuesday toward requiring members and staff to undergo training to prevent sexual harassment, a change that would bring the upper chambers employment rules more in line with the rest of the federal government.A bipartisan group of senators led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced a resolution mandating periodic anti-harassment training for senators, officers, aides and interns.The eight-page bill also orders the Senate to conduct a regular anonymous survey to gauge the prevalence of sexual harassment in its offices.Grassley introduced the bill with Sens.Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) after reports in The Washington Post and other news outlets documented the persistence of sexual harassment, particularly of young female staff members, in the halls of Congress.Leaders on Capitol Hill have been forced to confront the issue after a rash of allegations of abuse and misbehavior toppled movie producer Harvey Weinstein.How Congress plays by different rules on sexual harassment and misconduct We should do everything possible to make sure our colleagues and staffs dont have to endure harassment if we can prevent it, Grassley said in a statement.Trainings like this are important for cultivating the right kind of working environment and setting the baseline standards that any place of work should have.The Senate Training on Prevention (STOP) Sexual Harassment Resolution seeks to ensure compliance under the new system by requiring offices to supply lists of their employees to the Rules Committee designating whether they have completed anti-harassment training.Mandatory training must include discussion of the prohibition on retaliation against people who report harassment, the bill states.The measure must pass the Rules Committee to receive a vote by the full Senate.Asked when the panel might consider the resolution, Blair Bailey Taylor, spokeswoman for Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), wrote in an email: The Committee is actively considering the issue with the goal of reaching a bipartisan agreement in the very near future.Across the Capitol, Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) urged representatives Friday to undergo sexual harassment training and mandate it for staffers.Ryan has also ordered the Committee on House Administration to review policies and training materials aimed at stopping sexual harassment.The panel will hold a hearing on the issue on Nov. 14.The Washington Post is examining workplace violations on Capitol Hill and the process for reporting them.To contact a reporter, please email michelle.lee@washpost.com, elise.viebeck@washpost.com or kimberly.kindy@washpost.com.Read more at PowerPost
ACA sign-ups spike at open enrollments start:::::This post has been updated.The number of consumers signing up for plans under the Affordable Care Act has surged during the first few days of open enrollment compared with past years, according to federal and state officials.More than 200,000 Americans chose a plan on Nov. 1, the day open enrollment began, according to one Trump administration official.Thats more than double the number of consumers who signed up on the first day of enrollment last year.More than 1 million people visited HeathCare.gov, the official federal website, the official said, amounting to roughly a 33 percent increase in traffic compared with 2016.Those figures capture only part of the nations overall ACA enrollment, because they encompass only states that use the federal health-care marketplace or rely on its website for their consumers to sign up for coverage.Roughly a dozen states and the District of Columbia run their own programs and do not use HealthCare.gov.Several state exchange officials including in New York, Connecticut, Colorado, Idaho and Washington said Tuesday that they have seen upticks.An official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it would release data regularly throughout enrollment but did not give any schedule.Many ACA advocates have been concerned that consumers wouldnt sign up for coverage because Congress has repeatedly tried to repeal the 2010 law this year and President Trump has described it as failing and virtually dead.Despite this criticism, and despite steep cuts to federal advertising and enrollment-assistance budgets, Americans appear to be signing up for coverage at a faster rate compared with last year.It is unclear whether the extensive media coverage of efforts to roll back the law or consumers concerns about its viability may be helping fuel the increase.Grace-Marie Turner, president of the conservative Galen Institute, said some of the changes the administration has made may have helped boost enrollment, such as the fact that private brokers are actually being engaged to provide assistance through the federal website and some cheaper plans are now available.Liz Hagan, associate director of policy at the National Association of Health Assisters, said in an email that she and other ACA supporters are encouraged by what weve seen thus far.Thankfully, people sharing the facts about coverage and open enrollment have cut through the noise and rhetoric by the Trump administration.The chief marketing officer for the Washington (state) Health Benefit Exchange, Michael Marchand, believes the mixed messages and doomsday forecasts leading up to Nov. 1 may have actually helped increase marketplace visitation which is up 20 percent because it forced people to ask themselves how the changes will affect them personally.But Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said that many of the people who tend to sign up for coverage as enrollment starts tend to need insurance the most, and the critical question is how many young, healthy Americans will sign up some weeks from now.Federal enrollment this year lasts 45 days, half as long as it has in the past, while several states are allowing residents to sign up for ACA plans into January.The real test for open enrollment isnt day one.Federally, its day forty-five, Lee said.Young, healthy people need to be reminded, told, nudged and cajoled dozens of times to take the act of signing up for coverage.Roughly 5,900 Californians selected plans last Wednesday, a 25 percent over last year.In New York, according to Department of Health spokeswoman Erin Silk, more than 140,000 people visited the states website and 73,000 placed calls to its customer service line in just the first three days.In Rhode Island, enrollment this year is five times higher in the first week than it was last year, said Zach Sherman, the director of HealthSource R.I. An early outreach campaign by the state seems to have paid off with more than 500 people enrolling, compared to 109 people in the first week last year.We felt very strongly that we had to get out there earlier than in previous years, Sherman said.The Districts marketplace has seen the highest volume of first-week activity since the first year of enrollment.On just the first day last week, nearly 9,300 people visited the DC Health Link website to shop for plans, compared to 6,727 last year and just over 2,000 in years two and three.Mila Kofman, executive director of the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority, credits the uptick in interest to a concentrated effort by the District to publicize open enrollment as a way to pushback against the confusion that has swirled around the law.And in Montgomery County, Maryland, one navigator group even had to stay open two hours late last Sunday because of demand.The steady and consistent stream of insurance-seeking individuals are a mix of new applicants and re-enrollees, said Alma Luna, who has worked as an in-person navigator for all five enrollment seasons.Ive seen a lot of people who didnt apply in previous years and are trying to apply now, she said.A lot of people already have enrollments, but they want to be reassured that nothing has changed considering what theyve been hearing around the community.Statewide, in fact, growth is up 100 percent since last year, according to Betsy Plunkett, a deputy director for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.First-time enrollment is up 15 percent, with changes to existing plans up 270 percent.Overall, 10,420 people enrolled in the first week compared to 5,212 in 2016, she said.The picture is similar elsewhere around the country.Connect for Health Colorado spokesman Luke Clarke said state officials had expected that 2,700 residents would call exchange operators on the first day, which would have been on par with 2016, but 3,406 did.Its way ahead of where we were last year, and a big surprise, he said.That same day in Connecticut, 1,596 residents enrolled in qualified health plans on the state exchange while another 2,293 people either completed Medicaid applications or determined that they were eligible for that program.Access Health CT CEO Jim Wadleigh said in a statement that the states call center and website experienced a 15 percent increase in volume compared to opening day last year.MNsure Chief Executive Allison OToole said in a statement that enrollment there has been brisk, in part because the state received federal approval for a reinsurance program that means premiums will either stay level or decline for 2018.Last year, 40 percent of our enrollees were new, and were on pace to match that again, OToole said.Though this years enrollment process has gone relatively smoothly, Hagan said there is less assistance in rural areas, creating an unequal playing field that harms consumers.And while Lee expects many state-run exchanges, including his own, will maintain the same number of insured residents by the time open enrollment ends, he thinks states relying on the federal exchange will see a drop-off.Were very likely to see fewer people enrolled in federal marketplace states, which is going to lead directly to higher premiums in 2019 because youre going to have a sicker pool, he said.Its bad math.Read more: White House seeks to weaken ACAs individual mandate, with executive order as backup plan Federal notices about open enrollment season get cut in number and messaging
Senators launch bipartisan push to enforce existing background checks law:::::After a gunman killed at least 26 people at a Texas church, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)on Nov. 7 said theres an opportunity for us here to work on a bipartisan basis on legislation to improve the enforcement of background checks.(The Washington Post) After a gunman killed at least 26 people at a Texas church, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)on Nov. 7 said theres an opportunity for us here to work on a bipartisan basis on legislation to improve the enforcement of background checks.(The Washington Post) Republican and Democratic lawmakers who remain bitterly opposed about expanding gun-control measures are banding together to demand that federal agencies comply with existing ones, after reports indicated that the gunman who killed 26 people in a church shooting in Texas should have been prevented from buying a firearm.The Senates second-highest-ranking Republican announced Tuesday that he was planning to file legislation aimed at forcing federal agencies to upload required information about infractions into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and incentivizing state governments to do the same.Their record of compliance is lousy, its lousy, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)complained on the Senate floor, describing the numbers of reports being filed as staggeringly low.Cornyn was citing NICS statistics from late 2016 that showed many agencies, including many branches of the military, have reported zero felonies, domestic violence misdemeanors or restraining orders, indictments or other areas of concern to the NICS database.[Trumps highly dubious claim that more gun control could have left hundreds more dead in Texas] Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) also announced Tuesday that he was joining forces with Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) to prevent anyone convicted of domestic violence be it in criminal or military court from buying a gun, Flake tweeted Tuesday.President Trump, who is traveling in Asia this week, has been silent on the proposals.His son, Donald Trump Jr., responded to Flakes effort by ridiculing it Tuesday, tweeting that Flakes bill was incredibly proactive considering that law has been on the books since the mid 90s.But the senators complaint is that the federal agencies have not been complying with the law and that the military is exploiting a loophole that lets them report domestic assault as indistinct from other assaults unlike the reporting requirements for state courts.There has only been one instance, just one, of military reporting a charge like this to the database, Flake told reporters Tuesday, referring to domestic violence.His bill with Heinrich would simply clarify and actually force the military to take anything that would have been a domestic violence conviction to the state court and report it as such to the NICS system, Flake said.While it is not clear how many incidents have been omitted from the NICS database, lawmakers were convinced that the Texas gunman could not be an isolated case.This is only one example of repeated and frequent failures to report required convictions, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).Blumenthal sent a letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday requesting a full accounting of how the Pentagon turns over such information to the FBI, as well as how the military prosecutes domestic violence cases.[Democrats to try forcing vote on bill establishing select panel on gun violence] Sens.Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Nov. 7 said they will introduce a bill that would aim to ensure that people convicted of domestic violence not be allowed to purchase firearms.(Reuters) Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) also wrote to Mattis on Monday, requesting that he immediately initiate an audit of all military criminal investigative organizations going back 10 years, and focusing on cases in which the military was required to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigations of the outcome.Democrats have long argued for expanded background checks but sidelined those demands Tuesday in an effort to focus on improving compliance with current laws.Lets fix the background check system so that, as Republicans tell us over and over and over again, at least we can enforce existing law, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on the Senate floor.Murphy has emerged as one of Congresss most vocal advocates for gun control, frequently referencing his home-state example of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn.The aftermath of that shooting was the last time the Senate came close to passing a gun-control measure.Cornyn, a staunch critic of that and several other gun-reform measures, offered Tuesday to work with Murphy to force the federal government to improve its reporting.The background check system failed us terribly here, Cornyn said, adding that current reporting practice of agencies is unacceptable and it must change.Read more at PowerPost
IRS chief departs, blasting Congress for budget cuts threatening tax agency:::::Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen testifies during a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee in 2014.(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Leaving can be liberating.Republican Sens.Bob Corker (Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) have demonstrated that with their caustic criticisms of President Trump.Now its John Koskinens turn.Thursday is his last day as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, allowing his bluntness about Congress on Tuesday.He started with a veiled dig near the end of his prepared statement during a briefing with reporters.Im hopeful that, in the future, he said, the IRS and Congress can have a more rational and reasonable discussion of the resources the agency needs to meet its very critical responsibilities.That evenhanded comment, however, masks his more pointed worry.After listing how the legislature, led by Republicans focused on punishing the IRS and impeaching Koskinen, hurt the agency and taxpayers with funding cuts, he did not equivocate in placing blame squarely on Capitol Hill.Its clearly a matter of fault, Koskinen said, off script but on message.Thats my point here, as I leave town.I want people to understand that there are ramifications to, in fact, underfunding the agency.If the agency fails and people are looking for fault, it will be the fault of the Congress.I am blaming Congress.Koskinen had repeatedly warned Congress about the dangers of shortchanging the agency that collects more than 90 percent of the governments money.But Republicans were intent on penalizing the IRS because they said it had improperly scrutinized right-leaning organizations.It turns out that left-leaning groups also were targeted by that scrutiny, but for much of that controversy the focus was on conservatives.Congressional retribution meant taxpayer service suffered, or, too often, it simply failed.Because of staffing shortages, there were long telephone wait times for taxpayers, when calls were answered at all.Koskinen outlined two risks that continue to threaten tax administration, saying this is not a question of whether, but of when, if the budget continues to be cut.First are the agencys information technology systems, which Koskinen said have long been operating with antiquated hardware and software.He warned that the potential for a catastrophic system failure is increasing as our infrastructure continues to age.The second risk involves people, not things.The IRS has lost about 20,000 full-time staffers since 2010.Thats a big slice out of workforce that is now about 80,000.About one-third of the compliance staff, those who get taxpayers to pay, was lost.There were twice as many revenue officers in 1954, and there are fewer criminal investigation special agents than at any time since 1971.The number of audited individual tax returns is at its lowest point in 14 years.Criminal investigations are down 11 percent from last year and more than a third below 2010.The number of recommended prosecutions dropped by more than a third from four years ago.What these numbers mean is that, without adequate resources, we dont have enough people to perform all the audits we think are necessary, Koskinen said.If people think that many others are not paying their fair share, or that theyre not going to get caught if they cheat, or theyre just frustrated because they cant get the help they need from us to file their taxes, our voluntary compliance system will be put at risk, he warned.A 1 percent drop in the compliance rate translates into a revenue loss of over $30 billion a year.Avoiding enforcement because of budget cuts is good news for some, but Koskinen, in his frankness, demonstrates how it is bad for the rest of us.From my first meeting with Commissioner Koskinen, I found him to be candid and forthright, said National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon.He was outspoken in his belief that IRS employees are dedicated professionals who care deeply about serving this countrys taxpayers.In addition to managing a major agency with a punitive budget, Koskinen had to deal with hostile Republicans who tried unsuccessfully to impeach him.They accused him of providing false testimony, stonewalling Congress and being complicit in the destruction of evidence related to the IRS scrutiny of charitable organizations.Jason Chaffetz, a Republican and former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that grilled Koskinen during the impeachment attempt, is glad to see him go.David Kautter, the assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, will serve as interim commissioner.Koskinen was a disaster, said Chaffetz, who is no longer in Congress.Instead of cleaning up the scandal that started before Koskinen took office, Chaffetz said Koskinen was a total embarrassment who misled Congress.The Republican impeachment frenzy grew from the belief that the IRS was targeting right-leaning groups for additional scrutiny.But an agency inspector general report issued last month indicated that left-leaning groups were targeted, too.Commissioner Koskinen placed country first when he agreed to lend his management skills in service to the IRS, and our nation is stronger as a result of his dedication and perseverance, said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Oversight committee.I thank him for his willingness to work on behalf of the American people to the best of his ability, even in the face of baseless personal attacks and an extremely challenging management environment.Read more: House snuffs out conservatives IRS impeachment push Democrats call for largest IRS budget to improve service as Trump calls for cuts
Republican Frank A. LoBiondos retirement from House puts swing N.J. district in play:::::Another House Republican announced his retirement Tuesday, putting a closely divided district at risk for the GOP.Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo (R-N.J.), a 12-term congressman, said he would not seek reelection next year, citing in a statement the expected loss of key committee posts and an increasingly bitter political environment.People before politics has always been my philosophy and my motivation, he said in a statement.Regrettably, our nation is now consumed by increasing political polarization; there is no longer middle ground to honestly debate issues and put forward solutions.New Jerseys 2nd Congressional District includes much of the southern third of the state, including Atlantic City and shore towns stretching from Barnegat Light to Cape May.While LoBiondo has won comfortably since he was first elected, in 1994, the district is almost evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats and instantly becomes one of the most likely seats to switch parties in the 2018 midterms.[Republican lawmakers ponder the exits as GOP tensions rise and midterms loom] The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district as having a one-point GOP lean.Its voters picked Donald Trump by five points over Hillary Clinton in last years presidential race, but Barack Obama twice carried the district.Numerous Democrats hold state and local offices in the district and could be formidable candidates.There are also signs that the national Republican agenda is unpopular in the district: LoBiondo voted against the GOP health-care bill earlier this year that would have undone much of the Affordable Care Act.And he has withheld support for the pending GOP tax bill, citing its disproportionate impact on his constituents through the loss of key deductions.LoBiondo has consistently opposed his own partys harmful policies, and its clear he was no longer willing to be associated with establishment Republicans in Washington, said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Evan Lukaske, who added that Democrats are confident that a strong candidate will step up to run for the seat.Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that while Franks leadership will be sorely missed, I am fully confident a strong Republican nominee will hold the seat and continue delivering results for the 2nd District.In his statement, LoBiondo said he is in good health and that his decision was not electoral.Key nonpartisan House forecasters predicted LoBiondo would have been likely to keep his seat had he chosen to run again.Instead, like Reps. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.)and Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), who also recently announced their retirements, LoBiondo cited the consequences of internal GOP rules that will force him from key committee posts.As I am term-limited as Chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee and in my position on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, now is appropriate time to leave, he said before adding a more pointed comment on the contemporary House: Those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers.In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.LoBiondo is one of only six House Republicans currently in Congress who took office as part of the landmark Republican Revolution class of 1994.The others are Reps. Steve Chabot (Ohio), Rodney Frelinghuysen (N.J.), Walter B. Jones (N.C.), Mark Sanford (S.C.) and Mac Thornberry (Tex.).
I will be president for all Americans. One year ago, Trump promised a presidency that hasnt happened.:::::Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Here are key moments from that speech.(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Here are key moments from that speech.(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) When a triumphant Donald Trump took the stage a year ago to claim victory over Hillary Clinton, cheering from the crowd was Jesse Blanco dressed in a blazer, bow tie and a Make America Great Again hat ready for the president-elect to let loose like he had during so many rallies during the campaign.But a very different politician showed up than the one who shocked the globe with his politically incorrect and unapologetic campaign.Trump lavished praise on Hillary Clinton, laid out a centrist agenda focused on infrastructure projects and growing the economy, and told fellow world leaders that he would seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.Above all, he called for unity as he pledged to represent all Americans.Now its time for America to bind the wounds of division, Trump said about 3 a.m. on Nov. 9 in downtown Manhattan.I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.Blanco was surprised by Trumps tone but liked what he heard.Cheers for Donald Trump at his election-night event in New York as results trickled in.(Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post) It didnt seem like a stump speech, like the rallies he had been at.He was very composed, said Blanco, a campaign intern who was then a University of Pennsylvania freshman and attended the party with his younger brother.The crowd kind of wanted a more prideful speech, but he was very focused.The victory speech was a glimpse of a presidency that might have been.Instead, one year later, Trump finds himself the most unpopular president in modern times amid criticism that he has sought to divide more than unite.[Poll: Trumps performance lags behind even tepid public expectations] He has resumed his attacks on Clinton, barred most of those who criticized him during the campaign from working in his administration and seen rapid turnover in his White House.When he has felt under attack, he has aggressively punched back, going after members of his own party, media outlets, the intelligence community, the widow of a soldier killed in Niger, the cast of a Broadway show and minorities playing professional football who have knelt during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police abuse.He has yet to introduce the sweeping infrastructure plan he promised or implement an economic plan, although he is hopeful Congress will pass some tax cuts before the end of the year.He has repeatedly tried to implement bans on foreigners from several majority-Muslim countries, tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act many of his supporters depend on for health insurance and commissioned prototypes for a massive wall along parts of the southern border despite a lack of funding.Blanco wasnt the only one thinking Trumps victory speech was a sign he would be different as president than he was as a candidate.A cake on display at the election night event in New York.(Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post) I remember thinking maybe, just maybe, all of the people who have been saying that he will change were right, said Trump skeptic Andrew Weinstein who attended a gathering of never Trumpers at Lincoln Restaurant in Washington on election night.Maybe, just maybe hes going to heed their wise counsel.Weinstein a former Republican staffer on Capitol Hill and now the head of a public relations firm said Trump should have followed his victory speech by announcing he was closing his Twitter account, reaching out to Republicans who had opposed him on the campaign trail and working across party lines to launch an ambitious infrastructure plan.He could have done all of those things out of the gate, he said.If he could have taken some simple steps like that ...he could have changed the course of his presidency.Instead, Weinstein said, Trump has validated many of the concerns he and others raised during the campaign about the former real estate developers fitness for office.He compared the president and his party to the fable of the scorpion and the turtle who are crossing a river together when the scorpion stings the turtle, causing them both to drown.Thats his nature, Weinstein said of Trump.He cant help but sting.More than 700 miles west of Manhattan in the small Indiana city of Hammond, Carol Kitchens woke up at 4 a.m. the day after the election to prepare for work in a middle school cafeteria and learned Trump won.She quickly searched for his speech online.I applauded that he held out an olive branch, said Kitchens, an independent who voted for Barack Obama twice and then for Trump.The American people really want that.Kitchens like many people who voted for the president is disappointed in the Trump presidency so far but blames Congress for the lack of progress.She said she voted for Trump because she wanted to see a major change in Washington.But the Republicans and the Democrats are playing the same games that they always play, Kitchens said.Im really disappointed.She cheered the passage of the Affordable Care Act in the memory of her daughter, who was diagnosed with cancer in high school, was kicked off her parents health insurance plan when she turned 18 and then couldnt easily get insurance because she had a preexisting condition.She was surprised when Trump and Republicans followed through on their promise to repeal the health care law without composing a comparable replacement.If they really truly thought anything about their constituents, about the people who put them in office, they would fine-tune it, not get rid of it, she said.Kitchens said Trump appears to be learning more about the presidency and politics in Washington each day and she wishes his opponents and the media would stop nitpicking him.Shes hopeful Trump can once again hold out an olive branch like he did in his victory speech.I am very hopeful for the United States.I am very hopeful for Donald Trumps presidency, Kitchens said.Im not expecting miracles, but I am expecting changes.Congress needs to get their act together and do something.After Trumps victory party in Manhattan ended, Blanco caught a 6 a.m. train back to Philadelphia so he could make it to his early morning classes.He was exhausted but energized by the unexpected victory he witnessed.It was a historical night, he said.It was amazing to be there.It was the strangest thing.I had never seen campus so quiet or muted, said Blanco, now a sophomore who is studying political science, when he returned to school.I wondered: Is it always like this after an election?That atmosphere really lingered for a week, two weeks.Campus was as if a funeral had happened.When he arrived back on campus, he could immediately feel the change in tone.Many morning classes were empty, as students who were disappointed by the election results could not bring themselves to attend.He knew there wasnt much support for Trump on campus, but he was stunned to see campus grind to a halt.Since the election, Blanco said it seems like the country has become even more divided, that politics have become even more tribal.Instead of having heated debates, he said he increasingly finds people not even willing to have a discussion about their differences.As a young Republican, he views his party as having an identity crisis.While he celebrated the appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, new anti-lobbying rules for Trump administration staffers and the healthy economy, hes frustrated that Republicans cant come together to pass legislation and that the president often gets too carried away on Twitter.But hes still hopeful the president is constantly learning more about the job and can steer his tenure toward the vision he laid out on election night.He really has to hold true to his words, Blanco said, and work on behalf of all Americans.Scott Clement contributed to this story.
I cant do this again: Why a congressman walked out of moment of silence for Texas victims:::::Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said he walked out of a moment of silence in the House of Representatives for the victims of the Sutherland Springs shooting because he had "been to too many moments of silence."(Ted Lieu) Rep. Ted Lieus national profile skyrocketed as he became the acerbic foil to the nations tweeter in chief, blasting President Trump with incessant and sharply worded responses to presidential posts.But the California Democrats recent foray into social media took aim at other legislators who he said were not doing enough to beef up the nations gun control laws in the wake of Sundays mass shooting at a Texas church.While his colleagues were inside the House chambers on Monday, having a moment of silence for the victims, Lieu was outside, phone in selfie position, being the opposite of silent.My colleagues are doing a moment of silence in the House of Representatives chamber.I respect their right to do that and I myself have participated in many of them, but I cant do this again, he told his Facebook followers.Ive been to too many moments of silences.In just my short career in Congress, three of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history have occurred.I will not be silent.What we need is we need action.We need to pass gun safety legislation now.It was a spray of gasoline on the already incendiary debate about guns in the United States particularly concerning access to the most dangerous weapons that have been used to take dozens of lives in violent moments.Lieu, who is Catholic, told The Washington Post he prayed for the victims on Sunday, but got angry when he saw the congressional calendar.It contained the moment of silence, but no legislative action.[Why Ted Lieu compared Donald Trump to Scott Disick] This is all we do in Congress, he told The Post.We do this brief moment of silence, and then nothing happens.Its not as if were business people.We make laws.Were actually in a position where we can do something about this.Congressman Ted W. Lieu (D-Calif.) in his office in Washington.(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) His ire grew for most of a day, and when the moment of silence began Monday, he grabbed his phone and walked out.Before Lieu had finished the video, he had already received praise from people who say he got to the meat of the issue and criticism from those who derided him for making a political point during a moment of mourning.So glad you are MY REPRESENTATIVE.So proud of you, one woman wrote during the video.Your an idiot, a man wrote a few milliseconds later.To leave a moment of silence to do a political rant is not cool.Total disrespect for those killed.One minute is all you needed to wait, another commenter said.Its an embarrassment that you couldnt show 60 seconds of respect before you started grandstanding.Lieu was not the first to raise the gun control issue.Others brought it up in the hours after the shooting, which left 26 dead in a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex.May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 6, 2017 As the debate raged on, investigators were trying to parse out how the suspected killer got his guns despite a violent criminal past.The Air Force said it did not follow policies for alerting authorities about Devin Kelleys criminal history when he served at a New Mexico base, as reported by The Washington Posts Eli Rosenberg, Alex Horton and Mark Berman.He should not have been allowed to buy a gun because of his domestic-violence conviction in 2014.Trump asserted Tuesday that tougher gun laws would have made no difference three days ago.He said hundreds more people would have died had another man not been able to neutralize the alleged killer with a gun of his own.A month ago, a similar debate raged about bump stocks, a contraption that can be used to legally increase a rifles firing rate.Several rifles with bump stocks were found in the room of the shooter who opened fire on a concert crowd on the Las Vegas Strip last month from an upper hotel floor, killing 58 and injuring more than 500.As The Posts Aaron C. Davis, Beth Reinhard and Sari Horwitz reported, the increasingly popular bump stock has allowed even novice gun-owners to easily modify a legal semiautomatic rifle into one that resembles a battlefield machine gun.After the Las Vegas mass shooting, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced a bill specifically targeting bump stocks and similar inventions.A month later, Lieu ended his moment of non-silence with a call to action, saying Congress should pass reasonable gun safety legislation including a universal background check law.He told The Post that he got the irony of his predicament that more people are listening to him because of his sharp tweets toward Trump.For whatever reason, in me tweeting, it has resulted in more people paying attention, and I do think that while I have this opportunity, I should try to affect sentiment while I can.He also sought to blunt criticism that skipping out on a congressional moment of silence was in some way disrespectful to victims.Not being silent, he said, was pretty much the point.I think the best way for me to honor victims of mass shooting is to try to prevent further mass shootings.Read more: What its like to hear a shooting spree unfold two floors above your hotel room After shootings, police fear being a public target even at lunch Man held by Taliban for five years thought his captors were joking about Trump being president
Where the guns used in Chicago actually came from:::::During his state trip to South Korea, President Trump claimed "hundreds more" might have died if another man had not been able to "neutralize" the alleged shooter with a gun of his own during the Nov. 5 Texas shooting.(The Washington Post) While visiting South Korea on Tuesday, President Trump was asked whether he supports increased vetting of gun purchasers, given the mass shooting that occurred on Sunday in Texas.One part of his response would not surprise close observers of his presidency.If you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, its Chicago, he said.And Chicago is a disaster.Its a total disaster.This refrain is a common one.Chicago has tried to crack down on guns, but has seen a surge in gun violence.The implication from Trumps comments, then, is that new gun regulations wouldnt prevent gun violence and might even make it worse.But as a report released earlier this year by the office of Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) reveals, most of the guns recovered in Chicago came from outside the state.Only 40 percent of the guns recovered in the city were purchased in Illinois, the report read, including hundreds purchased at gun shops outside city boundaries.The report includes maps of two gun shops from which a large number of guns recovered in Chicago were purchased.The black dots are where the guns were recovered; the red Xs are the locations of the gun stores.Many of the guns recovered in Chicago a fifth of them were purchased in Indiana, which abuts the citys eastern border.An additional 9 percent of the guns recovered in the city came from Mississippi and Wisconsin.This pattern is not unique to Chicago.States with tougher gun laws often discover that places with more lax legislation are the source of many of the firearms used in crimes.Last year, the attorney general of New York issued a report about the flow of guns into his state.Attorney General Eric Schneiderman identified what he called the iron pipeline, a string of East Coast states through which guns flowed into the state.In New York City, for example, nearly 9 in 10 firearms come from out of state.Unlike Chicago, the city doesnt abut a state with looser gun laws.To its west is New Jersey; to the east, Long Island and Connecticut.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives compiles statewide data on recovered firearms.The most recent data, covering 2016, reveals some interesting patterns.A blue block indicates that the state identified at the left side of the graph is a major source of firearms for the state labeled in each vertical column.The darker the blue, the more guns came from that state.Notice the states highlighted in yellow.Several states Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Virginia are common sources of firearms for most of the states for which we compiled data.Those states are also ones in which gun laws are not among the most stringent.Also notice the yellow block at the center right of the graph.In New York and New Jersey, the blocks marking guns bought in each of those states are fairly light, compared with the block representing the number of guns from Indiana recovered in Indiana.In other words, a lower percentage of the guns recovered in New York and New Jersey were purchased in New York and New Jersey meaning that more of the recovered firearms came from out of state.Chicago still has an undeniable problem with gun crime, and many of the guns used in those crimes come from dealers in the state.But blaming Chicagos gun violence on its gun laws misunderstands the economics at play nationally.Inadvertently, Trump is undercutting his own point.To reduce the number of guns used in crime in Chicago, one can argue, youd need to implement tougher gun laws nationally to cut down on the number brought into the city.That, of course, was not the goal of Trumps argument.

Your view of the economy depends on whether your party controls the White House:::::President Trump waves to supporters on the steps of Air Force One as he arrives in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Feb. 10.(Wilfredo Lee/AP) Immediately after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, Gallup noticed something unusual.The week before the election, more than three-quarters of Republicans said they thought the economy was getting worse.The week after?A huge, 60-point shift.All of a sudden, a plurality of Republicans thought the economy was getting better.What changed?Only the result of the presidential race.As you might expect, that result had an inverse effect on Democrats: Suddenly they were more pessimistic than optimistic about how the economy was doing.Now-President Trump has repeatedly cited economic enthusiasm as a sign that his presidency is going well.But as data from the Pew Research Center released Tuesday makes clear, that enthusiasm is generally pretty one-sided.Pew asked a range of questions, splitting up the responses by party (including independents who tend to lean toward one party or the other).Before the election, Pew found, more than half of Republicans thought incomes were falling behind relative to the cost of living.After the election, that dropped to a bit over a third and more than half of Democrats suddenly felt as if their incomes were falling behind.Obviously, there wasnt a significant change in incomes that affected only one party.Only the perceptions changed.Partisan perceptions of the economy arent new to the Trump era, but theyve emerged relatively recently in American politics.Pews data goes back more than 20 years, allowing us to see how perceptions of the economy fared under past presidents.Under Bill Clinton, for example, both Republicans and Democrats viewed the economy as good.When George W. Bush was elected, though, Democratic perceptions plunged as Republican perceptions held steady.(There was a recession early in Bushs first term, which may have influenced the Democrats views.)By the end of Bushs term, with another recession looming, even Republicans felt that things were bad.Then came Barack Obama, and Democratic confidence in the economy grew much more quickly than did Republican confidence until Election Day 2016.At that point, a gigantic split in perceptions.We see a similar effect on a related question: Will the economy be better in a year?Republicans were more confident about it under Bush; Democrats were more confident under Obama and then Trump broke the scale.The effect is more pronounced when we consider solely the margin between the two parties.In the middle of Bushs eight years, Republicans were up to 50 points more likely to view the economy as excellent or good compared with Democrats.On perceptions of how the economy will be in 12 months, the effect of the 2016 election is stunning.That partisan divide trickles down into Pews in other ways, too.For example, Pew asked whether plenty of jobs were available in respondents communities, and Republicans were 11 points more likely to say that there were.Asked whether good jobs were available, Republicans were 25 points more likely to agree.The economy is doing well (except, according to the president, in Virginia).But how Americans view it these days is colored heavily by how they view the person in the White House.In light of these long-term trends, what Gallup noted after Election Day last year isnt a surprise.Nor should it have been, really, in an era in which partisanship colors nearly everything.

Labour calls for probe into Priti Patel meetings in Israel:::::Theresa May is under pressure to launch an investigation into one of her Cabinet ministers for failing to disclose meetings with top Israeli officials.Labour accused International Development Secretary Priti Patel of committing four "serious breaches" of the ministerial code over her trip to the Middle East in August.Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said Ms Patel should face a probe led by the standards adviser, after she was reprimanded personally by the PM.The Witham MP has apologised for not notifying Downing Street or the Foreign Office of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others during time out on a family holiday.Image: Priti Patel has left the UK on a trip to Africa She has since missed an Urgent Question in Parliament and left the country for a trip to Uganda and Ethiopia.Mr Trickett said the PM should either call in her independent adviser on ministerial standards or "state publicly and explain your full reasons for why Priti Patel retains your confidence despite clear breaches of the ministerial code".He alleged Ms Patel broke four grounds of the code - openness, collective responsibility, honesty and performing only those duties allocated to them by the PM.While Labour's Chris Bryant told Sky News: "She lied to the country when she suggested last week that she had told the Foreign Secretary before she went - and she hadn't.":: Westminster scandal - a growing problem for May A Number 10 spokesperson said Mrs May had "full confidence" in her International Development Secretary and that she had not broken the ministerial code.But they referred questions about who paid for expenses surrounding the meetings with Israeli officials to DfID.The department has not yet responded to questions from Sky News, but Downing Street previously said Ms Patel was on a private holiday "paid for by herself".
Westminster harassment scandal: MPs' staff and Unite union join anti-sleaze talks:::::House of Commons staff and trade union representatives are to join Theresa May and other party leaders in attempting to crack down on sexual harassment and bullying by MPs.Westminster's Members and Peers Staff Association (Mapsa), which represents secretaries, and the Unite trade union, which represents researchers, will help draw up new grievance procedures.Their involvement in the Commons sleaze crackdown was agreed at a meeting between the two groups and the Prime Minister, 24 hours after she met political party leaders.Unite also claimed the PM had agreed to consider its branch's call for formal recognition at Westminster, which Jeremy Corbyn and Labour MPs demanded at the meeting of party leaders.:: May pledges to create 'new culture of respect' :: Westminster harassment - who is accused of what?Image: Theresa May is leading a cross-party response to the scandal Downing Street said the Prime Minister's aim was to have an "open and candid" meeting with Commons staff and hear first-hand their views about the current system of dealing with complaints.Five Mapsa members and five from Unite met the Prime Minister in her Commons office.During the talks, she invited their groups to join the working group of senior MPs of all parties which will draw up a new grievance procedure for staff, to deal with misconduct allegations.:: Westminster scandal: Growing problem for May Image: Sir Michael Fallon was forced out over revelations about his actions "We are to be represented all the way through this, which I think is exactly as it should be," Georgina Kester, a Commons secretary who chairs Mapsa, told Sky News after the meeting."It was an extremely constructive meeting.We came away feeling the Prime Minister had listened to us and taken our concerns on board.We have been invited, with Unite, to take part in the working group."Ms Kester said she was now confident that real progress could be made in curbing sexual harassment and bullying at Westminster."Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet now," she said."Everybody wants a workable solution to this problem.The involvement of staff at all levels will help.We are a cross-party organisation.I things will change and the situation will improve."Unite parliamentary branch chair Max Freedman, said: "This was a productive meeting and the Prime Minister agreed to consider the branch's call for formal union recognition.Image: Jeremy Corbyn has demanded Unite be formally recognised in Westminster "Unite also emphasised the need for the voice of staff to be amplified in the discussion of new processes and in eliminating the culture of bullying and harassment."We look forward to a positive response from our meeting."Speaking before the meeting with Mapsa and Unite, the PM's spokesman said: "She feels it is important to get that first-hand sense of the current system."We want people to feel they can be open and candid with the Prime Minister.Clearly we want to move forward on a cross-party basis.It will be helpful to inform that to talk to the actual staff."
Ex-Welsh minister Carl Sargeant dead after allegations about conduct:::::Former Welsh government minister Carl Sargeant, who was suspended last week amid allegations about incidents with women, has died.The 49-year-old served as Labour's Welsh Assembly Member for Alyn and Deeside since 2003.North Wales Police said officers were called to an address in Connah's Quay, Flintshire at about 11.30am on Tuesday, where Mr Sargeant's body was found.He is understood to have taken his own life, the Press Association reported, and police are not treating his death as suspicious.The Welsh Ambulance Service said they were called about half an hour before the police.Until last week, Mr Sargeant was Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in the Welsh Government before being removed from his role and suspended by Labour.Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones revealed he felt he had no choice but to order an investigation after being made aware of "certain incidents" with women allegedly involving Mr Sargeant.Mr Sargeant, who previously served in a number of other ministerial roles, had described the allegations as "shocking and distressing" but said the details of the claims had not been disclosed to him.He added he was looking forward to "returning to Government once my name has been cleared".Mr Sargeant's suspension came amid a sexual harassment scandal across all parties in British politics.I'm deeply shocked to hear of the terrible news about Carl Sargeant.My thoughts and profound sympathy are with his family and friends.Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) November 7, 2017 Mr Sargeant was married to Bernie and they had two children, Lucy and Jack.He had lived in Connah's Quay, in his constituency, all his life.Before entering politics, the keen football fan worked at a chemical manufacturing plant and was a quality and environmental auditor and industrial firefighter.In a statement following his death, his family said: "Carl was a much-loved husband, father and friend."He wasn't simply a part of our family.He was the glue that bound us together.He was the heart of our family.We loved him so very much."He was the most kind and caring husband, father, son and friend.We are devastated beyond words, and we know our grief will be shared by all those who knew and loved him."We are in shock and grief.We ask that our privacy is respected at this time."Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter: "My thoughts are with the friends and family of Carl Sargeant following his tragic death."Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also described himself as "shocked, horrified" and "deeply sympathetic" to Mr Sargeant's family.Asked if there should be a change in the way allegations of impropriety are dealt with, Mr Corbyn added: "All allegations must be examined and must be pursued."But there also has to be great pastoral care and support given to everybody involved in these accusations and also that will deal with them, all parties, as quickly as possible."According to Sky sources, Mr Sargeant was receiving high level support from various parts of the Labour Party - both in Wales and Westminster - at the time of his death, with the purpose of checking on his well-being.Sky News understands this is standard procedure for those accused of inappropriate behaviour and that Kelvin Hopkins, the Luton North MP denying allegations of inappropriate behaviour, is also receiving support.Sky News also understands Mr Sargeant was aware of the nature of the allegations made against him.Image: The married father-of-two was an ex-Welsh government minister Carwyn Jones said: "Carl was a friend as well as a colleague and I am shocked and deeply saddened by his death."He made a big contribution to Welsh public life and fought tirelessly for those he represented both as a minister and as a local Assembly Member."He will be a great loss both to our party and to the Senedd.My heartfelt sympathies are with his family at this difficult time."The UK Government's Wales Secretary, Alun Cairns, said he was "shocked and saddened by the tragic news".Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: "This is unspeakably sad news.Our Parliament has lost a stalwart, and many of us have lost a friend."The Welsh Assembly suspended proceedings on Tuesday afternoon following the news.
Boris Johnson slams Iran blunder critics for 'deflecting blame':::::Boris Johnson has derided critics of a comment he made that could lengthen the sentence of a British woman jailed in Iran.The Foreign Secretary said people attacking him over the blunder were "deflecting blame and accountability" from the Middle Eastern country - which was "truly responsible".He said it was "simply untrue" there was any connection between his mistaken remark and the legal proceedings against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.Image: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been jailed since April 2016 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been jailed in Iran since April 2016.Her family had called on Mr Johnson to correct his recent claim she was teaching journalists at the time she was arrested - rather than on holiday.Mr Johnson called the country's foreign minister to insist it was "absolutely not the case", but dodged offering an apology.He told the House of Commons on Tuesday: "What everybody in this House wants to see is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe released - and that is exactly what the Foreign Office is working for; that is what we've been working for solidly over the last 18 months."He later added: "Of course I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context or misconstrued."Image: The British citizen was on holiday in Iran But Tory backbencher Anna Soubry responded that his "lack of contrition is as shameful as the original error"."Boris Johnson doesn't understand magnitude of the job & responsibility he holds," she tweeted.While Labour MP Chris Bryant commented: "I fear that if he can't show some contrition today, then the honest truth is he shouldn't be in his job because our people aren't safe."Image: Anna Soubry called the lack of apology 'shameful' But Foreign Affairs committee member Nadhim Zahawi said the Iranian authorities were the sole ones to blame for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's incarceration."If our words really do matter then it's only right that we don't play party politics," he said.Mr Johnson also confirmed he would travel to Iran before the end of the year to discuss Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case and hopefully visit her in prison.The row and its fallout has led to calls for the Foreign Secretary to consider his position - should Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have her sentenced increased.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told Sky News on Tuesday: "I don't believe it is a serious gaffe."I think people in the Iranian regime, which is a very brutal regime, are using this as an excuse to hold a UK citizen in the most tenuous, if not illegal, circumstances."
Nicola Sturgeon makes gay convictions apology and announces new legislation:::::Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has formally apologised to gay men criminalised by once illegal sexual offences, calling it a "historic wrong".Her apology, on behalf of the Scottish Government, spoke about those convicted of homosexual acts that were once against the law.It came before a debate in which she set out plans for a new law at Holyrood to pardon them for their historic convictions.The legislation will also enable the men to apply for their convictions to be removed from central criminal conviction records.It has been dubbed Scotland's "Turing Law" after codebreaker Alan Turing, who was given a posthumous royal pardon after being convicted in 1952 for gross indecency.:: Posthumous pardons for gay men over now-abolished sexual offences Image: Codebreaker Alan Turing was granted a pardon posthumously Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that the new legislation puts right "a historic wrong".She said: "For people convicted of same-sex sexual activity which is now legal, the wrong has been committed by the state to them, not by individuals.These individuals therefore deserve an unqualified apology as well as a pardon."She said the new bill would not "erase those injustices" but that she hoped it could "provide some comfort to those who endured those injustices".In Scotland, consensual sexual acts between men over 21 were decriminalised in 1981.It was not until 2001 that the age was lowered to 16.The new Holyrood legislation - the Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) Bill - was supported by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said: "Scotland is a better place to be gay than at any time in my lifetime and this action will make it better still."LBGTI support groups have also welcomed the bill.Tim Hopkins, director of the Equality Network, said it would be of "direct importance to hundreds of people with past criminal convictions for the kinds of relationships that were perfectly legal for their heterosexual friends".Stonewall Scotland called it an "important moment" that enables the country to "draw a line, once and for all, under a dark period in Scotland's history".The move in Scotland has not been reflected south of the border.Westminster's policing and crime act only seeks to pardon men who were convicted of same-sex offences who have since died.Men convicted of such offences in England and Wales who are still alive have to apply to the Home Office to have criminal records erased.
Scottish Parliament evacuated after 'white powder' in envelope sent to MSP:::::The Scottish Parliament was evacuated after a suspicious package containing white powder was sent to an MSP.Police in Edinburgh said they were called to Holyrood at about 11.35am, and the building was evacuated as a precaution.A source at the parliament said the incident involved three similar envelopes and that one was believed to contain white powder.According to Sky's Scotland Correspondent James Matthews, the alarm was raised after staff of Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro-Johnstone opened the mail.He was not there are at the time.A Parliament spokesman later confirmed the incident was over: "Parliamentary business as well as all tours and events will go ahead as planned this afternoon."The MSP block is now open and Members and their staff can return to their offices.The Scottish Parliament building remains open to the public."
Paradise Papers: Outcry over taxes 'a well-planned political campaign':::::The controversy surrounding the so-called Paradise Papers is merely a "well-planned, ongoing political campaign", Guernsey's chief minister has told Sky News.The documents, which were obtained and analysed by a range of worldwide media organisations, relate to the financial affairs of some of the world's top business people, companies and well-known figures.The publication of the records has led to allegations over taxes paid by the Queen's private estate, shares held by US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, and a helicopter leasing deal set up by advisers of British F1 champion Lewis Hamilton.However, the chief minister of Guernsey, where money is often invested before being filtered into the UK, has accused those behind the publication of the records of "pushing an agenda that isn't either to do with tax or morality".Image: Gavin St Pier pictured with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon Gavin St Pier told Sky News: "The timing of this is not accidental, it has been timed to coincide with the meeting of the European Council of Finance Ministers, where undoubtedly they will trot out and tell the UK that they need to get their house in order with the crown dependencies and overseas territories."That is simply because the UK financial services industry, of which we are a part, is the most competitive and successful in Europe."It is very much playing to the European agenda, particularly at this time with Brexit."Image: Lewis Hamilton has been accused of avoiding tax on a private jet worth 16.5m Describing Guernsey's financial services sector as "a funnel for foreign direct investment in the UK", Mr St Pier said the Channel island was vital to the British economy."There are literally tens of thousands of jobs in the UK which depend on us doing our jobs and doing it properly."That is of substantial value to the UK's exchequer.We are a symbiotic and important part of the UK's economy."That is not a convenient narrative for the EU at this particular time.It is not about the rich getting richer, the rich will be paying their taxes when and where they are due."
Extremist content online: What would you take down?:::::Government plans to remove online extremist content will "backfire" and fail to prevent terrorist attacks, Sky News has been told.Just hours after the London Bridge attack in June, Theresa May made it clear that she believed the availability of extremist content online was partly to blame."We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed.Yet that is precisely what the internet - and the big companies that provide internet-based services - provide," she had claimed.Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, announced plans during conference season that would see people who repeatedly view terrorist content online jailed for up to 15 years.But these criticisms and plans are flawed according to Jamie Bartlett, the director at the centre for the analysis of social media at the Demos think tank.Video: Those who view extremist content online could be jailed for 15 years In an interview with Sky News, Mr Bartlett said: "Despite all of the protestations that this material online is radicalising people and turning them into terrorists and extremists, the actual role that online material plays still isn't particularly clear."The truth is that a lot of the material that they share is not actually illegal at all."Instead, it was often comprised of "news reports about perceived injustices in Palestine, stuff that you could never censor in a free society."In August, YouTube was criticised after deleting video evidence relating to potential war crimes in Syria as part of its work to remove terrorist content and propaganda from the platform.Mr Bartlett added: "Part of the problem is we are putting a lot of pressure on the tech firms to remove content, and they are tending now to err on the side of safety, which means they would rather remove the stuff than leave it up."I don't think we should consider removing this content to be so vital in the fight against extremism and terrorism.Video: Tech companies take on extremism "Material that is produced by a terrorist organisation, or material that is directly inciting people to commit violence - that should be removed."The stuff that's underneath that threshold which is offensive or nasty - hateful even - leave it.Don't try and remove that.Don't always try to inch forward."This is what the Government is doing, their extremism strategy, where they're trying to remove offensive content, extreme content, that's going to backfire.":: Take it down or leave it up?Sky News asked Mr Bartlett where he would draw the line in the case of five example of extremist content which might be found online.But first: what do you think?Asked if a video featuring a beheading by Islamic State be taken down or left up, Mr Bartlett said: "If it is produced by Islamic State, who are a proscribed terrorist group, then take it down."A holocaust denial video?Mr Bartlett: "No, leave it up."A video explaining how you can build a bomb?Mr Bartlett: "Leave it up."A video explaining how to secretly get funds to Islamic State?Mr Bartlett: "Leave it up."A bomb-making video which encouraged people to do the same?Mr Bartlett: "Take it down."
Post-Brexit trade bill to be published in Parliament:::::The Government starts the legal process today to carve out the UK's post-Brexit future as an independent trading nation.A Trade Bill will be published in Parliament which is designed to give the Government the power to develop its trade relationship with the EU and the rest of the world.At its core is a commitment to write the EU's current free trade agreements into the statute books, so that existing arrangements can be closely paralleled.A Government source said this was designed to minimise confusion with our non-EU trading partners and avoid "substantive renegotiations".The source suggested most nations with whom we currently trade as part of the European Union would welcome the clarity, which would "enable us to maintain and improve our role as a global player".That job has been handed to a charismatic New Zealander called Crawford Falconer who is leading the nitty-gritty of the trade negotiations.Mr Falconer, 63, is a passionate runner and rugby enthusiast known for his blunt talk and dry humour.Image: Straight-talking rugby fan Crawford Falconer is in charge of the Bill He is also renowned for his grasp of detail - which will be tested severely as the complex and thorny detachment process continues..The Bill would also allow the Government to apply to become an independent member of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).This valuable deal allows the UK - as part of the EU - to bid for government contracts around the world worth an estimated 1.3tn pounds.When we leave the EU, we would also leave membership of the GPA, so a legal path to rejoin would have to be laid.The Bill would also allow the Government to set up a new way to resolve international trade disputes.Currently the UK uses the EU's established mechanisms, but after Brexit a new institution would be required to monitor practices which could damage business - such as flooding the British market with cheap imports.This body would investigate complaints from industry and recommend whether action should be taken.Opponents of Brexit - and the Government's approach - are likely to frustrate the Bill's passage through Parliament by tabling amendments.Over 400 have been added to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which forced the Government to delay the line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill in committee.
Westminster sex scandal: MPs criticise 'disappointing' response:::::Party leaders have agreed to implement a series of changes at Parliament amid Westminster's sexual harassment scandal - but the proposals have been branded "utterly disappointing" by some female MPs.At a meeting at 10 Downing Street on Monday, leaders of the Westminster parties agreed plans for an independent grievance process, to be introduced in the New Year, along with improved human resources support.This will include upgrading an existing helpline in order to provide face-to-face support for parliamentary staff by the end of this month.The leaders also established a cross-party working group to implement the changes, with their action coming amid a host of allegations against Government ministers, MPs and officials from across parties.:: Westminster harassment: Who is accused of what?Image: Party leaders meet in Downing Street to discuss sexual harassment But prominent Labour MPs have expressed regret that the reforms do not go far enough to protect staff.Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy said: "Still much work to do making Parliament safe if this only comes into place in a year and only covers MP staff."Her party colleague, Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips, added: "Find this utterly disappointing.Great a grievance procedure, the victims will be thrilled.What if they don't work in Parliament?"What about sanctions, what about specialist support from actual professionals who know what they are talking about on sexual violence/harassment?"So if you don't work in Parliament and an MP assaults you, or (an) MP's staff does.How will this help?":: Pestminster - Political farce is deadly serious Video: PM on 'deeply troubling' harassment culture Speaking after the meeting, Theresa May hailed an "important step forward" as she revealed the plans."Sadly, over recent days we've seen a number of allegations about figures from across the political parties," the Prime Minister said."It's important that those are investigated impartially and some have rightly been referred to the police."I think if this hasn't happened to you it's difficult to appreciate the impact this sort of behaviour can have."It simply has a lasting impact on people and we need to do more to stop these abuses of power."The Prime Minister said the allegations centred on Parliament "should be a matter of shame for us all", but denied having prior knowledge of claims against Tory MPs before the scandal broke.Video: Is the scandal in Westminster registering with voters?Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed the "proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating" over the cross-party proposals.Speaking to Sky News in Parliament after the meeting, he said: "We've agreed to set up this urgent group to represent all staff who work in this building, not just MPs and their staff."It's also employees of political parties, it's cleaners, it's catering workers, it's officials, it's agency staff."All people who work in this building deserve the knowledge they are in a safe working environment where there will be zero tolerance of bullying or harassment."It's a place that's very grand, very important and very exciting, but it's also a place of work."Mr Corbyn also suggested the party leaders had sent "a message to the whole country" with their response to the scandal.The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: "Parliament must be able to lead by example, and as politicians, we need to put in place mechanisms that fully support staff."
Ryan breaks record for shutting down floor debate:::::Paul Ryan vowed an end to the much-despised, top-down approach of his predecessor when he took the speakers gavel in 2015, promising a House thats more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, more participatory.We're not going to bottle up the process so much and predetermine the outcome of everything around here, he said in his first news conference as speaker.Story Continued Below But two years later, the House Rules Committee, which is controlled by the speaker, just set a record for the most closed rules in a session barring lawmakers for the 49th time from offering amendments on a bill.Ryan has yet to allow a single piece of legislation to be governed by an open rule, which allows members to propose changes on the floor.That makes Ryan the only speaker in modern history to forgo the open process entirely so far, according to senior House Democratic sources.They argue such a strategy while politically expedient for Republicans eager to avoid toxic and divisive votes is bad for democracy because it stifles debate.The Republican Majority has now made history for all the wrong reasons, said House Rules Committee ranking Democrat Louise Slaughter of New York in a statement Tuesday.Under Speaker Ryans leadership, this session of Congress has now become the most closed Congress in history.Michigan Republican Justin Amash, a process stickler and one of the most conservative members of the House, agreed, arguing in an interview Tuesday that Ryan has not lived up to his promise.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.When we offer amendments, they have to be approved by leadership before we vote on them and thats not how our system is supposed to work," he said."Our system was designed to reflect the will of the people in the House.And the speakers job is to ensure the system is open and people are given a fair opportunity to present their amendments."He later added: "Right now that's really broken and it seems to me that people in power here prefer a system where you have as few votes as possible and you attach everything to one or two votes and then everyone has the excuse that they had to vote for it because it has everything in it."Asked about the matter during a news conference Tuesday morning, Ryan denied that assessment and noted more bills have passed through committees this Congress than under Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and both Bushes though not all of those have received floor consideration or passed the House.We absolutely have an open process, Ryan told reporters.Were going through the committee process.All these bills are going through the committee.According to statistics compiled by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthys office, Republican panels have marked up 449 bills under President Donald Trump so far compared to 410 under Obama, 249 under George W. Bush, 260 under Clinton and 313 under George H.W.Bush.A House GOP Rules Committee source also notes that theyve allowed 864 amendments on the floor this Congress, which is more than the 778 amendments Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) allowed when she held the gavel in the 111th Congress.On Monday night, the House Rules Committee approved its 49th closed rule this year, the new record for a session.The result is that more than 1,300 amendments also have been blocked from consideration.Democrats and Republican proponents of open rules argue that shutting out input from lawmakers leads to worse policy because it keeps ideas from being considered in the light of day.One amendment that Democrats say merited a floor debate, but was sidelined by GOP leaders, was a bipartisan proposal to phase out the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, a hot topic following the Niger ambush that left four U.S. soldiers dead and many Americans wondering about the sprawl of the U.S. military abroad.That bipartisan amendment, blocked from being offered to a spending bill for Defense and Homeland Security agencies, had support from veteran Republican lawmakers.Others rejected amendments have been less explosive.Democrats were unimpressed, for example, when Republicans blocked a series of amendments from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)on whistleblowing protections, which they argue were absolutely germane and relevant to the whistleblower bill at hand.Open process my foot, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.)said, responding on the House floor to Ryans Tuesday comments.I guess in the age of Donald Trump words simply dont matter anymore.Black is white.Up is down.Open is closed.And politicians can say whatever they think sounds good and think they can get away with it facts be damned.Democrats arent the only ones getting the short end of the stick under numerous closed rules.Republican ideas also get shut out, something thats peeved members like Amash.Leadership, for example, recently decided not to allow an amendment by Rep. John Duncan (R-Tenn.) to give volunteer doctors who provided free medical services greater flexibility on where they practice.Asked about the matter Tuesday, Duncan said he is trying to get the Senate to fix the issue in the health care bill since his was not made in order in the House.Something similar is happening right now on the GOP's massive tax bill.Republicans across the conference are buttonholing members of the Ways and Means Committee to try to ask them to offer amendments on their behalf in committee.That's because amendments to the tax bill will likely not be allowed on the floor.A House Rules Committee Republican source said Democrats are being misleading.The 115th Congress number of closed rules is high, the source argued, because the chamber passed a number of Congressional Review Act bills to repeal regulations, and those are not subject to amendment.The source said modified rules, which make in order certain amendments but not others, allow the process to move faster a structure leadership often uses.Leaders like Ryan are also responsible for protecting the majority, and having their members vote on sensitive issues is risky politically.Republicans also blame Democrats for forcing a more guarded procedure in the first place, accusing the left of trying to tank the legislative process by offering toxic amendments.They often point to the summer of 2016, when Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) offered an amendment to bar federal funds from going to contractors who discriminate based on employees sexual orientation or gender identity.The amendment passed with centrist Republicans joining Democrats.But then those Democrats wouldnt back the overall bill, leaving GOP leadership stranded after the amendment repelled conservative votes.The legislation failed on the floor in an embarrassing defeat for the GOP.And Republicans since then have accused Democrats of intentionally trying to derail their legislation.That argument might work for some, but it certainly doesnt work for everyone.Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), a rules guru and member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said while he thinks the process has improved under Ryan, hed love to see more open rules.Lets fight it out, he said.If the idea can win on the floor then thats what the American people want.Thats what the representative government is about.Amash was less forgiving: "We're supposed to have a speaker who keeps the House open and reflects the will of the people...There's a lot of protection happening right now, where leaders are trying to shield their members from votes."
Texas Republican Ted Poe won't seek reelection in 2018:::::In his retirement announcement, Rep. Ted Poe said he's in "good health" and plans to continue pursuing his interests after leaving office.| Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Texas Republican Ted Poe won't seek reelection in 2018 'I am grateful for the honor and privilege to represent the best people in America, Texass Second Congressional District,' Poe said in a statement on his official Twitter account.Seven-term Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) said Tuesday he will not seek reelection in 2018, the latest in a string of GOP lawmakers to announce their retirements recently.Poe, a former prosecutor and judge, won reelection in 2016 in the solidly conservative 2nd Congressional District by nearly 30 points, but said he was ready to move on.Story Continued Below "I am grateful for the honor and privilege to represent the best people in America, Texass Second Congressional District," Poe said in a statement on his official Twitter account.Poe, 69, announced last summer he had been diagnosed with Leukemia.But in his retirement announcement, the lawmaker said he's in "good health" and plans to continue pursuing his interests after leaving office.In the past week, two other Texas Republicans, Reps. Lamar Smith and Jeb Hensarling, also said they would leave Congress after this term.
Dem senators get surprise call from Trump on taxes:::::Democrats "appreciate the effort and outreach," said Sen. Chris Coons, "but I think every one of us expressed our deep frustration that this meeting happened very late in the process."| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Dem senators get surprise call from Trump on taxes Trump told the Democrats that 'rich people get hurt in this bill.'President Donald Trump called a dozen Democratic senators Tuesday to court support for tax reform, but didn't appear to change many minds.Dialing in from his trip to Asia, Trump connected with the lawmakers as they huddled with two of his top aides on Capitol Hill.Leaving the meeting, though, Democrats reiterated their interest in a bipartisan process rather than the closed-door, one-party approach that congressional Republicans have taken so far on tax legislation.Story Continued Below Senate Republicans expect to release their tax bill later this week and start marking it up next week, a pace that is already raising fears of exclusion among some of the politically vulnerable red-state Democrats who say their votes could otherwise be in play.Trump told the Democrats that "rich people get hurt in this bill," Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) recalled after leaving the meeting."We made it clear that we don't agree with that."Brown pitched two amendments to the GOP tax bill that he said Trump responded to favorably, but the senator indicated that Democrats' hopes of shaping the Senate tax bill are not high."We hope it's in the bill," Brown said of the Democratic input."If it's not, I just wonder what this is all about."Playbook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Brown's proposals would provide tax credits for keeping jobs in the U.S., expand the child tax credit and offer more generous earned income tax credits.In addition, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)discussed manufacturing tax proposals during the meeting, according to an aide in the room.The aide added that Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) told attendees at the meeting, including White House legislative affairs director Marc Short and top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, that he is unlikely to support the tax bill."This was more a conversation about our desire to have a seat at the table and to be able to contribute ideas that would genuinely help the middle class, strengthen manufacturing, make our country more competitive, than it was specific negotiations" on any proposal, Coons told reporters.Trump spoke for about 10 minutes, he added.Asked whether he viewed Trump as receptive to the Democratic ideas, Coons paused before saying that he was "pleased the president took the time to call into the meeting."Democrats "appreciate the effort and outreach," added Coons, "but I think every one of us expressed our deep frustration that this meeting happened very late in the process."Coons said that Trump aides were "listening" as he predicted their tax bill would hit the same obstacles that doomed their Republican-only approach to Obamacare repeal.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who organized the meeting, had a more positive, but still wary, take."What happens if the economy doesn't grow the way it's supposed to" in response to the corporate tax cuts that Republicans are proposing, Manchin asked.He suggested a "trigger mechanism" that could kick in to avoid deepening the deficit with further tax cuts if economic growth doesn't materialize as projected.Broadly speaking, Manchin said, Democrats implored Trump and his party to slow down."What's the rush and the hurry with something so monumental as this is going to be?"Manchin said.Brown suggested another step Trump might take to show good faith with Democrats."Some of us wanted to see him if he'd release his tax returns, we could see how we'd do under this" legislation, Brown said.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Senators look to bolster background check system after Texas shooting Senators are slowly turning on the legislative spigot following the shooting at a rural Texas church that left more than two dozen dead.The efforts in the Senate are being spurred by the U.S. Air Forces disclosure late Monday that officials did not submit information to a federal database that the shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic assault that should have prevented him from owning firearms.Story Continued Below Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) is speaking privately with at least three Democratic senators about legislation that would better ensure the criminal histories of potential gun buyers are properly transferred to the FBIs National Instant Criminal Background Check System.Separately, Sens.Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said they are working on legislation meant to ensure all domestic violence convictions in the military are captured in the federal database.Democrats say the efforts wont go far enough to effectively curb gun violence, but theyre willing to negotiate with Republicans who have been long resistant to tougher firearms restrictions.Frankly, we tried a number of different things that havent worked very well, said Cornyn, the No.2 GOP senator who also represents Texas, the home state of the massacre.The status quo is really lousy.So I think were just going to have to go back to the drawing board and try to figure out what we can do.Republicans who control Capitol Hill have long opposed new gun control measures despite the onslaught of mass shootings, arguing the federal government should enforce laws already in place rather than imposing new ones.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.But two of the most recent mass shootings Sundays tragedy in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and last months at a music festival in Las Vegas have prompted the GOP-controlled Congress to take a renewed look at potential gun-related revisions to current laws, however modest.One avenue is potentially restricting bump stocks, a device that increases the rate of fire on a semi-automatic gun so it mimics a fully automatic weapon.Now, Republicans are exploring ways to tighten up potential loopholes in laws governing the federal database used for background checks on gun buyers.South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Senate Republican, said Tuesday that the Air Forces failure to send Kelleys domestic assault convictions are a pretty serious oversight and said lawmakers should give more direction to military officials on how to properly report those offenses.Ive talked with some of my colleagues about the idea that if it does take something, some direction from us to integrate those databases so that that information gets captured on the NICS system, that we need to do that, Thune said in an interview.A 2007 law requires federal agencies to make records available to NICS that show whether someone would be barred from owning or buying a gun.But states arent required to do so, unless their respective laws mandate it or it is a condition of receiving federal funding.Cornyn said he is looking into a potential carrots and sticks approach to coax states to better report that information to the federal database, such as the promise of additional grants.The Texas Republican released his own bill Tuesday meant to help federal agencies follow through on requirements to send information about criminal convictions to NICS, but is also talking with Heinrich and Democratic Sens.Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Chris Murphy of Connecticut about legislation that would similarly incentivize states.The NICS system is broken.Its been broken for a long time, Murphy said in an interview.We know that there are states that do not upload lists of people with serious mental health issues.We now know that the military has serious issues in uploading records related to court martials.The background checks database, as well as bump stocks, will be examined at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Nov. 14, the panel announced Tuesday.And several senators have also demanded information from the Pentagon on how the lapse could have occurred.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) has promised rigorous oversight over the militarys probe into the reporting failures, and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who leads a subcommittee within Armed Services, has also queried defense leaders on how widespread this issue may be.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a similar letter Tuesday to Defense Secretary James Mattis.Some lawmakers also raised the idea of boosting funding for NICS.The database is allotted about $73 million annually for federal grants to entice states to participate in reporting, and a separate $98.1 million to pay for FBI employees that manage the system, a Democratic aide said.Ann Stefanik, a spokeswoman for the Air Force, said the military is required to enter domestic violence offenses into the federal database.But Flake and Heinrich noted that just one domestic assault conviction had been recorded in the NICS system by the military since 2007 which the senators say indicates an issue with the system that allows the reporting of domestic violence offenses to fall through the cracks.Theres a problem deeper than just the law not being followed, Flake said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.Its more of a problem with labeling, how these charges or convictions are labeled, and how theyre recorded.The Uniform Code of Military Justice doesnt explicitly include a charge for domestic assault, senators said, which means such convictions in military courts may have gone unreported to NICS.This seems to be one of those cases where people on very different sides of what typically is a very divisive debate about guns agree that this is exactly the kind of individual who should have never had a firearm in the first place, Heinrich said in a separate interview.Democrats who have repeatedly pushed for tougher gun restrictions indicated they werent satisfied by the latest efforts proposed by Republicans on gun violence.We need to have a real background check law, one that works.Everyone except the Republicans in the Congress and the gun lobby agree.We dont want guns to get in the hands of the wrong people, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said.So now were going to fill one little gap here and not a lot of others?Thats not the way to solve this.But, Durbin added, Ill take what I can get.Elana Schor and Jacqueline Klimas contributed to this report.
House to brief lawmakers on shared employees amid ongoing IT probe:::::The briefings will focus on lawmakers use of shared employees to provide information technology services to member offices."| Detroit News via AP House to brief lawmakers on shared employees amid ongoing IT probe The House next week will hold members-only listening sessions on the use of shared employees, with the briefings coming months after several Democratic staffers were fired and remain under investigation over allegations of misusing the House computer system.The briefings, which are scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, will focus on lawmakers use of shared employees to provide information technology services to member offices, according to a notice obtained by POLITICO.Story Continued Below Democratic aides with knowledge of the briefings say they think Republicans on the House Administration Committee are planning to hold a hearing on the issue in the future, although nothing has been formally scheduled.A committee spokeswoman, Erin McCracken, said in a statement: The Committee on House Administration has been conducting an internal review on shared employees, specifically in the IT field.As a part of that process, the committee is hosting two identical bipartisan member-only listening sessions the week of November 13.""Members will be able to ask questions, as well as make recommendations on improving the supervision of these specific staff roles, she added.McCracken did not respond to a question about the potential for a future hearing.Imran Awan, a longtime House aide until earlier this year, has been at the center of a Capitol Hill criminal investigation involving procurement theft.Several of his relatives who worked as IT staffers for multiple Democratic members, including his wife, Hina Alvi, have also been named in the probe.Awan and his relatives were shared employees, meaning they worked part-time for several Democrats at once.There are a total of around 60 shared employees in the House, according to Democratic estimates, including IT staffers and financial administrators.Awan and Alvi were indicted this summer on multiple unrelated charges, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud.The U.S. Capitol Police investigation into alleged equipment theft and misuse of the House computer network is ongoing.Morning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.While most Democrats fired the staffers after the procurement investigation became public in February, Awan was still working for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) until he was indicted in July.Awan started working for Democrats in 2004, Alvi joined in 2007, and their other relatives followed after.The five former House staffers are accused of stealing equipment from members offices without their knowledge and committing potentially illegal violations on the House IT network.Several hardline conservatives and right-wing bloggers have seized on conspiracy theories related to the investigation, claiming that Awan had access to Wasserman Schultzs emails while she was chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee and that he, not Russia, was behind the leak of thousands of DNC emails during the election.The intelligence community, including the CIA and FBI, has said conclusively that Russia was behind the hacks as part of its widespread attempt to influence the 2016 election.The House Administration Committee is reviewing policies related to shared employees but has not yet made any, according to a senior Democratic aide.
Senators pitch bipartisan reform of Hill sexual harassment system:::::Sen. Chuck Grassley crafted the 1995 law that first set workplace conduct standards for Capitol Hill | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Senators pitch bipartisan reform of Hill sexual harassment system Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday proposed new bipartisan legislation to immediately require sexual harassment training for senators as well as aides and update the training to better reflect the experiences of victims.The measure from Grassley, who crafted the 1995 law that first set workplace conduct standards for Capitol Hill, comes as female lawmakers and aides both current and former come forward to share stories of sexual harassment they experienced on the job.Story Continued Below The bipartisan Senate proposal released Tuesday would require lawmakers and aides to undergo training within 60 days after the Senate Rules Committee issues instructions.Among Grassley's cosponsors are the Rules panel's top Democrat, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who is writing her own legislation strengthening the Hill's harassment-policing system."I believe each of you works hard to ensure that your offices are professional, free of harassment, and places where merits rewarded," Grassley told colleagues in remarks prepared for his measure's introduction."But I think we have to acknowledge that in our society, despite our best efforts and intentions, sexual harassment remains a serious problem.And we must work together to make sure that the Senate remains free from harassment."Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Sens.Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) are also cosponsors of the proposal, which calls for a review of and update to the current sexual harassment training programs.Changes should touch on "practical examples aimed at instructing supervisors" about how to prevent workplace misconduct, "a discussion of the consequences for perpetrators," and a reminder of the legal penalties for retaliation against victims who allege harassment on the job, according to an advance copy of the legislation obtained by POLITICO.The bill states that those updates to the Senate's training program, administered by the Office of Compliance and Office of the Chief Counsel for Employment, should include input from "entities having significant expertise in identifying, preventing, and responding to sexual harassment" as well as victims of harassment and victims' advocates."Every office should receive the same training so the Senate maintains a culture in which harassment is not tolerated," Grassley said in his prepared remarks."This is a common interest we all share.The voters who sent us here expect the best."The Senate bill also would institute a confidential survey to gauge the extent of lawmakers' and employees' experience with harassment in the workplace.Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), the author of a House plan to require harassment training, suspended her top aide Tuesday after POLITICO reported on complaints raised about him by fellow employees in her office.As such legislation draws further interest on both sides of the aisle, more than 400 former congressional aides in both parties on Tuesday have already added their names to an open letter that asks GOP and Democratic leadership for a broader reform of the current system for handling harassment claims on the Hill.Current rules require any congressional employee alleging harassment to undergo counseling and mediation before filing a complaint, a process that can stretch out for three months."We believe that Congresss policies for preventing sexual harassment and adjudicating complaints of harassment are inadequate and need reform," the former aides wrote.The letter's organizers are Travis Moore, a former legislative director for retired Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) who founded the nonprofit TechCongress, and Kristin Nicholson, a former chief of staff to Rep. James Langevin (D-R.I.).Moore said in an interview that the effort was partly inspired by the "very brave" video released last month by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a longtime proponent of mandatory sexual harassment training and a stronger system for handling complaints, in which Speier relayed her own story of being forcibly kissed while serving as a congressional aide."Former staff can speak out on this in a way that current staff really can't" given the risk that calls for reform could unfairly reflect on their current employers, Moore said recalling that while he worked on the Hill, female friends would often share "rumblings about members of Congress in elevators saying inappropriate things."

LoBiondo to retire from Congress:::::Rep. Frank LoBiondo raised $117,000 in the last fundraising quarter, among the lowest totals reported by House Republican incumbents.| Mel Evans/AP Photo LoBiondo to retire from Congress New Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, will not run for reelection in 2018, he announced Tuesday.LoBiondo cited committee term-limits for his departure, but the 12-term incumbent also took parting shots at partisan gridlock in Congress.Story Continued Below "There is no longer middle ground to honestly debate issues and put forward solutions," LoBiondo said in a statement."... Those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers.In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.LoBiondo said that his decision isn't "electoral" and that he was "very confident voters would again reelect me" in 2018 had he decided to run for reelection.The decision opens a battleground district in southern New Jersey that LoBiondo has held easily since 1994.New Jersey's 2nd District backed President Donald Trump with 50.6 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 46 percent in 2016.But former President Barack Obama also won the seat twice with between 53 and 54 percent of the vote.Harry Hurley, a New Jersey talk radio host, first reported the news of LoBiondo's retirement.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.LoBiondo raised $117,000 in the last fundraising quarter, among the lowest totals reported by House Republican incumbents, sparking speculation that he would retire instead of running for reelection.Though the district has 147,000 registered Democrats to 132,000 registered Republicans, LoBiondo has managed to easily and consistently win reelection thanks in part to strong labor ties.National Democrats have actively recruited state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, a conservative-leaning Democrat, in years past, but hes declined to run.Democrat Tanzie Youngblood, a retired teacher, already launched her bid to challenge LoBiondo in July.Democrats also floated retired judge Ray Batten as a potential candidate for the district.Republican operatives in the state floated two potential GOP candidates to replace LoBiondo: State Assemblyman Chris Brown, whos on the ballot for a state Senate seat on Tuesday, and former Atlantic County Sheriff Frank Balles.LoBiondo's retirement adds another major opportunity for Democrats to pick up a House seat in New Jersey.Already, two normally well-entrenched New Jersey GOP incumbents in the northern half of the state, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance, have attracted several credible Democratic challengers who are raising substantial amounts of campaign cash.LoBiondo, a member of the moderate Tuesday Group caucus, is the latest in a string of what Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) called "governing-wing" Republicans who have opted against running for reelection in 2018.Dent, Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Washington Rep. Dave Reichert and Michigan Rep. Dave Trott have all announced their plans for retirement.Matt Friedman, Jake Sherman and Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.
House Democrats prepare to pepper Sessions with questions about Papadopoulos:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions a top policy adviser to the Trump campaign last year has flummoxed lawmakers with his accounts of his own contacts with Russian officials during the campaign.| Jason Connolly/Getty Images House Democrats prepare to pepper Sessions with questions about Papadopoulos Attorney General Jeff Sessions will appear before the House Judiciary Committee next week, and Democrats said Tuesday theyre prepared to pepper him with questions about a campaign adviser who attempted to broker a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Sessions a top policy adviser to the Trump campaign last year has flummoxed lawmakers with his accounts of his own contacts with Russian officials during the campaign.Now he faces new scrutiny about how much he knew about the adviser, George Papadopoulos, who has since pleaded guilty for lying to investigators about his own attempts to parlay contacts with the Russian government into an advantage for the Trump campaign.Story Continued Below Papadopoulos told authorities that he urged Trump in a meeting that included Sessions to travel to Russia for a meeting with Putin.Sessions reportedly shot down the proposal, but he later told congressional investigators he had no awareness of any Trump campaign contacts with Russian officials.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.These facts appear to contradict your sworn testimony on several occasions, Democrats on the House judiciary panel, led by Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, wrote in a letter to Sessions dated Tuesday.Sessions will appear before the judiciary panel on Nov. 14.He will also speak that day to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session, Reuters reported.Democrats have been eager to grill Sessions for months and have griped openly that their committees chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), has largely stayed on the sidelines of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Goodlatte has pointed to the multiple investigations already underway, including special counsel Robert Muellers criminal probe, as a reason to stay out of the way.Sessions is also bound to face questions about the recent testimony of another campaign adviser, Carter Page, who told the intelligence panel last week that he informed Sessions in July 2016 about his own planned trip to Moscow, one that has drawn scrutiny from FBI investigators.Sessions appeared twice before Senate committees to detail his own contacts with Russian government officials during the campaign.But his last appearance came before Papadopoulos guilty plea was unsealed last month by Mueller, whos leading a wide-ranging criminal inquiry into Russias attempt to meddle in the 2016 presidential election and whether any Trump campaign associates aided the scheme.Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearing early this year that he was not aware of any Trump campaign affiliates communicating with the Russian government, though it was later revealed that he spoke during the campaign with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.Then, at a judiciary hearing last month, Sessions testified that he had no improper involvement with Russian officials and that he was not aware of anyone who had communications with the Russians.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.House Democrats said they also intend to ask for details about former national security adviser Michael Flynns contacts with Russian officials, details about the scope of Sessions recusal from matters related to the Trump campaign, calls for Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushners security clearance to be suspended, and the Justice Departments decision to settle a case that involved a Kremlin-associated lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. last year in Trump Tower.On the other side of the Capitol, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have urged Republicans to haul Sessions back for further questions about his involvement in Trump campaign aides Russia trips.During the attorney generals appearance last month before the committee, Sessions repeatedly declined to answer questions about his private conversations with Trump concerning the firing of FBI Director James Comey.The Judiciary Committees chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), has yet to make a formal request for Sessions to return, and ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said Tuesday that she had "no news" on whether the attorney general would return to the upper chamber following his testimony in the House.One senior judiciary panel Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said Sunday on Fox News that Sessions should come back to the Senate to "tell us everything you know about Russia."But Graham told reporters on Tuesday that he would leave it to Grassley to decide on future testimony from Sessions, with whom he is meeting this week to discuss trying terrorism suspects as enemy combatants."I don't think Jeff colluded with the Russians, but we just need to find out what was the involvement with the Russians?"Graham told reporters.The Senate intelligence committee's top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, said he and panel chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) would be discussing whether to engage with Sessions again to "clarify what happened or didn't happen with these meetings with Mr.Papadopoulos."Sessions testified before Burr and Warner's committee in June that he didn't know whether Page had meetings with Russian officials during the campaign despite Page's testimony last week that he had told Sessions about his Moscow sojourn.
Congresswoman tolerated abusive behavior by top aide, female ex-staffers say:::::A lawmaker pushing for a more aggressive response to sexual harassment on Capitol Hill has kept her chief of staff on payroll despite receiving multiple complaints by women in her office about his behavior toward them, according to several former aides.Rep. Brenda Lawrence, a former harassment complaint investigator for the federal government, introduced legislation recently to require congressional staffers to take an online course on sexual harassment.You have to set a tone.You have to establish this benchmark of zero tolerance, the Michigan Democrat said on ABCs This Week late last month.Story Continued Below But three former aides to Lawrence, all female, told POLITICO they personally relayed concerns to the congresswoman about how the chief of staff, Dwayne Duron Marshall, treated women.Each believed they made it clear to Lawrence that women in the office did not feel comfortable around Marshall or that he treated women differently than men.Two said they told her Marshall was the reason they were leaving her office.And one said she specifically cited inappropriate comments and physical contact.Lawrence denied in an interview that any current or former employee complained specifically about sexual harassment.She did, however, acknowledge what she called management-style issues in her office and said she responded with individual personnel actions though she would not say against whom or why.Whatever issues were brought to her attention, Lawrence was adamant that they did not constitute sexual harassment.She said she never heard about or witnessed unwanted touching or sexist comments by her top aide.I want to be very clear, very firm, that I had no knowledge of any allegations of sexual harassment in my office, and when I say none, I mean none, she said in a phone interview.I have had individual conversations with some of my employees when they had exit interviews.Ive had one-on-ones, and we have discussed things in the office that they felt we could do better.I have implemented training and other positive forms of correction....But I have not, and I want to be very clear, have not ever, had an employee former or present talk to me about sexual harassment in my office.After publication of this story Tuesday, Lawrence placed Marshall on leave pending an investigation.In an updated statement, she said she had requested the assistance of House and outside independent management resources

in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.In a statement also issued after this story posted, Marshall denied ever sexually harassing anyone.He said he would continue working for Lawrence as she tries to build support for her anti-sexual harassment legislation."In my 28 years of public service, I have never had any kind of complaint filed against me nor have I ever sexually harassed anyone!"he said in the statement, sent to POLITICO after this story posted."In fact, for the last 17 years of my career, I have directly represented women in the workplace.Despite these slanderous accusations, I will continue to focus on working on behalf of the constituents in our district."The aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told POLITICO they did not use the term sexual harassment but said their comments and concerns should have raised alarms with Lawrence, especially given her background.Shes complicit because she knows, said one of the three ex-staffers who said she spoke with Lawrence about Marshall.She knows he makes comments.She knows he rubs the back and rubs the shoulders.Shed say, I know there are some problems, but he has his good points too, and [the good] outweighs the other stuff.Another of the three former aides who relayed concerns, upon hearing Lawrences denial, said: She's completely full of shit."Lawrence has asked the women to come forward to tell her more about their experiences.Had I known, I absolutely would have addressed it and made it stop, she said.I understand the individuals are anonymous.I encourage them to come talk to me, because I dont want that behavior in my office.The Lawrence office controversy comes amid heightened scrutiny of the lack of safeguards against harassment on Capitol Hill.Numerous former female lawmakers have spoken publicly about inappropriate comments made to them by male lawmakers.And congressional staffers have privately shared stories with POLITICO about what they feel has become a culture of silence in an institution dominated by men.The situation also shows that the problem appears to extend even to one of the most outspoken lawmakers on sexual harassment matters.In interviews, former aides to Lawrence described a work atmosphere of anxiety for female aides, particularly where looks were concerned.They said Marshall would regularly remark on womens appearances, telling younger female staffers about how beautiful they were and how it was a shame they were single.Another said he once complimented her on how her legs looked in a dress.When womens looks did not meet Marshall's approval, he would make snide remarks, said a fourth former female aide, who said that at one point she felt pressured to go to the bathroom to put on mascara or lipstick.The same employee, who never reported the matter to Lawrence, said Marshall would lecture women for wearing flat shoes instead of high heels.At least two former employees said they heard Marshall say he could not hire certain women because their looks were not up to par.He sometimes boasted that three of his female staffers made The Hills 50 Most Beautiful list, one former aide said.When Marshall was pleased with their appearance, he would compliment female staffers, several of the former aides said.One former employee said Marshall often told her she was beautiful and would speak to her about her personal life and relationships, as well as his own.Another former aide said she also witnessed Marshall asking a different female staffer about her dating life, telling the woman that she was too good for the man she was seeing and that she should meet with him to discuss the situation.Marshall followed that employee to her car one evening, according to a staffer shed later complain to.The situation made her so uncomfortable that the former aide, who quit after just a few months, began asking colleagues to walk her to her car.The former employees also complained of unwanted touching.One former employee said Marshall would come up behind her and massage her shoulders or grab her by the waist.Another said Marshall once touched her neck while she was sitting at her desk, complimenting her hair.Two former staffers also witnessed him grab a female colleague's midriff and tell her she was getting fat.Marshall, who received a master's in government from the University of California, Berkeley in 1987, according to his LinkedIn profile, has worked in Congress since June 2004.He started with Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-Mich.), working as her district director until early 2011.Four years later, after a stint at a political consulting firm, he returned to Capitol Hill to work for Lawrence.Lawrence previously investigated harassment claims for the federal government and once served as a human resources manager.She often cites that experience while touting her bill that would mandate sexual harassment training for congressional staffers.During her appearance on This Week," Lawrence praised the #MeToo movement of women speaking out about their experiences with sexual harassment.It is giving reassurance and comfort for women to speak out, she said.Because as long as we are silent, it continues.In her interview with POLITICO last weekend, Lawrence said no one ever told her they were uncomfortable with Marshall.Asked whether she considered touching, like rubbing a colleague's shoulders, to be harassment, she said she did but had never heard about it happening in her office.Asked whether remarks on a person's appearance constituted sexual harassment, she said it was subjective and it depended on the circumstances.She noted that she has a strict dress code in her office.Pressed on whether women complained to her at all about Marshall, Lawrence demurred.You were clear that this article is about sexual harassment.I have never had a conversation with any employee about feeling sexually harassed in my office," she said."And Im not going to go off into another area if youre calling me about something else.The issue came to the fore in 2016, when several women in Lawrences office suddenly left some after less than six months.One aide who quit that year said she told the congresswoman that Marshall was one reason for her departure.Marshall once startled the employee when he came up behind her and put his hand on the small of her back, just above her buttocks, causing her to jump, she said.After she gave notice, Marshall grew angry and tried to make her stay, she said, telling her the job she thinks she had taken was not secure.He raised his voice and talked about how in Washington, D.C., you have to be careful, one staffer familiar with the incident recounted.The employee took Marshalls words as a threat and said she took the matter to Lawrence.While the aide had expected to give a longer notice, she packed her things that day and left, later explaining to the congresswoman that she was too afraid and upset to work in her office anymore.The employee sought counseling at a Capitol Hill office to help staffers under stress.A few months later, another employee leaving the office said she told Lawrence that Marshall was the reason.Marshall had initially called the staffer pretty when they interacted at work but had become increasingly mean, she said.The aide said she told Lawrence she felt Marshall treated women differently than men, though she did not mention his comments on her looks.According to this staffer, Lawrence responded with sympathy, asking whether there was anything she could do.[Lawrence] said she was really sad to hear that, because she said that her goal in the office is to create an environment where women feel comfortable and where women can be successful, and she felt like she was failing doing that if I was coming to her for that reason, the former aide said.By that time, the stream of women leaving had caused a stir in the office.Lawrence asked other employees whether they felt the same way about Marshall.At least one told her yes, and that many women in the office did, too.She had said to me, Im really for women; I really want to support womens issues, one of the ex-staffers said.And so we would say, Hey, well, Durons a problem.'"According to the employee, Lawrence responded that Marshall has his good points and his bad points and said, Im going to talk to him.It was amazing because it was someone you believed in," added the ex-aide, who was incensed by Lawrences appearance on This Week."She knew [about Marshall's behavior], but she just wouldnt do anything about it."

Howard Dean: Kushner will likely be indicted:::::Former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Howard Dean said he thinks there's a good chance President Trump's son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, will be indicted.I expect theres a good likelihood Jared Kushner will be indicted for money laundering, Dean said Sunday on MSNBC.And then were going to have to see how far the Russian involvement goes.This is serious business.These people are undermining our democracy.ADVERTISEMENT Dean said it appears special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether President Trump "engaged with a foreign power in order to get where he got.""That's a very serious matter for this country," Dean said.Dean also said he thinks Mueller is working his way up from the bottom.The former DNC chairman expects that eventually "either the Flynns are going to plead guilty or they're going to ... cooperate for some leniency.""And the next step is going to be the Trump family itself," he said.His comments come after an indictment was unsealed last week revealing that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had been charged on nine counts, including conspiracy against the United States, tax fraud and money laundering.It's the first indictment to come from Mueller's investigation.The 12-count indictment includes seven counts against Manaforts former business partner and protege Richard Gates, who was ousted from the pro-Trump group America First Policies in April.
Woman fired from her job after flipping off Trump's motorcade:::::A woman was fired from her job after a photo of her flipping off President Trump's motorcade went viral.The Huffington Post reported that the woman, Juli Briskman, was fired from her job at government contractor Akima LLC.The photo was taken by a White House photographer as the president was leaving his golf course in Sterling, Va. ADVERTISEMENT She told the Huffington Post that after the photo surfaced, her bosses told her she had violated the company's social media policy because she had used the photo as her profile picture.
Scattered NFL protests continue for ninth week:::::Five NFL players protested during the national anthem during the early slate of this weeks games, a decrease from last week, The Associated Press reported.Two Philadelphia Eagles raised their fists during the anthem while a teammate put his hand on one of the players' shoulders.One member of the New York Giants took a knee during the anthem, and one Tennessee Titans player stayed off the field during the anthem.ADVERTISEMENT About a dozen members of the New Orleans Saints took a knee before the anthem, but stood once the song began.No Houston Texans players knelt this week.Last week, nearly the entire team took a knee in protest of owner Bob McNairs comments that we cant have the inmates running the prison," referring to the ongoing demonstrations.NFL players have protested social justice issues, such as police brutality, since the 2016 season, either kneeling or raising a fist during the national anthem.The issue was brought into the spotlight again in September, when President Trump suggested those taking a knee should be fired.Papa Johns, an official partner of the NFL, said last week the anthem protests have been hurting its pizza sales.
Early Comey draft accused Clinton of gross negligence on emails:::::An early draft of former FBI Director James Comeys statement closing out the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE email case accused the former secretary of State of having been grossly negligent in handling classified information, newly reported memos to Congress show.The tough language was changed to the much softer accusation that Clinton had been extremely careless in her handling of classified information when Comey announced in July 2016 there would be no charges against her.The change is significant, since federal law states that gross negligence in handling the nations intelligence can be punished criminally with prison time or fines.ADVERTISEMENT The draft, written weeks before the announcement of no charges, was described by multiple sources who saw the document both before and after it was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee this past weekend.There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton, and others, used the email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified information, reads the statement, one of Comeys earliest drafts from May 2, 2016.The sources who had seen the early draft, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the draft statement was subsequently changed in red-line edits on or around June 10 to conclude that the handling of 110 emails containing classified information that were transmitted by Clinton and her aides over her insecure personal email server was extremely careless.The documents turned over to Congress do not indicate who recommended the key wording changes, the sources said.Memos show that at least three top FBI officials were involved in helping Comey fashion and edit the statement, including Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, General Counsel James Baker and chief of staff Jim Rybicki.The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday evening sent a letter to current FBI Director Christopher Wray demanding the FBI identify who made the changes and why.Apparently, as of May 2016, then-Director Comey and other FBI officials believed the facts fit that gross negligence standard until later edits were made, Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyTrump talks NAFTA withdrawal with GOP senators Fractures emerging on Senate panel's Russia probe The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (R-Iowa) wrote to Wray in the letter demanding more information.While Comey told Congress last year that he would never have prosecuted Clinton without proof she intended to violate a law, the editing of his statement suggests there might have been dissent within the FBI about that decision.Sources who had seen the draft said they are certain to renew interest among congressional Republicans into Comeys decisionmaking.The red-line history clearly shows the original statement was designed to allege Clinton committed gross negligence and then someone changed it to extreme carelessness, one source said.Clearly there was a difference of opinion on the term derived right from the statute.When Comey announced the decision to not bring charges against Clinton in July 2016 shortly after Clinton had secured the Democratic nomination to run for president against Donald Trump Donald John TrumpIntel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it Overnight Tech: Twitter bans ads from Russian media | Dem says she was targeted by Russian bot | House Judiciary to hold hearing on net neutrality Democrats dig for Russian connection and uncover environmentalists MORE he said agents decided not to pursue criminal charges under the statute because they could not prove she intended to violate laws like the Espionage Act.But he harshly criticized Clinton for setting up a personal email server outside the State Departments security apparatus and then using it to transmit classified information.Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information, Comey said at the time.There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clintons position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation, he said.Comeys decision to not to seek criminal charges has been controversial since it was announced, with politicians and legal scholars alike debating whether intent was necessary to pursue criminal charges.Section 793 of federal law states, Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.Some legal scholars have argued Comeys analysis of the law was correct, citing a 1941 Supreme Court ruling saying the gross negligence statute was not constitutionally vague as long as prosecutors showed there was intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States.But other scholars noted that prosecutions have been brought since the 1941 case in the military courts where intent wasnt required.Comey argued in testimony before Congress that while he was aware of the gross negligence statute, he did not believe any federal prosecutor would pursue that standard.I know the Department of Justice, I know no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case.I know a lot of my former friends are out there saying they would.I wonder where they were in the last 40 years, because Id like to see the cases they brought on gross negligence.Nobody would, nobody did, he said.But Comey also conceded in public statements that the FBI also found some evidence of criminality during the email probe.Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case, he explained.
ObamaCare signups surge in early days to set new record:::::A record number of people signed up for ObamaCare in the first few days of open enrollment this year compared to the same period in previous years, several sources close to the process told The Hill.The surge in sign-ups, which was confirmed by an administration official, comes despite fears from Democrats that enrollment would fall off due to the Trump administration's cutbacks in outreach and advertising.ADVERTISEMENT On the first day of enrollment alone, Nov. 1, one source close to the processtold The Hill that more than 200,000 people selected a plan for 2018, compared with about 100,000 last year.More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov that day, compared to about 750,000 last year, the source said.It is still early in the process and it is unclear how the final sign-up numbers will come out.Sign-ups early in the enrollment season are often people renewing their coverage, not new enrollees.Standard & Poors forecasted last week that enrollment could drop by as much as 1.6 million people below last years level of 12.2 million signups, in part due to uncertainty from the administration's actions.The enrollment period is also about half as long this year, ending Dec. 15.But the spike in sign-ups is some positive news for supporters of the health-care law who have been worrying about its fate under Republican control of Washington.The first few days of Open Enrollment for the Federal Health Insurance Exchange went smoothly," said a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the health-care law."The website performed optimally and consumers easily accessed enrollment tools to compare plans and prices."Acting Health and Human Services Secretary Eric Hargan said in a speech last week that the administration wants the sign-up period to be "as consumer friendly as possible."The administration cut the outreach budget by 90 percent and cut back on grants to outside groups, called navigators, that help people enroll.
At least 26 killed in Texas church shooting:::::Dozens of people were killed when a man opened fire in a church on Sunday in Sutherland Springs, Texas.Texas Gov.Greg Abbott (R) confirmed in a press conference on Sunday that at least 26 people have been killed in what he described as the state's largest mass shooting to date.ADVERTISEMENT The gunman was also killed, though authorities said it was not clear if the suspect had killed himself or had been shot by law enforcement.Multiple news outlets, including The Associated Press, have identified the shooter as Devin Kelley, though officials at the press conference declined to give the suspect's name.According to one law enforcement official at the briefing, the suspect was first seen at a gas station across the street from the First Baptist Church, about 40 miles outside San Antonio, at around 11:20 a.m.The suspect then drove over to the church, exited his vehicle and began shooting.He then entered the church, where he continued firing his weapon.At some point, according to the official, a local resident grabbed his own rifle and engaged the shooter.The suspect then got into his vehicle and drove off.He was later found dead in his car, though it wasn't clear if he had shot himself or if police had shot him.The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are working with local law enforcement at the scene.Im not sure well know immediately why all of this happened or had to happen, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told CNN on Sunday.It would not shock me if it takes more than a day or two, it may take weeks to unravel why this person decided to do this horrific thing.Paxton noted that Sundays shooting took place eight years to the day after 13 people were killed at Fort Hood.Sutherland Springs is a rural town of less than 1,000 people.One woman, who works at a gas station across the street from the church, told ABC News she heard rapid gunfire that lasted about 15 seconds.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told pool reporters that President Trump has been briefed on the shooting."The President has been briefed several times and is continuing to receive regular updates on the tragic shooting in TX," Sanders said."The President spoke with Gov.Abbott earlier this morning.We will keep you posted as we can share more details.Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends and families affected.May God comfort them all in this time of tragedy."Trump, who's currently in Asia for a 12-day, five-nation tour, tweeted not long after reports of the shooting."May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene.I am monitoring the situation from Japan," Trump wrote.May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene.I am monitoring the situation from Japan.Donald J.

CNN: Fox cancels Trump impeachment ads:::::Fox News has canceled ads purchased by Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer that call for President Trumps impeachment, CNNs Brian Stelter confirmed Monday.Due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers, we could not in good conscience take their money, Fox News told Stelter.ADVERTISEMENT Friday Steyer saidin a statement that Fox News informed him on Oct. 31 that it was refusing to air the ad entitled Join Us.Steyer said the decision shows no respect for democracy.Steyer launched his $10 million Need to Impeach ad campaign in late October, drawing the ire of Trump, who called Steyer wacky & totally unhinged.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Sunday downplayed the idea that Democrats will seek to impeach Trump if they take back the House in next year's midterm elections.She suggested Democrats will allow the various investigations of Trump to play out in an interview with CNNs Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."I believe that whatever we do, we have responsibility first and foremost to unify the nation, she said.Second of all, you cant go down any path without the facts and the law.If thats there, perhaps it will come out in these investigations.
Conway: 'Rush' to politicize Texas shooting is 'disrespectful to the dead':::::White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday called out those "pointing fingers" after the Texas shooting over the weekend that left 26 people dead."The rush to judgment, particularly by people who just see politics and Trump derangement in every single thing they do, it doesn't help the victims," Conway said during an interview on "Fox & Friends.""And it's disrespectful to the dead."Conway's comments come after a man opened fire at a church in Texas, killing more than two dozen people ranging in age from 77 years to 18 months.ADVERTISEMENT "There is evil among us," Conway said, before again blasting those who see the tragedy as political.It's so beyond any type of reasonable response that anyone should have why people see politics immediately," she said.She went after people for "taking to Twitter in the comfort of their very luxurious lives" and "pointing fingers."President Trump said Monday the mass shooting that left 26 dead was not a "guns situation."Instead, he said it was a problem with the shooter's "mental health."He also said it's a "little bit soon" to discuss the issue of guns and suggested that more people would have been killed if another armed person had not opened fire on the shooter.
Trump tells Japan to build cars in US instead of shipping them over:::::President Trump called on Japan to build more cars in the U.S. during his stop in the country as part of his first official tour of Asia as president."Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over, Trump said at an event with Japanese business executives, according to a pool report.That's not rude?he added.ADVERTISEMENT Three out of every four Japanese brand cars sold in North America were manufactured on the continent, according to Columbus Business First And Mazda and Toyota announced in August that they were investing $1.6 billion to start a new manufacturing plant in the U.S. that will create about 4,000 new jobs.Trump added that Japan has been winning when it comes to trade deals with the U.S.I have to say that for the last many decades, Japan has been winning.And you do know that, Trump said.Trump has long called for the U.S. to have move favorable trade relations with other countries, including Japan.He told reporters one day earlier that he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be having major discussions on trade during the trip.Trump also bragged about the quality of U.S. military equipment during the event.We make the greatest military equipment in the world.Theres nothing close.[Abe] is ordering a lot of military equipment, as he should be, given whats happening with one of your neighbors, Trump said, referring to North Korea, during a visit to the U.S. ambassadors residence.
President Trump Cancels Surprise Visit to Korean DMZ Due to Bad Weather:::::President Donald Trump has scrapped a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone due to poor weather.Marine One flew most of the way from Seoul to the DMZ before turning back due to poor weather conditions.Back at the U.S. Armys Yongsan Garrison, Trump prepared for his speech to South Koreas National Assembly while awaiting a potential clearing in the weather.Weather reports from near the DMZ showed misting conditions and visibility below one mile.Every American president since Ronald Reagan has made a trip to the DMZ except for George H.W.Bush, who made the trek when he served as vice president.Before Trumps trip, a White House official had said the DMZ visits have become a little bit of a clich.
Virginia and New Jersey Prepare for Governor Election:::::(RICHMOND, Va.) Virginia voters turned out in rainy weather Tuesday to pick a new governor after months of divisive campaigning led to an ugly slugfest overshadowed by racial overtones and attack ads.New Jersey, a reliably Democratic state, was the only other state holding a gubernatorial election.The contests were seen as an early referendum on Donald Trumps first year in office.Both parties are seeking momentum ahead of next years midterm elections.In Virginia the only Southern state Trump lost last year Republican Ed Gillespie is in a tight race with Democratic Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam.In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy faces Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno, who was at the side of Gov.Chris Christie for the past eight years.While local politics and issues weighed heavy on voters minds, some also were driven by lingering resentment from Hillary Clintons loss or still excited by Trumps win.If I could get rid of Trump I would be even happier.Ive never seen our state so miserable and Ive never seen our country so miserable, said John Holpp, 88, who said he voted for Murphy because hes hoping to get rid of Christie, who is term-limited.Guadagno, who wants to lower property taxes and end so-called sanctuary cities, has tried to distance herself from Trump and Christie, but its been challenging since she served as his top deputy.In rural Virginia, Edward McKellar, 36, said the improving economy drove him to vote a straight Republican ticket.I like the direction our country is going right now, said McKellar, an operations manager for an industrial company.The economy is good.Its as strong as its ever been.The work is out there.Savings and investments are good.Gillespie and Northam differ on taxes, guns, abortion and other issues.Gillespie supports a cut in the states income tax rate, less gun control and more restrictions on abortions.Northam said he wants a tax overhaul that targets low-income Virginians, supports greater gun restrictions and abortion rights.Polling places reported higher turnout than the previous gubernatorial contest, and early voter numbers were up as well.The 180,000 absentee ballots returned as of Sunday were 60,000 more than all absentee votes cast in the 2013 gubernatorial election.Generally speaking, Democrats tend to do better in Virginia with a greater turnout.Nationally, Democrats havent won any special elections for Congress this year and the next Virginia governor will have a major say in the states next round of redistricting, when Congressional lines are drawn.Republicans are looking for a boost as their party is beset by intraparty turmoil between Trump and key Republicans in Congress.Trump recorded calls to help boost Gillespie in the final stretch.In one call, Trump said Gillespie shared his views on immigration and crime and would help Make America Great Again.Trump also said Northam would be a total disaster for Virginia.Gillespie has largely kept the president at a distance throughout the contest and did not campaign with Trump.Political observers say the Virginia contest has been more racially charged than in recent memory.Outside groups on both sides have spent millions to influence the outcome and called on high-profile surrogates, including former President Barack Obama and Vice President Mike Pence.Emogene and Jimmy Babb, both 74, voted straight Republican at a polling station in Windsor, Virginia.There wasnt any one particular issue that drove them to the polls but said they shared Gillespies positions on gun rights and not removing Confederate statues.Statues should stay where they are, said Emogene Babb, a retired office service specialist at a local health department.They are part of our history.We need to accept life as it was.Our forefathers fought for them.At Jahnke Road Baptist Church in suburban Richmond, Virginia, Angelica Bega, 39, said she was uncertain whom she would vote for Tuesday until she was handed a ballot.She ultimately voted for Northam.Im an issues-driven voter and it was very frustrating to see the attack ads and the emotional appeals that dominated the campaign, she said.One tipping point was immigration.I dont think immigration is a big deal for many Virginians, but I think that Gillespie is trying to make it an issue.Gillespie is a former Republican National Committee and Washington lobbyist who has been criticized by Democrats and some conservatives as running a race-baiting campaign.Northam, an Army veteran and pediatric neurologist, has lumped Gillespie in with the white supremacists who rallied in Charlottesville this summer in support of Confederate monuments.Polls close in Virginia at 7 p.m. and in New Jersey at 8 p.m.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Sells Shipping Investment:::::Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has divested his interest in Diamond S Shipping Group Inc., one of the worlds largest owners and operators of medium-range tanker vessels and the subject of a Center for Public Integrity investigation.Ross has fully divested of his interest in Diamond S. Shipping, Commerce Department spokesman James Rockas said today, in response to questions from the Center for Public Integrity.Ross is currently in Beijing, traveling with President Donald Trump.Critics have raised questions about whether overseas shipping investments are appropriate for Ross, who is among the Trump administrations most influential trade policy players.Most of Diamond S Shippings fleet sails under Chinese flags, and the company has ties to a major Chinese investment fund.Its ships have also visited ports in Russian and Iran two nations that have for years found themselves in conflict with U.S. interests, and particularly so during Donald Trumps nascent presidency.Ross, who this week has also come under scrutiny for a separate shipping investment with ties to Russia, was not immediately available for comment.Rockas could not immediately say exactly when Ross shed his stake in Diamond S Shipping.Diamond S Shipping did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ross had been non-executive chairman of Diamond S Shippings board, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and agreed to step down from his position with the company when he took the Commerce Department job, according to his public ethics agreement.But during his confirmation hearing for the commerce secretary position, Ross confirmed he had no plans to divest his stake in Diamond S Shipping, and maintained that his investment didnt pose a conflict.The research weve done suggests that there has never been a shipping case come before the Department of Commerce, he said according to a hearing transcript, adding, I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic wheres there the slightest scintilla of doubt.A Center for Public Integrity examination of Diamond S Shippings operations, however, found the companys operations raised complex conflict-of-interest concerns.Diamond S Shippings vessels call at ports all over the world.One of its main customers, commodities giant Glencore PLC, last year acquired a stake in Russian national oil company Rosneft, a deal that drew scrutiny from American and European regulators.The Glencore-Rosneft deal marked the biggest foreign investment in Russia since the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions in 2014 because of the countrys military occupation of Ukraines Crimea region.Rosneft is under U.S. sanctions.Glencore said the deal complied with the sanctions.Asked if the deal violated the spirit of the sanctions, Amos Hochstein, then U.S. special envoy for international energy affairs, said, Clearly this is not what we were hoping for when we implemented sanctions.Diamond S Shipping said it has and may continue to call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to its 2014 filing with the SEC.Diamond S Shipping is based in Greenwich, Connecticut, but is incorporated offshore in the Marshall Islands.Rosss use of offshore holding companies and his stake in another shipping company, Navigator Holdings, also drew attention this week.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the New York Times reported as part of the Paradise Papers investigation that Navigators biggest customer was a Russian company with ties to both a Russian oligarch under U.S. sanctions and Russian President Vladimir Putins son-in-law.In an interview with Bloomberg, Ross said he would probably sell his Navigator stake.Ive been actually selling it anyway, but that isnt because of this, he said.Meanwhile, Ross has also this week faced questions from Forbes about the true value of his assets, and whether he properly reported them in federal financial disclosures.This story originally appeared on the Center for Public Integrity.
Trump 2016 Election: Looking Back at Most Important Moments:::::Donald Trump shocked the world and even some of his own campaign staffers one year ago when he defeated Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States.The 12 months since then have been tumultuous, as Trump has shaken up Washington politics by breaking long-held norms, dramatically reversing Obama-era policies and making rookie political mistakes that turn into cable news drama.As he approached the end of his first year in office, Trumps approval ratings were abysmal one poll had him at 37%, lower than any presidents approval rating at the same time in over seven decades.His campaign also faces a major investigation from special counsel Robert Mueller, with one former adviser pleading guilty to lying to investigators and his former campaign manager and another former official facing indictments on other charges.(They have pleaded not guilty.)But a lot can happen in four years; to be sure, other presidents have bounced back from scandals and mistakes to win re-election.Trump points to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, the rollback of various Obama regulations, the U.S. exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate deal and a looming tax reform proposal as wins.TIME has taken a look at the news of the last year since Trump was elected, and determined these moments the most consequential since he became Americas 45th president.Michael Flynns meeting with Sergey Kislyak One of most important meetings of Trumps presidential transition period didnt come to light until months later.In February 2017, the Washington Post reported that Michael Flynn, whom Trump had nominated just days after his election to serve as his National Security Advisor, had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in Dec. 2016 and discussed sanctions against the country, despite statements to the contrary from Vice President-elect Mike Pence.The report had spiraling implications, not just for Flynn, who would resign from his position shortly afterwards, but for Trumps entire Administration, which now has multiple investigations into possible campaign collusion with Russia looming over it.James Comey being fired and the subsequent appointment of Robert Mueller as Special Counsel Trump unexpectedly announced on May 9 that he was firing then-FBI Director James Comey, citing recommendations from the top-ranking officials at the Department of Justice that disapproved of the way Comey had handled its investigation into Clintons emails.While Trump was technically within his jurisdiction to fire Comey, the public reaction was one of skepticism, not only because the President had praised Comey for the way he handled that very investigation, but because Comey had publicly acknowledged he was overseeing the FBIs investigation into possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia.Just days after Comey was fired, Trump admitted the Russia investigation was a key factor in his decision to terminate him from his top spot at the FBI during an interview with NBC News Lester Holt.That revelation heightened concerns that Comeys replacement would halt the Russia investigation and intensified calls for the appointment of a special counsel.Those calls were answered about a week later.On May 17, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced he was appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The announcement came one day after a New York Times report that said Trump had asked Comey to stop an investigation into his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Withdrawing from the Paris agreement After much anticipation, Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden on June 1 that he intended to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, arguing that the withdrawal would pave the way for more domestic job creation.(Trump did, however, leave open the possibility of renegotiations that would benefit the U.S.).I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, he said in his speech.The announcement meant that, once the withdrawal became official, the United States would be the only country aside from Nicaragua and Syria not to join the agreement.(Both countries have since said they would sign the global climate pact, leaving the U.S. as the only U.N. member country not to sign it.)The decision, which came in spite of pressure from global leaders and members of his own administration, was not only a major step in dismantling his predecessors legacy, but showcased the lengths to which Trump would go to appease his voter base.He had said throughout the campaign that he would leave the Paris agreement should he become president.Announcing a ban on transgender military members On July 26, Trump issued an unexpected announcement on Twitter.After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allowTransgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military, he wrote.Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelmingvictory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.Thank you.Trumps announcement immediately provoked an outcry from his critics and the LGBTQ community.But action was somewhat slow to occur.The Pentagon did not respond to Trumps tweets about this issue, but waited for official guidance from the White House to reverse the decision to allow transgender soldiers to serve in the military, which took another month.This guidance provided a six-month time frame to develop a plan for transgender soldiers currently serving, which Secretary of Defense James Mattis announced he would take advantage of while he convenes a panel to develop further assessments.But transgender members of the military also sued Trump in court, and a federal judge rejected the ban on Oct. 30, dealing another blow to the policys feasibility.The Senates failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act Both Trump and nearly every Congressional Republican up for reelection ran on the idea of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, former President Obamas signature health care overhaul.So it was no surprise that the House of Representatives immediately got to work on legislation that would accomplish this objective.What was more surprising was their inability to pass it.Although the House managed to narrowly pass a version of a health care reform bill in May, it needed to advance in the Senate if it was ever going to reach Trumps desk.It didnt.With 52 Republican lawmakers in the chamber, party leadership could only afford two defections.Maine Senator Susan Collins and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski were firmly in the opposition camp, and Arizona Senator John McCain officially killed any hope of the bills passage with a surprise no vote in the middle of the night on July 28.While the three defectors were hailed as heroes by Democrats and anyone else who opposed the bill (including a slew of celebrities), it also showcased the Trump Administrations limited power over Congress.McCain, who has a long history of feuding with President Trump that dates back to the President deriding him for his military captivity during the 2016 campaign, made his decision despite pleas from Vice President Mike Pence, who had come to Capitol Hill that night to ensure the legislation passed.And Murkowski maintained her opposition to the bill even after Trump criticized her on Twitter, and after Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reportedly threatened to withhold funding for Alaska.Cutting a deal on the debt ceiling with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi On Sept. 6, Trump agreed to a deal with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would raise the debt ceiling for three months while providing $15.3 billion in aid to the victims of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in August.Trump, Schumer and Pelosi reached the deal on Sept. 6, and Trump signed it into law after both chambers had approved it.The necessity of providing aid to the victims of Hurricane Harvey undoubtedly sped up the legislative process, and Trump still faced opposition to the bill from his own party.But nevertheless, it seemed that the author of The Art of the Deal had finally achieved this objective in Washington D.C. and in a bipartisan fashion.Mueller indictments and George Papadopoulos pleads guilty On Oct. 30, nearly six months after Mueller was appointed to serve as Special Counsel, Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manaforts longtime associate Rick Gates were indicted on charges of money laundering, failing to register as foreign agents and failing to report their foreign bank accounts.Muellers office also revealed that day that George Papadapoulos, a onetime foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a conversation he had with a Russian professor who has links to the Kremlin.Both Trump and the White House reacted to these developments by downplaying Manafort and Papadopoulos roles in the campaign, and highlighting that most of the charges detailed in the indictment against Manafort happened before he joined the campaign.(There is NO COLLUSION!Trump wrote on Twitter that day).But the charges, while they may not have spelled out collusion, signified that this investigation that has dogged Trump since his presidency started is not stopping anytime soon.
Trump Administration to Keep Obama-Era Calorie Labeling Law:::::(WASHINGTON) The Trump administration is moving ahead with a law from the Obama years that will require calorie counts to appear on foods served at restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores and pizza delivery chains nationwide.Despite years of opposition by some food sellers, the Food and Drug Administration is offering only minor accommodations to industry complaints about the difficulties of displaying the information.The FDA posted recommendations Tuesday to help businesses comply with the law.Trump appointees have delayed or upended numerous other regulations passed by the Obama administration.But the menu labeling rules, championed by former first lady Michelle Obama, appear on track to take effect next May after years of delays.
Trump: Gun Restrictions Would Have Made Texas Shooting Worse:::::(SEOUL, South Korea) President Donald Trump says tougher gun laws would not have prevented a mass shooting at a south Texas church, arguing that more restrictions might have led to more casualties.Trump spoke at a news conference in South Korea Tuesday where he was asked about extreme vetting for gun purchases.Trump said: If you did what youre suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happens to have a gun or a rifle in his trunk.As he did following last months Las Vegas massacre of 58 people, Trump pushed back against the question, calling it a situation that probably shouldnt be discussed too much and noted that he was in the heart of South Korea.Trump added that if the Good Samaritan didnt have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.Authorities say Devin Patrick Kelley fired at least 450 rounds of ammunition at worshippers in Sundays attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs.The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old.Trumps more muted response to gun violence contrasts with his swift call for legislative and military action following the Oct. 31 truck attack in New York City.Within hours of a rental truck ramming through a crowded bicycle path and into a school bus, Trump called for Congress to immediately repeal the diversity visa lottery program that suspect Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan citizen, used to enter the country in 2010.After the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and aides said it was inappropriate to consider a policy response while people were still grieving.Despite days later suggesting openness to outlawing the bump stock device that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire at near-automatic rates, the Trump administration has shown no signs of urgency.Trump, who supported gun control before reversing his position to enter the Republican presidential primary, courted the National Rifle Associations endorsement in 2016, and earlier this year became the first president in three decades to speak at the gun groups annual convention.
Republicans Want To Pass Tax Reform By Thanksgiving. Here's Why That's Tough:::::Its been a bleak fall for Republicans in Congress, and theyre clamoring for a victory: specifically, they want tax reform.After months of teasing what would be the first significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years, Republican lawmakers finally introduced the bill, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, last Thursday.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan asserts that it will pass in the lower chamber by Thanksgiving.That is a bold ask: there are only eight legislative days between Nov. 6 and then, and a number of kinks are still being ironed out in committee.It carries a number of measures that have proven controversial not only among Democrats who accuse the G.O.P.of drafting the bill behind closed doors but also several interest groups in Washington and more than a handful of conservatives.Heres what could trip things up.Irate lawmakers from states with high taxes.In its effort to drastically simplify the federal tax code, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does away with a number of old deductions and loopholes notably the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which allows taxpayers to subtract the amount they pay in state and local taxes from the final sum thats taxed federally.Its a boon for taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, California, New Jersey, and Illinois: by one estimate, one-fifth of all SALT claims came from California and New York alone.Predictably, the lawmakers who represent those taxpayers have spoken out against the bill in its current form.On Oct. 26, 20 Republicans voted against the budget framework that was needed before tax reform could continue; 11 of them were from New York and New Jersey.Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, said on ABC on Sunday that as of now, [he] would be a no vote on the tax reform bill.When the Ways and Means Committee assembled on Monday to begin marking up the bill, Rep. John Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut, described the piece of legislation and the fact it was going forward without a public hearing as a great charade.People in my state are going to get a tax increase, he said.The sheer cost of the thing The problem with cutting taxes and this bill does cut taxes, particularly for the wealthy is that you have to pay for it.Slashing taxes means less revenue for the government.Last week, Rep. Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said that this tax reform package would cost the U.S. $1.51 trillion over the next ten years.This would alienate deficit hawks on Capitol Hill.But more critically, it would transgress the rules that lets the Senate to pass the bill through the process known as reconciliation, which allows legislation to pass with only a simple majority of 51 votes.For a bill to be considered under reconciliation, it must not add to the federal deficit after a decade, a measure known as the Byrd Rule.The Senate is expected to release its version of the bill later this week, per Politico.Given these constraints, this document is likely to contrast with the one before the House.Slim majorities and legislative drama Assuming the tax reform package makes it to the floor of the Senate unscathed, its fate there is far from certain.Even with the benefit of reconciliation, Republicans have a slim majority 52 of the 100 seats that has so far failed to bulwark their legislative priorities.Remember when the Senate tried to repeal Obamacare?(It happened twice.)Theres little room for error: only two no votes could doom the thing altogether.And there are dozens of possible combinations of defectors.Republican Sens.Susan Collins of Maine Bob Corker of Tennessee have expressed concerns over the matter of the budget, Politico reports.It is not out of the question that Sens.John McCain and Jeff Flake, both independent-minded senators whose impending departures from Congress have freed them to act and speak their minds, could turn against the bill.(Flake has also spoken out against the deficit problem.)On top of that, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky whose vote was already a matter of discussion is currently recuperating from injuries sustained in an assault by a neighbor on Nov. 3.Reports say five of his ribs are broken, and that its too early to say when hell be back on the Senate floor.There are myriad balls in the air.Trump said last week that signing tax reform into law by the end of the year would be his Christmas gift to the country.Christmas, its said, is a time of magic and in this case, magic might be needed.
Donald Trump Wants $4 B for North Korea Missile Defense:::::President Donald Trump has requested an additional $4 billion to enhance U.S. missile defense to counter the threat of North Korea, hours before he landed Tuesday in Seoul for his first visit since taking office.This request supports additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners, Trump said in a letter to Congress.Providing for the safety and security of the American people is my top priority, he concluded.Submitted while on a 12-day tour in Asia, his first trip to the region as commander-in-chief, Trumps appeal underscored his administrations attempts to address the urgent threat of North Koreas progress toward developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, capable of reaching the U.S.The Trump administration initially requested $9.9 billion for missile defense in the 2018 fiscal year, which some lawmakers dismissed as too low.But following a series of provocative missile tests this summer, the president pledged to increase defense spending by many billions of dollars, reports CNN.The additional funding outlined in the budget amendment would provide for construction of a ground base interceptor field in Alaska and 50 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors.Trump also appealed for $1.2 billion toward the administrations South Asia strategy which includes sending thousands more troops to Afghanistan and $0.7 billion for repairing Navy ships recently damaged in fatal collisions.The president further called on Congress to act on an earlier request of $1.6 billion to be allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for the construction of a border wall separating the U.S. from Mexico, one of Trumps core campaign promises.
Donald Trump Aide Carter Page Testifies on Russia Contacts:::::(WASHINGTON) A former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trumps campaign has acknowledged in testimony to Congress that he had contact with a high-level Russian official while on a trip to Russia last year, according to a transcript released Monday.Carter Page, an unpaid adviser who left the campaign before Trump was elected, told the House intelligence committee last week that he briefly said hello to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich when he traveled to Russia for a speech.Under repeated questions about the contact which he had at times denied in the past Page said that he had spoken to Dvorkovich after his July 2016 speech at Moscows New Economic School.It was a very brief interaction.It was some nice pleasantries.I cannot recall the precise words I said, but it was sort of best wishes, and, you know, thats about it, Page said in response to several questions about the contact.Democrats on the panel were skeptical of his explanation.California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, produced a campaign email during the questioning in which Page had written that Dvorkovich had told him in a private conversation that he had expressed support for Trump and the desire to work together.Page responded that the conversation had been less than 10 seconds long.The testimony was part of the committees probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether it is linked to Trumps campaign.Pages trip raised questions just as the FBI began its counterintelligence investigation into the Russian meddling in the summer of 2016, and he has offered contradictory accounts over the past year about whom he met there at one point telling The Associated Press that he hadnt met with Dvorkovich.But his testimony on Thursday was under oath.Page was interviewed in March for several hours as part of the FBI probe, before special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take it over.Page wouldnt answer questions about his contact with Mueller.The House panel released the transcript from the closed-door interview as part of an agreement with Page, who had been subpoenaed by the committee in early October.Parts of the transcript are redacted.Page told the panel he had informed some members of the Trump campaign about the Russia trip, including then-Sen. Jeff Sessions.He said he mentioned in passing to Sessions, who is now attorney general, that he was preparing to visit Russia and Sessions had no reaction whatsoever.The testimony could raise more questions about the extent of Sessions knowledge about interactions between Trump campaign aides and Russians.Sessions recused himself from overseeing an investigation into the Trump campaign in March after acknowledging two previously undisclosed conversations with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign.Since then, Sessions has downplayed his own knowledge about communications between campaign aides and Russian officials and intermediaries.Page has insisted and continued to insist in the interview that the trip was personal and not campaign related.However, the committee produced an email during the interview in which Page wrote to campaign officials and asked them to let him know if you have any reservations or thoughts on how youd prefer me to focus these remarks, apparently referring to the speech he was giving in Moscow.He also suggested that Trump take his place at the speech a suggestion that appeared to go nowhere.Schiff pressured Page on what he suggested were inconsistencies in his testimony and past statements.He noted how Page told the committee that he had met only one Russian government official during his July 2016 trip to Russia, and yet had told campaign officials in the emails afterward that he had received valuable insights from legislators and senior members of the Russian presidential administration.Are you being honest in your testimony?Schiff asked.Because it doesnt seem possible for both to be true.Page said the insights he was referring to were based on materials he had read in the press, similar to my listening to President Trump in the various speeches that I heard of his.In a statement prepared for the committee, Page insisted that he had no personal information that the Russian government or anyone affiliated with it played any role in the 2016 presidential campaign.He depicted himself as an unpaid member of a campaign foreign policy team that met infrequently and provided him with no direct access to Trump.I have never met him in my life, Page said of Trump.Ive been in a lot of meetings with him, and Ive learned a lot from him, but never actually met him face to face.Page said he had no direct relationship with the Russian government, though he conceded that he may have spoken with different Russian government officials over the years.At another point in the interview, Page was asked about his relationship with George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser whose guilty pleas to lying to the FBI about his foreign contacts was unsealed last week.Page said he had limited interaction with Papadopoulos, but acknowledged receiving an email in which Papadopoulos made reference to a Professor Joseph Mifsud.The unsealed court papers reference a professor who told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had dirt on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of emails.Emails obtained by the AP show that the conversations cited in the papers were with Mifsud and another person.
Texas Shooter Devin Kelley's History of Domestic Violence:::::We may never know why a shooter opens fire on a church full of worshipers, or a school full of kids, or a movie theater full of couples.But when it happens, a familiar pattern tends to emerge.The shooter is almost always male, and usually white.He has access to firearms.And often he has a history of domestic violence or violence against women.According to an analysis by Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates gun-control measures, 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016 incidents in which four or more people, not including the shooter, are killed with a firearm involved domestic or family violence.That just counts shootings in which the victims included an intimate partner or family member; it doesnt account for shooters who have domestic violence charges in their past, then go on to shoot up a crowd of strangers.When Devin Kelley walked into a Texas church and opened fire on Sunday, killing 26 and injuring some 20 others, he became yet another data point in this grim statistic.In 2012, while Kelley was serving in the Air Force, he was court-martialed on two charges of domestic assault after he beat and choked his wife, threatened her with a firearm and hit her infant son hard enough to fracture his skull.This kind of abuse in the home can be a harbinger of violence outside it.You could think of domestic violence as a canary in the coal mine for future violence, says Sarah Tofte, director of research and implementation at Everytown for Gun Safety.We may not know everything we need to know about why and when it reverberates outside the home, but we know that it does, and weve seen it over and over again.Several recent mass shooters share Kelleys record of domestic violence.James Hodgkinson, who injured Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others when he opened fire on lawmakers and aides at a baseball practice in June, had been arrested in 2006 for hitting and choking his daughter.Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando last June, had an abusive relationship with his ex-wife, who said he frequently beat her.Robert Dear, who killed three people and wounded nine others when he opened fire on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in 2015, had been accused of domestic violence by two of his ex-wives.He was also arrested for rape in 1992.(There is no record Dear was convicted, suggesting the charge was ultimately dismissed.)People with a history of domestic violence appear to be overrepresented in public mass shootings, says Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis.But the larger connection is this: a plurality of mass shootings are domestic violence events themselves.The shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Sunday may belong to the latter category.Officials on Monday called the shooting a domestic situation, and said that Kelley may have been targeting his mother-in-law, to whom he had been sending threatening text messages.Its not clear why so many mass shooters have a history of domestic abuse.Since so many shooters die at the scene of the crime, it may be impossible to ever fully connect the dots.But experts say that certain elements of domestic abuse feelings of masculine grievance, a desire to be feared, violent rage are also found in mass shootings.What domestic violence and mass shootings seem to have in common are these elements of control, says April Zeoli, an associate professor at Michigan State Universitys School of Criminal Justice.The vast majority of domestic abusers, of course, dont go on to become mass killers.Researchers caution that the sample size of mass shooters is too small to make a scientific conclusion about what they have in common or what the link between the two behaviors may be.Right now we dont have enough data to have a pattern, says Susan B. Sorenson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Ortner Center on Family Violence.[Domestic violence] might just be one of a series of bad behaviors.The issue might be something else entirely, and we just dont know.She calls the trend line a fake fact, supported by anecdotal evidence, but not scientific data.The one thing that we know that they all have in common is that they have access to massive firepower, says Sorensen.Thats the single unifying force at this point in time.No trend line can ever fully explain why 26 people were shot to death in a church on Sunday.But examining the connection with domestic violence can help make some sense of an act of violence that is otherwise senseless.
Trump DoD Nominee: 'Insane' a US Civilian Can Buy an AR-15:::::One of President Donald Trump's nominees for a top Pentagon job said Tuesday it is "insane" civilians can buy assault rifles a starkly different position from the administration's pro-gun stance."I'd also like to, and I may get in trouble with other members of the committee, just say how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy a semiautomatic assault rifle like an AR-15," Dr. Dean Winslow, the nominee for the Department of Defense's top health affairs job, said during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Vox reported.The AR-15 is the semi-automatic counterpart of the U.S. military's M-16 rifle and the nation's No.1 selling gun, according to Mediaite, which flagged the testimony.Winslow also mentioned the Air Force's failure to alert federal authorities Kelley was convicted of a crime, which might have kept him from buying the military-style rifle he used in the massacre of 26 churchgoers Sunday.But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was irritated by Winslow's assessment, saying "I dont think that's in your area of responsibility or expertise," Vox reported.Video of Winslow's testimony was posted by the Senate committee.
Brazile's 'Hacks': Hillary's Poor Health Led to 'Basket of Deplorables' Remark:::::Former Democratic National Committee interim chair Donna Brazile says she does not think Hillary Clinton would have made the insulting remark that half of Donald Trump's supporters belong in a "basket of deplorables" had she been in better health.In her new book, "Hacks," released Tuesday, Brazile wrote she saw Clinton before she made the Sept. 9, 2016, comment, and noted "Hillary did not look well," The Washington Free Beacon reported.Brazile "noticed her face was puffy," "her skin looked pale and papery," and "that her eyes were glazed," the Free Beacon reported.She approached Clinton about her health before the speech and saw that she was "wobbly on her feet" with a "rattled cough" symptoms so concerning Brazile suggested medical attention, the Free Beacon reported."A short time later, I was seated in the audience at the Cipriani when [Clinton] strode up to the stage with her usual strong steps," Brazile wrote, the Free Beacon reported."Then she said something that, had she been in better health, I don't think she would have said.""When she said 'basket of deplorables' I knew that no matter what she said in the rest of her remarks, this would be the comment that made it on to the evening news," she wrote.Two days later, Clinton had to leave a 9/11 memorial ceremony because she was woozy; her diagnosis of pneumonia was later announced.Brazile slammed Clinton's campaign for lying about the illness, initially claiming Clinton was "overheated," calling the explanation "stupid" and a "huge blunder.""The whole story stank, and the way the campaign handled it just made matters worse, she wrote, the Free Beacon reported.
WashPost: Senate Tax Plan Would Delay Corporate Rate Cut:::::Senate Republicans are planning a one-year delay in a major corporate tax cut in their reform plan, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.The Post cited "four people familiar with a draft of the legislation."The delay would save about $100 billion and is expected to face strong resistance from President Donald Trump, who has called for an immediate reduction to the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.The legislation is expected to be released Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee, the Post reports.House Republicans unveiled their reform plan last week.Trump praised the House proposal, saying "it's all about jobs" and "we'll make America globally competitive again."Besides slashing the corporate rate, the House plan lowers taxes for most Americans, though it limits the deduction for homeowners and would add $1.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade.In addition, the Senate blueprint is expected to differ from the House on those individual tax provisions, the Post reports.The Senate plan, for instance, would eliminate the state and local tax deductions that families take, which would go further than the House bill.Senate negotiators are also expected to keep the seven current income tax brackets, versus the four proposed by the House, the Post reports.
Grassley Introduces Bipartisan Sexual Harassment Bill in Senate:::::Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced a bipartisan bill Tuesday that would require senators and their staffers to undergo sexual harassment training.Politico reported that the proposal's co-sponsors include Sens.Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis. "I believe each of you works hard to ensure that your offices are professional, free of harassment, and places where merit's rewarded," Grassley told fellow senators, Politico reported."But I think we have to acknowledge that in our society, despite our best efforts and intentions, sexual harassment remains a serious problem.And we must work together to make sure that the Senate remains free from harassment."The issue of sexual harassment has gained additional attention over the last month because of several allegations leveled at disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey, and others.There have also been allegations of sexual assault within the halls of Congress.Grassley's bill would require senators and members of their staff to undergo sexual harassment training within 60 days of the Senate Rules Committee implementing the new rule.Gillibrand is also putting together her own legislation related to combatting sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.
Sen. Schumer: Trump Won't Veto Spending Bill If DACA's Added:::::Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is predicting President Donald Trump will sign a spending package in December if a permanent fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is included."Here's the bottom line we feel very strongly that DACA must pass and pass by Dec. 31," Schumer said at a news conference Tuesday."We're going to work very hard for it in the must-pass legislation that comes forward.""We think we're going to have a good number of our Republican colleagues join us.There are a lot of Republicans who want to pass DACA as well, and so I am very optimistic that it will pass."Schumer declared Trump will not veto the year-end spending package if DACA is in it."If DACA is in the omnibus, he will not veto it, is my prediction," he said, adding he believes there will be bipartisan support for putting a DACA fix in the bill.He also predicted there would be no need need for Democrats to threaten a government shutdown over a lack of a DACA fix."We won't come to that," Schumer said."I think we'll have Republicans joining us to support DACA."The Hlll has reported Trump told GOP senators last week at a meeting at the White House he does not want a DACA fix in the bill, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., believes there will ultimately be a deal that includes border security measures or a push to end chain migration.The current government spending deal lasts until Dec. 8.
Fox News: Fusion GPS Met With Russian Lawyer Before, After Trump Tower Meeting:::::The co-founder of research firm Fusion GPS, which financed a controversial 2016 dossier on then-candidate Donald Trump met with a Russian lawyer before and after her June 2016 contact with Donald Trump Jr., Fox News reported.At the time of the sit-down between Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump, Fox News reported.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom, Fox News reported.They also were together after the Trump Tower meeting, Fox News reported, citing an unnamed source.According to Fox News, Simpson and Fusion GPS were hired by BakerHostetler, which represented Russian firm Prevezon through Veselnitskaya.Senate Judiciary Committee investigators interviewed Simpson for more than 10 hours Aug. 22.A spokesman for the committee had no comment on whether Simpson confirmed his contact with Veselnitskaya during the closed-door session.NBC News first reported Veselnitskaya and Simpson were both at a hearing centered around another Fusion client, Russian oligarch Denis Katsyv.Katsyv's company, Prevezon Holdings, was sanctioned against doing business in the United States for its alleged role in laundering more than $230 million, Fox News reported, citing U.S. appeals court records.The wrongdoing had been uncovered by Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested for probing Prevezon and other companies with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.In December 2012, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act was passed into U.S. law, freezing Russian assets and banning visas for sanctioned individuals, Fox News noted.Simpson is believed to have been working with Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet counter-intelligence officer turned Russian-American lobbyist, to overturn the sanctions, Fox News reported.Over the weekend, Fusion GPS sought a restraining order after the House Intelligence Committee requested additional records that could reveal if Fusion was paying media companies or reporters for planting stories, Fox News reported.
CNN Poll: Democratic Party Hits 25-Year Low in Favorability:::::The Democratic Party hit its lowest favorability mark in 25 years in a CNN poll released Tuesday, with only 37 percent of Americans saying they have a positive view of the party.The study, conducted by independent research company SSRS, found 54 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the party.Fifty percent, though, said if elections for Congress were being held today they would vote for the Democratic Party's candidate, compared to 38 percent who said they would vote for the Republican Party's candidate.Fifty-nine percent said they would vote for a congressional candidate who opposes President Donald Trump, while 35 percent said they would side with a candidate who supports the president.The GOP fares worse, with only 30 percent of Americans saying they have a favorable view of the party compared to 61 percent who say they have an unfavorable view.On tax reform, 45 percent said they oppose the GOP proposal, while 31 percent said they favor it.Thirty-six percent said they thought they and their families would fare the same if the tax legislation passes and is signed into law, compared to 32 percent who say they think their families would be worse off.Twenty-one percent said they think they would be better off.The poll was conducted Nov. 2-5 among 1,021 adults.The margin of error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.
Joint Committee on Taxation Finds Some Tax Hikes in GOP Bill:::::A new analysis of the GOP's tax plan shows some middle-income earners would see tax increases an explosive prospect given Republicans' vows to give relief to the middle class, Politico reported.The Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis finds 61 percent of taxpayers will see their taxes fall in the next two years, Politico reported.By 2027, 20 percent would pay higher taxes, 46 percent would get a tax cut, and 34 percent would see only minimal changes, with breaks of less than $100.House tax writers estimate the average family would receive a $1,182 tax cut.The joint committee said 8 percent of taxpayers would pay more in 2019 under the plan.According to Politico, though the GOP plan is a net $1.5 trillion tax cut, it simultaneously both raises and lowers taxes, offering this example: By 2027, about 23 percent of those earning between $50,000 and $75,000 would see a tax increase, and 42 percent of people in that bracket would see a tax cut of at least $500 while among those earning more than $1 million, two-thirds would see a tax cut of more than $500, while one third would see a tax increase of at least $500."The bottom line is the president told me specifically that this is not a tax cut for the rich it's a tax cut for the hard-working middle class, so I'm looking at everything we're seeing," Sen.

Paxton: 'We Might Not Have 26 Dead' If Gun Law Was Followed:::::There are existing laws on the books that could have kept Texas church shooter Devin Kelley from getting hold of the guns he used to kill 26 and injure dozens more, and had that law been followed, "we might not have 26 dead people," Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Tuesday."I can tell you for the four purchases that he made, the system did their required checks and there was no prohibitive information in the systems that we checked that say he could not have purchased that firearm," Paxton told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" anchor Bill Hemmer."In all three of those databases, there was not information that we would have said was prohibitive for that man to get the firearm."Air Force officials admitted Monday that Kelley, a veteran, had been found guilty in 2012 of assaulting his wife and her child, and had been given 12 months confinement and a bad conduct discharge, but none of that information was reported to a federal database, as required by Pentagon rules.His discharge came in 2014, and that same year, Kelley bought the first of four weapons.News broke Tuesday that Kelley was able to escape from a mental health facility in 2012, in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, months after beating his then wife and her young son.Police picked him up at an El Paso bus station, and witness told them he had "suffered from mental disorders and had plans to run from Peak Behavioral Health Services."Kelley had also been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force base, witnesses told police, and "was attempting to carry out death threats" against his superiors in the military."I haven't focused so much on federal law," Paxton said."I mostly focus on state law.The main point here is we had existing law.Had it been followed whether it was the responsibility of the military or somebody else had it been followed, we might not have 26 dead people."There is a great outcry for new gun control laws, following both the Texas massacre and the Las Vegas shootings, but Paxton said the focus should be on enforcing the laws that are already in existence.Paxton said he does not have an answer about if the Air Force can be held liable, but instead, that will be something the Department of Justice and the Air Force will need to examine.Meanwhile, Kelley is dead of a self-inflicted wound, making the investigation much more difficult for local and federal investigators.The shootings were recorded on video, as cameras were running during the church service at the First Baptist Church of Sunderland Springs that day, but Paxton said he can't comment on the recording.He does think the video might help.He also said, while he cannot discuss the case much, he can say Kelley had "severe problems" Kelley's severe problems should have been recognized, said Paxton, and the real breakdown is the "fact that the system broke.We should have caught this.This guy should have never been able to get these weapons and the breakdown is at least there and maybe as we investigate we'll find out that maybe some of the family members should have notified authorities.That may be something that we determine down the road."It has been reported Kelley's in-laws were members of the church, but they were not present during the service, although his wife's mother was, and he killed her."I don't think they attended all that often but they attended occasionally, is what I've been told," Paxton said."It's odd that he chose the Sunday they weren't there.Maybe he didn't realize they weren't there.We're trying to figure that out."He said there is also no evidence pointing to whether Kelley had been at the church before."I think part of it, too, he wanted to go to a place where it would take first responders a long time to get there," he said."There may have been numerous factors that affected why he chose this location."
Tillerson's Transparency Push Has State Staffers Skeptical:::::State Department staffers are concerned Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's recent push for transparency is more about Hillary Clinton than the current administration, Politico reports.Tillerson has directed several hundred employees of the department to sort through a backlog of requests for records, in what he claims is a bid for increased transparency, in a move that has won praise from conservative groups."We haven't understood why there's been a slow-walking of releasing records, and we've been quite public in counseling the administration to take an approach of extreme transparency," Tom Fitton, president of conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, told Politico."It looks like someone's listening."However, many workers believe the actual reason is to reveal Clinton's official emails from her time leading the department.These workers also believe the assignment is meant to push them toward resignation, since many were reassigned from more significant posts."It's a remarkable misuse of resources to advance what is at its core a partisan political aim," an unnamed State employee said."We all know what's going on.And, of course, we're all unhappy that we're being made a part of it."CNN reported last month President Donald Trump was pushing the State Department to move faster in releasing Clinton's emails, and he "asked Tillerson to work to clear the backlog."
Judge Napolitano: Comey 'Thought He Could Pull a Fast One on the American People':::::Judge Andrew Napolitano slammed former FBI Director James Comey over memos that show he changed his statement about Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information.Comey initially said that Clinton was "grossly negligent," according to a draft dated May 2, 2016, but a later draft, dated June 10, had Clinton listed as "extremely careless," according to newly reported memos, The Hill reports."James Comey thought he could pull a fast one on the American people by using a slightly less offensive sounding term 'extremely careless' and thereby exonerate her.But legally, it's the same thing," Napolitano told Fox News' "Fox & Friends."Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote to current FBI Director Christopher Wray seeking more details in a letter posted on the committee's website."Gross negligence in the handling of classified information is a criminal act," Grassley noted in the letter.
Brady: Tax Bill Provides Relief for All Incomes, Boosts Economy:::::The House Ways and Means Committee will have its tax bill out of committee on Thursday, and when the measure eventually becomes law, it will provide tax relief at all levels while giving a vital boost to the nation's economy, Chairman Kevin Brady said Tuesday."Just like any business that's in financial trouble back home, you have to do two things," the Texas Republican told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" program."You have to cut spending and get the costs under control.You have to get new revenue.You have to grow as well.Tax reform is that half of the equation.Getting people back to work, getting companies growing, stop sending our jobs overseas can help us in a big way grow revenues."If the nation is able to get away from "this Obama 1.8 percent economy," economists believes the effects will "last for a decade forward," the congressman added."We get away from that and move into [President Donald] Trump's strong economy, you can recoup a trillion dollars or more from just good solid tax reform.So this growth helps."The tax relief will come at all income levels, Brady said, including local small business people as well as higher earners, and "every American will be better off under this plan.""You have to look at your unique situation," he continued."What the joint committee confirmed yesterday is yes, the design of this, because it isn't just about the rates, it is about cutting taxes underneath those rates as well, people are better off."House Republicans do want to be on the same page as Trump, who is "leading the charge" for a "big, bold tax cut," Brady said."He wants to see our companies and our jobs, our research come back from overseas," he said."It is important for us to be on the same page with him and we are. "
Voters in New Jersey and Virginia to Elect New Governors:::::Voters in New Jersey and Virginia are choosing new governors Tuesday in contests that could be an early referendum on President Donald Trump.In swing-state Virginia, most polls show a close race between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democratic Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam.New Jersey will get a successor to unpopular GOP Gov.Chris Christie in the race between Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno.Murphy holds a double-digit lead in polls over Guadagno.The stakes are high as both parties seek momentum ahead of next year's mid-term elections.Democrats haven't won any special elections for Congress this year and the next Virginia governor will have a major say in the state's next round of redistricting, when Congressional lines are drawn.Republicans are looking for a boost as their party is beset by intraparty turmoil between Trump and key Republicans in Congress.Incumbent governors in both states, Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Christie in New Jersey, are term-limited.Virginia's race has been an often ugly slugfest that political observers say has been more racially charged than past contests in recent memory.Outside groups on both sides have spent millions to influence the outcome and called on high-profile surrogates, including former President Barack Obama and Vice President Mike Pence.Gillespie has kept Trump at a distance but tried to excite the president's supporters with sharp-elbowed ads on immigration and Confederate statues.The former Republican National Committee and Washington lobbyist has been criticized by Democrats and some conservatives as running a race-baiting campaign.Northam, an Army veteran and pediatric neurologist, has lumped Gillespie in with the white supremacists who rallied in Charlottesville this summer in support of Confederate monuments.On the issues, the opponents have key differences on taxes, guns, abortion and other issues.Gillespie supports a cut in the state's income tax rate, less gun control and more restrictions on abortions.Northam said he wants a tax overhaul that targets low-income Virginians, supports greater gun restrictions and abortion rights.In New Jersey, Murphy, who earned a fortune at Goldman Sachs before serving as Barack Obama's ambassador to Germany, has promised to check Trump's influence on his state.Murphy has promised a liberal agenda that includes support for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, hiking taxes on millionaires, increasing funding for schools and legalizing marijuana.Guadagno has tried to distance herself from Trump and Christie, but it's been challenging since she served as his top deputy for eight years.She's run on lowering the state's property taxes and ending so-called "sanctuary cities."
Sen. Angus King Against Banning Assault Weapons:::::Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he opposes banning assault weapons.King's comments came during an interview on MSNBC.On the heels of the mass shooting in a Texas church, King was asked specifically if he supported a ban on a "military-style weapon" or an "AR-15 weapon.""I'm from a state where was have one of the highest gun ownership rates in the country," he said."Yet, we have one of the lowest rates of gun crime."And he added: "It's called an assault weapon, but it's simply a semi-automatic hunting rifle in costume, with a different kind of stock.But the functionality of the weapon is exactly the same as [ones] used by legitimate hunters.""So, I have a problem with banning a weapon because of its appearance.""A lot of times in these situations apparently, it's when the fellow it's always a fellow starts to reload, that's when you might have a chance to stop the tragedy."So, magazine size, I think, is something I do think we need to look at."
Sen. Cruz: It's a 'Mistake' for House Bill to Raise Taxes:::::Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is pushing to keep alive the idea of including a repeal of Obamacares individual mandate in the tax overhaul plan, even as House Republicans struggle with how to address an issue that threatens to complicate the tax debate.Cruz also criticized the House bill for getting rid of exemptions for Americans in high-taxed blue states, calling it a "mistake."At a news conference Tuesday, Cruz said its vital to use the tax legislation to end the mandate that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty.If nothing else, he said, doing so will in effect be a tax cut for the 6.5 million Americans who now pay a penalty because they dont have health insurance coverage.I think its critical to make this end, he said of the mandate.Further, axing the mandate would produce $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue, which could be used as offsets to pay for tax cuts vs. ending tax deductions for middle class families in high-taxed states."There are some taxpayers who are losing exemptions, particularly in some high-tax states like New York or California that could conceivably be paying higher taxes.I think that is a mistake," Cruz said."I think tax reform needs to cut taxes for everybody."House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News Sunday that the GOP was considering adding the mandates repeal to the bill.Republicans have some incentive, because doing so is estimated to raise $416 billion over a decade, which could be used to offset tax-rate cuts.Repealing the mandate would result in increasing the number of people who are uninsured, thus cutting federal spending on subsidies for insurance coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Yet adding the matter into the tax debate could be combustible just a couple of months after a drive to replace the Affordable Care Act blew up in the Senate.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said at a meeting of the panel on Monday that he didnt plan to include a repeal of the Obamacare mandate in his version of the bill.Yet this morning he told talk radio host Hugh Hewitt that GOP leaders in the debate are listening to other lawmakers about it and that its still on the table.Asked about the presidents position on repealing the mandate as she stood near Cruz Tuesday morning, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said that we respect the fact that the process is ongoing.She added that its time for lawmakers to weigh in on the policies that will be in the tax bill.For his part, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted there is solid early momentum toward a broad tax plan.Nothing is more important to the presidents economic agenda than tax reform and tax cuts, Mnuchin said.He added that the administration couldnt be more excited about where we are, and that Congress appears likely to send President Donald Trump a final package by years end.
New Jersey Gov. Christie Argues With Voter on Election Day:::::New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie argued with a voter on Tuesday, the day his state elects a new governor.New York Times correspondent Nick Corasaniti captured the argument in a video that he posted on Twitter.The voter asked Christie why he did not merge two New Jersey towns."I never said I was going to merge the two towns," Christie said.He encouraged the voter to run for office and make the change herself."Be the voice to do it.No, I know, that's too hard it's easier to sit here and complain," Christie said to the voter."That's the joy of public service.It's serving folks like you that is really such a unique joy.It really is.You're fabulous."Christie, the outgoing governor, is the least popular governor in New Jersey history, according to a July poll in Politico.The governor's support for President Donald Trump made him less popular in his state, Christie said in October.
Kevin Brady: Adoption Tax Credit Could Return to Tax Reform Bill:::::House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said Tuesday that the adoption tax credit could be added back to the tax reform bill."Absolutely we're having these discussions.For me as a pro-life dad and my wife as a pro-life mom, we understand, look, we understand the joys of adoption, because we have a family where none existed before," Brady said in an interview with Hugh Hewitt."I'm an adoptive dad of two kids, as well.We know how important this is."The adoption tax credit is a one-time refund for adoptive parents, which can be applied over the course of five years.The credit in 2017 was $13,570, according to The Hill.A private agency adoption can cost $40,00, The Hill's report said.Brady said the credit was taken out because not many families can use it, but more people could benefit from it under the new tax reform bill."This really is a debate between the old approach and a newer approach that can help more people," Brady said in the interview."We're going to have the discussions in the Ways and Means Committee, and with Republicans, or do we want to stick with the old credit ...or do we go with the tax cuts that provide about $2,000 a year, and the new family credit that helps you with your child every year of their life?"Brady said in the Hewitt interview.
Rep. Collins: Donors Said Pass Tax Reform or 'Don't Ever Call Me Again':::::Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., told The Hill Tuesday that his donors are threatening to walk if the Republican tax bill doesn't pass."My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don't ever call me again,'" Collins, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said when asked if donors approve of the plan.Before he was asked the question, Collins had been describing the barrage of lobbyists representing special interests looking to save certain tax provisions.The New York Republican told reporters after a House GOP conference on Tuesday that "every special interest is out in force.I'd say the more they come out, it's an indication we're doing a darn good job."He then specified that large businesses and special interest groups aren't the only ones lobbying, noting that his niece pushed him to bring back the adoption tax credit."We are getting lobbied by our families, our neighbors, our friends," he said.
Rep. Biggs: Make Tax Cuts Retroactive to 2017:::::Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., wants the GOP tax cut plan made retroactive to 2017.Biggs' comments came in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Tex., chairman of the Way and Means committee."First and most important, we should implement all tax rate reductions and other provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) retroactive to January 1, 2017," he said."While I appreciate that filers will see immediate benefits arising from decreased withholding in their paychecks already by January 2018, these same taxpayers will also fail to notice that their respective tax burdens have not decreased.Needless to say, the political fallout for Republicans could be dire."Delaying the tax cuts may also slow our nation's economy.Since President Trump took office in January, our nation has seen three consecutive quarters of economic growth in excess of 3 percent.By applying full retroactivity to this tax reform package and returning more hard-earned money back to individuals and small businesses to spend or invest as they see fit, we will be in the best position possible to capitalize on the enormous economic growth of the past few months."Word of the lawmaker's letter came in a report by The Hill.The website noted Republicans are hoping to pass a tax package and have it signed by the end of 2017.It reported making the cuts retroactive would result in a big lump sum payment for many taxpayers, but would also add to the deficit.
Gillespie: Future Va. Governor Must Be Able to Work With Trump:::::Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie said Tuesday he appreciates President Donald Trump's tweeted support, and he noted that if he's elected in the race against Democratic challenger Ralph Northam, he'll be able to work with the White House."If you're going to be governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, you better be able to work with the president of the United States, and the vice president, and the Cabinet," Gillespie told Fox News' "Fox and Friends" program."Twenty cents of every dollar of our economy here in Virginia is a direct federal dollar, and I'll be able to work with the president to make sure that remains the largest naval base in the world."Gillespie said he can tell from the "momentum and enthusiasm" he's seen over the past two weeks, he feels confident he'll take the race.Gillespie's last major general election race was in 2014, when he narrowly lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Warner.However, while mounting his gubernatorial race this year, he almost lost the primary in June to Corey Stewart, who ran a strong GOP campaign during which he followed the Trump model, including calling for a stronger stand on illegal immigration, The Washington Post reported.In a pair of tweets posted while Trump is touring in South Korea, the president praised Gillespie, saying if elected, he'll "turn around the high crime and poor economic performance" of Virginia.He also accused Northam of being "weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS" and said he'll oppose the Second Amendment.Gillespie is a former Republican National Committee chairman and White House counselor to President George W. Bush, and said he learned lessons in the close race against Warner that will help him come out ahead in Tuesday's race."We're 39th out of 50 states in economic growth," Gillespie said."Virginia should be [number] one out of all 50 states, and I truly believe that.And I have a plan to get us there to increase our job creation by 25 percent, to make our community safer and improve our schools and our transportation system, to make sure we can get home in time to have dinner with our family.So I have a plan for all of these things.Twenty-one specific policy proposals that I put forward, and the voters are seeing that, and they know that this election is not just about the next four years, it's about the next 30 years."Gillespie also said he does not believe Gov.Terry McAuliffe did not provide momentum needed for the state."For the five of the past six years, our economic growth rate has been less than one percent, and we've now got more people moving out of Virginia than into Virginia," said Gillespie."That had never happened before.But for the past three years before, more people moved out than in.And last year, 51 percent of them took a four-year college degree with them.That is not momentum."
Democrat wins in New Jersey as elections test the nation's political mood:::::Washington (CNN) Phil Murphy has won the New Jersey governor's race, CNN projects, returning the state to Democratic control after eight years under the leadership Republican Gov.Chris Christie.It's a big pick-up for Democrats, handing them their first victory in a statewide race since President Donald Trump took office.Murphy defeated Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno in a state where Christie's unpopularity -- with approval ratings in the teens, making him the least-liked governor in the country -- proved too much to overcome.Votes are also being counted in Virginia, where a tightly contested governor's race that will test Trump's impact on the nation's political mood.Democratic Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam hopes to capitalize on a surge in voter turnout in Virginia's northern suburbs near Washington and deliver the party its first big win in the Trump era.Republican former lobbyist and George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie, meanwhile, is attempting to show Republicans who had previously kept their distance from Trump a way to embrace the President's policies on the campaign trail.Elsewhere in the country, New York City, Atlanta and other cities are electing mayors.And in Utah, voters will select a replacement for the retired former Rep. Jason Chaffetz.Gillespie has mimicked Trump's tactics -- attacking Northam over sanctuary cities while saying he would not remove Confederate Civil War monuments.A Gillespie mailer also referenced the controversy over protests by NFL players ."You'd never take a knee ... so take a stand on Election Day," the mailer reads.But he has kept personal distance from Trump: The two didn't campaign together at all, despite Trump visiting his own golf course in Virginia 15 times after Gillespie won the Republican nomination.Republicans nationally are closely watching to see if Gillespie's approach works or whether he got too close to Trump for suburban voters' comfort, or strayed too far away from the President to win over his rural, white base.Northam, meanwhile, has struggled to motivate the black voters who make up the Democratic base.Former President Barack Obama urged Democrats not to get "complacent" in non-presidential elections during an October rally with Northam in Richmond.Preliminary exit polls found that Gillespie's focus on keeping Confederate monuments in place could be popular with Virginia voters -- particularly Republicans and independents.Ninety-five percent of Republicans said the monuments should remain in place, and nearly eight in 10 independents agreed.Meanwhile, about seven in 10 Democrats said the statues should be removed.Helping Northam, though, could be Trump's 43% approval rating among those who voted, according to the preliminary exit polls.Fifty-five percent of Virginia voters said they disapprove of how Trump is handling his job.The Virginia race carries national importance as a gauge of how voters are reacting to Trump a year into his presidency -- and also because the state is a proving ground for both parties' approaches in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats hope to take control of the House and Republicans seek to expand their 52-48 Senate majority.The election takes place with Trump overseas on a 13-day Asia trip.The President had thrown his political capital heavily behind Sen. Luther Strange in an Alabama Republican Senate primary in September -- but Strange lost to former judge Roy Moore, and Trump has been much less involved in subsequent races, although he continues to tweet to help Gillespie.The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible.If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017 The Virginia race has caused national Democrats anxiety for weeks.Northam has struggled to pull away in a state Obama carried twice and Hillary Clinton won in 2016.Polls have shown a tight race, with Northam narrowly leading in most.Four new polls were released Monday, with the closest, from Monmouth University, showing Northam's lead at 2 percentage points.The widest gap came from Quinnipiac University, which pegged Northam's lead at 9 points.The Wason Center at Christopher Newport University showed Northam up 6 points, and Fox News had Northam's lead at 5 points.New York, Utah Republicans have an advantage in a Utah special election to replace the retired former House oversight chairman Jason Chaffetz.There, Provost Mayor John Curtis is expected to cruise to an easy victory.In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who campaigned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and has fashioned himself as a leading progressive voice -- appears to be on track to win a second term.It's one of many mayoral races across the country taking place Tuesday.Down-ballot races Democrats also hope to make down-ballot gains.In Virginia, Democrat Justin Fairfax is running for lieutenant governor against Republican Jill Holtzman Vogel, a state senator known for her sponsorship of a 2012 bill that would have required women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds.Social issues are prominent in another statewide race in Virginia, as Democratic attorney general Mark Herring faces Republican challenger John Adams, who has hit Herring for his refusal to defend Virginia's same-sex marriage ban in court.Across the country in Washington, a state senate match-up will decide whether Democrats take control of the chamber -- and therefore land the "trifecta" of control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's office.

The 5 counties to watch in the Virginia governor's race:::::Washington (CNN) The big-ticket race on the ballot Tuesday is in Virginia, where either Republican Ed Gillespie or Democrat Ralph Northam will be elected the next governor of the commonwealth.Virginia has transformed from a solidly red state to a leaning blue one rapidly over the last decade.And most polling in the race gives Northam a small lead -- although everyone agrees Gillespie has been closing fast amid a series of slip-ups by Northam's side So where should you look to see who might be having the better night?I talked to a half-dozen smart Virginia political operatives -- Democrats and Republicans -- and asked them to pick a single county in the state that would best tell the tale of Gillespie vs. Northam.Their picks -- and their thoughts about those picks -- are below.(And make sure to check out another look at counties that matter via CNN's Terence Burlij and Ryan Struyk .)Albemarle County Charlottesville -- the site of the white supremacist violence over the summer -- sits at the center of this central Virginia county.Thanks in no small part to the University of Virginia -- and the community that has grown up around it -- Albemarle is seen as the home of the liberals' liberals in the state."A place that has become emblematic for all of Virginia's past sins/transgressions and yet possesses one of its most stunning achievements," said one Democratic insider."(It's) traditionally conservative and rural yet has that progressive center."Hillary Clinton won Albemarle by more than 14,000 votes over Donald Trump in 2016.Democrat Terry McAuliffe carried it by 6,500 votes over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the 2013 governor's race.If liberals are fired up and ready to go -- even for a candidate like Northam, who is not progressives' first choice -- you'll see it in his margins in Albemarle.Chesterfield County

Poll: Views of Democratic Party hit lowest mark in 25 years:::::Washington (CNN) Favorable views of the Democratic Party have dropped to their lowest mark in more than a quarter century of polling, according to new numbers from a CNN poll conducted by SSRS .Only 37% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Democrats, down from 44% in March of this year.A majority, 54%, have an unfavorable view, matching their highest mark in polls from CNN and SSRS, CNN/ORC and CNN/USA Today/Gallup stretching back to 1992.The rating includes low favorable ratings from some core Democratic groups, including nonwhites (48%) and people under 35 years old (33%).The numbers come amid recent feuds and divisions in the Democratic Party, as former interim chair Donna Brazile's new book has unveiled new questions about infighting during the 2016 presidential campaign.But the Republican Party isn't doing any better, with just 30% of Americans holding a favorable view.That's essentially the same as September, when the rating hit its lowest point in polling back to 1992 , but down from 42% in March.A broad 6 in 10, 61%, have an unfavorable opinion.This means both parties sit at or near rock bottom as voters go to the polls across the country on Tuesday, most prominently in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as dozens of local and mayoral races nationwide.A substantial 33% of liberals and 41% of conservatives have unfavorable views of the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.Plus, 4 in 10 independents, 42%, say they have an unfavorable view of both parties vs. only 8% who say they have a favorable view of both.Indeed, a bare majority of Americans, 51%, say it's bad for the country that the Republican Party is in control of Congress.Only 38% say GOP control is good for the nation.That's worse than at any point in CNN's polling on the Democratic majority in Congress between 2007 and 2010.A look ahead to 2018 But at least for now, all of those negatives for the GOP appear to outweigh the Democrats' decline in popularity when it comes to the ballot box, with Democrats continuing to hold a lead on a generic congressional ballot.Democrats top Republicans on that question by a wide 12 percentage points, 50% to 38%.That's similar to a 14-point gap between the two parties last month.Republicans and Democrats remain almost unanimously united behind their own candidates in 2018, but Democrats hold a crucial 10-point lead among independents.There are more warning signs for Democrats in this poll.Overall, 36% of registered voters who identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting next year, down from 44% who said so in September.That puts Democratic enthusiasm on par with that of Republicans, which stands at 37%.And there are signs in the poll that more of next year's vote may be driven by dislike of a party than affection for one.Sweeping majorities of voters have unfavorable views of the party they won't support in 2018: 87% of people who say they'd back a Democrat have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, and 89% of those who say they'll back the Republican have a negative view of the Democrats.Still, a sizable number view the party they do plan to vote for unfavorably: A third of voters on both sides, 32%, say they have an unfavorable view of the party whose candidate they say they'll support in 2018.Trump's record unpopularity , now down to just 36% approval, also bleeds into the midterm elections: Roughly the same number, 35%, say they'd be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports Trump over one who opposes the president, down from 41% in April.Americans say their own member of Congress deserves re-election in November, 46% to 39%, with a sizable 15% unsure.But two-thirds, 65%, say most members of Congress don't deserve re-election.Even among Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, 51% say most members aren't worthy of another term.The future of GOP tax reform On the Republican tax reform plan, only 31% of Americans say they support the GOP tax reform proposals in Congress.Less than half, 45%, say they oppose the plans, down from 52% last month, when the question wording included Donald Trump's name.A quarter have no opinion on GOP tax reform plans.Support for the tax plan overall is largely split down party lines: 64% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 8% of Democrats say they support the plan.Only 21% say they will be better off under the GOP tax plan vs. 32% who say they will be worse off, similar to the divide in October before details of the plan were released.And by a two-to-one margin, Americans say it would increase the deficit instead of shrinking it, 40% to 18%.Republican leaders in Congress have said they hope to pass sweeping tax reform legislation by the end of December, adding at least one major legislative accomplishment in their first year.JUST WATCHED Poll: Americans concerned about Russia probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Americans concerned about Russia probe 02:05 Majorities of Americans oppose some core tenets of the GOP tax plan: 52% say they oppose lowering the corporate tax rate, 56% say they oppose repealing the estate tax and 52% oppose eliminating deductions for state and local income and sales taxes.Still, majorities back some parts: a broad, bipartisan 79% say they support increasing the child tax credit and 55% say they favor increasing the standard deduction.About half of Americans, 49%, say they favor limiting the home interest deduction to only $500,000 worth of mortgage debt.The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS by telephone Nov. 2 to Nov. 5 among a random national sample of 1,021 adults.The margin of sampling error for results among the full sample is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.
Election Day 2017: The most important things we'll learn:::::(CNN) The governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey usually receive heightened attention because they are the first big statewide races (except for special elections) after a new president takes office.But after all the tumult of Donald Trump's first months as president, this year's focus is even more intense -- for at least one of the contests.The Virginia governor's race has been captivating, controversial and frequently cutting.Republican nominee Ed Gillespie, a long-time party operative and lobbyist, has dominated the campaign dialogue with a succession of racially tinged attacks on Democrat Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor.Though Virginia has been trending Democratic, and final pre-election polls still show Northam leading, Gillespie's onslaught has shaken the soft-spoken Democratic nominee and unnerved party activists desperate to record their first big electoral win of the Trump presidency.By contrast, the New Jersey race has been a relatively sleepy affair that has failed to engage much voter interest: Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and US ambassador to Germany, has consistently held a double-digit advantage in polls over Republican Lt.Governor Kim Guadagno, who has labored under the unpopularity of both Trump and outgoing GOP Gov.Chris Christie.Still a big Murphy win, if combined with a Northam victory, would send a chill through other Republicans representing white-collar, cosmopolitan places, especially along the coasts.Starting on Wednesday morning, both parties will be analyzing the results , but especially Virginia, for lessons they can apply to the 2018 midterm election.Here's a guide to some of the questions each side will be asking.How big a shadow does Donald Trump cast?For decades, in an early barometer of voter disappointment in a new president, the party that loses the White House in the previous year has usually won the gubernatorial races in both New Jersey and Virginia.In Virginia that pattern held in every election from 1977 (when Republican John Dalton prevailed a year after Jimmy Carter's election) through 2009 (when Republican Bob McDonnell triumphed a year after Barack Obama's).Democrat Terry McAuliffe broke the mold in 2013, by narrowly winning the governorship the year after Obama's reelection.In New Jersey the pattern started later, but in every election since 1989, the party out of the White House has captured the governorship.Exit polls in both states have found a close relationship between attitudes toward the incumbent president and the vote in the governor's race.That's been especially true among those who disapprove of the president.In 2009, about 9 in 10 of the voters who disapproved of Obama voted for McDonnell in Virginia and GOP nominee Chris Christie in New Jersey, powering their victories.In 2013, Christie again won 84% of Obama disapprovers, but Ken Cuccinelli, the polarizing GOP nominee in Virginia, only carried 81% of voters who disapproved of the president.Even though a narrow majority of Virginia voters disapproved of Obama, McAuliffe won because he captured a greater share of the approvers (91% ) than Cuccinelli did of the disapprovers.Given that surveys have consistently shown Trump's approval rating below 40% in both states, Gillespie and Guadagno must replicate McAuliffe's equation to prevail: they will need to win a higher percentage among Trump approvers than they lose among disapprovers.The challenge is that in both states Trump's disapproval rating among voters is likely to be much higher than Obama's was in 2013, leaving the GOP nominees less room for error.Gillespie has followed a distinctive strategy of keeping his distance from Trump personally (the President hasn't campaigned in the state) while embracing several of his key themes, for instance on immigration.If that allows Gillespie to suppress his deficit among voters who disapprove of Trump, he may offer a roadmap to other Republicans running in places dubious of the President.Who votes?Both states have exemplified the modern Democratic challenge of relying on an electoral coalition that turns out much more in presidential than off-year elections.Against that backdrop, the contests will provide an important early signal on one of the key questions for 2018: whether the Democratic base's intense antipathy toward Trump is enough to reverse that fall-off.In all key groups, turnout has been lower for these gubernatorial races than it is for the previous year's presidential contest.But the decline usually has been disproportionately greater among the core Democratic groups of young people and minorities, producing an electorate in both states that is whiter and more Republican than in the presidential year.One reason McAuliffe won is because he minimized that fall-off; Northam must match him.Population growth in Virginia since 2013 has continued to strengthen the groups and places where Democrats are strongest.But Democrats are nervous that Gillespie may inspire a turnout surge among Trump's core constituency of older, blue-collar and non-urban whites with his racially provocative campaign -- which has included a full-throated endorsement of preserving Confederate monuments and unrelenting attacks on "sanctuary cities" and the Central American gang MS-13.One gauge to watch is how close the minority share of the vote in Virginia comes to reaching about 30% (it hit just under that in 2013 and just over in 2016) -- or whether a combination of depressed turnout among non-whites and elevated turnout among whites significantly reduces that number.Another key benchmark will be whether the affluent Democratic-leaning Northern Virginia suburbs come close to matching the nearly 35% of the statewide vote they cast in 2016-or whether a big rural turnout significantly shrinks that number.Both sides consider it a given that the youth share of the vote will tumble compared to 2016 and the electorate will skew older, which helps Republicans.Does the class realignment continue?Another critical dynamic in Virginia will be how much the Trump factor -- and Gillespie's turn toward Trump-like themes -- accelerates the shift in partisan allegiances between blue-collar and white-collar whites, what I've called the class inversion.As in most states, Republicans now consistently post crushing advantages among Virginia whites without a college degree: Trump in 2016, Gillespie in his narrow 2014 Senate race defeat against Democrat Mark Warner, Cuccinelli in 2013, presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, and McDonnell in 2009, all carried about 70% or more of them.Gillespie needs to equal, if not exceed, that.But, given the state's substantial minority population, that's not enough for Republicans to win, if Democrats can remain competitive among whites holding at least a four-year college degree, who tend toward more liberal views on cultural and racial issues than their blue-collar counterparts.Obama in 2012, McAuliffe in 2013, Warner in 2014, and Hillary Clinton in 2016, all carried between 42-45% of Virginia's college-educated whites, per exit polls.In each case, that was enough to win.If Northam matches that range among well-educated whites, he'll likely win too (absent a huge turnout shift toward blue-collar and rural areas).If Northam exceeds that range, it will be a warning shot that Trump's unpopularity with those voters is weighing on other Republicans-an ominous message for the House Republicans who will be defending white-collar districts next year.It would also provide insights on the next question both sides will be asking after Virginia.Did the immigration issue help or hurt Gillespie?Northam ran a bland, mostly forgettable campaign, but Gillespie planted a stake by igniting Trump-style cultural confrontations over Confederate monuments and especially "sanctuary cities."Whether Gillespie wins or loses, analysts in both parties believe other Republicans are likely to reprise his attacks next year because they have clearly shaken Northam.Already, Guadagno has stressed the issue in the campaign's final weeks.Both sides will be watching whether Gillespie's arguments help him turn out the Trump constituency-and whether, in a backlash, they provoke larger turnout and/or bigger margins than usual for Democrats akmong non-white voters.Gillespie's campaign insists the "sanctuary city" arguments are also helping him with suburban swing voters anxious about crime, while the Northam campaign says the attacks' racial edge have alienated those voters.The answer has big implications for 2018, and both sides will be combing the Virginia results for clues -- particularly the results among college-educated whites and in the DC exurbs-about who's right.Do the usual guideposts apply?In each state, political professionals have key yardsticks they will be watching for early clues to the results.In New Jersey, Michael DuHaime, the chief political strategist for Christie's two gubernatorial victories, points to two signposts.The first is whether Guadagno amasses a bigger combined margin in the GOP's best two large counties, Ocean and Monmouth, than Murphy does in the Democrats' best two, Essex (which includes Newark) and Hudson (which includes Jersey City).The second is whether Guadagno can break through in at least some of the counties that touch the New Jersey turnpike, from Salem and Gloucester in the south to Hudson and Bergen in the North."When Republicans win, they pick off a few," DuHaime says.Bergen is worth its own look.The state's largest county, it has evolved from red to blue behind the familiar suburban formula of growing racial diversity and cultural disaffection between the GOP and white-collar whites.A big win for Murphy there would offer another sign of suburban discontent with the Trump-era GOP.In Virginia, many political experts zero in on two counties.Chesterfield County, just south of Richmond, historically has favored Republicans, but Trump significantly underperformed there.If Gillespie wobbles there too, it will offer an indication of suburban backlash against his embrace of Trump-like themes.Another marker is well-educated Loudon County in the Washington DC exurbs.Gillespie narrowly carried it in 2014, but Clinton trounced Trump there.Gillespie can't afford that.Given how few voters appear persuadable in this race, turnout in the base counties may be more important than the tilt of the swing counties."Virginia is not a two-party state: It is two one-party states," says Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia."Republicans roll up the margins in the rural areas; Democrats roll up the margins in the cities."Republicans are looking for big numbers from the mostly smaller places along the Interstate 81 corridor that runs through the state's western edge.Democrats are banking on high Northern Virginia turnout in Alexandria, Arlington and above all Fairfax County, which cast about 300,000 votes in the McAuliffe and Warner victories, but over 550,000 ballots in the 2016 presidential race."If it starts going more to the proportions you see more in a presidential election...[when] you look at the number of votes they get out of a place like Fairfax County and Arlington it's tough to keep up with that," acknowledges one top GOP strategist.What happens down the ballot?Beyond the gubernatorial race, political pros are also watching the Virginia House of Delegates races.That's not because Democrats have a chance of capturing the heavily gerrymandered chamber (Republicans now hold 66 of its 100 seats) but for further indications of whether Trump is hurting the GOP in suburbia.The University of Virginia's Geoffrey Skelley, associate editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, says the test of a good night for Democrats is whether they net more than the four delegate seats they gained in 2007, their best recent showing.Most of the Democratic opportunities are concentrated in Northern Virginia suburbs and exurbs where Trump has been unpopular and Democrats are energized in opposition to him.These state legislative races will test whether Democratic candidates can convert those dynamics into actual victories on Election Day.And, for 2018, no question looms larger than that.
Phil Murphy elected New Jersey governor:::::(CNN) Democratic nominee Phil Murphy will win the New Jersey governor race, CNN projects.Murphy's victory over Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno shifts control of the governor's seat to Democratic hands following eight years of Republican rule under the tenure of Gov.Chris Christie.It also means that should Sen. Bob Menendez leave office next year, he would be replaced by a Democrat, maintaining the current balance in the US Senate.Christie, a once-popular Republican in the blue state of New Jersey, has seen his popularity decline sharply over the years, as the Bridgegate scandal and his embrace of President Donald Trump weighed on New Jersey voters.Quinnipiac University polls taken over the past several months peg Christie's approval rating regularly in the mid to low teens.Guadagno has sought to distance herself from Christie's toxic image in the state, but as his lieutenant governor, she failed to sway voters, who Quinnipiac showed gave her low marks as well.New Jersey holds its elections in off years, meaning the year after the nation elects its president, the voters of the Garden State must return to the polls to choose their governor.Over the past several cycles, these elections have delivered governors from the opposite party of the President.Read More

Trump attempted to go to DMZ but had to turn back because of weather:::::Story highlights Trump was frustrated and disappointed, Sanders said The White House had previously said Trump was not going to visit the DMZ Seoul (CNN) President Donald Trump attempted to make an unannounced visit to the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea on Wednesday morning, but was forced to turn back because of bad weather.Trump was aboard Marine One en route to the DMZ but was grounded after about 18 minutes of flight.South Korean President Moon Jae-in was scheduled to join Trump at the DMZ in a show of unity, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday morning.The joint visit would have been the first for a US and South Korean President at the DMZ, Sanders said, calling it a "historic moment.""The effort shows the strong and importance of the alliance between the two countries," Sanders said.Trump was disappointed and frustrated by the failed attempt, Sanders told reporters, adding that the trip had been quietly planned before Trump left Washington for his trip through Asia.Read More
CIA director met with DNC hack conspiracy theorist at Trump's urging:::::(CNN) CIA Director Mike Pompeo recently met -- at the urging of President Donald Trump -- with one of the principal deniers of Russian interference in the US election, according to multiple intelligence sources.Trump apparently made the highly unusual request that Pompeo meet with the former National Security Agency employee and look into a theory that the leak of Democratic Party emails last year was an inside job rather than a cyberattack by Russian hackers.William Binney, the former NSA employee-turned-whistleblower who circulated the conspiracy theory, confirmed to CNN that he met with Pompeo for about an hour on October 24 -- despite the fact the intelligence community concluded early this year that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.The CIA responded to CNN's inquiry about the meeting by saying that Pompeo "stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 intelligence community assessment" that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.Read More
De Blasio poised to score big victory for New York City progressives:::::(CNN) For the first time in more than three decades, New York City, a national liberal stronghold that historically balks at ideological leadership inside its own narrow borders, is expected to re-elect a Democratic mayor -- one with unabashed progressive politics and an eye on Washington.Mayor Bill de Blasio is poised to rewrite recent history despite having operated under near constant assault from the city's boisterous tabloid newspapers, while doing little himself to smooth over sometimes testy relations with eye-rolling New Yorkers.De Blasio shocked the city's political elite when he won the Democratic primary in 2013 and is poised now to lock up a second term after running a campaign without a serious challenge from anyone inside his own party or, in this fall's general election, city Republicans, who all but ceded the race.For progressives in the Trump era, de Blasio's success -- an October poll showed him with a 44-point lead over his GOP rival -- represents new evidence to back an argument that ambitious, broad-based economic reforms can win over political skeptics and break through a wall of criticism from even the scrappiest of press corps -- a group de Blasio has made little effort to pacify."The tabloids are entertainment with a very small dose of news," de Blasio told CNN through a spokesman on Tuesday."New Yorkers' political views are shaped much more dramatically by what they are feeling in their lives.They'll trust their own experience when it comes to universal pre-K, neighborhood safety, school improvement and what I'm doing to keep their apartment affordable.They strain out the entertainment when push comes to shove."And there has been plenty of the latter -- the sideshow amusements and screeching tabloid recriminations -- during his nearly four years on the job."They're always going to try and find something to just blow up and make bigger, but at the end of the day, when you look at the substance of de Blasio as mayor, and you look at the policies he's enacted, he's done a great deal to make this a more equitable city," said Rebecca Katz, a former top aide and adviser."New Yorkers don't need a mayor who is warm and fuzzy, they need a mayor who will make their lives better."On that front, de Blasio scores high -- or even up -- with a diverse assortment of constituencies.Perhaps most surprising is the evolution of his relationship with the city's police, a fraught one that threatened to derail his mayoralty in its first year.After two officers were shot and killed while sitting in their patrol car in December 2014, hundreds of police turned their backs on de Blasio at the slain officers' memorial services.De Blasio's open discussion of a warning he'd given his biracial son, telling him to be especially cautious if he were stopped by police, along with past criticism of controversial practices like "stop and frisk" and long-running labor angst all fed what seemed like a doomed alliance.But those concerns, a few notable blips aside, have mostly drifted into the background.In early 2017, he agreed to a new contract with the largest police union, which had been working without one for years.As election season approached, the union chose not to make an endorsement -- which many scored as a political win for the mayor."Had they endorsed (Republican challenger) Nicole Malliotakis, it definitely would have been embarrassing," Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, said on Monday."But then again, he's given the police a lot.They asked for a few hundred more police, he gave them a thousand.They're supposed to do this (implicit bias) training, it hasn't begun yet.He promoted Jimmy O'Neill, who is widely respected among the rank-and-file."In the meantime, controversial tactics like "stop and frisk" are all but gone and crime has continued to plummet.In an op-ed published this week, former police commissioner Bill Bratton called the combined work of the mayor and police a "New York City miracle."De Blasio's most prominent political success, though, came in delivering on his most deeply progressive campaign promise from 2013, a pledge to bring universal pre-kindergarten for four-year-olds.The budget deal, struck with Democratic Gov.Andrew Cuomo, delivered nearly $350 million in funds for the program.There is talk now of expanding it to include three-year-olds."It's about kids," said the Working Families Party New York state director Bill Lipton, explaining the popularity of the program."Lots of people understand that the science is on it is really solid and people support government when they believe are effective.People know the data on this.And the rollout was universally applauded.It demonstrated competence."Greer, a past critic of the mayor, said de Blasio's delivery of pre-K scored him points across class and race lines."We know that it's helped working class New Yorkers, but I think it's also helped a lot of middle class New Yorkers stay in the city," she told CNN."This helps a lot of two-income, middle class families that are making a good amount of money but might have either a new home or larger rental responsibilities or school loans" and who might otherwise have considered leaving the city for cheaper real estate.The mechanics of the program, which by definition is "universal" and not targeted or means-tested, and its underlying ideology puts de Blasio in near political lockstep with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed the mayor and campaigned with him here last week."This mayor is leading the city in a way to bring us together to create a better life for all of our people," Sanders said during an October 30 event."Everything that Mayor de Blasio is trying to do is exactly the opposite of what (President) Donald Trump is trying to do."De Blasio saluted right back, holding up Sanders as a progressive icon -- one destined, as he put it, for greater glories still."That day is going to come and when it comes you are all going to look back and say, who started this, who started the ball rolling, who started this movement, who planted the seed who gave us the hope, who showed us the way," de Blasio said."Ladies and gentlemen, Bernie Sanders."Asked about his own future plans, de Blasio was predictably coy."I'm entirely focused on being mayor of the greatest city in the world," he said on Tuesday afternoon.Barring a massive upset later tonight, he'll have four more years to prove it.
Chief of staff to congresswoman placed on leave following sexual harassment claims:::::Story highlights Rep. Brenda Lawrence wrote proposed legislation on sexual harassment Unidentified former employees have accused her chief of staff of harassment (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence has placed her chief of staff on administrative leave following accusations of sexual harassment by former staffers in her office."It is unfortunate that I am just learning of these allegations by unidentified former employees for the first time," Lawrence said Tuesday in a statement to CNN."My office will nonetheless take all necessary steps to root out and address any inappropriate behavior."On Tuesday, Politico published allegations made against Lawrence's chief of staff, Duron Marshall , with accounts from three former female staffers about his treatment of women within the office.In a statement provided to Politico, Marshall denied the allegations, saying he has "never had any kind of complaint filed against me nor have I ever sexually harassed anyone!"CNN has reached out to Marshall for comment and has not yet received a response.Lawrence in a statement Tuesday says there were occasions where employees brought workplace concerns to her attention, but she was not aware of allegations of sexual harassment."Had I been made aware of any concerns about sexual harassment in my office, those concerns would have been promptly investigated and appropriate disciplinary action taken, including termination of employment of any individual engaged in sexually harassing behavior," she said.Read More
Source explains why Comey didn't use 'grossly negligent' to describe Clinton:::::(CNN) Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has taken interest in why an early draft of a memo by then-FBI Director James Comey described the behavior of Hillary Clinton as "grossly negligent" for her handling of classified information, though Comey in his July 5, 2016 public statement didn't use that term.A source familiar with the FBI decision tells CNN that Comey and his FBI colleagues were "playing with the language throughout" the process, but consistently held the belief that they needed to condemn Clinton's handling of classified information while asserting they would not bring charges.Instead, Comey ended up criticizing Clinton's conduct as "extremely careless," but said no reasonable prosecutor would pursue charges based on the evidence."Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information," Comey said in July.JUST WATCHED FBI director: Clinton 'extremely careless' with emails Replay More Videos ...

Mike Rogers separately interviewed with special counsel Robert Muellers team.Multiple sources familiar with their accounts said they told investigators that some of their interactions with President Donald Trump were odd and uncomfortable, but that they did not believe he ordered them to interfere with the FBI investigation.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Private interview + Special counsel Robert Mueller's team interviewed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in June or July, according to The Wall Street Journal.Rosenstein was interviewed about his role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey.Trump and his allies initially said Comey was fired because of a memo Rosenstein wrote describing Comeys poor job performance, but President Donald Trump later acknowledged that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteins recommendation.Rosenstein was interviewed as a witness in an investigation that he is also overseeing, due to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Former British spy Christopher Steele Private meeting + CNN first reported that special counsel Robert Mueller's team met this summer with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote a series of memos known as the dossier, which alleged widespread collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.US investigators have corroborated some aspects of the dossier, specifically that some of the communications among foreign nationals mentioned in the memos did actually take place.President Donald Trump dismissed the memo as totally made-up stuff.Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin Private interview + Special counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin to testify before a grand jury, according to a report from Hurriyet, the largest newspaper in Turkey.Former national security adviser Michael Flynns lobbying firm was paid $530,000 to represent Alptekin during the final months of the U.S. presidential campaign.After Flynn resigned from his White House job, he retroactively registered as a foreign agent for Turkey for the work he did on behalf of Alptekin.Business associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn Grand jury subpoenas + Federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to some of former national security adviser Michael Flynns recent business associates.Investigators were looking into possible wrongdoing in how Flynn handled disclosures related to payments from clients tied to foreign governments including Russia and Turkey.Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page Questioning by FBI agents + Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page says he was questioned by FBI agents in March as part of the investigation into Russian meddling.He was interviewed on five occasions, the Washington Post reported.Page said many of the questions were about allegations contained in a dossier written by a former British spy that claimed Page was involved in an effort to collude with Russia to elect President Donald Trump.Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos Questioning by FBI agents + FBI agents conducted their second interview with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.He said he wanted to cooperate in the investigation, but shortly after the interview, Papadopoulos deleted social media accounts that had evidence of his election-year contacts with Russians and people connected to the Russian government.Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos Questioning by FBI agents + FBI agents interviewed Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.He made false statements during the interview, according to court filings.He admitted meeting a professor in London who told him that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails.But he falsely claimed multiple times that he got the information before joining the campaign, according to court filings.Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manaforts storage unit Search under FISA warrant + As part of the court-approved surveillance on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the FBI investigators conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort, CNN reported.It is not known what they found.Regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Grand jury subpoenas + Multiple grand jury subpoenas and records requests relating to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort were issued as part of then-FBI Director James Comeys investigation into Russian meddling, according to NBC News.They were served in the six months before Comey was fired.Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort FISA warrant + The FBI investigation into Russian meddling started in July 2016.As part of that probe, the FBI asked the secretive court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to authorize surveillance of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, CNN reported.The Wall Street Journal reported that the surveillance began after Manafort left the Trump campaign in mid-August 2016.
Feds have eye on cybersecurity issues Tuesday:::::Story highlights Experts do not believe any interference with actual voting occurred last year Virginia and New Jersey have high-profile gubernatorial races Tuesday Washington (CNN) As voters head to the polls on Tuesday, state and local officials are working with the federal government to monitor any potential cybersecurity issues on the first major Election Day since the 2016 election.While experts do not believe any interference with actual voting occurred last year, Russian efforts to meddle in the election -- in part through hacking emails and some probing of election-related systems at the state level -- have fueled a national conversation about the cybersecurity of elections.The Department of Homeland Security has taken the lead for the federal government in helping shore up election systems, which are managed at the state and local level."We are working closely with officials in Virginia and New Jersey and other states and will have cybersecurity advisers embedded with state officials and with direct lines to DHS' National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center throughout the day today," spokesman Scott McConnell told CNN in an email."We continue to offer state and local governments our cybersecurity services, including cyber hygiene scans of Internet-facing systems and onsite risk and vulnerability assessments. "Virginia and New Jersey have high-profile gubernatorial elections, but voters across the country are casting ballots in other state and local races.Read More
The mayoral races you'll want to watch:::::Washington (CNN) This Tuesday is an off-year election , where the energy is focused in a grab bag of state and local races.Much of that attention centers on the marquee gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as New York City's mayoral race, where incumbent Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to receive a second term.But Tuesday also marks major decisions for voters in cities around the country, with fiercely fought mayoral races nearing their ends.Here are a few to watch (this story will update as results come in): Atlanta Democratic Mayor Kasim Reed is approaching the term-limited end of his time as Atlanta mayor, and that exit brings one of the most contested mayoral races in the country.Reed has endorsed Democrat Keisha Lance Bottoms.Bottoms leads the pack in the latest round of polling alongside Mary Norwood, who is not identify with a party.The Atlanta mayoral race, like many mayoral races, is technically nonpartisan position.The two face a crowded field, which includes State Sen. Vincent Fort.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigned for Fort and extended fundraising support to the candidate, and the race could be an opportunity for Sanders -- whose presidential candidacy failed to win over the south -- to expand his movement.Tuesday night is all but guaranteed, however, not to be the end of the mayoral race.Georgia utilizes a majority rule with a runoff system, so if no candidate emerges with more than 50% of the vote -- as is expected -- then the top two candidates will face off in December.Boston Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh, the incumbent, faces Tito Jackson, a nonpartisan member of the Boston city council.If elected, Jackson would be the city's first black mayor .Jackson is campaigning against Walsh on a range of issues, including policing and racial inequality.Charlotte The Democratic incumbent, Mayor Jennifer Roberts, lost in the primary, which means voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, face a new slate of candidates.Councilwoman Vi Lyles, the Democrat who defeated Roberts, faces Republican Councilman Kenny Smith.The winner of Tuesday's contest, be it Lyles or Smith, will be the seventh new mayor Charlotte has had since 2009.Cincinnati The putatively nonpartisan race pits Democrat against Democrat.Mayor John Cranley seeks a second term and faces off against Cincinnati City Council member Yvette Simpson.One of the more notable points on the race: the eye-popping funding totals.By Cincinnati.com's total, the candidates for mayor and city council raised more than $5 million, with about half of that coming from the sitting mayor's war chest.Cleveland Tuesday will see Mayor Frank Jackson face City Councilman Zack Reed to determine if Jackson nets a fourth term in the northeastern Ohio city.Detroit Like Cleveland, Detroit's election on Tuesday has a Midwestern mayor seeking re-election.Mayor Mike Duggan faces State Senator Coleman Young after the two emerged from the August primary.In the August election , Duggan got almost 68% of the vote to Young's nearly 27% in a field of eight candidates.Duggan enjoys support from former Vice President Joe Biden, and the sitting mayor said in an interview with Politico that he'd chair a Biden 2020 presidential bid if the former vice president were game.Miami Mayor Toms Regalado is term-limited from seeking re-election, and those vying to replace him are: Francis Suarez, William Armbrister, Christian Canache and Cynthia Mason Jaquith.The Miami Herald identified Suarez as the favorite and pointed to Suarez's opposition as limited to unfunded candidates.Miami's politics are unique, with a sizable Cuban population and key role in statewide races giving it outsize influence.St. Petersburg On the other side of Florida sits St. Petersburg, where the city's mayor has received national backing for his re-election bid.Democratic Mayor Rick Kriseman faces Republican Rick Baker.Politico reported in August that given the closeness of the race, former President Barack Obama was endorsing Kriseman.Former Vice President Joe Biden added on, backing Kriseman and recording a robocall, according to the Tampa Bay Times Seattle A scandal rocked the Seattle mayor's office and left the field wide open.Mayor Ed Murray announced in May he would not seek re-election as he denied sexual abuse allegations against him.Murray resigned in the wake of another allegation in September, when his own cousin went forward saying Murray had abused him while the cousin was a teenager.The disturbing revelations mean Tuesday will be a face-off between Jenny Durkan and Cary Moon.In the crowded August primary, Durkan took 27.9% of the vote to Moon's 17.6%.Minneapolis This city does things a bit differently than most.It utilizes a system known as ranked-choice voting, where instead of choosing one candidate and having a potential runoff election, voters rank the candidates from most preferred to least.The system can encourage support for third-party candidates and make a crowded election more practical.Mayor Betsy Hodges is seeking re-election and faces more than a dozen people.One of the candidates is listed on the ballot as Captain Jack Sparrow.St. Paul The twin city to Minneapolis -- St. Paul -- will also hold its mayoral election on Tuesday.Mayor Chris Coleman is running for governor of Minnesota, leaving the race open.In late October, a mailer from a political group linked to the police and local business drew a questionable line from the theft of candidate Melvin Carter's guns, implying without evidence that Carter was responsible for gun violence in the city due to the theft.Criticism of the mailer led the political group to shutter its operations, and the St. Paul Pioneer Press wrote that the incident "blew up" the mayoral race.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson is seeking his fourth term.
Christie confronted at the polls in New Jersey:::::Story highlights Christie and his record-low approval ratings hover mightily over the contest to replace him.Christie's penchant for confrontation has helped define his tenure as New Jersey's chief executive Washington (CNN) In his final Election Day as New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie added another on-camera upbraiding to his legacy as a politician with a proclivity for punching back.New York Times reporter Nick Corasaniti filmed the former Republican presidential candidate speaking to the press after casting his vote.Christie was asked by a passerby why he didn't merge a township and a borough during his eight years in office."Well, as governor, I can't.I can't.I don't have the authority to do it," he said with his wife, Mary Pat, smiling behind him.After voting, Christie got into a bit of an argument with a voter who questioned why he didn't merge His two towns pic.twitter.com/n3AQi3PfBk Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017 "Go in and vote for whoever you want.I never said I was going to merge the two towns," he continued."You want to merge Mendham township and Mendham borough, run for the township committee," said Christie, who resides in the township."No, I know, 'cause that's too hard.It's easier to sit here and complain."Read More
President Trump dismisses question on extreme vetting for gun ownership:::::Story highlights "There would have been no difference three days ago," Trump said Trump said Monday the shooting was caused by a "mental health problem" Seoul (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday "there would have been no difference three days ago" in the deadly Texas shooting if an extreme vetting policy for gun ownership had been in place."If you did what you're suggesting there would have been no difference three days ago, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun in his truck and shoot him, and hit him and neutralize him," Trump said responding to a question during a joint news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in."Instead of having 26 dead he would've had hundreds more dead," Trump said.Trump has called for "extreme vetting" of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries in response to terrorist incidents.But he has resisted any action on gun laws in response to the deadly mass shootings that have occurred during his time in office.Trump added that "the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago.And Chicago is a disaster.A total disaster."Read More
Are Democrats blowing it in Virginia?:::::(CNN) For months, the assumption has been that Ralph Northam would be elected Virginia governor on Tuesday night.Now, with just hours remaining before polls open in the commonwealth, the race suddenly looks like a toss-up between Northam, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie."It's hard to imagine a statewide candidate who was in the lead with three weeks left who has had a worse close to their campaign," said Glen Bolger, a GOP pollster who has worked extensively in Virginia.And, by any objective measure, it's hard to argue with Bolger's assessment.Northam absolutely botched his position on sanctuary cities in the closing weeks of the race -- insisting that despite his vote to kill a bill in the state Senate that would ban sanctuary cities (even though Virginia doesn't have any!), he actually would have voted in support of the legislation he killed if Virginia did have any sanctuary cities.Uh, OK. Then there are the other intangibles in the race working against Northam.Northam is not the fierce anti-Trump liberal that many Democratic activists in the state want.That candidate was former Rep. Tom Perriello, who lost to Northam in a primary earlier this year.Northam is also from a part of the state --the eastern shore -- that is not terribly populated or a traditional source of statewide Democratic candidates."He is running a campaign that is true to him," said one Democratic pollster who has worked in the state for decades."Mainstream, practical, continue Virginia's progress."Northam simply can't sell as a hard-line and aggressive anti-Trumper, the source argues, so he's been smart not to try.The Democratic source also noted that Gillespie has shown an ability to close strong -- he came from nowhere to lose to Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, by just 18,000 votes in 2014.Plus, when Democrats have won the Virginia governorship (in 2001, 2005 and 2013) the races have been close (five points, six points and three points, respectively).The problem for Northam in this race might well be expectations.Heading into this year, many Democrats viewed a win here as a no-brainer.Virginia has been transformed over the last decade from a reliably Republican state to a Democratic-leaning one; President Barack Obama carried it twice, Hillary Clinton won it by six points in 2016 and Democrats control the governorship and both US Senate seats.Trump is not terribly popular in the state -- especially in the highly populated northern Virginia suburbs that encircle DC.A look at the aggregate of the polling -- and there's been lots of it -- done in the last week or so of this race shows Northam ahead, but by less than some people expected.According to Real Clear Politics' poll of polls , Northam now has, on average, a lead of just over three points on Gillespie.Yes, that's down from the six-and-a-half point edge he held at this time last month.But given the disastrously bad closing week of the race for Northam, the fact he is still ahead at all is somewhat remarkable -- and may speak to the durability of his advantage.Here's the thing: Excuses aside, if Northam loses the governor's race in Virginia tomorrow, it will set off a panicked blame game not just in the state but nationally, as liberals will insist that Perriello would have won had the party nominated him.(In that, it will echo the debate over whether Clinton or Bernie Sanders would have been the better nominee against Trump -- a fight still happening within the Democratic Party despite the fact that the election ended almost a year ago.)Given all of that, there's a tremendous amount riding on Northam on Tuesday night.Can he find a way to win even after enduring such a bad final month?And if he can't, what (if anything!)should we conclude about the state of the Democratic Party in Virginia and nationally?
Syria seeks to join Paris Climate Agreement, leaving US as the only non-member:::::Washington (CNN) The United States is now a party of one in its stance on climate change.Syria will join the Paris climate agreement, leaving the US as the only country in the world not signed on to the landmark climate deal.Syrian officials announced their intention to ratify the accord at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP23) in Bonn, Germany, on Tuesday."I confirm that the Syrian Arab Republic supports the implementation of Paris climate change accord, in order to achieve the desired global goals and to reflect the principles of justice and shared responsibility, but in accordance with the capabilities of each of the signatories," Syria's Deputy Minister of Local Administration and Environment M. Wadah Katmawi said.Katmawi added that developed countries, "in their capacity as the primary contributors to climate change, should live up to their legal and humanitarian responsibility" by offering technical and financial support to developing countries to help battle climate change.
5 questions for Tuesday's elections in Virginia, New Jersey:::::Washington (CNN) Can Republicans win tough races by getting close -- but not too close -- to President Donald Trump , adopting his tactics without actually campaigning with him?Can Democrats win swing states by criticizing Trump, but not too much -- pledging to work with the President when possible?The Virginia and New Jersey governor's races -- a year after every presidential election -- are always seen as a test of how voters perceive the sitting President.This year, Virginia, in particular, looks like a strong gauge of Trump's performance -- and a proving ground for the strategies both parties hope will work in the 2018 midterm elections.Here are five big questions for Tuesday's elections: 1.Can Trump's tactics sell without Trump?Trump visited his golf course in Virginia 15 times between Gillespie winning the GOP gubernatorial primary and the general election.But he didn't once hold an event with Republican candidate in the most important race of 2017.Gillespie might not have wanted to campaign with Trump -- but he certainly borrowed heavily from Trump's tactics and signature issues.Long known as an advocate for a bigger Republican tent and more inclusive immigration policies, Gillespie has taken an alarmist turn this year.His TV ads have included striking images of MS-13 gangs displaying the words "kill, rape, control," as well as Gillespie pledging to keep Confederate monuments up, and hitting Democrats for automatically restoring the voting rights of former felons who have completed their sentences.Those culture warrior tactics were designed to make sure Trump's base turned out for Gillespie, who nearly lost the Republican primary to Corey Stewart.But they alienated a lot of Gillespie's old friends.Ed Gillespie used to be the champion of diversity in GOP....now this https://t.co/3HjawnvmlE Al Cardenas (@AlCardenasFL_DC) October 30, 2017 So the last 3 ads by @EdWGillespie are: gangs, people getting their voting rights back, and monuments.The dog whistle is a little loud, Ed Doug Stafford (@dougstafford) October 26, 2017 Ed Gillespie is running one of the most vile campaigns I have seen in a long time.He really should be ashamed of himself.Norman Ornstein (@NormOrnstein) October 28, 2017 Gillespie spokesman David Abrams refuted those critiques, saying, "Ed is surging in the polls because Republicans are united behind his campaign, and because he is running on substantive policies broadly popular with the people of Virginia."The question is whether Trump voters will buy Gillespie's authenticity and turn out to vote for him -- or if they'll see Gillespie's refusal to be seen near Trump as a better reflection of his allegiances and stay home.2.Can Obama fix Democrats' off-year problems?Former President Barack Obama oversaw the atrophy of the Democratic Party at the state and local level -- a result of the party's failure to turn out its voters in non-presidential elections that led to losing about 1,000 state legislative seats.Now that he's out of office, Obama is trying to convince Democratic voters that these races really do matter."Off-year elections, midterm elections -- Democrats sometimes, y'all get a little sleepy.You get a little complacent," Obama said during a rally with Northam in Richmond last month."And so as a consequence, folks wake up and they're surprised -- 'How come we can't get things through Congress?How come we can't get things through the state house?'" Obama said."Because you slept through the election."In particular, Northam's campaign has been laser focused on turning out black voters.Those black voters make up about 20% of Virginia's electorate and tend to vote strongly Democratic.It's why his event with Obama was in Richmond, a city with a sizeable African-American population.And make no mistake, Obama himself could be the most important salesman here.If his involvement in Northam's campaign can boost turnout, Democrats across the 2018 midterm map would see him as a potential game-changer.3.Will progressive groups' ground troops lead to turnout?Outside groups are playing a big role in Northam's campaign -- supplying digital advertising reinforcements for a candidate who has only aired TV ads as well as ground troops who have made calls and knocked on doors for weeks.Perhaps the leader of those groups is Planned Parenthood, which has a lot on the line -- not just in the governor's race, but for lieutenant governor, where Democrat Justin Fairfax faces Republican Jill Holtzman Vogel.The Republican is known for having sponsored a 2012 bill that would have required women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds -- which Planned Parenthood vehemently opposed.Other Democratic groups have bickered about Virginia since Northam defeated former Rep. Tom Perriello in the gubernatorial primary.That split was on vivid display last week when Democracy For America announced it wouldn't back Northam's "racist" campaign while making calls for other Democratic candidates.But a share of the credit for wins in statewide and even state assembly contests would go to Planned Parenthood, which announced in August it would spend $3 million to help Northam.4.Will there be a shocker?The reason so much focus is on Virginia is that Tuesday's other big contests all feature heavy favorites.But close elections have a way of sneaking up on people.In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and US ambassador to Germany, is expected to cruise past Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno.That's in large part because of the Chris Christie factor: The outgoing Republican governor's approval rating is in the teens, making him the least popular governor in America.And while Guadagno has tried to create some distance -- hitting Christie after he was photographed on a closed beach during a state government shutdown -- she's still Christie's No.2.In New York City, mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and is looking to build his status with progressive voters even outside the city.If any of these contests tighten up, it'd set off alarms across both parties nationally.5.Can Democrats take full control in Washington state?One down-ballot race to watch: a state senate contest in Washington.If Democrat Manka Dhingra defeats Republican Jinyoung Lee Englund, control of the senate would tip into Democratic hands.Democrats already control the state house and governor's office -- which means a win in that race would give them the "trifecta": unified control of Washington's government.This is incredibly important.Right now, Republicans have that "trifecta" in 26 states, which gives them broad authority not just over laws and budgets, but the redistricting process every 10 years.Democrats, though, only have such control in six states -- California, Oregon, Hawaii, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island.It's perhaps the most vivid example of the party's collapse during Obama's tenure, and an imbalance that reflects Democrats' broad structural disadvantages.Full party control matters.In many states where Republicans are in charge, their lawmakers have passed right-to-work laws and voter ID laws, and handle the once-a-decade redistricting process alone.The more those structural advantages are locked in, the harder it is for Democrats to regain what they've lost.
Top White House aides to sell Senate Dems on tax reform:::::(CNN) Two top Trump administration officials will head to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to sell Senate Democrats on President Donald Trump's tax plan, multiple sources with knowledge of the meeting tell CNN.The meeting with Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, and Marc Short, Trump's director of legislative affairs, is a signal that the Trump administration believes they may need Democrats to pass Trump's top legislative agenda.Short confirmed the meeting to CNN, adding that the Tuesday gathering is "not the first time" the White House has met with Democrats on tax reform.Tax reform, Short said, will be the "entire purpose of the meeting."The meeting was organized, according to two sources with knowledge of the gathering, by Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who has shown a willingness to work with the Trump administration on tax reform.Read More

Donald Trump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, puts on a bomber jacket that he received from US forces in Tokyo on Sunday, November 5.President Donald Trump is on a high-stakes trip that will take him through five Asian nations Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines over 13 days.It is his longest foreign trip as President, and it is the longest Asian trip for a US President since George H.W.Bush in 1992.Much of the trip will focus on rallying regional powers to pressure North Korea into abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.North Korea has stepped up its provocations since Trump took office.Trade will also be a leading objective of the trip, according to the White House.Follow Trumps journey here, as seen through the lens of Jim Watson, a photographer who covers the White House for Agence France-Presse.Tuesday, November 7 Trump landed in South Korea, the second stop on his trip, and had lunch at Camp Humphreys with troops from both the United

showing great strength, Trump said.I think they understand we have unparalleled strength.There has never been strength like it.I do see certain movement, yes.Moon said he and Trump carried out candid talks about the North Korean issue and agreed to scale up regional deployments of military forces.Moon said the United States and South Korea must "maintain (a) strong stance toward North Koreas threats."Trump has been fiercely critical of KORUS, the free-trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, and he suggested earlier this year that he might terminate it.Trump said Tuesday

talks with Pyongyang.He said now is a time for a strengthening of sanctions.For more than 20 some years, the international community attempted dialogue with North Korea, Abe said.Now is the time not for dialogue but for applying a maximum level of pressure on North Korea.Trump declared that the era of strategic patience is over when it comes to the United States stance toward North Korea.Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong, Trump said during a joint news conference in Tokyo.But look at whats happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years.Look where we are now.Trump,

Case dropped against protester who laughed at Sessions:::::Story highlights She had been prosecuted by the DC US Attorney's Office A judge threw out a previous conviction in the case in July Washington (CNN) The Justice Department has dropped its case against a woman who laughed out loud during the confirmation hearing for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, ending months of legal wrangling.The woman, Desiree Fairooz, was protesting with Code Pink, a progressive group whose activists are regularly seen around Washington.She was arrested by a Capitol Police officer after audibly laughing during Sessions' confirmation hearing in January.But prosecutors filed a "nolle prosequi," or notice that it would no longer pursue charges, with the DC Superior Court on Monday.She had been prosecuted by the DC US Attorney's Office and had been convicted of a misdemeanor before a judge threw out the conviction in July and ordered a new trial.The government had decided to retry the case after Fairooz rejected a plea deal, and a trial date had been set for next week.Fairooz tweeted the notice was a "relief" Monday night.Read More
Trump hopes to reassure in South Korean address:::::Seoul (CNN) Near the front line of the world's tensest standoff, President Donald Trump on Wednesday will formally articulate his views of a region on edge during an address at South Korea's National Assembly.His mission inside the soaring assembly hall: convince his audience of Korean lawmakers, plus the broader region, that he's committed to preventing the type of annihilation that many fear is possible if Trump's language is misconstrued.Aides say his remarks will put the current conflict into historical context, stressing the half-century alliance between the US and South Korea while encouraging other countries in the region -- namely, China and Russia -- to step up their efforts to isolate North Korea.At no other point on his 13-day tour of Asia will Trump have a similar opportunity to lay out at length his plan to help secure American allies while also pursuing aggressive trade policies he believes will put the United States on fairer footing.Drafts of the speech have been in the works for weeks, officials say, with input from Trump's top national security aides like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R.McMaster.Trump's speechwriter Stephen Miller is accompanying the President in Asia.'Ultimately, it will all work out' During a series of public appearances in and around the South Korean capital on Tuesday, Trump defended his provocative threats toward Kim Jong Un.But he declined to repeat the type of fiery bombast which has helped ratchet up tensions here."Ultimately, it will all work out," Trump said ahead of a briefing at a US Army garrison near Seoul shortly after landing in South Korea on Tuesday."It always works out.It has to work out."Later, at a news conference alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump declined to say whether he's entirely ruled out diplomatic talks with Pyongyang, a move he'd previously derided as a waste of time.And while he again declined to rule out use of military force in countering North Korea's threats, he appeared less willing to provoke the communist regime than he has from the United States."We have many things happening that we hope -- in fact, I'll go a step further -- we hope to God we never have to use," he said.That sense of restraint hasn't always colored Trump's remarks about the North Korea crisis.Over the summer, he dramatically scaled up his threats, vowing to rain "fire and fury" on the communist regime if their provocations continue.Later, he demeaned the country's dictator at the United Nations General Assembly, terming him "rocket man" at the gathering of world leaders.Each time, Kim has responded in kind, lambasting Trump as a senile leader who was putting the world's security as risk.Since Trump assumed office, he has scaled up his country's ballistic missile launches, and conducted a massive underground nuclear test in September.Optimism In Asia this week, Trump has tamped down the bitter back-and-forth, avoiding direct insults of young and brash leader just across the border.His tame by comparison remarks have warned North Korea that the US era of "strategic patience" was over, but declined to threaten all-out war."Hopefully, something very successfully (will be) worked out on that," he said during talks with Moon on Tuesday.Moon, meanwhile, expressed optimism that Trump could help ease his country's concerns about the persistent spat with North Korea, despite his own differences with Trump's approach.Trump has accused Moon of appeasement, and scoffed at his desire to open talks with North Korea in a bid to cool tensions.Speaking Tuesday, Moon said he hoped Trump could help "relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea's provocations."
Donald Trump literally just made the 'good guy with a gun' argument:::::Washington (CNN) In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting in late 2012, a new saying became popular among gun rights advocates: "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."(The phrase is widely credited to National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre.)The logic behind the saying goes like this: In an era of mass shootings, the best (only?)defense is to be armed yourself.Shooting back at a shooter may be your only chance at living through such an incident.We need more good people with guns -- not fewer.Which brings us to Tuesday afternoon in Seoul, South Korea where President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter whether he might support "extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun" in the wake of the Texas church shooting on Sunday that left 26 people dead "You're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now.We could let a little time go by.It's OK if you feel that's an appropriate question even though we're in the heart of South Korea.I will certainly answer your question.If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him, and hit him and neutralize him.I can only say this: If he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.So that's the way I feel about it.Not going to help."
Trump strikes optimistic tone on North Korea:::::Story highlights Trump and Moon took questions at a joint news conference Trade and North Korea were the top issues Seoul (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he believes US-led international efforts to crank up the pressure on North Korea and his at-times menacing rhetoric are beginning to work.But he has declined to reprise his inflammatory words of the past -- invoking neither "fire and fury" or "rocket man" -- so far during his time in the South Korean capital.The US President did not offer any specific signs of progress, noting that his administration likes "to play our cards a little bit close to the vest."But alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in during a joint news conference, Trump said he believes the US-led coalition is "making a lot of progress.""Yes, I think we're making a lot of progress.Yes, we're showing great strength.I think they understand we have unparalleled strength.There has never been strength like it," Trump said."I do see certain movement, yes."The comments marked the first time Trump has signaled US efforts to counter the North Korean threat are yielding positive results.And while he did not signal the military option had left the table, Trump on Tuesday leaned more heavily into his hopes for a diplomatic solution rather than the issuance of threats of military action.
CNN Poll: Trump approval at new low as Russia concerns grow:::::WASHINGTON (CNN) Donald Trump's approval rating stands at its lowest point in CNN's polling as concerns about contacts between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian operatives have grown sharply in the wake of the first indictments from the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the US election.Overall, just 36% say they approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS , worse by one percentage point than Trump's previous low of 37%, reached in October.Disapproval has also reached a new high at 58%, with nearly half (48%) saying they strongly disapprove of the way the President is handling his job.More Americans than ever before express concern about contacts between suspected Russian operatives and Trump's presidential campaign.Forty-four percent say they are "very concerned" about those reports, up from just 27% saying so in July, shortly after news broke about a meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump, Jr. Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer, among others.The new poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday, following the announcement last week of indictments against Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, and his associate, Rick Gates, as well as news that a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign had pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government.Almost six in 10, 59%, say they think Trump himself knew last year that anyone associated with his campaign had contact with suspected Russian operatives, while only 35% think the then-GOP nominee did not know about those contacts.Fewer (39%) see last week's legal actions as signs of a widespread effort within the campaign to coordinate with Russia; 44% say they represent an effort to coordinate that was limited to just a few people.And with the investigation's first charges, the poll also finds broader support for a full investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the election as well as a rising share who consider such meddling a crisis.About two-thirds (64%) now say the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the US presidential election in 2016 is a serious matter that should be fully investigated, while just 32% see it as an effort to discredit Trump's presidency.That figure is down from 38% saying so in August.Just 34% approve of the way Trump is handling that investigation, 54% disapprove, though that represents an improvement since August, when 59% disapproved.Trump responded to last week's charges by taking to Twitter, writing that there was "NO COLLUSION," urging the FBI and Justice Department to look in to the Democrats and Clinton campaign, and calling the investigation a "witch hunt."The percentage who say it's a "crisis" for the United States if the Russian government did attempt to influence the outcome of the presidential election now stands at 22%, our highest read on that measure, up from 16% seeing it as that serious in April.Overall, about two-thirds consider it a crisis or major problem.The US intelligence community has said Russia tried to influence the election.There are sharp partisan divides on all things Russia, however.Republicans are far less likely than Democrats or independents to say: It's a serious matter that should be fully investigated (28% among Republicans vs. 91% among Democrats and 63% among independents) They are concerned about contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian operatives (91% among Democrats, 64% among independents and 34% among Republicans) They think that Trump knew about those contacts during the campaign (17% among Republicans, 61% among independents and 87% among Democrats) Looking ahead to future elections, there is tepid confidence at best that government, technology firms or media are doing enough to prevent foreign countries from influencing future elections.Narrow majorities say they have confidence that their local elections officials (52%) or the federal government (51%) are doing enough to prevent foreign interference, but majorities lack confidence in tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google (59%), Donald Trump (59%) or media organizations (52%) to do enough to prevent such meddling.The lack of confidence in tech companies crosses party lines, with majorities of Republicans (63%), independents (58%) and Democrats (57%) saying they have little or no confidence in Facebook, Twitter or Google to do enough to prevent interference from foreign countries, but views on Trump and the media are sharply split by party, with Republicans more apt to express confidence that Trump is doing enough (77%, vs. 11% of Democrats) and Democrats expressing greater confidence in media organizations (60% vs. 21% among Republicans).Views on Congress's work on this front are split -- 49% are not confident, 46% are.While this survey represents the lowest approval rating for Trump, he has a ways to go before reaching the lows of some other recent presidents.In CNN polling, that low-approval mark belongs to President George W. Bush, who hit 24% a couple of times in 2008.And in Gallup's all-time trend, it's President Harry Truman, who hit 22% approval in 1952.Richard Nixon was at at 24% just before he resigned.Bush bottomed out at 25% in their polling.
Here are all the places Trump is losing support:::::(CNN) A new CNN poll shows that just 36% of Americans approve of the job Donald Trump is doing, the lowest mark to date in his presidency.(That's in keeping with a number of other polls of late.)It's also a significant fade from Trump's 100-day mark -- when he stood at 44% approval in CNN data.So, where, specifically, is Trump bleeding support?I asked CNN's polling boss Jenn Agiesta that question!Here's where she pointed me.1.Indies.Unaffiliated voters are leaving Trump's side in large numbers.Back at the 100-day mark in April, Trump was at 44% approval with independents.Now?32%.Trump's numbers among partisans are broadly similar.He's at 5% approval among Democrats (vs 8% in April) and 86% approval among Republicans (vs 85% in April).Read More

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement.Page admitted he met with Russian officials and discussed the U.S. election "in general terms."He said he told special counsel Robert Mueller, who is charge of the federal investigation, that he intends to plead the Fifth Amendment.Trump Shifts From Aggressor to Negotiator on North Korea

Wallace Bennett.New York City mayoral election Incumbent Democrat Bill de Blasio is poised to sail towards re-election as the mayor of New York City, despite the fact that his approval ratings dipped to as low at 50 percent in a July 2017 poll from Quinnipiac.De Blasio did not face any major resistance in the Democratic primary over the summer, and none of his challengers in the general election appear to have made much headway in challenging him.The Republican candidate is state assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis.Trump robocall on behalf of Gillespie "I need you to vote for Ed Gillespie to be your new Governor of Virginia.If you let Ralph Northam be governor, he will be a total disaster for your state.Northam is weak on crime and weak on immigration, and as your Lieutenant Governor Northam has driven your economy right into a ditch."- robocall recorded by President Donald Trump for Ed Gillespie Race background Trumps presence hangs over the race in Virginia where he has been actively tweeting on Gillespies behalf in recent days.He weighed in on the election early this morning amid his 13-day trip to Asia.[Gillespie] will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA, Trump tweeted.MS-13 and crime will be gone.Vote today, ASAP!Though Trump has not personally campaigned for the Republican, Northams campaign has attempted to tie the president to Gillespie, banking on Trumps unpopularity in the state to help secure what would be the fourth gubernatorial victory for Democrats in the past five Virginia races.The New Jersey election has been dominated by talk of Christie, who is among the least popular governors in U.S. history, based on polls of his job approval.Murphy has argued that a Guadagnos governorship would represent a continuation of Christies tenure, while Guadagno has pointed to moments of disagreement with her boss to attempt to distance herself from the two-term governor and former Republican presidential primary candidate.Washington Post via AP, FILE Trump has been notably quiet on the race in the traditionally blue state where Murphy has led Guadagno by consistent double-digit margins in polls ranging back to the spring.Recent polls show the Democrat with a lead of between 10-15 points.Surveys of Virginia voters show a markedly closer race, with Northam outpolling Gillespie by as much as 9 percentage points in one poll, while falling within the margin of error of another.Polls close in Virginia at 7 p.m. EST and in New Jersey at 8 p.m. EST.
Exit poll analysis explores President Trump's impact on Virginia, New Jersey races:::::Exit poll results in Virginia and New Jersey this evening will explore the prime motivators of voters preferences in the two biggest-profile contests since the 2016 presidential election giving analysts a look at any impact of Donald Trumps presidency, among other factors.Phil Murphy, the former U.S. ambassador to Germany, is projected to win New Jersey's gubernatorial election, based on ABC News' analysis of the exit poll.Sweeping backlash to the deeply unpopular Chris Christie, a Republican, became a focal point of the campaign that pitted Murphy against the state's Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno.Preliminary exit poll results mark Trumps substantial unpopularity in Virginia and New Jersey alike, where analysts will seek to divine whether his troubled presidency impacts the outcome of todays gubernatorial elections.A substantial anti-Trump vote and a broad advantage on health care boosted Democrat Ralph Northam in Virginias gubernatorial race, while Republican Ed Gillespie pushed back with vast support from evangelical and working-class whites in preliminary exit poll results.With the outcome uncertain as polls closed, 33 percent of Virginia voters said they were casting their ballots to show opposition to Donald Trump, twice as many as said they were voting to show him support (17 percent).While that benefited Northam, Gillespie prevailed among those who said the president wasnt a factor.Trump had a 42 percent job approval rating, 11 points weaker than that of the incumbent Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe.Northam is his lieutenant governor.Further, half of voters expressed a favorable attitude of the Democratic Party overall, vs. 38 percent for the Republican Party.Gillespie prevailed on at least one issue in the bitter race: Virginia voters by 59-37 percent said Confederate statues in the state should be left in place, and he won by a wide margin among those who said so.He also won eight in 10 white evangelicals, who accounted for one in four voters, and nearly three-quarters of whites who dont have a college degree, a GOP mainstay.Whites overall accounted for 68 percent of voters, about the same as in the 2016 presidential race, and down from their 2013 and 2009 shares.They backed Gillespie by a 19-point margin, while Northam won nonwhites overwhelmingly.On Northams side, turnout by liberals was up sharply from previous gubernatorial contests, to 28 percent of all Virginia voters, up from 18 percent in the 2009 race and 20 percent in 2013.(It was 26 percent in 2016, when Hillary Clinton notched her only southern-state win in Virginia.)Conservatives, meanwhile, at 32 percent of voters, were slightly off their 2013 level, 36 percent, and down from their 2009 share, 40 percent of voters in the state.Also helpful to Northam: Given a list of five issues, Virginia voters by a wide margin picked health care as the top concern in their vote for governor, and they favored him by 78-21 percent over Gillespie.Other issues offered were gun policy (the two split voters who called it their top issue), and immigration, taxes and abortion, (which, combined for an adequate sample, were big for Gillespie)..There were, as expected, sharp regional differences in the state, with Northam very strong in the Washington D.C. suburbs and Hampton Roads region, Gillespie in the mountain region.The two were about even in preliminary results in central Virginia and Richmond/Southside.Virginias bitterly fought contest pits Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam, who as a state senator represented the Eastern Shore but needs broad support in the states more Democratic north, against Republican Ed Gillespie, who focused his campaign on conservative causes ranging from immigration to Confederate monuments to gun issues.VIRGINIA In early exit poll results, 60 percent of Virginia voters say Confederate monuments should be left in place, vs. 36 percent who say they should be removed Northams position).At the same time, they fracture on trust to handle race relations, with 39 percent picking only Northam, 24 percent only Gillespie, 16 percent both and 15 percent neither.Alongside Trump, the Republican Party in Virginia is broadly unpopular, with a favorability rating of just 38 percent.By contrast, the Democratic Party is seen favorably by 50 percent, and outgoing Gov.Terry McAuliffe has a 53 percent job approval rating, far better than Trumps.And as another potential boost to the incumbent party, 30 percent said the states economy is improving.(Half said its staying the same, with 20 percent saying its getting worse.)Asked the top issue in Virginia, 37 percent of voters in these preliminary results said it was health care, dwarfing the others presented: 17 percent gun policy, 14 percent taxes, 14 percent immigration and 9 percent abortion.Gun policy was one of the issues that sharply divided the candidates, and 52 percent of voters say someone in their household owns a gun.Among groups, whites account for 68 percent of voters in these preliminary results, compared with 72 percent in the 2013 governors race and 67 percent in 2016, when a higher minority turnout helped Hillary Clinton win her only Southern state.Nearly two-thirds of white voters have college degrees, potential help for Northam; non-college whites are a solidly Republican group in general.Liberals made up a larger share of the vote in these early results than in the past, 28 percent, compared with 20 percent in 2013 and 18 percent in 2009.For their part, the conservative share of the vote was 33 percent, somewhat lowered from 2013 (36 percent) and 2009 (40 percent).By party, Democrats look to have a slight advantage, accounting for 39 percent of voters, vs. 31 percent Republicans and 29 percent independents.Thats good news for them, if it holds in later data: Democrats also had an edge in turnout in 2013, when McAuliffe became governor, whereas Republicans did in 2009, when they won.Tens of millions were spent on the Virginia contest, much of it in the closing weeks.But only 7 percent of voters said they finally decided just in the last few days, 9 percent in the last week.By contrast, fully 66 percent said they decided in September or earlier.Note, these are preliminary exit poll results, and can change as additional data becomes available.NEW JERSEY The deep unpopularity of two fellow Republicans in New Jersey doomed Kim Guadagno in the states gubernatorial race: Donald Trump and Chris Christie.Just 33 percent in preliminary exit poll results said they approved of Trumps job performance.And voters by a 3-1 margin, 29 percent vs. 11 percent, said they were casting their ballot to express opposition to the president rather than support for him.Given an even split among voters who called Trump a non-issue, the presidents unpopularity was central to Democrat Phil Murphys support.Christie, for his part, received a strikingly dismal 20 percent approval rating from his states voters.And 51 percent of voters said they thought worse of Guadagno, his lieutenant governor, because of her association with him.A mere 4 percent said it made them think better of her.Critically for Murphy, Democrats and liberals turned out at their highest rates in New Jersey gubernatorial races since 1993.Democrats accounted for 44 percent of voters, vs. Republicans 28 percent.Independents, moreover, backed Murphy over Guadagno, after favoring Christie by a vast 34-point margin four years ago.Three in 10 voters cited property taxes - a frequent Guadagno talking point - as their central issue, and they backed her by a wide 64-34 percent.But even more said corruption in government was the main issue in their vote, and two in 10 picked health care - both strong issues for Murphy.Beyond Christie himself, New Jersey voters arent happy about current economic conditions under his tenure.Nearly four in 10 said the economy is getting worse, compared to fewer than two in 10 who say its getting better.(The remainder said its staying the same.)The Democratic Party is seen favorably by six in 10 New Jersey voters, twice as many as say the same of the Republican Party.In 2013, 51 percent of voters saw the Democrats favorably, vs. 38 percent for the Republicans even as Christine won.Within the party, ratings for the states two U.S. senators range vary widely, from six in 10 for Cory Booker to 35 percent for Bob Menendez, whos currently on trial on bribery charges, with closing arguments just yesterday.Among groups, Democratic and liberal turnout are at their highest in gubernatorial races since 1993 in these preliminary data, making up 45 percent and 36 percent of New Jersey voters, respectively.By contrast, just over a quarter of voters identify as Republicans; about a fifth as conservatives.Independents and moderates come in at 28 percent and 43 percent, respectively.As in Virginia, white college graduates, 43 percent, are outnumbering white non-graduates, 30 percent, in this early data.Nonwhites make up 26 percent of the vote.Of four issues presented, 35 percent selected corruption in government as their top concern in this race, followed by 30 percent for property taxes a frequent Guadagno talking point.Fewer said health care, 19 percent, or immigration, 8 percent, mattered the most in their choice.Results can change as the night progresses, so check back regularly.The exit polls are being conducted by the National Election Pool, a media consortium.Through 2016, early state exit poll results like these were adjusted to reflect pre-election polls in that state.Given the errors in some state polls, that approach has been changed starting this year.The NEP now produces an estimate of the typical error in exit polls in a given state in past years, and adjusts the new results on that basis.The adjustment will be removed as actual vote data come in.
Testy NJ Gov. Chris Christie argues with voter outside polling place:::::Outgoing New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, whose record unpopularity has become a key factor in the state's gubernatorial election, argued with a constituent this morning as he spoke with reporters outside his polling place.The fiery Republican, who logged a 15 percent approval rating in a late-October poll by Quinnipiac University, faced off with a woman who asked him why he had not used his time in office to merge the adjoining towns of Mendham Borough and Mendham Township.Christie resides in Mendham Township."Because I can't," Christie responded in the exchange, captured by a reporter for The New York Times."As governor, I can't.I don't have the authority to do it."After voting, Christie got into a bit of an argument with a voter who questioned why he didn't merge His two towns pic.twitter.com/n3AQi3PfBk Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017 New Jersey voters head to the polls today to elect Christie's replacement, choosing between Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno and Democratic former U.S.Ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy.Recent polls have shown Murphy with a consistent double-digit lead over Guadagno, whose association with Christie is frequently cited as having a negative impact on her candidacy.Christie's often testy disagreements with New Jerseyans brought widespread attention after his election in 2009.He frequently engaged in town halls across the state in which he raised his voice and scolded state residents in a fashion unusual for U.S. politicians.During his second term in office, Christie found himself embroiled in a scandal related to the politically motivated closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge, was criticized for the amount of time he spent out of state during his failed presidential bid and was infamously photographed on vacation outside the state-owned shore house on a day when a state government shutdown had closed public beaches."Listen, go in and vote for whoever you want," Christie said today as the woman asked why she should vote for "another Republican.""The easiest thing in the world is to stand where you stand and stand on the sidelines and critique," he added, suggesting that she run for the township committee."[It's] easier to sit here and complain, but you know what?That's the joy of public service It's serving folks like you that is really such a unique joy.It really is.""You're fabulous," he said.
What you need to know about the New Jersey governor's race:::::On Tuesday, New Jersey voters head to the polls in one of the two gubernatorial elections taking place in 2017 -- an election that has developed into a referendum on sitting Gov.Chris Christie and on the strength of the Democratic Party, one year after the election of President Donald Trump.The race to replace the deeply unpopular Christie features two candidates who are relatively unknown on a national level.Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno has served eight years as Christie's No.2 in Trenton, and Democrat Phil Murphy had a brief run as the U.S. ambassador to Germany after a career on Wall Street.While New Jersey is a consistently blue state in presidential elections, the Garden State has shown itself willing to elect Republicans at the state level.After early polls indicated Murphy had a wide lead, the gap has narrowed slightly in recent weeks as Guadagno has attempted to distance herself from the Christie administration.Here's what you need to know about the race: Who are the candidates?Phil Murphy: Murphy, a Democrat, served as the U.S. ambassador to Germany from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama.Before his diplomatic service, he worked as the Democratic National Committee's national finance chair from 2006 to 2009 and was a prolific party fundraiser.Spencer Platt/Getty Images, FILE For 23 years, Murphy worked for Goldman Sachs, rising from a summer intern to eventually lead offices in central Europe, serve as president of the investment banking firm's Asia office and run the company's investment management division.Murphy's campaign website biography does not name the company, but rather describes it as a "major international business."A native of Massachusetts, Murphy graduated from Harvard and received an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.He has four children with his wife, Tammy Murphy.Phil Murphy defeated former Under Secretary of the Treasury Jim Johnson and state Assemblyman John Wisniewski, among other candidates, in the Democratic primary on June 6, receiving a plurality of over 48 percent of the vote.His running mate is state assemblywoman Sheila Oliver.Kim Guadagno: Guadagno, a Republican, is the current lieutenant governor of New Jersey, the first person to hold the position after it was established and approved via state referendum in 2005.Before she was tapped by Christie to be his running mate, Guadagno was the sheriff of Monmouth County, New Jersey's fifth-most-populous county.Bobby Bank/WireImage via Getty Images, FILE Before her election as sheriff, Guadagno worked as assistant New Jersey attorney general and assistant U.S. attorney for the district of New Jersey.Guadagno is a graduate of Ursinus College and received her law degree from the American University Washington College of Law.She has three children with her husband, Mike Guadagno.Kim Guadagno won the Republican primary in June with over 46 percent of the vote, defeating her closest rival, Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, by more than 15 points.Her running mate is Carlos Rendo, the mayor of Woodcliff Lake.What are the major issues?Polling in New Jersey consistently cites taxes as the most important issue to the state's voters.Property taxes and state income taxes there are among the highest in the U.S., and the issue has taken on greater notability with the recently released House Republican tax plan proposing an elimination of state income tax deductions and a cap on property tax deductions at $10,000.Murphy has been open about his desire to raise taxes on the state's wealthiest citizens and has proposed legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana, which his campaign claims would raise $300 million.Guadagno has pitched property tax cuts for middle class New Jerseyans and has been outspoken about her disagreement with the Christie-backed bill to raise the state's gas tax last year.On education, Guadagno has said she supports "expanding school choice," the ability for parents to send their children to publicly financed charter schools, according to her campaign website.She further calls for "advancing merit pay for teachers" and providing greater vocational education opportunities.Murphy's proposals include increasing state funding to public and community colleges to lower tuition and instituting a loan forgiveness program to graduates who pursue science and technology jobs in the state.He has also called for free statewide pre-K education.Both candidates have pledged to reform the ailing NJ Transit train system with Murphy pledging to appoint an emergency manager and secure increased federal funding, while Guadagno says she will end a political oversight panel, push employers to offer transportation benefits and advocate for new express train lines.The Chris Christie factor In the four years since Christie's 2013 re-election a race in which he defeated Democrat Barbara Buono by 22 percentage points the governor's popularity has plummeted to historic lows as he became engulfed in scandal over the politically motivated closure of traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge in 2013 and spent months outside the state as he campaigned for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.The most recent Quinnipiac University survey of Christie's approval in late October measured it at 15 percent, a record low for the poll of likely voters in the state, and 81 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Christie's job performance.The approval-disapproval split among Republican likely voters was 37-57.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images, FILE In the same poll, when Quinnipiac asked likely voters whether Guadagno's position as Christie's lieutenant governor affected their opinion of her, 51 percent of respondents, including 16 percent of Republicans, said it had a negative impact.Murphy has seized upon the scandals faced by Christie in an attempt to link Guadagno to the governor.In one advertisement that has received heavy airplay in the weeks leading up to the election and sits on the home page of Murphy's campaign website, the Democrat stands in front of the George Washington Bridge and says of Christie and Guadagno, "Their biggest triumph was a traffic jam," a reference to the "Bridgegate" scandal.Guadagno, meanwhile, has attempted to distance herself from Christie, pointing to moments of disagreement, including her gas tax position, to showcase her independence.Over the summer, when Christie was photographed outside the governor's shore house in the midst of a state government shutdown that closed state beaches, Guadagno described the incident as "beyond words" and called for the house to be sold.What do the polls say?The most recent polls in the race show Murphy with consistent double-digit leads, though the advantages owned by the Democrat are not as commanding as he once enjoyed in the campaign's early months.A Quinnipiac University poll released on November 6 showed Murphy with a 53-41 edge among likely voters, while a Monmouth University poll released on November 1 had the Democrat with a 53-39 percent lead over Guadagno.The Quinnipiac University poll released on October 25 gave Murphy a 57-37 percent advantage, also among likely voters.As recently as early September, a Quinnipiac University poll gave Murphy a 25-point lead, which would eclipse the margin by which Christie defeated Buono in 2013.Between 1985 and 2013, no GOP candidate had won a gubernatorial race by more than 3 points.Join us Tuesday for Your Voice, Your Vote 2017, our live coverage of the biggest races of the year and a look back on the

What you need to know about the Virginia governor's race:::::Voters head to the polls Tuesday in Virginia to decide their next governor in a race that has been closely watched as a bellwether for the 2018 midterm elections and a test of President Donald Trumps influence in the only Southern state he lost in 2016.The race between Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam, a Democrat, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie started out as a relatively tame political contest between two moderates but has morphed into an intense battle over hot-button issues like illegal immigration, race relations and Confederate monuments.Since 2001, Republicans have won just one out of the four gubernatorial elections in Virginia, and national groups have poured money and resources into the state to boost Gillespies campaign.Trump did not campaign with Gillespie, but Vice President Mike Pence appeared with the candidate last month at a rally in southern Virginia.Northam has attracted support from national Democrats and appeared on the campaign trail with former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.Democrats are eager to pull out a win in Virginia as a tangible show of political resistance to the Trump presidency.Heres a look at what you need to know about who is running and what matters in Tuesdays election: Ralph Northam Northam, Virginias Democratic lieutenant governor, grew up on Virginias Eastern Shore and attended the Virginia Military Institute.He later served as an Army doctor and taught medicine and ethics at Eastern Virginia Medical School.He was elected lieutenant governor in 2013, serving under current Gov.Terry McAuliffe.This year he faced a strong primary challenger in former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello but was able to win the nomination with help from McAuliffe and Democratic groups in the state.Ed Gillespie Gillespie has been in Republican Party politics for decades, having served as a Republican National Committee chairman and counselor to President George W. Bush.Gillespie has also worked as a lobbyist and political strategist.In 2000 he co-founded a consulting firm, Quinn, Gillespie & Associates.Gillespie ran for the Senate in 2014 and nearly unseated incumbent Mark Warner, a Democrat.Gillespie lost the election by less than 1 point in a result that caught many political observers off guard.In this year's Republican primary, Gillespie was nearly beaten by Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart, who ran as a more conservative and Trump-aligned candidate.The Trump question Trump did not campaign for Gillespie but has loomed large over the race.The president endorsed Gillespie over Twitter, praising his ads highlighting violence perpetrated by the MS-13 gang in Virginia.Ralph Northam,who is running for Governor of Virginia,is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities.Vote Ed Gillespie!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2017 Gillespie approached questions about Trump very cautiously throughout the campaign, but Northam, who called Trump a narcissistic maniac early in the campaign, has tried to tie Gillespie to him at every turn.The presidents approval rating in Virginia was just 34 percent in a recent Quinnipiac poll.Northam has run ads in the final weeks of the campaign linking Gillespie to Trump, likely in the hopes that the unpopular president will be enough of a drag in certain areas of the state for Northam to pull out a win.The ad wars Most of the campaigns most heated exchanges have come over the airways.Gillespie has run ads highlighting crimes committed by the violent MS-13 gang, accusing Northam of supporting policies that have allowed the gang to grow in the state.The Republican has also run ads highlighting Northams support for the automatic restoration of certain rights for criminals, saying the policy allows sex offenders to have their gun rights restored.Gillespie has also tried to use the controversy over Confederate monuments to his advantage, running ads saying the monuments will stay up if he is elected and hitting Northam for saying he would take steps to remove some statues.While Northam has largely attacked Gillespie over his lobbying career, a mailer sent out by the states Democratic Party linked Gillespie and Trump to white nationalist protesters and the surrounding chaos over the summer in Charlottesville, according to The Washington Post.Just last week, an outside group called Latino Victory Fund ran an ad featuring a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and Gillespie bumper sticker menacing young minority children.The Gillespie campaign called the ad vile and an attack on all Virginians.The Northam campaign did not condemn the ad.It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them," campaign spokesman Ofirah Yheskel and told ABC News in an email.The group pulled the ad after eight people were killed in New York City after a truck attack that targeted cyclists and pedestrians.Looking to 2018 With the largely uncompetitive New Jersey gubernatorial race the only other statewide election tomorrow, Virginia will be looked at as the best political barometer before the 2018 midterms.Republicans have a much more favorable map when it comes to Senate races, as Democrats are defending 23 incumbents seats and two independent seats with members who caucus with them.Republicans, by contrast, are defending just eight seats.The last year a Republican was elected governor of Virginia was 2009, when Bob McDonnell defeated Democratic state Sen. Creigh Deeds.With Trumps effect on the 2018 midterms still largely a question mark, the Virginia race will give both parties an early look at how they should approach key races across the country.Join us Tuesday for Your Voice, Your Vote 2017, our live coverage of the biggest races of the year and a look back on the one year anniversary of Trumps election.Starting at 7:30 pm ET, ABC News will be covering all the races - including the big contests in Virginia and New Jersey - livestreaming on ABCNews.com/LIVE and on ABC Newss Facebook and YouTube pages, plus OTT platforms including Apple TV and Roku.
Trump says North Korea nuclear crisis will ultimately work out 'because it always works out':::::President Trump expressed optimism alongside military commanders in South Korea Tuesday that the diplomatic crisis with North Korea "ultimately" will "work out.""I think we're going to have lots of good answers for you over a period of time, and ultimately it will all work out," Trump said prior to an operational briefing at Camp Humphreys with U.S. and South Korean military leaders."Because it always works out, has to work out."The comments contrast with dire warnings from the president in recent months threatening North Korea with "fire and fury" in the face of repeated missile tests as well as the country's detonation of what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb in September.The Associated Press Trump mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as "little rocket man" in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in September and said if the U.S. were forced to defend itself or its allies against North Korean aggression, "we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."The president appeared to tone down his language leading up to his visit to Asia.His stop in Seoul puts him in the closest proximity yet to the threat faced by key U.S. allies in the region.Later Tuesday, President Trump will sit down with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss trade as well as the country's approach to North Korea.Trump has urged Moon to be more direct in confronting North Korea's aggression in the region."I hope that your visit to Korea and to the Asia-Pacific region will serve as an opportunity to relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea's provocations and also serve as a turning point in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue," Moon said..
President Trump: Extreme vetting for Texas shooter would have made 'no difference':::::President Trump said Tuesday that new gun laws would have made "no difference" in preventing the massacre at a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 people dead.Trump was asked during a press conference in South Korea about his recent comments calling for "extreme vetting" immediately following the New York City terror attack, and whether he would favor similar scrutiny for those looking to purchase firearms."If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago," Trump said, before turning to praise the actions of a bystander who engaged the shooter following his rampage."You might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck, go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him."The president added, "I can only say this.If [the neighbor] didn't have a gun, instead of 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.So that's the way I feel about it, not going to help."The suspected shooter, Devin Kelley, 26, served in the Air Force but was court martialed in 2012 on charges of assault and aggravated assault on his spouse and a child.Authorities said Monday that his gun purchases were allowed because there was no prohibited info in the federal background check system, the Air Force has since acknowledged it did not report Kelley's convictions to the FBI.The president was briefed on developments in the shooting while in Japan, and said soon after that it should be credited to a "mental health problem" and not U.S. gun laws.The Associated Press He and the White House urged restraint in jumping to conclusions similar to the reaction following the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October.The White House later said the president would be willing to work with Congress on potentially regulating the "bump stock" device used by the shooter to increase his rate of fire, though those efforts have seemed to fade in recent weeks.The president's response to the Texas mass shooting has been compared with his reaction to the terror attack in New York City just last Tuesday, where he waited only hours before stating he had directed the Department of Homeland Security to institute strict vetting procedures and called for Congress to change immigration policy.I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo said the tweets were not "factual" and "tended to point fingers and politicize the situation," though the White House disputed he was taking advantage of the tragedy for political gain.
After months of public denials, Carter Page admits he told Trump officials about meeting with Russians:::::Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page told the House Intelligence Committee last week that he alerted several top Trump campaign officials about a planned trip to Moscow in July of 2016 and notified others when he returned.Page said he informed campaign adviser J.D.Gordon, then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Trump aide Hope Hicks over email about a trip to speak at a university, according to a transcript of the interview released by the committee Monday evening.If youd like to go on your own, not affiliated with the campaign, you know, thats fine, Page recalled Lewandowski telling him about the trip.Ryan McBride/AFP/Getty Images As has previously been reported, Page told lawmakers he separately informed then-Sen. Jeff Sessions about the planned trip, which he made in a personal capacity.That disclosure, first reported last week, has led Democrats to accuse Sessions of misleading Congress in testimony under oath when he said he wasnt aware of Trump campaign contacts with Russians.I don't think he told me the truth, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said in an interview with ABC News.I think that on different occasions he either has a terrible memory or he is deliberately not telling me the truth.Page said he met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich on his July 2016 trip, which appeared to be at odds with what he's said about his trip in media appearances.In January, Page told ABC News that he spoke not one word to anyone from the Kremlin during the trip, and then in April, he acknowledged only that he said hello briefly to one individual, who was a board member of the New Economic School where I gave my speech.Gage Skidmore Under pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, however, Page admitted to sending an email to Trump officials after the trip promising a readout of incredible insights and outreach from Russian legislators and senior members of the Presidential administration in Moscow.Those accounts are directly contradictory, so you have to conclude that what he was saying publicly simply wasnt true, Schiff said in an interview with ABC News.Page downplayed the significance of that note in his interview with lawmakers.In explaining his email, Page said he spoke briefly with Dvorkovich at a reception -- and that he and wanted to share impressions of what he observed on Russian television and in speeches with Trump officials.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images The Trump administration has also tried to downplay Pages significance to the campaign.Page was one of the five people Trump identified during the campaign as a member of his foreign policy team, but when Page came under intense scrutiny following the publication of the infamous dossier during the transition, former press secretary Sean Spicer claimed Pages contact with Trump was minimal.Carter Page is an individual who the President-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign, Spicer said shortly before Trump took office in January.But Page said he was invited to speak at a Moscow university after he became affiliated with the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016.In emails he appeared to suggest to campaign officials that Trump make the trip to Russia, which didn't appear to go anywhere.Page told lawmakers he has not been told by the special counsel to expect an indictment, but wouldnt say whether hes met with special counsel Robert Mueller or his team.Page, meanwhile, continues to project confidence and says the investigation is based on false allegations and lies put forward in the dossier.It was terrific to have the opportunity to help clear the record as to the falsehoods from the dodgy dossier which started this whole thing against me, Page said as he left the hearing last week.ABC News Pete Madden contributed to this report.The photo of J.D.Gordon was used under the terms of the Creative Commons license.
Trump admin. ending protective immigration status for Nicaraguans, delays decision for Hondurans:::::The Department of Homeland Security has ended Temporary Protected Status for Nicaragua, meaning that the 2,500 Nicaraguans living in the U.S. under that special status have 14 months to leave the country.Today was the deadline for the administration to decide the fate of those Nicaraguans and some 57,000 Hondurans -- but that second group will have to wait to see their future decided.The department said that acting Secretary Elaine Duke had not yet made a decision about Honduras, requiring additional information on the conditions on the ground and saying Honduras had formally requested an extension.Given the current information, it is possible that the program will be terminated, a DHS official added.No decision has yet been made about El Salvador or Haiti.A DHS official said that nothing should be read into today's decision about the future of other temporary protective status programs, but the administration has already let ones for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone all expire.Temporary Protected Status is a special immigration status for people from a foreign country where the U.S. determines that conditions in that home country prevent those people from returning safely or where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately.Nicaragua and Honduras were originally designated Jan. 5, 1999, because of destruction wrought by Hurricane Mitch.While infrastructure may have been rebuilt after the destruction, the status has been reauthorized every 18 months ever since because of the violent conditions in both countries.Because of those continuous extensions, many of the people now facing deportation have been in the U.S. for nearly two decades, including some who have raised families here.The decision on Nicaragua will be implemented 12 months after its deadline expires, meaning Jan. 5, 2019.DHS said that the U.S. has been in touch with Nicaragua, and they have assured the administration they will be able to receive these individuals back.That Jan. 5 deadline means that after then, those Nicaraguans must be out of the country or they will be here illegally.The Trump administration will not consider them a priority for deportation, but they will be eligible for it, a DHS official told reporters Monday night.The deadline for a decision on Honduras was extended six months, until July 5, 2018.The Trump administration is now calling on Congress to legislate a "permanent solution" and "provide a certain future" for these individuals."We do hope and encourage Congress to look at this and find a solution," rather than have the executive sign extensions every 18 months, as has been the case for over 20 years, a DHS official said."Recognizing the difficulty facing citizens of Nicaragua -- and potentially citizens of other countries -- who have received TPS designation for close to two decades, Acting Secretary Duke calls on Congress to enact a permanent solution for this inherently temporary program," the Department said in a statement Monday night.There is some movement among members of Congress to do that, just as there is to seek a solution to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- those young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents, also known as DREAMers -- which Trump has also vowed to end."As Congress works to find a permanent solution for the Dreamers, it is apparent that we must also prioritize a legislative fix for the Temporary Protected Status program," Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland and the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday, before the decision on Nicaragua and Honduras was announced.The decision was made by Duke, in consultation with the State Department and other agencies, based on her review of the conditions and the requirements of the law, according to a DHS official, denying there was any pressure from the White House.But Duke will soon be out of her role, pending the confirmation of Trump's nominee for secretary, his current Deputy Chief of Staff Kirstjen Nielsen.Whether or not to expel 57,000 Hondurans who have been in the U.S. for years -- a politically contentious issue -- will be one of her first and most difficult decisions, if she is confirmed.The executive must make a decision 60 days before the expiration deadline for each program.The next deadline is Nov. 23 for Haiti and Jan. 8, 2018, for El Salvador.ABC News' Jeffrey Cook contributed to this report.
Mystery deepens over assault on Sen. Rand Paul:::::Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is recovering at his Bowling Green home after being physically assaulted Friday afternoon by a neighbor.The assailant 59-year-old Rene Boucher was arrested by Kentucky State Police and charged with fourth-degree assault, authorities said.U.S. Capitol Police and the FBI are investigating the incident because assaulting a member of Congress is a federal crime."Senator Paul was blindsided and the victim of an assault, his spokeswoman said Friday in a statement, adding that the senator is fine.Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, said in a statement that the senator sustained five rib fractures, caused by high-velocity severe force and lung contusions.Stafford added that it is unclear when Paul would return to work because the pain associated with the injuries is considerable and could last weeks or months.It is a pending, serious criminal matter involving state and federal authorities.We wont have any further comments at this time, Stafford told ABC News.According to the arrest warrant, Boucher walked onto Pauls property and tackled him from behind, forcing him to the ground.Matthew Baker, Boucher's attorney, said in a statement to ABC News Monday, "Senator Paul and Dr. Boucher have been next door neighbors for 17 years.They are also prominent members of the local medical community and worked together when they were both practicing physicians."It continued, "The unfortunate occurrence of Nov. 3 has absolutely nothing to do with either's politics or political agendas.It was a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial.We sincerely hope that Senator Paul is doing well and that these two gentlemen can get back to being neighbors as quickly as possible."Warren County Regional Jail/AP The FBI said in a statement that it is working with state and local partners to determine if there was a violation of federal law.U.S. Capitol Police said it would not comment on the ongoing investigation.
Top 5 cultural moments from President Trump's official visit to Japan:::::Wrapping up the first stop in a grueling five-country swing through Asia, President Trump and the first lady were treated to several Japanese cultural moments over the business of international diplomacy.Trump meets the emperor President Trump and the first lady visited the Imperial Palace for a traditional state call meeting with the Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan.In greeting the emperor, the president nodded his head and shook hands with the emperor but notably did not bow.The issue of whether and how to bow to the Japanese emperor has been a matter of contested protocol, with more than one past president receiving criticism for how they bowed.Most recently, former President Obama was critiqued for how he bowed before the emperor, which some cultural watchers said was too deep of a bow for the rank of a U.S. president.Eugene Hoshiko, Pool/AP Feeding Koi Ahead of his own lunch with Prime Minister Abe and an expanded U.S. and Japanese delegation at Akasaka Palace Monday, the president treated the palace Koi to a hearty lunch of their own.Standing on a balcony above a pond, Trump and Abe were presented with wooden boxes of fish food and proceeded to sprinkle the food into the pond below with spoons.After throwing several spoonfuls of food, Trump, and Abe, turned over the box, dumping all of the remaining food to the fish below.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images The first lady gets a calligraphy lesson Prime Minister Abes wife, Akie Abe, brought the first lady on a visit to a Japanese elementary school Monday, where the first lady learned the art of Japanese calligraphy.After being welcomed to the school by a gymnasium full of singing children, a student in a fourth grade classroom gave the first lady a short tutorial in how to use a calligraphy paint brush.She carefully dipped her paint brush in ink and swiped it over a piece of paper, copying one character that when combined with another painted by Mrs. Abe spelled out the Japanese word for Peace.The two women then held up their characters together and posed for a photo with the children in the classroom.Melania Trump learns about history of pearl harvesting in Japan In what was her first event of the trip without the president, the first lady met up with Mrs. Abe at Mikimoto Pearl's flagship store in Tokyos high-end Ginza shopping district Sunday, where the first lady learned about Japans long history of harvesting pearls.Ms. Trump learned about how Kokichi Mikimoto, the founder of the Mikimoto brand, successfully harvested the worlds first semi-spherical pearl from an oyster through human intervention in 1893, and about the ancient Japanese practice of harvesting pearls.The first lady and Mrs. Abe posed for a photo with two traditionally-dressed ama pearl divers who wore goggles on their heads and held barrels for oyster collection.Ama divers, which translates to mean ocean ladies, are women who dive for pearls, oysters, and shellfish without scuba equipment in a tradition that's more than a thousand years old in Japan.Shizuo Kambayashi/AP Trump Checks Out Bonsai Trees While visiting Akasaka Palace, Prime Minister Abe gave President Trump a tour of the grounds and a collection of bonsai trees.The well-manicured dwarf trees are a quintessential symbol of Japanese culture.

Trump says he was surprised there are 'so many countries' while in Japan Video:::::Transcript for Trump says he was surprised there are 'so many countries' while in Japan All right, so, the new guy's over in Asia right now and he told a Japanese banquet that before he got this new gig he didn't really know what he was getting into.Take a look.I never ran for office, and here I am.But I never ran.So I wasn't very experienced.And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world.I never knew we had so many countries.That's funny.He's funny.He only knows two countries, the U.S. And Russia.Those are his two countries.Who knew?I think probably every other single president before you knew there were more countries than just two.I mean, and it's not the first time he's been surprised about how things kind of work.Another clip.Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.The governor of Puerto Rico is so thankful for the great job that we're doing.And it's the most difficult job because it's on an island in the middle of the ocean.Lincoln signed a law that built the first transcontinental railro railroad.Most people don't even know he was a Republican, Rieg?Does anyone know?We knew.The Abraham Lincoln thing kills me because I personally have a pearl necklace of Abraham linco Lincoln's face that I wear.He is ultimate Republican icon and that sells his legacy and that is the gaffe of all of it.He didn't know maybe.Those are admissions you save for behind closed doors maybe?What did you say.Maybe behind closed doors you want to say.There are things that I didn't know that I share with my close friends and family and we laugh about it at the holiday.S he said he could shoot somebody on fifth avenue and they would still follow him.He doesn't care what he says because they're there no matter what.The thing in front of the congregation in Asia I think was pretty shocking but it's sort of par for the course because I remember reading that he doesn't really want too much intelligence briefings, he doesn't want to e0 oh you know, he wants a big picture.He doesn't want to a lot of details.Don't you need details if you're the president of the united States?I don't know because he has definitely changed his tune on North Korea.Yeah.Since he landed.You know, all that rocket man, Kim Jong-un, rocket man, rocket man, rocket man has been replaced by, hello, Kim.I'm here and I wonder if we can have a meal.I mean, it's kind of crazy and is his base going to be okay with this, you know, hey, oh, I was just kidding, hi.What's going to happen here.It may be easier to talk tough when you're out of range of the missile.I feel like it would make me I nervous staying on the ground.Don't you think someone said stop with the rocket man thing.He doesn't listen.John Kerry said the reason that North Korea wants to get a bomb is because of trump.That is factually inaccurate on his part.John Kerry?Yes.There have been -- since the Clinton administration there have been sanctions done over and over again.This is the legacy of a lot of presidents Republicans and Democrats on both sides.I don't like the rocket man stuff either.This guy who we've talked about on this show, he is an extra brand of crazy.He doesn't care about anything.I mean, it's absolutely petrifying to be playing with fire this way.That's why he doesn't go to the dmz, the demilitarized zone.You know, hey, you js crossed the road over there.Walk about four miles and you'll meet up with Kim.He's going, huh huh.The thing about John Kerry that was interesting to me, he was our secretary of state forefour years and he also said if you want a relationship and you want to stop a nuclear war with North Korea, it has to be based on diplomacy.If you remember, Donald Trump right away said I'm going to blow up your country and I think that's what John Kerry was referring to.And nobody believes that that will ever happen.I don't believe that that will -- You don't?No.That's one thing I agree with trump because he did say it's not going to happen because the diplomacy will happen because it has to and it always has and it will.You're not talking about a conventional war here.You're talking about something else.But you have to have the difficults in place and that's to my ani issue.What could happen is an accident in South Korea because of the military bases there.An accident is something in your pants.Somebody could get ahold of stuff.There could end up being millions and millions of atrocities and that to me is what I fear more than anything.It's not necessarily an attack on the United States or .It's an attack on South Korea.The Asians know about nuclear war because we dropped bombs on nagasaki and Hiroshima back in the day and they know what that means.Americans may not understand.You have to look into that because it's really bad.Also, diplomacy is everything.Diplomacy is everything and the idea that we don't have the diplomats on the ground that we should have, it freaks me out.Because I think the only way -- you know, one of the best conversations I ever had with Bill Clinton was about how he handled Korea, because he said, you know, we would go over and we say, look, we know you're not feeding your people so we're going to help you, we're going to feed your people because all you do is sell commune igss.You're not going to sell them to anybody because if you do it's going to be a problem.So if you're cool with that, we're cool.That went on for a good long time and then everything sort of disappeared and no one was talking to anybody and it really has become an issue.Do you think trump is now turning a corner on this because he's saying let's make a deal?I think he doesn't have a choice because the w0r8d has said, listen man, you want to go fight him on a beach, that's fine.Don't involve us.Because when you drop something, it's going to involve a lot more than just you.Well that's the problem.Going over there, don't do it, you know.This is not a skirmish in Syria.This is not a land war.This is the World's War.It will be if it happens.The one thing I will say is more than anything -- I'm talking meaning fallout and also retaliation with nuclear bombs.I'm not saying Syria is not a World War.The anxiety of North Korea more than anything is what gives me pause every day and the tweeting by diplomacy, about North Korea specifically, Kim Jong-un, is absolutely incredibly dangerous and playing with fire.It's provocative.So marketing exec Julie This transcript has been

Bicyclist fired from job for flipping off Trump motorcade Video:::::Transcript for Bicyclist fired from job for flipping off Trump motorcade So marketing exec Julie brisman went viral for flipping off the presidential motorcade as it roared past while leaving one of his golf clubs, but she changed the photo to her social media profile picture and her company fired her.And so, there's a great question, did she deserve to get fired over it.The great question is maybe she was just saying you're number one.How do they know, right?It's possible.It's possible.It's a coincidental finger choice.I think it really is up to companies because I don't know if this is generational with social media but I've always said before you hit post or send, would your boss be okay with it and would your parents be okay with it.So I feel like this talk of whether someone can do this in their own time, we've become 24/7 brands.We no longer receive a land line call from our boss at home and check out for the day.You're now on the clock all day long.What's interesting to me was she wasn't recognizable.The feet was -- She posted it.She posted it, she told her employer.So I think a lot of people feel like I'm protected by the first amendment and of course you are from government action but this is her company and it's not freedom from consequences.It's just freedom of speech.My question is, how the hell does she get that close.Yeah.Because remember what happened when thebicyclist, he didn't even realize there was a motorca motorcade, so how does this girl, he's riding along.So close.And I'm thinking, hey, where's the secret service?What the hell?She could have had a jacket.They don't -- what the hell?What about the guy who also worked for that company who also posted heinous things against black lives matter and called people names and he still has his job.I think it's the company.Do they work for the same company?She says it.This is her -- this woman, what is her name?Julie brisman.She says the director at her company called someone a And he still has his job.Well see, now there's a problem there.Yeah.There's a problem there.You have to treat people equally.We're going to find out.We might not know by the end of the show but if we find out tomorrow, we're going to be talking about it.We'll be right back.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Paul Ryan calls for prayers in wake of Texas tragedy Video:::::Transcript for Paul Ryan calls for prayers in wake of Texas tragedy Hey, so speaker Paul Ryan has been criticized after calling for prayer instead of legislative action in the wake of the Texas tragedy.But he's not backing down.Take a look.People who do not have faith don't understand faith I guess I'd have to say, and it is -- the right thing to do is to pray in moments like this because prayer works.I know you believe that and I believe that and when you hear the secular left doing this thing, no wonder you have so much polarization and disunity in this country when you do that kind of thing.You can't do that, Paul, because not everybody subscribes to what your version of religion is.People do this in a different way.The question is, is he isolating people -- He's dividing people.-- By saying that you don't get it because you don't do it the way he does.He's dividing people when he says secular left.Immediately it's us against them again.I understand what he meant -- part of what he said when he said that people don't always -- like there were a lot of people that called for prayer and everyone, like, lashd out.The thing about people that are really spiritual, not just spiritual but religious, those people are still praying even though they were in church when they were shot because nothing about god says you won't be shot in a church, run over by a bus and get cancer.It says I'll be there to give you strength.Prayer works.It's congress that doesn't work.But let me say one thing -- There's a lot of -- Let her finish her point.Although I'm someone that turns to let's get practical solutions, let's talk about it, I am someone that goes to more legislation, I understand that when people were mocking a lot of the people that called for prayer, I understood what they meant just because I have so many dear friends that do turn to prayer for everything.Except that at one point, the most congress people who were calling for prayer and tweeting about prayer are the biggest recipients of NRA money.What?Bigots?Biggest.What did you think I said?I thought you said bigots.There lies the hypocrisy.Everyone that watches knows I'm a very prayerful person, have gone to catholic schools my whole life.It is my go to thing, but the problem is when other tragedies happen in the United States, instead of saying we need to pray for them, it's let's build a wall, let's throw the immigrants out.That's usually the response from so many of these people that are now saying, you know what, let's not talk about the gun issue, instead let's pray.Well praying didn't stop all those bullets from being shot into that church.I mean they had the prayers covered, right?They were in church praying.That's right.Yelling at each other about who prays and who doesn't -- will wheaten treated, the murdered victims were in a church.That doesn't help either.I very rare quote Stephen Colbert.We have a voting problem in this country.The turnout is not at the levels it should be.If you want to take action, it is election day today, get out there and vot for who you want.Yeah.And in a certain way today's election will determine the next election for president in many ways.We will have some tea leaves to read tomorrow about the election.We will.Everybody good?Okay.We'll be right back.Announcer: Did Hillary's This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Former DNC chair Donna Brazile discusses allegations about Democratic Party in new book Video:::::Transcript for Former DNC chair Donna Brazile discusses allegations about Democratic Party in new book Brazile makes a lot of shocking claims about how Democrats blew the election in her new book, "Hacks: The inside story of the break-ins and breakdowns that put Donald Trump in the white house."And we can't wait to talk to her about it.Please welcome Donna Brazile.So what is this?What is this book?Tell me about this book.It is my examination of what happened last year.2016 will go down in history as one of the most disruptive political seasons that we've had in a long time.As the interim chair to the democratic party and by the way, second time.There will not be a third time so everybody can believe Donna Brazile -- the D next to my name next year will be dance party.Maybe you'll join me.This was a very terrible year for the American people.We were hacked.I stepped up as chair of the party because of a hacking, because someone went into our server, stole our e-mails, stole our data and created havoc.So my book tells the story.It's my story.Everyone else has told their story.You might hear more stories 3wu9 this is my story of what happened.And you have every right to tell it.I hope so.Maya Angelou -- thank you, thank you.The poet Maya Angelou said one of the greatest burdens is an untold story.I told the story also, whoopi, because I'm afraid that it's still happeningment we haven't cleaned up our house.You can't go to Best Buy, Meghan, and get anti-wall ware when the Russians are whahacking you.We need a president who says this must stop, we won't be hacked again and our elections are going to be free from any foreign interference.You do know that this book is being used against the party -- Say it.I'm trying to say it.All right.Against everybody.So people are upset and you know, you understand.So explain why you didn't realize people would take the idea of Hillary bailing out the party years -- or whenever she did it as something that was bad and robbed Bernie of his ability to be president.I mean, that's how -- that's the message that's being put out.Right.-- In your name.First of all, I never used the word rigged in my book.I said that -- I used the word cancer in that I was uncomfortable with the cancer that I found when I became chair.Look, I was in office, I didn't know how deeply in debt our party was, okay?And when I learned that Hillary was bailing us out, I want to call her secretary Hillary Clinton but I also know her as Hillary because I have great affection and respect for her.When I learned that Hillary was bailing our party out, giving us $3.5 million a month to keep us floating, I appreciated that.But I wanted control over, whoopi, was that if I raised a $1, $1.50, I wanted to spend my money without asking permission.So that was -- so whoopi, when Donald Trump last year said what the hell do you have to lose, it's August 19th -- Against African-Americans.And by the way, have you noticed what color I am?Yes.I know, baby.This is what black look like when it's 57.What I wanted, joy -- Okay, all right.But what I wanted was to fight back.I knew Donald Trump was doing more than just trying to rattle African-Americans.We had been hacked so I knew he was playing a game and I wanted to respond.And I had to respond with a column.I wanted to respond with ads.I wanted to respond with posters.I wanted to respond with more activity across the country.That's what I tried to do and that's why I said, Bernie, guess what, I found the cancer.I'm not killing the patient.I'm not killing my party because my party was more than elected the president.It was the United States senate, the congress, and let me just say there were things on the ballot that people probably didn't see.I saw Obamacare, I saw climate change.I saw a kid growing up in poverty like myself who wanted a white house and a president who would care for them and that was Hillary Clinton.I wanted to win.I didn't want to sit there and be a figure head.Y'all don't think I'm a figure head.Have you spoken to Hillary since?Of course, I did.I said that in the book.I spoke to her in February.That was a while, a long time.She's not on my speed dial.I love her now.I got all the people, but I -- let me just say this, I gave up everything last year when I got that phone call, I did not want that phone call.If there was ever a time I should have said I'll stay unemployed, but that's not who I am.I'm a fighter.I'm never a first choice but I'm the person you call in to clean up the mess.I always say I'm the daughter of a maid and a janitor.Who else do you want to clean up a mess.I'll clean up somebody's mess but I think not clean up our democracy if we have a foreign government interfering and the president of the United States will not help to clean up our democracy.With all respect, not to interfere, but P you're highly critical of the campaign in this.Of course I am.I think there's an impression that it's only the hacking, only James Comey.You say there was no sex and no fun I believe happening -- You got to the real juicy part of my book.Yeah.You know, we have this thing in campaigns that everybody likes to do a little thing, you know.There's no sex on the campaign, that's a bad campaign, that is very true.See, you know a little about politics and campaigning.I said it was antiseptic.It was antiseptic in the sense that there was no rumbling and fumbling and no passion.And I wanted passion.Passion is what you need in a campaign.You just can't go out there and say go out and vote.You have to say here's why Hillary Clinton will make a better president.That's what I was referring to.Donna, why are we just hearing about this now though?It couldn't have been just you that knew that these things were happening.Why is it taking so long for us to be getting the news that all of this stuff was going on behind the scenes because so many of us were busy defending it, saying you guys are J suspicious and you're like, no, there's something going on here and now we find out there was.First of all, for many of us who received our briefing, I know when I received my briefing from the FBI, I got up the next day and I said, oh, my god, why am I going back to the DNC.I should be going to the Pentagon.Megh Meghan, your father's campaign along with president Obama was hacked by the chooinds.This was hacked by the Russians.Are we waiting for the noirn north Koreans, the Iranians.Who else are we waiting for?I found a lot of dysfunction, a lot of hdiscourse.My job as chair was to try to clean up as much as I could and I let it in good hands with Tom Perez and the others who are now doing a better job.We've been friends for a long time.I know you're a straight shooter.But I think what Sara's getting to is you allege in the book that Hillary Clinton basically owned DNC.She owned the party.She controlled the party, and that that was to the detriment and the fairness of the primary between Hillary and Bernie.Is that true?Yes, I put out in the book and I said there was a joint fundraising agreement that all the candidates signed.We had five candidates but there was a separate memoranda of understanding.When I came to the conclusion that I could not spend the money, I could not direct the resources, and I was having people who did not have the kind of experience I have on the battlefie battlefield.When they were telling me I needed $2 million when I said I needed $8 million -- Those were Hillary's people.I used to call them the high command of Brooklyn.I'm not mad at them.I was disappointed.I said I need $8 million to fight Donald Trump.I wasn't asking for $80 million.I was request $8 million.By the way, I didn't mind raising the money but just let me spend the money.Get to your book for a second because you threw a lot of people under the bus.The DNC is mad at you, Robbie Mook is mad.I'm not sure about Hillary.I saw Mook and he's upset.Here's the question I wanted to ask you, why the timing of the book?Today is election day, why are you giving red meat to trump's side.A lot of people ask me that.Why not have it next week?Joy, I didn't, quote unquote -- I said my launch for my book when I sent in my proposal.I thought, you know, in the year after a presidential election that's when you have a lot of debate and dissent.Everyone is writing books.Mr. Biden's book is coming out, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Clinton's book.By the way, I thought she wrote a great book, historical, memoir and a campaign.I wanted to tell my story about what happened.I wasn't writing to make someone upset.Look, I cried for everybody.I wanted to prevent this hacking from happening again and I want to see the democratic party a stronger party, more effective party and make sure that our country is never attacked again.Hold on one second.Donna Brazile is going to stick This transcript has been

Donna Brazile on passing debate questions to Hillary Clinton's campaign, Democratic funding of Russian research Video:::::Transcript for Donna Brazile on passing debate questions to Hillary Clinton's campaign, Democratic funding of Russian research to clean away odors for up to 30 days.Breathe Happy with Febreze.Was surprised when you apologized for passing debate questions on to the Hillary camp.Why were you surprised?Because we've known each other for a very long time.So I was surprised that you apologized for it but in the book you seemed to doubt that you really did that, so I would like you to set the record straight.Did you pass on the debate questions or not?So in the book I describe two things.One I describe when I was first told that my, quote unquote, e-mail was part of John podesta's dump, my first reaction was oh, I can explain it, let me go home and look at my stuff.I couldn't find it.What I did because I know myself, I called up everybody and said I need to get the, quote unquote, material I sent you.I couldn't find it.I apologized, hell yeah I apologized and I quit CNN that night because I could not explain it.I could not find my -- actually, I could not find my server.Do you remember?Let me tell you what I remember doing.As a catholic girl, you know how you have to say bless me father, I have sinned.Yeah.I remember during that period of time I was trying to respond to the black lives matter, I was trying to get more debate questions pertaining to, quote unquote, people of color, and yes, I wanted diversity.Roland martin from TV one, I said I apologize because I can't find my e-mail.It's podesta's e-mails, I apologize.And I hope everybody knows me knows this is a big girl here, a big woman, and I apologize.All right.I did it.You did.I have a question for you and I hope you answer this honestly because there are a lot of questions about this Russian dossier and there's evidence that has come out that the DNC helped fund it.Did you know that was happening and were you surprised to hear it?I asked one question on November 4th and I was told that I didn't need to know, so no, I did not know.Because I did not control my money.You're waxing poetic about Russia and Russia being involved in the election but when you see that the DNC was funding for it -- Meghan, Meghan, you know campaigns.So the line item is called legal.The line item is called research.The line item -- if you asked me today because I have a list of all the DNC consultants, do I see fusion gps, no, but if you ask me was this a question that came up during my tenure as chair, it did on November 4.Do you think it's wrong?Do you think it sets a bad precedent?To do legal -- To pay for research.I was not involved in the contracting.The Republicans -- I -- Meghan, I was not involved in the hiring of this firm.I did not know about the existence of this contract.But in terms of opposition research, people go after things that I must tell you in America, they go after dirt.When they go after dirt, you saw what Mr. Trump junior did but no, I did not go after it.Do you think it's wrong to go to Russia to ask for opposition research on a candidate?You asking me about the dossier and how it was compiled, I don't know how it was compiled.I don't know who went after it, Meghan.I'm just asking if you think it's wrong.First of all, I don't believe that foreigners should be -- unless they're American citizens they should have no place in our politician and they should not control our politics.She's not questioning -- you're not questioning opposition research.You believe in opposition research.I do.I don't agree with it to foreign adversaries.It sets in my opinion a very dangerous precedent.There any evidence, Donna, that the chin tan campaign actually paid Russia?The research that I was a party to, I thought they did a doggone good job with the research and I applaud what the research people did but I have no idea what happened in this case.That wasn't one of my contracts.So, I have a question for you because remember when -- of course you remember when Hillary seemed to faint.Yes.At that 9/11 ceremony.And I think you said in the book that you were thinking very seriously that you wanted to replace her with Biden and Cory booker.Yes.What I said in the book, whoopi has the book.Put it up there.That chapter is 11 called "Collapse."That morning when she fainted, I had no idea what happened so I kept saying what happened, what happened, what happened.Later that evening there was a former chair of the DNC who began to assess that we needed to have a strategy in place.I kept my own counsel.The next morning someone from the Hillary campaign came to the DNC to help me tamp down those rumors and I went Oun CNN that afternoon to say Hillary's doing well, she's going to resume traveling.I said when she went to that debate she did a great job taking on D.T.So you didn't think of replacing her with Biden and Cory booker?The rules of the convention and the rules -- You could do it anyway.The chair shall and confirm with, okay?So in the case of death, resignation or disability, the chair shall, that is what I have in the book.Okay, hold on.Coming up, she's back.We'll be right back.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Live updates: Murphy projected to win New Jersey governor's race:::::Phil Murphy, the former U.S. ambassador to Germany, is projected to win New Jersey's gubernatorial election, based on ABC News' analysis of the exit poll.Sweeping backlash to the deeply unpopular Gov.Chris Christie, a Republican, became a focal point of the campaign that pitted Murphy against the state's Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno.In Tuesday's other major gubernatorial race, the election between Democratic Virginia Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam and former Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie is still too close to call.While the statewide races have not attracted the level of attention that might accompany elections in a presidential or congressional midterm year, each has been marked by its own defining factors.Check back throughout the night as the ABC News team provides the latest updates on all the major races: Live Updates Exit poll analysis Exit poll results in Virginia and New Jersey this evening will explore the prime motivators of voters preferences in the two biggest-profile contests since the 2016 presidential election .Preliminary exit poll results in both states gubernatorial elections are now available.View our full analysis HERE.Murphy projected to win New Jersey race, based upon ABC News' analysis of the exit poll ABC News Over 14 percent reporting in Virginia, Gillespie leads With 14.3 percent of precincts reporting in Virginia, Gillespie leads Northam 51.8-46.9 percent.Exit polls show voters' opinions of Trump Something to watch: 32% of VA voters said they cast their ballot to show opposition to Pres.Trump, vs. 16% who said they did so to express support for him, per preliminary exit poll results.Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) November 7, 2017 Other races to watch: In addition to the marquee races in Virginia and New Jersey, elections at the state and local levels are being held across the country.Here are a few to keep an eye on: Virginia House of Delegates All 100 seats in the House of Delegates are up for election.Republicans hold 66 out of 100 seats in the chamber and Democrats are not expected to be able to take back the legislature, but there are a number of higher-profile races that garnered national attention.The exact number of seats that Democrats are able to pick up could be a good indicator of the strength of the party's brand in different parts of a swing state like Virginia.Forty-three of the 88 Democratic candidates running for the House of Delegates are women.Virginia races of note: 13th district - Roem (D) v. Marshall (R): Danica Roem would be the states first openly transgender elected official if she wins, and Democrats have been gunning hard to unseat 13-term incumbent Bob Marshall.Marshall is a hardline conservative that entered politics as an anti-abortion activist.12th district - Hurst (D) v. Yost (R): Chris Hursts life was flipped upside down after his girlfriend Allison Parker, a journalist at WDBJ, was murdered on live television in 2015 by a former co-worker.Now Hurst is running for political office and hoping to unseat Joseph Yost, who has held this district since 2011.31st District - Guzman (D) v. Lingamfelter (R): If elected, Elizabeth Guzman would be the first Latina elected to the Virginia statehouse, and this district in suburban Prince William County outside of Washington D.C. is another competitive race that Democrats are hoping to pull out.Washington state senate district 45 If Democrat Manka Dhingra is able to defeat Republican Jinyoung Lee Englund, it would give the Democrats control of the Washington State Senate, which would mean complete Democratic control of the West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) in every state legislative body and governors seat.The suburban and wealthy district east of Seattle was won handily by Hillary Clinton during the general election, and a win there has Democrats in the state eager to begin enacting an even more progressive agenda in the state, spearheaded by Gov.Jay Inslee.Kentucky Rowan County clerk election Kim Davis, who was sent to prison in 2015 when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, is running for re-election for the first time since she was jailed.Utah's 3rd congressional district The race for Utahs 3rd congressional district is not expected to be competitive with the Republican nominee, Provo Mayor John Curtis, primed to take over the seat after Jason Chaffetz resigned from Congress back in May.The district is reliably red, and even with some pushback in the state, Donald Trump won it in 2016 by 18 points.Chaffetz cruised to re-election by almost 50 points in 2016.Curtis is taking on Democrat and physician Kathie Allen, who has not attracted much support from national Democrats, as well as Jim Bennett, a third party candidate and son of former U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett, and grandson of former U.S. Sen. Wallace Bennett.New York City mayoral election Incumbent Democrat Bill de Blasio is poised to sail towards re-election as the mayor of New York City, despite the fact that his approval ratings dipped to as low at 50 percent in a July 2017 poll from Quinnipiac.De Blasio did not face any major resistance in the Democratic primary over the summer, and none of his challengers in the general election appear to have made much headway in challenging him.The Republican candidate is state assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis.Trump robocall on behalf of Gillespie "I need you to vote for Ed Gillespie to be your new Governor of Virginia.If you let Ralph Northam be governor, he will be a total disaster for your state.Northam is weak on crime and weak on immigration, and as your Lieutenant Governor Northam has driven your economy right into a ditch."- robocall recorded by President Donald Trump for Ed Gillespie Race background Trumps presence hangs over the race in Virginia where he has been actively tweeting on Gillespies behalf in recent days.He weighed in on the election early this morning amid his 13-day trip to Asia.[Gillespie] will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA, Trump tweeted.MS-13 and crime will be gone.Vote today, ASAP!Though Trump has not personally campaigned for the Republican, Northams campaign has attempted to tie the president to Gillespie, banking on Trumps unpopularity in the state to help secure what would be the fourth gubernatorial victory for Democrats in the past five Virginia races.The New Jersey election has been dominated by talk of Christie, who is among the least popular governors in U.S. history, based on polls of his job approval.Murphy has argued that a Guadagnos governorship would represent a continuation of Christies tenure, while Guadagno has pointed to moments of disagreement with her boss to attempt to distance herself from the two-term governor and former Republican presidential primary candidate.Washington Post via AP, FILE Trump has been notably quiet on the race in the traditionally blue state where Murphy has led Guadagno by consistent double-digit margins in polls ranging back to the spring.Recent polls show the Democrat with a lead of between 10-15 points.Surveys of Virginia voters show a markedly closer race, with Northam outpolling Gillespie by as much as 9 percentage points in one poll, while falling within the margin of error of another.Polls close in Virginia at 7 p.m. EST and in New Jersey at 8 p.m. EST.
Transgender Virginia candidate could make history and other races to watch:::::Elections at the state and local levels are being held across the country, with a number of notable candidates in the races.Among them is Danica Roem, who would be Virginia's first openly transgender elected official if she manages to unseat 13-term Virginia House of Delegates incumbent Bob Marshall.Here are a few to keep an eye on: Virginia House of Delegates All 100 seats in the House of Delegates are up for election.Republicans hold 66 out of 100 seats in the chamber and Democrats are not expected to be able to take back the legislature, but there are a number of higher-profile races that garnered national attention.The exact number of seats that Democrats are able to pick up could be a good indicator of the strength of the party's brand in different parts of a swing state like Virginia.Forty-three of the 88 Democratic candidates running for the House of Delegates are women.Virginia races of note: 13th district - Roem (D) v.

Labour: Priti Patel must face probe or quit over Israeli trip:::::Image copyright PA Priti Patel must be investigated for holding unofficial meetings during a holiday in Israel or "do the decent thing and resign", Labour has said.The international development secretary apologised on Tuesday for holding 12 meetings, including one with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, on a private trip.In the Commons, Labour's Kate Osamor said it was a "black and white case" of the ministerial code being broken.But minister Alistair Burt said policy did not change as a result of the trip.Ms Patel was not in the Commons to face an urgent question about her actions because she is on a pre-arranged visit to Africa, a situation which Labour said was "simply not acceptable".The BBC understands Ms Patel suggested some of Britain's aid budget go to the Israeli army, after the visit in August.She asked her officials to see if Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area.The BBC understands the Foreign Office advised that because Britain did not officially recognise Israel's annexation of the area, it would be hard for the Department for International Development to work there.Speaking in the Commons, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt defended Ms Patel's "perfectly legitimate" right to raise the matter - saying it was within the context of providing medical help for Syrian refugees who could not get assistance in their own country.But he said the idea had been rejected because ministers did not think it would be "appropriate".'Contrite' He told MPs that the Foreign Office learned of her visit on 24 August, while she was still in Israel, but after a number of key meetings had already taken place.He said Ms Patel had been "absolutely contrite" for "getting the sequencing wrong" in terms of informing officials but Mrs May accepted her apology and now regarded the matter "as closed".But Labour's Kate Osamor said Ms Patel's actions were covered by the existing code and demanded a probe into what she did during the trip and what action she sought upon her return.The opposition says there are "strong grounds" to believe Ms Patel is responsible for "multiple breaches" include failing to act in an open and transparent manner, not abiding by the principle of collective responsibility and not being honest about the nature and number of meetings she attended."It is hard to think of a more black and white case of breaking the ministerial code," Ms Osamor said."It is time the secretary of state either faces a Cabinet Office investigation or does the decent thing and just resigns".The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said local UK diplomats in Israel probably first became aware of her visit on 24 August because that was when the opposition leader she met, Yair Lapid, first tweeted about their meeting.The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures, including Mr Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party.No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner, Lord Polak.Ms Patel has admitted how the meetings were set up "did not accord with the usual procedures".Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was "extremely unwise" for Ms Patel to have held secret meetings with Israeli officials.Image copyright PA Image caption Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK, which took place last week "Not only did she not tell the Foreign Office directly, so far as I'm aware the British Embassy in Israel wasn't aware that this was happening.Now that just shouldn't be done... it's not just a question of courtesy," he said.Lord Ricketts, former head of the diplomatic service, told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight that he couldn't think of a precedent "where a senior minister visits a country, has an extensive programme like this without the Foreign Office, the foreign secretary or even the ambassador in the country knowing about it".However International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was not "in any way forbidden" to speak to the prime minister of another country without telling the foreign secretary.He added: "I find it utterly unsurprising that the international aid secretary would want to talk to charities while she's on holiday in a particular area about whether or not we can use the British aid budget to diminish the humanitarian problems there."Ms Patel, who is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel, has admitted a "lack of precision" for suggesting last week that Boris Johnson knew about the trip, and that only two meetings had taken place when she attended 12.Downing Street, which has called for the ministerial code to be clarified in this area, said Ms Patel had acknowledged she had behaved in an "improper way" and would not do so again.
Sacked Labour minister Carl Sargeant found dead:::::An ex-Welsh Labour minister who faced a party investigation into allegations about his personal conduct has taken his own life, it is understood.Carl Sargeant, 49, lost his job as cabinet secretary for communities and children last Friday.He was suspended from Labour after the first minister learned of a number of alleged incidents involving women.A family statement said they were "devastated beyond words" at the loss of "the glue that bound us together".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the death was "deeply shocking news".Mr Sargeant, who was married and had two children, was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on Tuesday morning.He was sacked from his Welsh Government job after allegations about his behaviour were passed to First Minister Carwyn Jones' office.Mr Jones had said on Monday he felt he had no choice but to refer the matter to the party.Mr Sargeant had vowed to clear his name.The Welsh Assembly's business for Tuesday was cancelled as a mark of respect following his death, and meetings on Wednesday and Thursday will also not take place.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Welsh Assembly members pay tribute to Carl Sargeant In a statement Mr Sargeant's family said: "Carl was a much loved husband, father and friend."He wasn't simply a part of our family.He was the glue that bound us together."He was the most kind and caring husband, father, son and friend.We are devastated beyond words, and we know our grief will be shared by all those who knew and loved him."Image caption Police were called to an address in Connah's Quay on Tuesday Analysis by Vaughan Roderick, BBC Welsh affairs editor The Senedd, in the wake of the death of former Welsh Government minister Carl Sargeant, is a place in shock.I do not remember an atmosphere anything like this.There is, among some senior Labour figures, a growing sense of concern and anger at the process where the government or the Labour Party appear not to have exercised their duty of care over Mr Sargeant after he faced accusations about his behaviour.There are people who spoke to Mr Sargeant on Tuesday morning who were told that he still did not know what the allegations were.Carwyn Jones's future could be on the line here.This is a trauma that could become a political crisis unless he comes up with the answers that Labour AMs in particular want to hear.More from Vaughan Paying tribute, the first minister said: "Carl was a friend as well as a colleague and I am shocked and deeply saddened by his death."He made a big contribution to Welsh public life and fought tirelessly for those he represented both as a minister and as a local assembly member."The prime minister's spokesman said in relation to the "sad news" about the death of Carl Sargeant, that Theresa May's "heart goes out to Carl Sargeant's friends and family".Mr Corbyn said the AM was "somebody who represented our party" and "worked hard to represent his communities".The Labour leader said that all allegations must be examined and pursued but added: "There must also be great pastoral care and support given to everybody involved in these accusations, and also that we deal with them, all parties, as quickly as possible."Speaking through tears, former local government minister Leighton Andrews told BBC Radio Wales: "Carl Sargeant was loved.He was loved across the political divide.He was loved by the people in his own community."Carl was a unique politician.He arrived in the assembly from the factory floor.He grew up and still lived in the council estate that helped shape his roots in Connah's Quay - he was still very much part of that community."My understanding is that Carl was still not aware of the detail of the allegations against him even though, I'm told, this morning."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ex-Plaid AM Rhodri Glyn Thomas: "Carl clearly felt he'd been found guilty" Former Plaid Cymru AM Rhodri Glyn Thomas said Mr Sargeant "clearly felt he had been found guilty before he had a chance to defend himself."So I think we need to develop a system which is fair to everybody, which defends everybody, but doesn't place people in a position where they feel they have no opportunity whatsoever to fight their cause."Tributes were paid across the political divide on Tuesday.Conservative Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he was "shocked and saddened" by the news, adding: "My heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues."Elin Jones, assembly presiding officer, said Mr Sargeant "served the people of Alyn and Deeside with pride and determination" and that he had made an "enormous contribution to the development of this democratic institution".Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Our Parliament has lost a stalwart and many of us have lost a friend."Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: "Carl Sargeant made a significant contribution to Welsh politics, both as an assembly member and a government minister."UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton described him as a "gentle giant" who would be "missed across the party divide".Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams, who was a colleague of Mr Sargeant's in the Welsh Government, said: "Not only was Carl a dedicated local AM, but he was an effective government minister who had a significant impact across political life at a national and community level."FC Nomads, the Connah's Quay football team that Mr Sargeant was president of, cancelled all games this weekend in a mark of respect.North Wales Police Supt Mark Pierce said police were called at about 11:30 GMT on Tuesday to a report that a man's body had been found at an address in Connah's Quay."The man has been formally identified as local AM Carl Sargeant.His next of kin have been informed and police are supporting the family," he said."North Wales Police are not treating his death as suspicious and the matter has been referred to HM Coroner."
Boris Johnson sorry if Zaghari-Ratcliffe remarks 'caused anxiety':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said "she was just a mum on holiday" Boris Johnson has said he is sorry if his remarks about a British-Iranian mother caused anxiety to her family.The foreign secretary had been criticised for saying Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been jailed in Iran, had been training journalists there.A charity said the remarks could worsen her sentence.She had been in Iran on holiday when she was arrested, it said.Mr Johnson told MPs he was sorry if his words were "so taken out of context" as "to cause any kind of anxiety".The UK government had "no doubt" she was on holiday when she was arrested, he said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Johnson called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained at Tehran Airport in April 2016 and is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, although the official charges have never been made public.She has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action (the corporation's international development charity), but has always said the 2016 visit was so her daughter Gabriella, who is three, could meet her grandparents.She was summoned back to court on 4 November, where Mr Johnson's comment was cited as new evidence as to what she was doing in Iran.Mr Johnson had told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 1 November: "When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it."[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed.And that I find extraordinary, incredible."Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said Mr Johnson had done a "good thing" in clarifying his comments, and asked him to try to visit his wife in Iran."It's important that the judiciary understands that the British government thinks she is innocent," he said.He said he hoped his wife and daughter, a British citizen - who is with her grandparents in Iran - can return home before Christmas.Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said she saw a "direct correlation" between Mr Johnson's original remarks and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's treatment in Iran.She said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had "never trained journalists" at the charity.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson is asked if he will apologise to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family Mr Johnson told MPs his previous remarks to the foreign affairs committee "could have been clearer".He said: "My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime - not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been engaged in such activity."I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect, and I'm glad to provide this clarification."Later, when MP Layla Moran asked him if he would apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family, he said: "Of course I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family."He said he did not believe his comments had "had any impact on the judicial process" in Iran.Johnson's job is safe By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent: Boris Johnson is in hot water again.It will not, however, result in his dismissal from the cabinet.In an effort to hose the situation down and minimise any damage to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, the foreign secretary told his Iranian counterpart that he accepted his remarks at the committee "could have been clearer".He said he was seeking to condemn "the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime."But that is not what he said to the Commons committee last week - and Labour MPs are furious at this latest diplomatic fumble by the Foreign Secretary.The foreign secretary said his comments had no impact on the case in Iran, a view echoed by his Iranian counterpart.That certainly helps Mr Johnson weather this latest storm.But more fundamentally, Theresa May does not have the political strength to dismiss one of the Cabinet's big Brexit-supporting beasts.More from Ben: Boris Johnson weathers latest storm Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent Mr Johnson had earlier called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to say his remarks provided "no justifiable basis" for further legal action and that he intended to visit Iran before the end of the year to discuss the case.Mr Zarif told the foreign secretary the developments in the case over the weekend were "unrelated" to Mr Johnson's remarks, a Foreign Office statement added.The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments "shed new light" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe "had visited the country for anything but a holiday".Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies all the allegations against her, but lost her final appeal in April.She has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the government in Tehran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been eligible for parole under the early release scheme from 23 November.Mr Ratcliffe told the Press Association that his wife could now face a fresh trial before that date to block her chance of freedom."I think the one thing the foreign secretary could do to make amends would be if he went to visit her in the next few weeks before her trial," he said.Mother caught in Iran power struggle Image copyright Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Image caption Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was in Iran so her daughter could meet her grandparents By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian Service: The case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is first and foremost a story of terrible personal suffering for a young woman, her husband and their baby girl.Eighteen months into a five-year sentence, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces the prospect of up to 16 years in an Iranian jail.It is also, however, a story of an internal power struggle in Iran, as well as of the nation's deeply difficult relationship with the UK.Read more from Rana
Brexit minister Steve Baker attacked over Brexit impact study 'delay':::::Image caption Steve Baker questioned Labour MPs' motives Brexit minister Steve Baker says it will take "no more than three weeks" to publish official reports on the impact of Brexit on Britain's economy.The government had been ordered to publish the reports immediately by Commons speaker John Bercow.But Mr Baker said officials needed more time to "collate" the information.He was accused of a "cover up" and of being in contempt of Parliament by opposition MPs and some on his own side.He rejected these claims, saying time was needed to "bring together this information in a way that is accessible".And he questioned the motives of Labour MPs calling for immediate publication, asking them: "Whose side are they on?"He accused Labour of pursuing anti-Brexit stories and insisted the 58 studies did not include "qualitative" analysis of the impact of Brexit on the economy as they were expecting.Labour's Pat McFadden said the minister's questioning of MPs' patriotism "cannot stand" and demanded the studies be handed over to the Commons Brexit committee in un-redacted form straight away.Image caption Hillary Benn is calling for un-redacted information Committee chairman Hillary Benn said the un-censored documents should be released to him without delay and it "should be for the committee to decide in what form they are published".Conservative MP Anna Soubry - who campaigns against Brexit - accused Mr Baker of "gross contempt" of Parliament by not publishing the documents.Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, who originally requested the documents through a Freedom of Information request, accused the minister of mounting a "cover-up".Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone also added his voice to those calling for the immediate publication.But the minister was backed by several Conservative MPs, including the Brexit committee's deputy chairman, John Whittingdale, who said he accepted Mr Baker's reasons for the delay.The government had originally sought to keep the 58 studies secret, saying they would undermine Brexit talks.They were effectively forced into agreeing to their publication by a Labour motion last week in the Commons.Labour MP Matthew Pennycook, who raised the issue by asking the urgent question in the Commons, said: "This farce has dragged on for far too long.There can be no further delay - and ministers just need to get on with it."Mr Baker told him: "We will provide this information to the (Brexit) committee as soon as possible.We currently expect this to be in no more than three weeks."After the session ended, SNP Commons leader Pete Wishart disclosed he had written to the Speaker to formally make an allegation of contempt for "refusing to fully comply with a binding vote" of the House - which Mr Bercow said he would study "most carefully".
Damian Green and Bob Quick quizzed by Cabinet Office inquiry:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Damian Green's conduct is being investigated by the Cabinet Office First Secretary of State Damian Green gave evidence to a Cabinet Office inquiry into his conduct earlier on Tuesday, the BBC understands.The inquiry, which is being held behind closed doors, quizzed former senior police officer Bob Quick on Monday.It is examining Mr Quick's claims pornography was found on a computer in Mr Green's Commons office during a police investigation in 2008-09.Mr Green has denied the allegations saying they were a "political smear".The inquiry is also looking at a separate claim that Mr Green, who is Theresa May's second-in-command, made inappropriate advances towards a female Conservative activist in 2015.He also denies that allegation and has provided the inquiry with text messages between the pair as part of his evidence, BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said.No timescale has been set for how long the inquiry will take but it's thought that it will be quite short, added our correspondent.Image copyright PA Image caption Bob Quick led the investigation into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's office being searched Mr Green was briefly arrested in 2008 during what was a controversial inquiry into Home Office leaks.His Commons office and home were also searched but no charges of any kind were brought.Mr Green has said the police never told him at the time that any improper material had been found on a parliamentary computer, condemning the claims as "disreputable political smears" which "amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination".He has suggested Mr Quick, who was forced to resign as the UK's top anti-terror officer in 2009 following a security blunder which compromised a potential operation, was a "discredited" figure but the former officer is standing by the claims.Mr Quick, Scotland Yard's former assistant commissioner, told MPs in 2009 the leak inquiry had been "complicated by the existence of private material on the computer removed from Mr Green's parliamentary office".
Brexit: Ministers publish post-EU trade legislation:::::Image copyright AFP Details of the government's post-Brexit trade policy have been published.Ministers say the Trade Bill includes provisions for the UK to implement existing EU trade agreements and help ensure firms can still access foreign government contracts worth 1.3tn.It will also create a new trade remedies body to defend UK businesses against injurious trade practices.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said firms needed "as much stability as possible" on the day the UK leaves.But Labour questioned why the bill was being published on the day Parliament rises for a week-long recess, suggesting ministers wanted to "minimise scrutiny".And unions said workers' rights must not be sacrificed on the altar of doing "dodgy deals" with countries with insufficient employment protections.The UK cannot sign or negotiate trade deals before its scheduled departure from the EU in March 2019.However, ministers say they can "scope" out future deals with key trade partners, such as the US, Australia and New Zealand.Despite its publication, the Trade Bill, one of nine pieces of new legislation in the pipeline to prepare the ground for Brexit, will not be debated by MPs until a later date.Mr Fox said the point of the bill was to "provide as much stability as possible" for businesses on the day Britain leaves the EU and to prevent market instability.But looking beyond that, the UK wanted to negotiate "more liberal" trade agreements to "provide even better market access than we have through our EU membership"."One of our worries is that global trade is not opening up," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and the UK wanted to "use its influence to get a more liberal global trading system" once it had left the EU.'Ramshackle' But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the "ramshackle bill" offered no protection for workers' rights and for public services like the NHS from foreign contractors."The Trade Bill must guarantee that the price of entry to a trade deal involving Britain is signing up to the strongest protections for workers and public services," she said.On the eve of the bill's publication, one of Donald Trump's leading allies said he was optimistic that the UK and US will sign a free trade deal after Brexit.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the BBC there had already been a "joint scoping exercise" in Washington in July on a free trade agreement and another similar meeting will be held in London next week."We're huge trading partners with each other and our economies are in many ways more similar to each other than either of us is to most of Europe," he said."So there's all the logic in the world for the US and the UK to be not only good trading partners, but FTA partners," he said.Mr Ross, who met Theresa May and other senior ministers during a two-day visit, identified continued "passporting" of financial services, compliance with EU food standards on GM crops and chlorine-washed chicken and future trade tariffs as areas that could pose problems in negotiations between the nations.
'UK wellbeing rises after Brexit vote':::::Image copyright Getty Images In the year after the UK narrowly voted to exit the European Union, there was a small but significant increase in the population's feeling of wellbeing, official statistics show.The improvements in areas such as life satisfaction and happiness were seen only in England, however.Elsewhere, the rates flatlined.People in Northern Ireland continued to report the highest levels of wellbeing.Rates of anxiety increased slightly, but not significantly.To obtain the Office for National Statistics data, more than 100,000 adult UK residents were asked to answer the following questions, on a scale of nought to 10, with nought being "not at all" and 10 being "completely": Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?A higher proportion of people reported very high levels of life satisfaction, happiness and feelings that life was worthwhile in the year ending June 2017 compared with the previous year.The average ratings at the end of June 2017 were: 7.7 out of 10 for life satisfaction 7.9 out of 10 for feeling worthwhile 7.5 out of 10 for happiness 2.9 out of 10 for anxiety The ONS statistical bulletin suggests possible social and economic factors that might help explain the results."Employment and job satisfaction, our health, the quality of our relationships and our financial situation are just some of the aspects of our lives shown to have an effect," it says.For example, the employment rate is at its highest level since comparable records began in 1971 and the unemployment rate is at its joint lowest since 1975.There have also been improvements is gross domestic product per head and net national disposable income per head.But the ONS points out that real household disposable income per head has fallen for the fourth quarter in a row.Over the year the data covers there have been "various situations of uncertainty", says the ONS - a new prime minister, a vote to leave the EU and several terror attacks."Considering this, it may be surprising that levels of personal wellbeing are increasing.However, it is important to note these figures are only reported at a country and national level, and are presented over the year.It is therefore possible that any sudden or individual change in personal wellbeing may not be seen in the data," it says.

Paradise Papers: Isle of Man says tax laws 'transparent':::::Image caption The island's government has invited the UK Treasury to investigate its aircraft importation practices The Isle of Man has said it does not welcome those "seeking to evade or aggressively avoid taxes", following the Paradise Papers revelations.Its tax practices have come under scrutiny after documents showed Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his 16.5m luxury jet by importing it via the island in 2013.Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the Isle of Man was "open and transparent".The UK Treasury is now investigating the importation of jets to the island.On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme said Hamilton was given a 3.3m VAT refund after he imported a Bombardier Challenger 605 into the Isle of Man.While the 32-year-old F1 driver's planned use of the jet was predominantly for business purposes, the programme saw documents which suggested he intended to make private flights about a third of the time - with his social media accounts showing evidence of this.To try and get round EU and UK rules banning VAT refunds on aircraft used by private individuals, Hamilton's advisers formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man, the leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby suggest.The jet was then leased back to Hamilton.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: How Lewis Hamilton got a 3.3m VAT refund In an emergency statement to the Isle of Man government, Mr Quayle said an internal review of the practice found no evidence of wrongdoing and he said he had no reason to believe its Customs and Excise Division had been involved in the mistaken refunding of VAT.In October, the Manx government invited the Treasury to conduct an assessment of the practice of importing business jets via the island into the EU, and promised "all appropriate action" would be taken against individuals or companies if there was any evidence of wrongdoing.Mr Quayle confirmed that the assessment had begun, with the "scoping" of it due to be published this month and work to be completed in 2018."The VAT treatment of the importation of aircraft into the EU is a highly technical and complex area in which the Isle of Man follows the same policy, laws and rules as the United Kingdom," he said."However, we acted swiftly and decisively and have taken action to demonstrate that the Isle of Man is a well-regulated, open and transparent member of the international community."'We will not be complacent' Panorama also raised questions about a law passed by the Isle of Man government in 2005 - before the European Savings Directive (EUSD) began.The EUSD was introduced to stop people from one part of Europe putting assets in an account in another country without declaring it.Most of the people targeted by EUSD were therefore already evading tax.Tax adviser Mark Morris claimed an Isle of Man regulator was aware the new law would help tax evaders.Image caption Chief Minister Howard Quayle said he was proud of how the island had taken the international tax agenda foward Mr Quayle said the law was never utilised on the island and tried to distance his administration from the decision to enact it."It is difficult for any administration today to understand or attempt to justify the thinking made by an administration nearly 13 years ago," he said."We are considering all the allegations made to determine next steps and what action can be taken in relation to the past."Mr Quayle added that "where the Isle of Man's integrity is challenged we will not be complacent", and he was "proud of the role" the island had taken "in moving the international tax agenda forward"."However it cannot - and should not - be overlooked that to truly combat evasion and abuse, action not only needs to be global but it also needs to be implemented consistently and effectively."
RHI scandal 'struck at the heart of NI democracy':::::Image caption There are about 2,000 boilers accredited to the RHI scheme The independent public inquiry into a flawed green energy scheme has been told that the scandal struck at the heart of Northern Ireland's democratic institutions.The claim was made at the opening of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme inquiry by David Scoffield QC.The government scheme, which started in 2012, helped collapse the Stormont Assembly in January.It encouraged businesses to switch from fossil fuels to biomass or woodchip.But a lack of cost controls meant it could have an overspend of 700m over 20 years.The inquiry, which is being led by retired appeal court judge Sir Patrick Coughlin, opened on Tuesday morning.He said that the inquiry would seek to be a "measured, objective, independent and publicly-transparent investigation".He added that the inquiry team had already examined one million pieces of documentary evidence.Image caption David Scoffield QC making his opening remarks to the inquiry on Tuesday morning Mr Scoffield, counsel for the inquiry, outlined some of the documentary evidence including text messages and emails written by politicians at the time of an "explosive" interview given by former DUP enterprise minister Jonathan Bell to the BBC.Mr Bell criticised his predecessor in the job, the DUP leader and former first minister, Arlene Foster, as well as some advisers.He was suspended from the party after the interview.Mr Scoffield added that both Mr Bell and Mrs Foster would give evidence to the inquiry voluntarily, along with five DUP special advisers: Timothy Cairns; Andrew Crawford; Stephen Brimstone; John Robinson and Timothy Johnston.Image copyright RHI inquiry Image caption Sir Patrick Coghlin is chairing the inquiry, which is expected to take several months He told the hearing that public concern had reached "fever pitch" as outcry over the scheme grew and that the inquiry would investigate a number of key allegations.This included what he described as "the most damning claim" - that politicians and their special advisers had interfered to keep the scheme open when it ought to have been closed, by delaying the introduction of cost controls.He said that the allegation of interference created the impression to the public of "improper patronage" and that it was claimed some had a "conflict of interest" because they personally, or their relatives, had an interest in the scheme.'More questions than answers' He said other claims that would be investigated by the inquiry include: Weaknesses in the scheme meant boiler owners had a "perverse incentive" to burn more fuel to earn more subsidy Allegations of fraud That the bill would have to be met by Northern Ireland's taxpayers That there were opportunities to fix flaws in the RHI scheme that were missed Mr Scoffield added that while there were "no obvious victims" of the debacle, it would be wrong to say there were no victims at all.He said many people were angry by how the scheme had panned out and it would be "hard to find a taxpayer" who did not have serious questions about the use of significant amounts of public money to pay "unplanned debt" over the scheme.Image caption RHI was a government scheme, started in 2012, which encouraged businesses to switch from fossil fuels to biomass or woodchip.He said only the final report would address issues of responsibility for problems in the scheme.Mr Scoffield said the inquiry would not address issues of civil or criminal liability, or whether individual applications were legitimate under the terms of the scheme's regulations.The inquiry team is investigating the non-domestic green energy scheme, the overspend from which might have to be paid out of Northern Ireland's block grant from Westminster.The row over the handling of the crisis contributed to the collapse of devolution in early 2017.The scheme was introduced in 2012 by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI).On Tuesday, a statement outlining the RHI scheme "from inception to the present day" was released online by the Department for the Economy, the department that replaced DETI.Image caption Many of the boilers, like this one, burn wood pellets The department later uploaded a series of documents onto the RHI inquiry website.They shed more light on the department's own take on what went wrong with the scheme.These documents refer to a handover note from an official at the then Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.The official was involved in the day-to-day running of the RHI scheme.When he left the department in 2014 - and there was a high turnover of staff in the department at that time - he left a detailed note that contained a number of priorities that required immediate attention.They included a review of RHI tariffs and consideration of cost controls to prevent excessive payments.The review never happened.And the Department for the Economy comments: "Unfortunately these points were not acted upon.The department commissioned consultants PwC to examine why this happened but the work was suspended before conclusions could be drawn."The department adds the concerns in the handover note were not escalated and RHI was not among the top issues raised in a briefing for the new permanent secretary in July 2014.Cost controls The inquiry will look at the introduction of the scheme, the oversight of it, the introduction of controls in 2015 and the suspension of the scheme the following year.In particular, it will consider why the Northern Ireland scheme did not contain the same cost controls from the outset as the one in Great Britain, which it mirrored.Key allegations it will address include that a spike of applications in Autumn 2015 was caused by firms being aware, in advance, of impending cuts to tariffs.Image caption Firms could legitimately earn sizeable subsidy by burning the fuel It will also investigate whether there was political interference by DUP special advisers to delay the introduction of cost controls.That has been denied by the special advisers.Fourteen witnesses will give evidence between now and Christmas.It is expected that Mrs Foster and Mr Bell will not give evidence until 2018.Image caption Many of the boilers are in agriculture businesses including poultry The RHI scheme was shut to new applicants in 2016.One year cost controls have been applied by the Department for the Economy that have drastically reduced the 2017/18 in-year overspend.But they expire at the end of the financial year.Image caption One-year cost controls are currently in place The department has announced plans to extend them for a year, but that will require assembly approval or the decision of a direct rule minister.The cost controls are also the subject of a legal action by boiler owners who claim the cuts in tariffs were illegal.They claim the projected overspend is vastly inflated and could be in the region of 160m, not 700m, over 20 years.Judgement in that case has been reserved.
Mobile phone tracking data 'could replace census questions':::::Image copyright PA Thousands of people have had their movements tracked by the Office for National Statistics to see if they can find out where they live and work.The ONS is trying to build up a picture of people's daily commute - something it normally asks about in the census.Mobile phones create a record of every location visited by the user if the phone is switched on.Statisticians believe the data, which is anonymised, could one day replace census questions in England and Wales.But it admitted it would need to carry out "extensive evaluation" of "privacy impacts" if it went down that route.'Children's mobiles' The experiment was carried out using data from subscribers to the Vodafone mobile phone network.It was restricted to subscribers aged over 18 and did not include people who use pay-as-you-go phones.It tracked where phones were overnight, to work out where users lived, and where they travelled during the day, which was assumed to be their place of work.It focused on three London boroughs - Lambeth, Southwark and Croydon - and looked at how far people travelled to work during a four week period in March and April last year.It painted a slightly different picture to the 2011 census, with more people appearing not to leave their home borough on their daily commute.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Office for National Statistics tracked phone users around London Some of this might be down to students, who may have been "mistakenly inferred as commuters as their movement behaviour will be similar", the report said."It's also likely that some parents will take out subscriptions for their children's mobiles," said the report, so in future "children of secondary school age and in higher education might therefore also be included".Final census?The mobile data underestimated some commuter flows, such as the number of people travelling into Lambeth every day.The study may have failed to indentify commuters with "non-standard work patterns, such as night or shift workers; depot workers and those on zero-hours contracts" or those that were ill on holiday, the report said.The ONS is now asking for feedback to decide whether the new system will be rolled out more widely.The government and local authorities use this kind of census household and working patterns data to plan housing developments and transport networks.The census has been carried out every 10 years since 1801, with the exception of 1941, to provide a snapshot of the size of the country's population and details about how people live and work.But the government wants the next census, in 2021, to be the final one to be carried out using the traditional paper-based questionnaire method.It has asked the Office for National Statistics to explore how it can get the information it needs from alternative sources.
Drop the puerile slogans, Sir John Major tells party leaders:::::Sir John Major has hit out at the use of "puerile" political slogans as he called for more honesty in government about the challenges facing the UK.The ex-prime minister said political leaders should avoid "deceitful" sound bites and be more candid about the limitations of what government can do.In a speech in London, he recounted how his use of the phrase "back to basics" in 1993 had ended up "perverting a thoroughly worthwhile social policy".Sir John was PM between 1990 and 1997.Addressing an audience in Westminster Abbey, Sir John also warned about factionalism in his party and the British political system as a whole and of the risk that "partisan" voices "appealing to the extremes" posed to democracy."The anti-European right wish to control the Conservative Party," he said."The neo-Marxist left wish to dominate Labour.Both are making headway in a battle for the soul of their respective parties."In a strong attack on what he suggested was the debasing of modern politics, he called for special advisers to be reined in, saying they were being used as "attack dogs", leaking material and usurping civil servants.'Worth nothing' He suggested the language of politics was being corrupted by the tendency of politicians to fall back on pre-prepared and meaningless sound bites.Sir John, who has called Brexit a historic blunder, cited the Leave campaign's promise during the EU referendum to "take back control" as a "memorable example of pitch-perfect absurdity".Such slogans, he argued, "convey nothing, explain nothing and are worth nothing"."As voters hear our elected representatives uttering puerile slogans instead of explaining policy, it is no wonder if respect for them melts away.Slogans and sound bites are a deceit."Electors deserve the truth in plain English, not in fairy tales."Sir John conceded his own use of the phrase "back to basics" in his 1993 Tory conference speech - in which he called for more emphasis on personal responsibility, respect for law and order and a return to "the old values of neighbourliness, decency and courtesy" - was counter-productive.Because it was followed by a string of sex and financial scandals involving ministers, the speech came to be associated with personal morality and probity."They [slogans] can mislead," he added."I once used the phrase back to basics and it was taken up to pervert a thoroughly worthwhile social policy."Theresa May was criticised for her frequent use of the phrase "strong and stable" during the election campaign while Jeremy Corbyn relied heavily on his claim to be "for the many not the few".In his speech, Sir John warned that the massive task of extricating the UK from the EU was "crowding" out other vital issues and said his party needed to talk more about levels of income disparity and regional imbalances which "surely cannot be permitted to continue as they are".
Party leaders agree new complaints procedure, says Theresa May:::::Image copyright Reuters Westminster party leaders have agreed to introduce a new grievance procedure for staff to deal with misconduct allegations, Theresa May has said.The prime minister said the measures, which will also include face-to-face human resources support, were an "important step forward".They were backed by Labour's Jeremy Corbyn following cross-party talks.It comes as several Conservative and Labour MPs are investigated over allegations of sexual misconduct.The new grievance procedure should be in place next year, said Mrs May, with the new face-to-face support service, an upgrade of an existing complaints hotline, to be introduced by the end of the month.Speaking after the meeting in her parliamentary office, Mrs May said: "I think if this hasn't happened to you it's difficult to appreciate the impact that being a victim of this sort of behaviour can have, it simply has a lasting impact on people."We need to do more to stop these abuses of power and I'm pleased that having convened this meeting of party leaders today we have agreed a way forward," she added.'Independent route' Mr Corbyn has called for training for MPs in managing their offices and a new independent body to support staff who suffer mistreatment.In a letter to the prime minister ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbyn said MPs should undergo training after each general election in employment standards.He said a new body should be set up to provide an "independent route" to counselling, reporting and representation through complaints procedures, and have powers to recommend reporting of criminal allegations to the police.He said political parties should encourage all staff to join a trade union, as they can provide a "vital mechanism" for strengthening effective action and protection from sexual and other harassment and abuse at work.'Disappointing' Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, who last week called for MPs to be educated on consent, said any new training programme should come into force immediately, rather than after an election.The SNP Ian Blackford said that although the proposal for a working group came from the prime minister there was "cross-party consensus" on the plan."This is about a working group that can work on a consensual basis, on a cross-party basis, to make sure we can have standards - first class standards, gold plated standards - that we can be proud of", he said.But Labour MPs who have led the campaign to crackdown on sexual abuse and harassment said the reforms did not go far enough.Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, said: "Find this utterly disappointing.Great a grievance procedure, the victims will be thrilled.What if they don't work in Parliament?"What about sanctions, what about specialist support from actual professionals who know what they are talking about on sexual violence/harassment."And Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, added: "Still much work to do making parliament safe if this only comes into place in a year and only covers MP staff."
Fears for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after Boris Johnson remark:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran A charity fears a British-Iranian woman held in Iran could have her prison sentence doubled following remarks made by the foreign secretary.Boris Johnson told a Commons committee that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arrested at Tehran Airport in 2016, was "teaching people journalism".The Thomson Reuters Foundation said she was seeing family and urged Mr Johnson to correct his "serious mistake".The Foreign Office said the remarks could not justify new charges.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is currently serving a five-year sentence after Iran tried her on charges of trying to overthrow the government.She denies all the allegations against her.'Used as evidence' She lost her final appeal in April 2017 but has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action (the corporation's international development charity), but insisted the 2016 visit was for her daughter to meet her grandparents.Image copyright PA Image caption Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared before MPs last Wednesday Mr Johnson was appearing before MPs on the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 1 November, and criticised Iran over the case before saying: "When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism as I understand it."[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed.And that I find extraordinary, incredible."Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to court where the foreign secretary's comments were cited as evidence against her.At this hearing she was accused of engaging in "propaganda against the regime".The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments "shed new light" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe "had visited the country for anything but a holiday".Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, called on Mr Johnson to "immediately correct the serious mistake he made".Image copyright Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Image caption Thomson Reuters Foundation says the comments "can only worsen her sentence" Ms Villa said there was a "direct correlation" between Mr Johnson's comments and the unscheduled court appearance."This accusation from Judge Salavati can only worsen her sentence.She is obviously a bargaining chip between the UK government and Iran and this injustice must stop as soon as possible."Whatever is at stake should be paid attention to by the UK government."Labour's Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's constituency, said she is "furious" with Mr Johnson and called on him to "urgently retract" his remarks.'Ensure clarity' A Foreign Office spokesman said the remarks "provide no justifiable basis" to bring further charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe."While criticising the Iranian case against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Foreign Secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven Iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment."The UK will continue to do all it can to secure her release on humanitarian grounds and the foreign secretary will be calling the Iranian foreign minister to raise again his serious concerns about the case and ensure his remarks are not misrepresented."
Lib Dem member 'referred to police over rape allegation':::::Image copyright Getty Images The Liberal Democrats have suspended a party member and referred reported rape allegations to the police.The allegations emerged in a series of tweets over the weekend, which claimed an alleged victim's complaint had been "hushed up" by party HQ.The party said a member was suspended "pending the outcome" of a police probe but gave no further details.It is the first allegation involving the Lib Dems in the misconduct scandal currently engulfing Westminster.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable earlier took part in cross-party talks which resulted in the announcement of a new grievance procedure for staff at Westminster, to be introduced in the New Year.Lib Dem volunteers have set up a website, LibDemsToo, to catalogue "accounts of sexism within the UK Liberal Democrats and useful links for taking action".In a statement, a Lib Dem spokesman said: "If an allegation is made against a party member, the disciplinary procedure is triggered immediately with an investigator talking to witnesses."If someone has an allegation of a criminal nature against a member of the party, we would urge them to go to the police."If they were unable to do so, we would refer it to the police on their behalf.Our party has a clear and robust complaints procedure set out on our website."We take any such complaints extremely seriously."If anyone has any complaints, we would urge them to come forward as set out on our website, and our pastoral care officer will make prompt contact."
Brexit impact studies not what you think, David Davis tells Labour:::::Image copyright PA David Davis has sought to dampen Labour's expectations about a series of official reports on the impact of Brexit on Britain's economy.The government had sought to keep the 58 studies secret, saying they would undermine Brexit talks.Mr Davis was effectively forced into agreeing to their publication by a Labour motion in the House of Commons.But the Brexit secretary claims there has been a misunderstanding about what they contain.In a letter to Labour MP Hillary Benn, he said the analysis ranged from "very high level overarching" work to specific examinations "of certain product lines in specific sectors".But, he added, "it is not, nor has it ever been, a series of discrete impact assessments examining the quantitative impact of Brexit on these sectors"."Given the above, it will take my department - and other departments, since this work draws on inputs from across government - time to collate and bring together this information in a way that it accessible and informative for the committee," he added.He also argued that some sections should remain "private" because they contained "confidential or commercially sensitive information" or details that could damage Brexit talks because they had "been developed to underpin advice to ministers of the negotiation options in various scenarios".He said he would meet Mr Benn, the chairman of the Commons Brexit committee, on Monday to discuss what it would be in the public interest to release.'Not sensible' But Commons speaker John Bercow has told the government it has 24 hours to publish the analyses or say why it hasn't.Responding to a point of order from Labour, following the publication of Mr Davis's letter, Mr Bercow said: "the motion passed on Wednesday obliges ministers to provide the Committee on Exiting the European Union with the impact assessments arising from sector analyses."That should be done very promptly indeed.Failing that, I expect ministers to explain to the House, before we rise tomorrow (Tuesday) evening, why they have not provided them and when they propose to do so."Mr Bercow added that the Brexit secretary had contacted him to say that the government would provide the material before MPs begin a week-long recess on Tuesday.Speaking earlier at the Institute for Government in London, Mr Benn said: "I don't want to publish stuff about negotiating fall-backs, red lines.That would not be sensible."But he stressed that he wanted to see the material "as soon as possible", and that it would be for the committee to decide what information was made public.
Blair agreed 'second term' exit before Granita dinner says Brown:::::Image copyright PA Image caption The two men had a famously fractious relationship as neighbours in Downing Street Gordon Brown says Tony Blair told him in person before a famous 1994 dinner he would one day hand power to him.In his memoirs, Mr Brown says there was "a private but explicit understanding" Mr Blair would make way for him in his second term in office in return for him not contesting the Labour leadership.Their so-called "Granita pact", a reference to the London restaurant they dined in, has entered Labour folklore.Mr Brown says the deal was already done and the meal only "rubber-stamped" it.Mr Brown did ultimately succeed Mr Blair as prime minister in 2007, a decade after Labour first won power, although allies of his have long accused his predecessor of breaking a promise to stand down much earlier.The circumstances which led Mr Brown not to challenge for Labour's leadership after John Smith's sudden death - effectively paving the way for Mr Blair to take the crown - have long been the subject of speculation.The then shadow chancellor was regarded by many in the party as Mr Smith's obvious successor although he opted not to put his name forward, leaving Mr Blair to defeat John Prescott by a large margin.Mr Brown announced his decision to sit out the contest the day after the two men met at the Granita restaurant in Islington, North London, in 31 May.Granita, a once trendy venue near Mr Blair's then home, closed in 2003.'Formality' In his memoir My Life, Our Times, which is published on Tuesday, Mr Brown says the importance of the Granita dinner - which was dramatised in Channel 4 show The Deal - was over-stated, suggesting an agreement between the two men had effectively been agreed a fortnight earlier and the meal was a mere "formality"."I always smile when commentators write that we hammered out a deal in the restaurant," he writes."The Granita discussion merely confirmed what he had already offered and I had already agreed".Two weeks earlier, he said Mr Blair had assured him that he would have control over economic and social policy in a future Labour government and he had specifically "promised" to serve one full term in office if Labour won power at the subsequent election.Mr Blair, he says, told him he had family reasons for only wanting to serve a limited time in Downing Street."He wanted to be free from day-to-day politics to be with his children in their teens - the time of life when parents are most needed.It was a promise he repeated on several occasions."'Partnership' Mr Brown says he decided to accept his colleague's assurances and clear the way for Mr Blair as he was "unwilling to see the party divided in a way that would endanger the prospects for reform".The only major development at the Granita meal, Mr Brown claims, was Mr Blair's talk of the two men forming a partnership that would represent a "new departure for British politics" and his assurance that a future Labour government, unlike its Tory predecessors, would not be a "one-man band".However, Mr Brown says tensions between the two men and their allies quickly surfaced about how his leadership announcement would be presented and whether the two men should take part in a joint photocall as a demonstration of unity.Mr Brown remarks that he was soon "frozen" out of Mr Blair's leadership campaign, setting the tone for years of difficult relations between the two men as prime minister and chancellor between 1997 and 2007."Long into the future, the focus of the 1994 leadership race would wrongly remain on what was said at Granita, he writes."The restaurant did not survive and ultimately neither did our agreement."
Paradise Papers: Lord Ashcroft 'does not control' offshore trust:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltons questions about his offshore trust Lord Ashcroft has denied allegations that he ignored rules around the management of his offshore investments.According to leaked documents, the Tory donor gave assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Punta Gorda Trust in Bermuda in 2000.The leaked Paradise Papers provoked questions as to whether he sometimes made decisions without consulting trust officials.Such action could see the trust challenged by HMRC.The peer denied controlling the trust.In a statement, he said that he has never known the identity of any of the trustees or had any dealings with them."At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."No professional trustee has ever resigned because of anything I may have done," he added.Panorama approached Lord Ashcroft during last month's Conservative Party conference in Manchester but he declined to answer any questions about the trust.He has described two previous Panorama investigations into his affairs as "unashamedly one-sided" and said he had informed BBC director general Tony Hall that he is "simply not prepared to deal with" the programme.'Hugely significant' The 71-year-old former Conservative deputy chairman has given millions of pounds to the party.He fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then-prime minister but remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests.Journalist Peter Oborne said Lord Ashcroft has been a "hugely significant figure" in the Conservative Party over the last 20 years.He said: "Lord Ashcroft has been one of the most significant donors to the... party.But it's not just... that he's been a giver of money, he's also been very important organisationally.He's involved himself in the internal politics."Other documents in the Paradise Papers show Lord Ashcroft has secretly remained non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.Addressing this allegation, he said in his statement: "My position was made public in a statement which I made in March 2010 and to which a link is provided here."Following the change in the law later that year, a change which my statement anticipated, for each of the remaining five years during which I sat in the House of Lords, I was deemed tax resident and domiciled."This is all publicly available information and nothing was produced yesterday by the BBC which suggests different."'Inadequate supervision' The structure of a trust involves one entity legally entrusting a second to look after assets for a third, essentially removing ownership for tax purposes.Wealthy people can legally avoid paying tax on assets that they have given to a trust because they can tell the authorities they no longer own or control the assets in them.But for a trust to work as a tax break, decisions about its assets have to be taken independently by the trustees.Source document Despite the warning, Lord Ashcroft appears to have continued to make decisions about the trust's assets.In October 2000, one of the trustees said: "I would like to emphasize at this point that it is imperative at all times that the trustees are aware of any and all transactions to be entered into prior to transactions occurring."To do otherwise, will only serve to undermine the integrity of the trust as the trustees are being advised of actions taken in connection with trust assets, which should be under their control, after the event."A review of the trust in 2009, discovered that significant payments out had been made that had not been properly recorded.In an internal email, a lawyer representing the trust says: "There have been very large sums of money involved and I am very concerned that there has been inadequate supervision of both transactions and distributions... to put it bluntly we seem to be told nothing whereas we carry the responsibility of acting as trustee."Source document Paperwork then appears to have been put in place retrospectively "to ensure that we have all the relevant trustee and company authorities in place for the transactions which have occured [sic]".'Red flag' Trust experts say anybody who puts their money into a trust could face a challenge by tax authorities if it was felt rules had been abused.Image copyright Hidefumi Nogami, Asahi Shimbun Image caption Lord Ashcroft's trust was based in Bermuda This could include a challenge from HM Revenue and Customs if it was to take the view an overseas trust had been controlled from the UK.Nicholas Shaxson, the author of Treasure Islands, an expose of the workings of tax havens, told Panorama: "On the evidence I have seen, it looks like something that is abusive behaviour and an abusive structure.If the trustees are worried, the trustees are expressing alarm about that, that's a clear red flag."Prof Brooke Harrington, the author of Capital Without Borders, said: "It's important that trustees be independent because the whole concept of a trust is that a settlor gives over legal ownership of an asset to the trustee."That's why you get these tax benefits and other legal benefits from the trust structure."Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures.The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International

Grenfell Tower: 131 families are in hotels, MPs hear:::::Image copyright Getty Images More than 130 families left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire are living in emergency housing, MPs have heard.Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Kensington and Chelsea Council's response in the aftermath of the fire had been "sluggish and chaotic".It comes as the Grenfell taskforce produced a report into the fire, which said the council "failed its community" on 14 June.Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said it had "huge" amounts of work to do.Speaking in the Commons, Mr Javid said residents had been "failed by a system that allowed the fire to happen" and then failed again in the aftermath.He said efforts to rehouse victims had been "painfully slow" - with just 26 out of 204 Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk families given permanent accommodation so far.'Hesitant' homeless He said 122 households had accepted an offer of temporary or permanent accommodation, and 73 had moved in to new homes.The taskforce said residents were "hesitating to accept rehousing offers" because they did not want to lose benefits.Currently, former residents of Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk have their rent, utility bills and council tax suspended for the first 12 months of moving into temporary or permanent accommodation.The council said this created a "financial cliff edge, which the tenants can avoid by remaining in their emergency accommodation".Some residents see the rent-free period as wasted on temporary homes, it said.It voted to extend the rent-free period until summer 2019 in a bid to remove "unintended disincentives".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Marcio and Andreia Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire The Grenfell taskforce, set up in the aftermath of the fire, has spent nine weeks looking at the recovery process run by the council."The report pulls no punches about the fact that there is still significant room for improvement," Mr Javid said.It said 320 families altogether - including not only former residents but also those living in Grenfell's vicinity - were still living in hotels.The report, written by housing and local government experts appointed by the government, said the council needed to work more quickly, and cited accounts of "poor treatment" towards victims.It said many staff did their best to help but there was a leadership vacuum and a distant council that did not know its residents.The report's authors met survivors, concluding that many victims felt no-one was listening to their concerns.It nevertheless praised Kensington and Chelsea for "working hard to develop effective support and services to victims and survivors".Since the fire, many of those at the top of the council have quit, including leader Nick Paget-Brown and chief executive Nicholas Holgate.The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it "entirely" accepted all the taskforce's recommendations and would offer new homes to "all those who want to leave" emergency accommodation by December.Cast a shadow Mrs Campbell said the local authority had "huge amounts of work to do" and understood the need to change.But the report criticised its lack of urgency, saying: "As the council tries to do everything at once, it is doing everything too slowly."It accused council members of lacking a "firm grasp" of the true scale of the recovery operation - saying some believed that "in a few months' time everything shall return to the way it used to be".It said it was "disappointing" that the tower, which is currently a crime scene, had not yet been covered, urging scaffold work to be completed with "greater haste".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why did it take so long to get an aerial platform to the tower block?BBC Newsnight investigates It said visible remains of the burnt-out tower "cast a shadow" over the entire area."Any extended delays will further add to the ongoing trauma that the community is living with," the report said.Mr Javid suggested a number of ways the council could improve - including increasing the pace of their work and the need for "greater empathy and emotional intelligence" towards victims.
Paradise Papers: Queen should apologise, suggests Corbyn:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Queen should apologise,' suggests Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen, among others, should apologise for using overseas tax havens if they were used to avoid taxation in the UK.The Labour leader was asked at the CBI conference whether the Queen should say sorry for making overseas investments.He said anyone putting money into tax havens for the purposes of avoidance should "not just apologise for it, recognise what it does to our society".The BBC has revealed that the Queen's estate has used overseas tax havens.It comes after a leak of confidential papers from Bermuda revealed the secret offshore investments of the rich and famous, including the Queen.Mr Corbyn's spokesman later clarified his comments, saying the Labour leader did not specifically call on the Queen to apologise but thought "anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should acknowledge the damage it does to society".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Queen's private estate invested 10m in offshore funds Mr Corbyn called for a full inquiry, public lists of company ownership, and a new tax enforcement unit to tackle tax evasion.On Sunday, BBC Panorama broadcast the first results of its year-long investigation into the Paradise Papers, a massive leak of financial documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby.The leaks raised questions over tech firm Apple's tax structures, the investments of Conservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft, Everton FC owner Farhad Moshiri, Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, and offshore investments made on the Queen's behalf by the Duchy of Lancaster.Buckingham Palace has not commented on the revelation that the Duchy of Lancaster, which handles the Queen's private wealth, used offshore investments.A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: "We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds.All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate."The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."Criminal investigations HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson vowed to "chase down" anyone trying to hide money offshore and evade tax.He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that HMRC had asked to see the leaked Paradise Papers in order to "look at every case of tax evasion very seriously".Mr Thompson said there were 66 ongoing criminal investigations into the Panama Papers, which in April 2016 exposed tax avoidance and evasion, saying 100m could be retrieved."That gives you some sense about how long quite complicated tax cases take to bring to some sort of fruition," he added.Media playback is unsupported on

people to pay the tax that is due".At the CBI conference, the prime minister said HMRC had collected 160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance since 2010.Mrs May's spokesperson said: "It is important to point out that holding investments offshore is not an automatic sign of wrongdoing, but HMRC has requested to see the papers urgently so it can look into any allegations."But when asked, Mrs May did not commit to a public inquiry into tax revenue lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes.Ashcroft 'ambush' Among the Paradise Papers documents was evidence that Tory donor Lord Ashcroft remained a non-dom and continued to avoid tax despite attempts to make peers pay their full share.Lord Ashcroft has insisted he did not ignore rules in relation to the Punta Gorda offshore trust and said his tax residency was "publicly available information".The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (150m) from his offshore trust in Bermuda.Responding to the programme, Lord Ashcroft wrote: "At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."He also explained why he ran away from a Panorama reporter who approached him for comment, taking refuge in a toilet, saying he was "determined" not to "fall victim to their ambush".Media playback is unsupported on

havens, which is legal.Bermuda's premier David Burt said the territory has a "robust regulatory regime" with the same tax system in place since 1898.He added the UK's tax law allows the use of offshore tax havens.Former Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable, criticised the government for not clamping down on offshore tax havens trading under the British flag.He said: "The Paradise Papers

Westminster sex scandal: Theresa May calls for 'culture of respect':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption May: Allegations must be properly investigated Theresa May has called for a "new culture of respect" ahead of a meeting with other party leaders to discuss the Westminster sexual misconduct scandal.The PM said in a speech to the CBI that people should know their complaints will be investigated properly.It comes as several Conservative and Labour MPs are investigated over claims of sexual misconduct.On Sunday Conservative MP Chris Pincher stepped down as a government whip after allegations about his behaviour.Mr Pincher has also referred himself to police and the Conservative Party's complaints procedure following newspaper reports of allegations about his conduct in 2001 made by a party activist.It follows the resignation of Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary following complaints about his behaviour and amid a Cabinet Office inquiry into the conduct of First Secretary of State Damian Green.Image copyright Conservative Party Image caption Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, who denies wrongdoing, has been suspended from the party after "serious allegations" against him were referred to the police and three other Conservative MPs who deny wrongdoing - Stephen Crabb, Dan Poulter and Daniel Kawczynski - have been referred to the party's disciplinary committee after media allegations about their conduct.Labour has also suspended an MP - Kelvin Hopkins, who denies claims he made inappropriate physical contact with a Labour activist in 2004 - and is investigating a formal complaint made against Clive Lewis, who denies groping a woman.The party has also launched an independent investigation after Labour activist Bex Bailey said she had been raped at a party event in 2011 and discouraged by a senior official from reporting the attack.In a speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference Mrs May said: "We need to establish a new culture of respect at the centre of our public life."One in which everyone can feel confident that they are working in a safe and secure environment, where complaints can be brought forward without prejudice and victims know that these complaints will be investigated properly."Political parties have not always got this right in the past.But I am determined to get it right for the future."She is due to meet other party leaders later to discuss setting up an independent grievance procedure for Parliament."Those working for Members of Parliament should not have to navigate different party systems depending on their employer's political affiliation," the prime minister told the CBI."What has been revealed over the last few weeks has been deeply troubling - and has understandably led to significant public unease."Women and men should be able to work free from the threat or fear of harassment, bullying or intimidation."But for too long the powerful have been able to abuse their power, and their victims have not felt able to speak out."Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the CBI conference that everyone, including businesses, "have a duty to act, and act now" over sexual harassment.He said: "Such abuse, sexism and misogyny is, sadly, very far from being confined to Hollywood and the corridors of power, but is also widespread in our schools and universities, in our businesses and workplaces, in our newspapers and on our TV screens.It is all around us."That must change and business has an essential role to play.All of you need to look hard at yourselves, as we in the Labour Party are doing ourselves, to see how your processes and procedures can be improved.How it can be made easier for women to speak out and for victims to get the support they have a right to expect."Meanwhile, Mr Green, Mrs May's most senior minister, is to be interviewed as part of the Cabinet Office investigation into his conduct.The inquiry was triggered after Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than him, claimed he "fleetingly" touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015, and a year later sent her a "suggestive" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Damian Green said the allegations were from a "tainted and untrustworthy source" Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was "untrue (and) deeply hurtful".The inquiry was broadened after the Sunday Times reported that a statement prepared by ex-Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick alleged pornography was discovered by officers searching Mr Green's parliamentary office following a spate of leaks of Home Office information in 2008.Mr Green said the claims were "completely untrue" and "political smears".
Jeremy Corbyn backs CBI demand for Brexit transition deal:::::Image copyright EPA Theresa May must agree a Brexit transition deal "immediately" to end uncertainty for business, Jeremy Corbyn has told the CBI's conference.The Labour leader backed a call from the business group to get such an agreement by the end of the year.Mrs May has attempted to reassure business leaders they will get plenty of time to make new arrangements after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.She has yet to start talks on her call for a two-year transition period.But she told the CBI conference in London she wanted the talks to start "as early as possible".She has previously suggested they can't begin until the UK's sorts out its "future partnership" with the EU, something that might not happen until the middle of next year, if at all.But some businesses - including BT - have warned that unless the terms of a transitional period were clear by January they would have to start planning for a "hard Brexit".CBI president Paul Drechsler said about 10% of businesses had "started to reallocate employees, to replan their investments... by the end of the year that will be 25% and by March 60% of all firms will have made big decisions, which are their contingency plans to prepare for the unknown".'Nightmare scenario' That was a message echoed by Mr Corbyn as he told the CBI conference that the transitional arrangements had to be agreed immediately "so that businesses know they won't face a cliff-edge Brexit when the two year negotiating period is up"."Because let me be clear: to delay a transition deal until a final deal is agreed as the prime minister says she wants to do, is simply not good enough."The prospect of sudden changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which people do business is affecting... decisions right now."He also warned about the "nightmare scenario" of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, which he claimed would lead to "tariffs on our food imports and our manufacturing exports, queues at our ports and a hard border in Northern Ireland with all the dangers that could bring".He added: "The fact that some in the cabinet want 'no deal' to re-launch Britain as a race-to-the-bottom deregulated tax haven on the shores of Europe only adds to the risks."Last month the CBI and other business groups warned the UK risks losing jobs and investment unless a transition deal is agreed by the end of the year.But the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said he will not discuss transition terms until the UK has settled its divorce issues, including its exit bill.Mrs May told MPs last month the UK could not "put in place the practical changes necessary to move to the future partnership" until it knows "what that future partnership is going to be".'Crucial to success' But she used her speech to the CBI to address concerns businesses will face a "cliff edge" in March 2019."I have made clear that a strictly time-limited implementation period will be crucial to our future success."I know how important it is for business and industry not to face a cliff-edge and to have the time it needs to plan and prepare for the new arrangements."During this period our access to one another's markets should continue on current terms, and I want us to agree the detailed arrangements for this period as early as possible."But we should also be able to develop our relationships with countries outside the EU in new ways, including through our own trade negotiations."The CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was now "cross-party agreement" that a transition deal was needed "as soon as possible" and "so this is the time for urgent action".
Boris Johnson safe for now despite latest diplomatic fumble:::::Image copyright Reuters On the day George Orwell's statue was unveiled outside the BBC's Broadcasting House, it seems fitting that the government finds itself fending off accusations it has distorted and misrepresented the English language for political expediency in a way that would make the writer fume.Boris Johnson is in hot water, again, over what he said to a meeting of the Commons foreign affairs committee last week.Speaking about the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in prison in Iran, Mr Johnson said, "when we look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it, at the very limit".But Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family and the British government have always insisted she was in Iran visiting family when she was arrested in 2016.And now in an effort to hose the situation down and minimise any damage to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, the foreign secretary has told his Iranian counterpart that while he accepted his remarks at the committee "could have been clearer" he was seeking to condemn "the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime".But that is not what he said to the Commons committee last week and Labour MPs are certainly furious at this latest diplomatic fumble by the foreign secretary.It will not, however, result in his dismissal from the cabinet.The foreign secretary said his comments had no impact on the case in Iran, a view echoed by his Iranian counterpart.That certainly helps Mr Johnson weather this latest storm.But more fundamentally, Theresa May does not have the political strength to dismiss one of the cabinet's big Brexit-supporting beasts.If she had a Commons majority and a united cabinet she might feel British diplomacy could be more effectively carried out by someone else.But her government is fragile.After Michael Fallon left his post as defence secretary last week another cabinet departure would look like a government unravelling.It is the same reason Priti Patel is still in her job.
What politicians can learn from chimps:::::Image copyright PA/Getty Image caption Prof Tilley presents Primate Politics on BBC Radio 4 The word "politics" probably conjures up an image of Theresa May facing Jeremy Corbyn over the despatch box - and despite the hooting from the backbenches we might not think that this has much to do with chimpanzees.Yet many of our fellow primates are our equal in their desire for power and ability to manoeuvre others to get hold of that power.Chimpanzees are intensely political animals.They live in social groups of about 50 with male leaders who have to engage in a variety of political manoeuvres to get to the top.Professor Frans de Waal's book Chimpanzee Politics details the shifting coalitions created among chimpanzees to take power at Arnhem Zoo in the Netherlands.He argues that it is not enough to simply be the strongest."The best alpha males in chimpanzee communities are not necessarily the biggest and strongest males," he says."You have to have supporters which means you have to keep these supporters happy.You have to be diplomatic."Building a coalition Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Coalitions aren't just for humans Part of this diplomacy involves forming coalitions with other males.This can be very strategic and mirrors what we see politicians within parties doing all the time."If you have three males and one of them is overwhelmingly strong then there's a tendency for the other two to gang up together against that male," says Prof de Waal."Because if they attach their political weight to the top male who is that strong male they're just an accessory to his power."The other crucial part of diplomacy is getting support from the masses.This involves being "nice" - would-be chimpanzee leaders are as keen on kissing babies as human politicians - but also distributing resources, typically meat, to build up support: "The Japanese scientist Toshisada Nishida studied one chimpanzee who ruled for 12 years," says Mr de Waal."He would appropriate the meat of other males and then selectively share with his supporters and selectively not share with his rivals.He had a whole bribery system that worked very much to his advantage."In effect, that chimpanzee leader was taxing the group and then returning those resources to selected supporters.Clearly bribing voters with their own money is not unique to human politicians.Primates at war Image copyright Getty Images Another similarity involves conflict between groups.Chimpanzees often raid and ambush other troops, brutally killing rival group members.They also face danger from other animals such as snakes.And just as in human politics, these external threats can silence internal dissent and shore up support for leaders.Marc Hetherington, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, studies how voters sometimes "rally around the flag"."George W Bush in the early 2000s went from not being a particularly popular president, especially at the beginning of his term, to having 90% approval after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks."This is one of the textbook examples of rallying round the flag."Other primates show the same tendencies.Dr Alison Cronin is a primatologist, and director of Monkey World in Dorset."If you have an external threat that's a danger effectively to everybody, it brings the group together, you rally together," she says."And people who you might not even like on a day-to-day basis, if you're going to join up as a band of brothers to defend the realm, then all for one and one for all."Humans are primates These parallels shouldn't be too surprising.Human are primates.And for most of human evolutionary history we lived in small tight-knit groups of hunters and foragers in which coalitions of individuals vied for leadership.That history can mean that we are potentially making political decisions in a way that is often poorly suited to the modern world.Professor Michael Bang Petersen is an expert in evolutionary political psychology at Aarhus University in Denmark."We act as if we still live in a small-scale society," he says."Our brain is built to assume a small-scale environment and the solutions that we think are intuitively right are the solutions that work well in a small-scale society."Image caption Alison Cronin and James Tilley with chimpanzees at Monkey World This can make it difficult for people to hold principled political attitudes as we naturally prefer to think about things on a case-by-case basis as we did in small groups.For example, Prof Bang Petersen says, rather than considering which punishments fit which crime, we prefer to think about which punishments fit which criminal.Remarkably, these hangovers from our past even extend to basic questions about income inequality.Prof Bang Petersen argues that, on average, physically strong people prefer less income redistribution because they forget that redistribution policies are determined by factions in Parliament not whether they can enforce them physically.At the same time, our willingness to cooperate is a crucial part of why democracy works and this too can be traced back to when we lived in small groups.Think about voting.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Does our evolutionary history explain why so many of us turn out to vote?No individual vote will make any difference to the result, so why do so many people vote?Prof Bang Petersen argues that this too is part of evolutionary heritage."People feel that voting is important and that makes intuitive sense for our mind that is designed to navigate small-scale politics where each individual could indeed be decisive."That stems from high levels of cooperativeness."Of course, we should be a bit cautious about saying that we are simply products of our evolutionary history and that other primate behaviour is just a mirror of our own.There's an obvious difference between humans and other primates: language.Language, alongside greater cognitive capacity, allows us to make laws and plan ahead.Language allows us to create groups that are national, not just local, and include people we will never meet.But that can still mean that we sometimes behave as if those groups consist of 50 people on the savannah scratching a living from hunting and foraging.And next time you are watching PMQs, it is worth remembering that we are, in the end, just one political primate among many.
Red Robbo: The man behind 523 car factory strikes:::::Image caption Derek Robinson, nicknamed Red Robbo, died on 31 October 2017 He was a controversial figure throughout his lifetime but Derek Robinson remains a working class hero to many.Vilified by the media as "Red Robbo" he was also betrayed, in the eyes of his supporters, by trade union bosses.Following his death on Tuesday aged 90, BBC News examines his legacy.In February 1980, less than a year after Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, thousands of car workers gathered following the sacking of one man.Union convenor Derek Robinson had been dismissed months earlier by British Leyland's chairman Michael Edwardes.Management regarded him as an "insidious influence" and his days at the car firm had been numbered.A communist, he had led 523 walkouts at the Birmingham car plant during a 30-month period, gaining the nickname Red Robbo from journalists and becoming an increasingly divisive national figure.Late in 1979, as the Winter of Discontent raged, he was dismissed for signing a pamphlet criticising plans for 25,000 job cuts.But instead of supporting him, the workers who gathered that February day turned on him.A motion for a strike in favour of his reinstatement was overwhelmingly defeated - 14,000 votes against to just 600 in favour.Image copyright PA Image caption A motion for strike action protesting against Mr Robinson's dismissal in 1980 was overwhelmingly voted down Film-maker Ken Loach, who made a documentary about Mr Robinson, said his story encapsulated a "critical moment" in the battle between Thatcherism and the power of the unions.The director believes Mr Robinson was "betrayed" by a union leadership with whom he had a thorny relationship.Initially, the workers came out in support of Mr Robinson, he said."There were big strikes across British Leyland, but union leaders instructed them to go back to work," Mr Loach believes.They had "consciously got rid of him".Image copyright PA Image caption British Leyland, Mr Edwardes wrote, was perceived as being a business "at war with itself" Image copyright Getty Images Born in Cradley Heath in the Black Country in 1927, Mr Robinson had begun working at the Longbridge plant aged 14 and was in his 50s when the axe fell.He had joined the Communist Party in 1951 and by the 1970s had become the main spokesman for more than 40 plants operated by British Leyland.But the car giant had been hit hard by post-war economic struggles and had developed a reputation for producing low-quality cars.By 1975, it had been bailed out by the government, which now owned 95% of it.Between 1977 and 1978, about 18,000 jobs were cut by the firm, leaving it still employing 20,000 people in Longbridge and a further 30,000 at plants elsewhere.Mr Robinson led the fight back, organising hundreds of disputes.These were blamed by managers for delays to production of 62,000 cars and 113,000 engines, costing the business an estimated 200m.But the political mood of the country was changing.By the winter of 1979, as 1.5 million public sector workers were on strike across the UK, the Labour government was in its final throes.Mr Robinson was among those trade unionists soon to lose their grip on power.Image caption Film-maker Ken Loach described Derek Robinson as a man of "iron principle" Mrs Thatcher, who came to power following the general election in May that year, regarded Mr Robinson as a "notorious agitator" and thought him a militant communist determined to stand in the way of progress.British Leyland's chairman Michael Edwardes shared that view.He wrote in his 1983 book, Back from the Brink, that Mr Robinson had "kept Longbridge in ferment and upheaval" for years and "disruption and upheaval" were his "food and drink".He was sitting opposite Mr Robinson when the union convenor was finally dismissed.But why had Mr Robinson's fellow workers not supported him?For many, Mr Robinson is remembered "very badly", according to Chris Cowin, an expert on British Leyland's history."He's seen as a troublemaker, someone who resisted attempts to modernise," he said.Image copyright PA Image caption Strikes co-ordinated by Mr Robinson cost British Leyland 200m in lost production, according to chairman Michael Edwardes Former Leyland worker Stephen Cox said Mr Robinson was regarded by many as "way out on an extreme".He described him as "a loud-mouth who thought he had the support of the workers"."He may well have had absolute belief in what he was doing, but few others did," Mr Cox added.Not all former workers agree.Christopher Lunt worked at Longbridge until MG Rover - the successor company to British Leyland - went into administration in 2005.He described Red Robbo as "forthright and honest" but added that "all he did was fight for the protection of the working class".Image copyright PA Image caption The Winter of Discontent saw rubbish piled high, as seen here in London's Leicester Square Another who continues to believe in what Mr Robinson stood for is Graham Stevenson, who was the Communist Party candidate in the 2017 West Midlands metro mayor election.He hopes his friend will be remembered as "one of those stalwarts in the post-war era that maintained a better life for ordinary people", not as an "agitator" or "destroyer" which he said was "a complete invention".For Mr Stevenson, the dismissal of Red Robbo was "the first shot in the war that Thatcher began against working people and their families"."He wasn't at all like what the media portrayed him as in the 1970s," he said."He was a very competent man in private life he was very kind and very caring."Following his dismissal, Mr Robinson worked as a tutor in trade union studies during the 1980s and 1990s, teaching shop stewards."His legacy ought to be that you've got to fight," said Mr Loach."He's to be hugely respected."As for his Red Robbo nickname, Mr Robinson told MPs in 2000 he regarded it as a badge of honour."I can sleep sound at night because I never betrayed the workers I was elected to represent," he said.
The case for the voting age to be lowered to 16:::::At the moment, 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds are too young to vote.They pay taxes, but aren't old enough to elect the men and women who decide how to spend them.Yet after a General Election where younger people turned out in numbers not seen for decades, the question of whether it's undemocratic to continue to deny 16-year-olds the vote is being asked again.Leading the teenage charge this time around is Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton.His proposal not only calls for the voting age to be lowered, but for political education to be taught in schools."The young people that I come in to contact with understand issues and they get behind campaigns," he told Newsbeat.Seventeen-year-olds Nathan Randles, Samah Khalil and Jess Consterdine, from Oldham's youth council, are a case in point."I pay tax as an apprentice and I have no say on where it goes," says Nathan."I want a say in how much my education costs," Jess chimes in."There's no test you take at 18 which means you are informed," argues Samah.And their case is backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.The Scottish National Party, the Lib Dems and Green Party are all on board too - but crucially the Conservatives aren't.Speaking just before this year's General Election, Prime Minister Theresa May said: "You have to pick a point at which you think it is right for the voting age to be."I continue to think it is right for it to be 18."Some claim that position is based on a fear that not enough younger voters would vote for the Conservatives.But the PM is not alone in her thinking.Austria is the only country in the EU where 16-year-olds can vote in general elections.And although supporters for lowering the electoral age say you can get married, join the Army and work full-time at 16 - that's not entirely true.You can now vote in the Scottish parliamentary and local elections at 16.The Welsh Assembly is looking at doing the same for local elections there.Labour MP Jim McMahon believes the momentum is with his campaign to push forward a bill proposing votes at 16."If you are giving 16-year-olds the right to vote in Scotland and Wales, you ought to be doing the same for 16-year-olds in England too," he says.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Balfour Declaration: The divisive legacy of 67 words:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Balfour Declaration: 100 years of conflict The British peer Arthur Balfour barely makes an appearance in UK schoolbooks, but many Israeli and Palestinian students could tell you about him.His Balfour Declaration, made on 2 November 1917, is taught in their respective history classes and forms a key chapter in their two very different, national narratives.It can be seen as a starting point for the Arab-Israeli conflict.The declaration by the then foreign secretary was included in a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leading proponent of Zionism, a movement advocating self-determination for the Jewish people in their historical homeland - from the Mediterranean to the eastern flank of the River Jordan, an area which came to be known as Palestine.It stated that the British government supported "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people".Image caption The key 67 words of Balfour's letter At the same time, it said that nothing should "prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities".Palestinians see this as a great betrayal, particularly given a separate promise made to enlist the political and military support of the Arabs - then ruled by the Ottoman Turks - in World War One.This suggested Britain would back their struggle for independence in most of the lands of the Ottoman Empire, which consisted of much of the Middle East.The Arabs understood this to include Palestine, though it had not been specifically mentioned."Do you think Britain committed a crime against the Palestinian people?"asks a teacher during a lesson in a Palestinian school in the West Bank city of Ramallah.Image caption Palestinians regard the declaration as an historical injustice Everyone puts up a hand."Yes," a 15-year-old girl answers."This declaration was illegitimate because Palestine was still part of the Ottoman Empire and Britain did not control it.""Britain considered the Arabs as a minority while they formed over 90% of the population."'Huge hope' Israeli children, inevitably, tend to see British involvement more positively when they study the Balfour Declaration in a lesson towards the end of their high-school years.In Balfouria, a village in northern Israel, nine-year-old Noga Yehezekeli is already proudly able to recite a Hebrew version of the text off by heart."In the moment it was given, the declaration gave huge hope and a huge push for the Zionist movement," says her father, Neve."People saw that if the British government gave such a declaration there was a chance that one day the Jewish nation would be established, which really happened later in '48" - the year the State of Israel was formed.Image caption The declaration gave Zionists huge hope, says Neve Yehezekeli (right) Residents of Balfouria - including Neve's grandfather - were part of a growing Jewish community in Palestine when Lord Balfour visited in 1925.They gave him a hero's welcome.By that time, the area was under British administration.The Balfour Declaration had been formally enshrined in the British Mandate for Palestine, which had been endorsed by the League of Nations.During the first half of the Mandate period, Britain allowed waves of Jewish immigration.But amid an Arab backlash and rising violence, Israelis remember how it later blocked many fleeing persecution, particularly during the Holocaust.Hard to deliver At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, inaugurated by Balfour, Professor Ruth Lapidoth has studied the 67-word document.An expert on international law, Prof Lapidoth argues it was a legally binding declaration, but says Britain found it hard to deliver on its pledge.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Balfour was given a hero's welcome by the Jewish community in Jerusalem in 1925 "The political situation was very bad when the Nazis came to power and then England needed the help, the friendship of the Arab countries," she says."Then they had to limit the implementation of the declaration, which is a pity."Prof Lapidoth left Germany in 1938, a year before the start of World War Two, and so has a personal interest in the pronouncement."I'm still very grateful for it," she says."It was really the source of our right to come back to Palestine, including my own."'Long-due promise' Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, describes the Balfour Declaration as "a central milestone" in the process of establishing his country.The British government has invited him to London for events to mark the centenary on Thursday.That decision, at a time of dimming hopes for Israeli-Palestinian peace, has infuriated Palestinians, who plan a day of protests.Image copyright EPA Image caption Palestinians say Britain's declaration deprived them of a state They want Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration."As the time passes, I think British people are forgetting about the lessons of history," says Palestinian Education Minister Sabri Saidam.He points out that Palestinians still seek the creation of a state of their own - which alongside Israel would form the basis of the so-called two-state solution to the conflict, a formula supported by the international community."The time has come for Palestine to be independent and for that long-due promise to be fulfilled," he says.
Tackling the 'boys' club' of political cartoons:::::Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP Why do the UK's national newspapers' full-time cartoonists never seem to be women?Out of nearly 180 cartoons featured in last year's edition of Britain's Best Political Cartoons not one was drawn by a woman.It was flicking through a copy of the book that first highlighted the gender imbalance in the industry for Ella Bucknall, an illustrator currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts in London.This realisation prompted her to start Whip, a magazine of political cartoons by women, to give them a platform that didn't exist elsewhere."Particularly at the moment when there are so many aspects of politics affecting women's lives, from Trump to the DUP, we need to be able to have our own voice.We need to be able to argue back," she said.Image copyright Rosie O'Driscoll / WHIP The "boys' club" is a common complaint of women working as cartoonists.Nicola Jennings, whose work has been published in the Guardian, said: "Political cartoons are a sort of running joke between the boys.I wonder whether men find it too difficult to be lampooned by a woman?"Men lampooning each other is like an in-joke and they're just slapping each other on the back, whereas if it's a woman it's seen as much stronger criticism."The editorial cartoons of the national newspapers remain a distinctly male affair.Tim Benson, editor of Britain's Best Political Cartoons, defended his selection as simply a reflection of the state of the industry."My criteria is that the cartoon has to be published in a national newspaper.There are lots of female cartoonists who publish their work online or draw for the Morning Star but they are unpaid," he said, "If you want to be able to call yourself a political cartoonist you have to be able to earn your living as one.I can only pick cartoons from what is available."My view is that anyone with the perseverance and the skills will rise to the top, whatever their gender is.Personally I don't think there's a woman out there at the moment who can compete with the very best."I've got Nicola Jennings in this year's book but only because she's been published in national newspapers.I would love to have more work by female cartoonists but I'm not going to include them in my book if I don't think they're good enough.I never decide on gender lines.As far as my book is concerned there is absolutely no gender bias at all."Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP To find female political cartoonists at the moment, it is necessary to look beyond the national newspapers.Nicola Streeten, an illustrator and comics scholar, has researched the history of British feminist cartoons and comics from the 1970s.What she found was that outside the national media there were a host of women drawing political cartoons, from the Suffragettes to 1960s feminist magazine Spare Rib.She is currently co-editing a collection of 250 years of female cartoonists in Britain, The Inking Woman, following an exhibition of the same name at the Cartoon Museum."The more we looked the more women we found.You just have to take the trouble to look.Some people are against having a women's-only publication or exhibition but at the moment there just aren't the platforms for women," she said.There are only six full-time political cartoonists working for national newspapers.As far as we can tell there has never been a woman among them and most of the men have held their positions for years."There was a tradition of editorial cartoonists having a job for life.Those jobs were already taken by men 50 years ago so there haven't been any open doors for women," explained Martha Richler, otherwise known as Marf, one of the few women to have worked as a political cartoonist on Fleet Street, for London's Evening Standard.Image copyright Martha Richler Ms Richler, who was made redundant from the Standard in 2008 after the recession hit, said: "As budgets were cut, cartoonists were considered a luxury.But the story's not over if you look online."She admits she misses her salary but prefers the freedom of working online."There were times at the Standard when I wasn't allowed to do a darker cartoon.Online I have total freedom and there are no prejudices about what women can draw.We can self-publish.There are amazing opportunities if only we can crack the problem of monetising it."Ms Richler also said she faced sexism in Fleet Street.In 2004 the Daily Telegraph claimed her jokes were "regularly rewritten by backbench executives".The paper later published an apology.Ms Richler said the attack suggested there was an assumption women simply couldn't be good political cartoonists.Image copyright Alice Skinner / WHIP So how do things look now?Emma Allen was recently appointed as the New Yorker's cartoon editor.The work of Ms Jennings and Kate Evans has been featured in the Guardian.Political blog The Canary has recently launched an

Profile: Who is Gavin Williamson, the new defence secretary?:::::Image copyright Getty Images He's the Tory enforcer who kept a tarantula on his desk and joked about using a "sharpened carrot" to get his way.Now Gavin Williamson has been propelled into his first cabinet role in the wake of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's sudden resignation.So what more do we know about a politician seen as rising star but whose rapid elevation has apparently upset some of his colleagues?Theresa May's chief whip, first elected to Parliament in 2010, wasn't among the bookmakers' favourites for the Ministry of Defence vacancy.The South Staffordshire MP has no military background and had little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament.Raised near Scarborough by Labour-supporting parents, he ran a Staffordshire pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before becoming an MP.After entering Parliament, Mr Williamson was given a role in the Northern Ireland Office in 2011, and then became David Cameron's backbench aide.He was appointed a CBE in the ex-PM's controversial resignation honours list, telling the Stourbridge News he was "extremely honoured and humbled" at the award.And he didn't fall out of favour as Theresa May took over in July 2016 - "literally walking out with one prime minister and in with the next" in the words of friend and fellow Tory MP James Wharton.Factfile Date of birth: 25 June 1976 (aged 41) Job: MP for South Staffordshire, since 2010.Chief whip from June 2016, now defence secretary Education: Went to to Raincliffe Comprehensive School and Scarborough Sixth Form College; studied social sciences at the University of Bradford Family: Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Honours: Awarded a CBE in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours for political and public service After a disappointing general election for the Conservatives, he played a key role in brokering the 1bn deal with the DUP to prop up their minority government.But until now, that tarantula might have been the most commonly-cited fact about the 41-year-old - whose successor as chief whip tweeted a picture of his desk on taking over.He has described the creature, known as Cronus, as "a perfect example of an incredibly clean, ruthless killer" - who reportedly fell foul of the strict rules about animals on the Parliamentary estate.Kate Moody, who sold it to him at his local garden centre, told BBC Radio 4 the MP had thought it would be a "great addition" to his office.She recalls Mr Williamson joking that he was having a "mid-life" crisis when he bought the red-legged Mexican tarantula, saying "it was a sports car or a tarantula and the tarantula won".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gavin Williamson (right) shakes hands with the DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson And spiders aren't the only animals close to his heart - he's also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden.He might be kind to animals, but there was a hint of a less accommodating approach in his speech to the Conservative Party conference as he described his methods in the whips office."We take a carrot and stick approach," he told delegates."Personally I don't much like the stick, but it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot."In his own words Image copyright AFP On being appointed as chief whip: "I was absolutely flabbergasted, but I accepted immediately."On his pet tarantula: "You have to look at all different ways to persuade people to vote with the government and it's great to have Cronus as part of the team" In the Commons: "It's very important to use our gardens which are a specific habitat for hedgehogs.Just recently in my own garden I built a hedgehog house.Sadly I have no residents in it but hopefully it will encourage them and the growth of hedgehogs in South Staffordshire."What others say
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
A pint of view: What do farmers think about Brexit?:::::What do the farmers out in the field, in the dairy and in the milking parlour think about Brexit?No-one knows what's around the corner for the dairy industry.Specific negotiations over a future trade deal haven't even started.Some experts predict oblivion; others see opportunity.So let's start with what we do know: the state of the industry 20 years ago, and what it's like today.Image caption Currently the EU is UK dairy's biggest trading partner, with 80 per cent of exports going there.The number of dairy farmers has shrunk dramatically: In 1996 there were around 35,000.Now there are around 13,000 - a drop of almost two-thirds.Farms are getting bigger: The average herd size was 75 cows and now it's 140.And as for the cost of a pint: back in 1996 it was 36 pence, now it's 43 pence - and many farmers say it's too low.So how do those working in the industry feel about what the next 20 years may hold?Image caption James and Rhiannan feel that Brexit has given them - and their son Ethan - the chance of a more secure future.James and Rhiannan Lomas have a dairy farm of around 200 cows in Cheshire.They almost went out of business two years ago because of the collapse in the milk price.But now they are part of a small number of farms starting to export liquid milk (as opposed to powdered or products such as cheese) to Qatar.The Middle East nation was left without milk almost overnight after a blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies.Mr Lomas says: "It's amazing.Every day we thought of giving it all up.But hopefully now Brexit will improve our outlook and open up a lot of markets - if the politicians get it right."He adds that there have definitely been some dark times."Hopefully it will give us a chance to make us a more of a secure and better future.Certainly the fluctuation of the dairy business will always be there, but the ability to change markets might give us the chance to go elsewhere."Ms Lomas explains: "It makes you feel a lot more positive for us."Looking down at her son Ethan, she adds: "And for him."China exports Andrew Henderson is the man who secured the deal with a hypermarket chain in Qatar.He runs a dairy called Nemi, also based in Cheshire.It bottles milk from farmers in the surrounding counties and could soon be the first in the UK to export fresh milk to China.These cows are given an enriched feed so they produce milk high in selenium, which can be in short supply in the Chinese diet.A supermarket there has just placed an order.Image caption Brand GB: A prototype of the bottle that could carry the first British fresh milk to China.Note the gold Houses of Parliament and British flag."Brexit is having a very positive effect - we have farmers who are getting a much better milk price and we also have more interest from countries inside Europe and outside Europe for fresh British milk.We are trying to supply that need."He says the Chinese are interested in British milk because they see it as "pure".They also want to know exactly which farm the product is coming from."We were in China in June and we were sitting with some highly decorated officials from the Chinese government and they made a point of saying it's very easy to do a deal with one country - but very difficult to do a deal with 27."Would this be happening without the Brexit vote?"I believe not.There was no will from the major European cooperatives and organisations to deliver our fresh milk to China as they are already within those markets with dried milk and other products from Europe," says Mr Henderson.His business partner is Mark Langslow, from County Milk Products."Regarding Brexit, I think we've made the right decision.I think it makes us want to stand on our own two feet, and forces us to stand on our own two feet."Image caption Dairy farms are closing because they can't find able staff to take on the roles available.However not too far away, near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, David Brookes has a dairy herd of 180 cows.He's a member of the West Midlands Dairy Board.He relies on his daughter to help with the business and talks of what experts have referred to as the "shocking crisis" in the dairy labour industry."There's only around 1% on jobseekers allowance in Staffordshire.Whether it's the butchery side of things and processing meat or whether it's processing dairy products we have become reliant on a migrant labour force, mainly from Eastern Europe," he says."We need the skilled labour.And at the moment they are not coming over."He says that the devaluation of the pound is largely to blame, but also the uncertainty surrounding Brexit."One of the problems is the classification of 'labour'.Because the government is very keen to get a lot of skilled labour.A lot of our processing workers (such as those that operate milking equipment) are skilled, but their skills are not clearly defined as skilled under government guidelines," Mr Brookes explains.He believes that if restrictions are imposed "it could be very difficult".Further south, in Wiltshire, Jenny Quick helps to run a small family dairy herd."People may tell you their view," she says, "But no one knows.We just have no idea yet."Follow Claire on Twitter.
Westminster sexual harassment: MPs outline claims:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chi Onwurah: Male and female researchers left 'uncomfortable' in Westminster bar MPs have been speaking out about sexual harassment in the corridors of Westminster - including one claim that bad behaviour at a parliamentary bar was dismissed as typical "pub" talk.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom vowed to stamp out "sleazy, sexist or homophobic banter", as she faced MPs in light of allegations of sexual harassment in Parliament.One of those to speak out, Labour's Chi Onwurah, said some male and female researchers had been made to feel "deeply uncomfortable" by MPs while at a parliamentary bar, the Sports and Social club - but her complaint was ignored.The Labour MP said: "When I complained recently to an officer of Parliament who had some responsibility in this area...I was told that happens in pubs all over the country."Ms Leadsom gave her "absolute assurance" that people going to restaurants and bars in Westminster should feel safe."There should be no place here on the estate or in our constituency offices where people can be abused or allegations not taken seriously," she said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liz Saville Roberts says she was told "distrust is endemic" among staff of MPs Liz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said she had been told by one employee of an MP that authorities failed to act when she reported an assault claim - leaving the woman "deeply disappointed and distrustful"."She reported being sexually assaulted to the proper authorities earlier this year, who did nothing," she said, adding: "She tells me that distrust is endemic."Ms Saville Roberts asked: "How can I assure her that her complaint will now be treated differently?"For her part, Ms Leadsom said she would be willing to take the complaint up herself.One MP already being investigated for inappropriate behaviour is international trade minister, Mark Garnier, who reportedly asked his secretary to buy sex toys and called her "sugar tits".Secret text Conservative MP Matthew Offord said he was recently sent a text message that accused a current MP of being "utterly foul" towards a woman - but he did not reveal the name of the sender or the politician.Mr Offord said the sender had described the incident as a "problem he saw in this place".He quoted the text as saying the MP was "utterly foul and I'm sure it's a pattern of behaviour on his part - but in this instance I don't think it'd be fair on the woman in question to name him."He added that the sender asked him to "do the best you can" to widen the investigation from sexual harassment claims to also address complaints about bullying and treating staff like "dirt".Monday's question-and-answer Commons session took place in response to an urgent question on plans to tackle sexual harassment in Parliament, brought by Labour MP Harriet Harman.Ms Leadsom's statement prompted "wittering about a witch hunt", according to Labour's Jess Phillips.She told the chamber: "As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The PM is "too weak" to tackle abuse allegations amongst her own ministers, says Labour's Lucy Powell Conservative Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, confirmed that some people had expressed "anguish" that the allegations could "unfairly tarnish" innocent MPs.He insisted that Parliament was not a "den of inequity".Earlier, Labour MP Lucy Powell told the BBC that there was an "imbalance of power" in Westminster that left employees open to being abused."When you have that mix of lots of desperate people in that environment [you get] this sort of power abuse - because that's what it is," she said.
Cyber-crime: Security Minister Ben Wallace's claim about arrests unpicked:::::The Claim: Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."Reality Check verdict: The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air.Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation.No-one was charged during the relevant period.We all know a burglary when we see one.Smashed window.TV gone.But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab.That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult.Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money.Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS.The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers.Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure.The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true.Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017.That already looks spot on.In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales.The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents.Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were "cyber-related".On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of "computer misuse", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name.Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a "zombie" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution.And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture.Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 "significant" incidents.The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack.National priority So what about the response?The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture.It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units.But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game.While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's "Operation Falcon", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills.One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world.It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted.Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles.Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year.During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.These are categorised by assessing the following factors: Threat and risk Public impact Financial harm Nature of the incident Victims Mr Wallace claimed: "We are getting there."Are we?The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ.But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and "chaotic" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks.The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an "alphabet soup" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter

Brexit: Is a last-minute deal possible?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019.The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019.It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU.Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too.According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.Even if a deal was done at "the 11th hour" as Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through.So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all.The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about "hypothetical scenarios" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in "good time" before March 2019.It's not entirely clear what "deal" Mr Davis was referring to.The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts.The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations.The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights.The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked.If the "deal" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that.The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well.Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states.But that option would be a hard sell.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?:::::Image copyright Getty Images This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs.But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage?Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement.The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger.Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear.An engineer accompanying me explains that these are "sewage ejectors", dating from 1888.An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits?But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster.And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink.The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds.Image copyright CIBSE Heritage Group Collection Image caption The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that "everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point" - before being ejected out to the main London drain.The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall.And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later.But, adds Mr Piper "we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer".So what happens if they suddenly fail?"If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable.The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards.Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers.There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes.And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do.The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state.Some have known this for years.A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace "faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"."There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."Home from home So how has this happened?And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics?Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability.Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there.So any repairs have been crammed into recess times.And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist.The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a "daily sense of continuity and security".Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges.Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call "elite blockage".The palace, he says, "casts a spell" on many who use it.It represents a kind of politics with "low expectations of public engagement" which "locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics".Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future.Meanwhile "the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."Image copyright uk parliament Image caption The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics.Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter.Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation.MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn.But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action.So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change?"It's starting to look like that," says Dr Shenton.It might be that "the whole place just grinds to a halt"."In terms of British pride," warns Prof Flinders, "if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an "elite blockage" like no other.Chris Bowlby presents Parliament - A Building Catastrophe?on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 October 2017 at 20:30 BST.You will be able to listen via the Radio 4 programme website or download the programme podcast.
Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels.There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money.But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal.But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a "period of implementation".It is not entirely clear what would be implemented.But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all.Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently?The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators.And both the EU and Theresa May (in her Florence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries?Those third countries might have their own opinions about that.But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself?It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues.The Confederation of British Industry, for example, argues that in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition.But UK government policy is rather different.It still argues that a deal on our "final relationship" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do.Upping the ante But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered.Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that "what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere", Mr Davis said: "We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."He added: "But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period.The words "at least in principle" contain a fair amount of wiggle room.And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly.It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition.And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must "take account of the framework for a future relationship".But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante."No final deal" equals "no transition" equals "hard Brexit".As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on.But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else

party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask

Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.
Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?:::::Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when her party was left with 318 MPs and Labour had 262.Here's what we know so far.The list will be updated as new appointments are made.Prime Minister - Theresa May Image copyright Reuters Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for.The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.She had previously been home secretary for six years.Theresa May: Full profile Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance First Secretary of State - Damian Green Image copyright AFP Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state.As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command.It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Image copyright PA Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Image copyright Reuters Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye.During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis Image copyright Reuters David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary".The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister.Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon Image copyright AFP Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox Image copyright AFP Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade.He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.He told reporters he was "delighted" to keep the job he has held since July last year."It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."Justice Secretary - David Lidington Image copyright PA Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992.He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans Image copyright PA Baroness Evans of Bowes Park keeps her job as the leader of the House of Lords.When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Image copyright Reuters Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life".But in a tweet he admitted there were "challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better".Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.Education Secretary - Justine Greening Image copyright PA Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities.She is part of the most diverse Parliament yet as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.She has been MP for Putney since 2005.Transport Secretary -

Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
