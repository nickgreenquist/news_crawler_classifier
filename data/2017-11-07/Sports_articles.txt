NFL overreactions following Week 9:::::The Packers won't win until Aaron Rodgers returns.Brett Hundley has led Green Bay to only 44 points in 11 1/2 quarters since Rodgers broke his collarbone, and that includes a meaningless touchdown at the end of regulation in Monday night's 30-17 loss to Detroit.The Packers were 4-1 before Rodgers got hurt.They're 4-4 now.They'll be stuck on four wins whenever he comes back.With Rodgers, the Packers were Super Bowl contenders.Without him, they're contenders for a top-5 draft pick.Wait.The Cleveland Browns (0-8) are on Green Bay's schedule.Every team beats the hapless Browns.So that'll be at least one for Hundley and the Packers.Here are more overreactions following Week 9: -- -- OVERREACTION: The Eagles (8-1) are going to the Super Bowl.REALISTIC REACTION: They're the team to beat, but Drew Brees already has a playoff win in Philadelphia, the Cowboys aren't going down without a fight and don't count out Russell Wilson and the Seahawks.-- -- OVERREACTION: Ben McAdoo is the worst coach to run a team that plays in East Rutherford, New Jersey.REALISTIC REACTION: Remember Rich Kotite coached the 1-15 Jets.-- -- OVERREACTION: Denver's defense is overrated.REALISTIC REACTION: Carson Wentz has torched many defenses.This time, he beat the best.-- -- OVERREACTION: Andy Reid will bench Alex Smith for Patrick Mahomes to rescue the free-falling Chiefs.REALISTIC REACTION: Smith was an MVP candidate when Kansas City started 5-0.A 1-3 skid against good teams shouldn't earn him a seat on the sideline.-- -- OVERREACTION: The Texans will give in and sign Colin Kaepernick.REALISTIC REACTION: We've been down this road before.-- -- OVERREACTION: Jimmy Garoppolo will be the franchise quarterback the 49ers sorely need.REALISTIC REACTION: He's thrown 94 passes in his career.-- -- OVERREACTION: The AFC South is better than the AFC West.REALISTIC REACTION: Don't let records fool you.-- -- OVERREACTION: The Cowboys are the best team in the NFL.REALISTIC REACTION: Easy for Tamba Hali to say after Dallas beat Kansas City, but check the standings.-- -- OVERREACTION: It's official.The Super Bowl hangover has bit the Falcons.REALISTIC REACTION: If they beat the Cowboys at home this week, they're right back in the playoff mix.-- -- OVERREACTION: The Rams are the team to beat in the NFC West.REALISTIC REACTION: They have to beat the Seahawks on Dec. 17.-- -- For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP -- NFL
NFL Power Rankings: Eagles remain on top:::::NEW YORK (AP) -- Halfway through the NFL season, some familiar teams have been playing especially well.The dominating Philadelphia Eagles.AFC powerhouses the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots.And Carson Wentz and his high-flying Eagles remained on top in the latest AP Pro 32 poll .Philadelphia received all 12 first-place votes for 384 points Tuesday in balloting by media members who regularly cover the NFL.The Eagles (8-1) have won seven games in a row and have the league's best record."The latest act in Carson Wentz's brilliant 2017 season was carving up a Broncos defense that was formerly the top-ranked in the NFL," said Jenny Vrentas of The Monday Morning Quarterback."Eagles fans may be waiting for the other shoe to drop, but they are the best team in football right now."The Steelers and Patriots, both 6-2 and coming off byes, kept the second and third spots.The surprising Los Angeles Rams, coming off a 51-17 rout of the Giants at New York, jumped three places to No.4."This dynamic offense shows no signs of letting up after leaving a slew of Giants dazed and confused in the Meadowlands," said SB Nation Radio's Ira Kaufman.The Minnesota Vikings, who also were on a bye last week, remained at No.5.The surging New Orleans Saints, who have six in a row, moved up two places to No.6.Both teams face road tests this week as Minnesota meets the Washington Redskins and New Orleans heads to Buffalo to play the Bills, who are undefeated at home.The reeling Kansas City Chiefs, who have lost three of four after a 5-0 start, slid three spots to No.7.The Chiefs have a bye this week before returning to action on Nov. 19 against the Giants.The Dallas Cowboys, who have won three in a row, jumped three spots to No.8."Dominated the Chiefs," Fox Sports' John Czarnecki said of the Cowboys' 28-17 win over Kansas City.The Carolina Panthers, who trail the Saints by only a half-game in the NFC South, gained a spot to land at No.9.The Seattle Seahawks slid four spots to round out the top 10.
NFL HALFWAY: Rams, Bills, Jags succeeding with new coaches:::::DENVER (AP) -- Of the half dozen first-year NFL head coaches, Vance Joseph inherited what was widely considered the best situation: a team just one year removed from a Super Bowl parade with a championship-caliber defense and a renovated offense.Unlike the other five teams that averaged 4.4 wins last season, Denver was coming off a 9-7 season and the job only came open because of Gary Kubiak's health concerns.Yet, it's the Broncos (3-5) who are spiraling with five losses in their past six games while Sean McVay's Rams (6-2), Doug Marrone's Jaguars (5-3) and Sean McDermott's Bills (5-3) are primed for playoff pushes.Even Anthony Lynn's Chargers (3-5) are on the rise after a winless first month that included three losses by a field goal or less.While the 49ers are an NFL-worst 0-9, Kyle Shanahan could end up being the biggest winner of them all with his team jockeying for the top pick in next year's draft."Of course it wears on you," Shanahan said of all the losing."If you sit there and you think about those words and the record too much and, yeah, it will affect you big time."But sitting and dwelling on that and worrying about your ego and things like that, it's not going to make you play better."The dive has started to fray nerves in Denver, where calls for offensive coordinator Mike McCoy's job fill the airwaves.Suddenly, all that winning ugly over the past couple of years, highlighted by Denver's defense carrying a diminished Peyton Manning to victory in his Super Bowl 50 farewell, looks pretty good in retrospect.When Kubiak quit, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips joined McVay in L.A. and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison joined McDermott in Buffalo.Phillips is having his customary first-year effect with the Rams, who sport the largest point differential in the NFL, and Dennison is directing an offensive turnaround with the Bills, who could end the league's longest playoff drought -- they haven't qualified since 1999.The Rams have missed out every year since 2004 and the Jaguars every season since 2007.If they continue their resurgence, the Chargers might get in for the first time since 2009.Even the Broncos haven't lost hope because they're only two games behind the Chiefs, losers of three of four (but with a favorable schedule the rest of the way)."We have time," Joseph said, "but time's running out.So, we've got to fix it right now."The problems in Denver are mostly on offense, where Joseph spent his first eight months on the job pondering whether Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch would be his quarterback only to see Brock Osweiler emerge as his best bet.Joseph has seen his team average an NFL-worst 14 points since Week 3, suffer its first shutout in a quarter century and get blown out at home coming off a bye week by the battered Giants.After a 51-23 loss at Philadelphia on Sunday that shattered the defense's not-my-fault aura, defensive end Derek Wolfe said the "Broncos are beating the Broncos" with too many mistakes, turnovers, drops and flags before the snap and after the whistle.Joseph acknowledged the coaching staff has to clean up its act, too.Joe Woods' defense is having too many breakdowns in coverage, Brock Olivo's special teams are too sloppy and McCoy stubbornly sticks to a steady diet of three-receiver sets even though his quarterbacks have 18 sacks and 10 turnovers out of that formation over the past six games."It's a league that's really built and operated to have equal parts.So, the difference sometimes is the coaching.The difference is the scheme and play calling," Joseph said."So, when you don't win, absolutely you have to coach better.And that starts with me.Because in this league coaching is very important and the better-coached teams win."Right now that includes the Bills, Rams and Jaguars.BILLS: McDermott is doing more with less than his predecessor Rex Ryan.Fewer than two dozen players remain from last year's roster and the losing culture is finally fading in Buffalo.McDermott has gotten the most out of QB Tyrod Taylor and the Bills lead the NFL with a plus-11 turnover margin.The next four games are critical: road games against the Chargers and Chiefs sandwiched in between home games against the first-place Saints and Patriots.RAMS: With help from McVay and a better supporting cast, former top overall draft pick Jared Goff has made a huge jump this season.After failing to win the starting QB job until halfway through his rookie season, Goff is undergoing a sophomore surge not unlike Carson Wentz's in Philadelphia.The Rams hit the halfway point in first place in the NFC West.Down the stretch, they'll be tested by fellow NFC division leaders Minnesota, New Orleans and Philadelphia.JAGUARS: Having spent the previous two years as Jacksonville's O-line coach, Marrone knew exactly what he had with turnover-prone QB Blake Bortles.So he built a run-first team that could control the clock, limit Bortles' passes and play to an already-stout defense.Drafting RB Leonard Fournette and LT Cam Robinson beefed up the ground game, and DE Calais Campbell has proven to be the NFL's best free-agent signing.The Jaguars looked poised for a strong finish and their best season in a decade.49ERS: Shanahan arrived with a lot of optimism as he brought his deep offensive knowledge and playbook from Atlanta to a team in need of a change.But San Francisco got off to the worst start in franchise history.QB Brian Hoyer went from starter to the bench before getting cut when GM John Lynch acquired Tom Brady's longtime backup Jimmy Garoppolo.The only drama down the stretch will be if they can avoid 0-16 and get a good look at Garoppolo before determining whether to draft a quarterback with a premier pick in April.CHARGERS: The relocated Chargers didn't leave their heartbreak in San Diego when they moved to L.A.They've already lost four games by eight points or fewer.McCoy's last two teams in San Diego lost 17 games by that same one-score margin.They've once again had stretches of strong play and a string of solid victories with an undeniable collection of veteran talent.But narrow losses due to poor late-game execution and bad breaks have kept them from rising to the top of the AFC West.-- -- For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and

Florida State RB Jacques Patrick back earlier than expected:::::TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's offense this season has been beset by injuries.But the Seminoles have received some good news for once as they prepare for Saturday's game at fourth-ranked Clemson.Running back Jacques Patrick has returned to practice and could see action against the Tigers.The 6-foot-4, 234-pound junior was thought to be lost for the season after having knee surgery on Oct. 24, but the injury was not as bad as originally believed."At first they thought (the cartilage) was torn like what (safety) Derwin (James) had last year," Patrick said."I knew after the surgery though when I woke up and was able to put full pressure on it that I was fine."More Florida State Seminoles news Patrick's return comes as the Seminoles (3-5, 3-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) are trying to avoid a losing season for the first time since 1976 and having a string of 35 consecutive bowl appearances snapped.Patrick injured the knee in a 31-28 loss to Louisville on Oct. 21.He thought it was just a knee sprain, but an MRI had the original diagnosis as torn cartilage that would sideline him 4-to-6 months.But Patrick was able to walk following the surgery, and his recovery was quick from there.Patrick was doing conditioning and running drills last week before being cleared to return."People were just looking at me crazy because I just had surgery and I'm walking into practice," Patrick said."It started out as a real devastating moment but I overcame it."Patrick's return should bolster an offense that has found its greatest success is on the ground.The Orlando native is averaging 72.3 rushing yards in six games (434 yards on 76 carries), including a 120-yard effort in a win at Wake Forest on Sept, 30.He is also fifth on the team in receptions with 13 for 88 yards.Cam Akers rushed for 199 yards and two touchdowns in last Saturday's 27-24 win over Syracuse.The 5-foot-11, 213-pound freshman is fifth in ACC, averaging 86.9 yards per game (127 carries, 752 yards), and has three 100-yard games this season."We've run the football well at times, which has helped us create some big plays on offense," coach Jimbo Fisher said."Both backs are continuing to learn and play well.Jacques, this is his first full season as a starter, and Cam is starting to do some really good things."Clemson (8-1, 6-1) comes into the game second in the ACC and 20th nationally in run defense, allowing 121.9 yards per game, and has allowed only two backs to go over 100 yards in its last 16 games.Florida State has had success running the ball the past two years against Clemson.Dalvin Cook had a pair of 100-yard games and tied a school record with four touchdowns last season.However, the Seminoles lost both games and are trying to avoid their first three-game losing streak to the Tigers since 2007.A loss would also mean that FSU would finish below .500 in the ACC for only the second time since joining the conference in 1992."They had the injuries that kind of hurt them.They looked good last week," Clemson linebacker Kendall Joseph said."Not their best offense, but they're definitely capable of moving the ball on us and playing well.So we definitely have to be ready and come ready to play."

Roy Halladay, former MLB star, killed in plane crash off Florida:::::Former Major League Baseball pitcher Roy Halladay was killed Tuesday when a small plane he was piloting crashed in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida.He was 40 years old.The Pasco County Sheriffs Office said Halladay was the only person on board the ICON A5 when it went down in shallow water shortly after noon off New Port Richey.No mayday calls were made to Tampa air traffic controllers."He loved to fly," Sheriff Chris Nocco said of Halladay, an eight-time All-Star and two-time Cy Young Award winner."He talked about his family, baseball and flying."In a statement, the sheriff's office described Halladay as "an incredible friend," noting that the former pitcher had donated money for the department to purchase a K9 officer.The dog was named "Doc," a nod to Halladay's nickname.Halladay was an amateur pilot who often posted on social media about small planes.ICON aircraft had posted a video with Halladay trying out a new plane.Halladay pitched for 16 years in the major leagues with the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies before retiring following the 2013 season."We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay's untimely death," the Phillies said in a statement."There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game."Current and former players responded with an outpouring of emotion on social media.Vernon Wells, a former Blue Jays teammate, called Halladay "one of the best to ever do it."Halladay won the Cy Young Award twice, once in 2003 with the Blue Jays and again in 2010 with the Phillies.Only five other pitchers have won the award in both the American and National Leagues, and three of those Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and Gaylord Perry are in the Baseball Hall of Fame.During that 2010 season, Halladay went 21-10 for the Phillies with a 2.44 ERA.In addition to winning the Cy Young Award, Halladay finished sixth in the voting for National League MVP.He pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history on May 29 of that year against the Marlins and followed that up with a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the National League Division Series.In an era where starting pitchers went deep into games less frequently, Halladay threw 67 career complete games -- including 20 shutouts -- and was the active leader in that category when he retired.Other baseball players to die in plane crashes included Pittsburgh Pirates star Roberto Clemente in a relief mission from Puerto Rico traveling to earthquake victims in Nicaragua on New Year's Eve in 1972; New York Yankees catcher Thurman Munson piloting his own plane near his home in Canton, Ohio, in 1979; and Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle piloting his own plane in New York City in 2006.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Ex-Colts LB Mathis charged with intoxicated driving:::::NOBLESVILLE, Ind.-- Former Indianapolis Colts defensive star and current assistant coach Robert Mathis has been charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated, endangering a person.The misdemeanor charge was filed Tuesday in Hamilton Superior Court.Police in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel say the 36-year-old Mathis was arrested early Oct. 24 after driving the wrong way on a one-way street and not signaling a turn.A Colts spokesman says the team has no comment on Mathis being charged.A message seeking comment was left for an attorney for Mathis.Mathis retired as a player after last season following a 14-year career with a team-record 123 sacks for the Colts.He was named to the Pro Bowl six times.He's now on theIndianapolis coaching staff as a pass rush consultant.

No. 12 Oklahoma St tries to shift focus to Iowa State:::::STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- The players for No.12 Oklahoma State don't have any time to feel sorry for themselves.Following a demoralizing 62-52 loss at home to rival Oklahoma, the Cowboys have another strong Big 12 opponent on the schedule Saturday.The Cowboys (7-2, 4-2 Big 12, No.11 CFP) need to forget about their previous gam and prepare to go on the road against No.24 Iowa State (6-3, 4-2, No.15 CFP)."I told the guys, `If we would have hit the last pass and won the game, you got to get over it to get ready for the next team,'" Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said Monday."My point is, you guys got to get back to work, got to get over it.I don't want to hear anything about a throw, I don't want to hear anything about a dropped coverage, I don't want to hear anything about tangled up and falling down and giving them a big play."While Gundy believes that putting that performance in the rear-view mirror would have been important win or lose, it will be especially crucial for the defense, which surrendered a school-record 785 yards to Oklahoma, shattering the previous mark of 718 by Texas Tech in 2007.The Cowboys also set dubious records by allowing an average of 10.3 yards per play and 16.6 yards per pass attempt."This one obviously stings, but like Coach Gundy was telling us, we can't let it fester, because it will affect us in getting ready for Iowa State," said senior linebacker Chad Whitener, whose interception on the goal line with 2:59 remaining and Oklahoma leading 55-52 set up OSU for their final offensive drive that could have won the game."Ames isn't an easy place to play, so we just need to go out there and be ready to learn from our mistakes.We have to really take advantage of the time that we have to prepare and get ready for another week.""The mindset doesn't change at all," added sophomore defensive end Jordan Brailford, who recorded six tackles, including 3.0 for a loss and 0.5 sacks, on Saturday."We always come back ready to go.We always go out there, practice hard and focus on getting ready for the next opponent."Gundy will also be relying on his senior leadership group to keep hammering that point home."I think leadership is going to be huge this week," said senior center Brad Lundblade."It takes more leadership after you lose than it does after you win, honestly.We have great leadership and all different types of leaders in all of the different position groups, so I have no doubt that we'll be ready to go next week."Gundy considers Iowa State yet another good opponent that will challenge his team.The Cyclones had won four straight, including wins over league leaders Oklahoma and TCU, before losing to West Virginia 20-16."You shoot them straight, tell them the way it is," Gundy said of the message to his team."`I wish you had a week off to feel sorry for yourself for a couple of days, but I've got news for you.You better get right, you better get ready to play, you're going up to play a team that's a legitimate top 20 team in my opinion and they've played extremely well at home.They might not look as flashy as some of the other teams you've played, with skill that goes all over the place, but you're going to see a team that doesn't make a lot of mistakes.'"
"Hollywood" Marquise Brown a rising star for No. 5 Oklahoma:::::NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- When folks give you the nickname "Hollywood," you're probably doing something right.Oklahoma receiver Marquise Brown is doing an awful lot right these days.The sophomore from Hollywood, Florida, burned Oklahoma State for a school-record 265 yards receiving in a 62-52 win last Saturday that vaulted the Sooners to No.5 in the latest AP poll .Brown's teammates have taken to the nickname."We all cut up and joked about it, but I think it'll be something that sticks with him," Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield said."I think he likes it.We'll roll with it.As long as he's catching passes and running like that, I don't care."Brown, a junior college transfer, now leads the team with 743 yards receiving, slightly ahead of tight end Mark Andrews.The Sooners hope he's got something left for Saturday's showdown with No.8 TCU for the Big 12 lead.Both teams are 8-1 overall and 5-1 in league play.The Sooners are also fifth in the playoff rankings, and TCU is eighth.Brown is generously listed at 5-foot-11 and 162 pounds.When Riley was asked about Brown's weight on Monday, he joked that Brown "weighs about half of how many yards he had the other day."The recognition is starting to come.Brown was named the Big 12 Newcomer of the Week after Saturday's effort and has been added to the Biletnikoff Award watch list, which honors the nation's top receiver.The Sooners started the season unsure of who would replace Biletnikoff winner Dede Westbrook as the team's primary deep threat.Now, there's no doubt.Westbrook was clocked at Oklahoma's pro day at 4.34 seconds in the 40-yard dash.Mayfield said Brown might be a step faster."It's a complete difference maker," Mayfield said."I think we saw somewhat with what Dede could do last year with that speed that he had, but I think Marquise is even faster.I love Dede, but Marquise, he's got another gear.For teams to have to game plan on that -- it's tricky, because you can't really leave him on an island because he's going to outrun you."Brown had his moments this season before the breakout performance against Oklahoma State.He caught six passes for 155 yards against Tulane, including an 87-yard touchdown.He caught six passes for 126 yards against Kansas State.He took it to a new level against Oklahoma State with touchdown catches of 84 and 77 yards among his nine receptions."I think he's just gotten more comfortable," coach Lincoln Riley said."We've gotten more comfortable with him.He's able to play more reps. And he's making more plays as the reps go up.He's done a great job."The comparisons to Westbrook are coming because of speed and production.It was Westbrook's single-game school yardage record that Brown topped last week."Dede's a little bit bigger, a little taller," Riley said."But the way they play, the way they attack the ball and are able to keep speed up while still catching the ball and some of the things they do route-wise are very similar."
Free-throw disparity bugs Thunder ahead of game vs. Kings:::::SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Oklahoma City Thunder aren't overly concerned that they broke from the gates a bit more slowly than they would have desired.They are far more peeved about the whistles they are receiving along the way, namely the ones blown by officials and the rate at which they are hearing them."We haven't been getting the benefit of the doubt," Oklahoma City guard Paul George told The Oklahoman after the Thunder's 103-99 loss to the Trail Blazers in Portland on Sunday.That defeat dropped Oklahoma City to 4-5 in the season's early stages, and one of the bigger issues involves free throws.Oklahoma City will seek a change in the pattern Tuesday night when it visits the Sacramento Kings at the Golden 1 Center.The Thunder rank 25th among the league's 30 teams in free-throw attempts per game at 19.0.Their opponents are shooting 24.4 per game, the ninth-highest figure in the league.The discrepancy reared its head in a blatant way Sunday when the Blazers outshot the Thunder 28-15 from the line and outscored them 22-8 on free throws.The ejection of forward Carmelo Anthony for a flagrant-2 foul on a play in which he originally was awarded a basket and apparent three-point-play attempt also stood out.Anthony is expected to play against the Kings."What's more concerning to me," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said, "is the fact that our opponents have gotten to the free-throw line 50 times more than we have."Reigning MVP Russell Westbrook, who racked up a record 42 triple-doubles last season while joining Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson (1961-62) as the only NBA players to average a triple-double for a season, is at 20.1 points, 9.0 rebounds and 11.4 assists per game this season.He has four triple-doubles.Last season, he averaged 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists.Anthony and George have been solid so far, too.Anthony is averaging 20.6 points and 5.7 rebounds in 32 minutes per game but has been held below 20 in three consecutive games.George is averaging 21.0 points and 5.1 rebounds in 34 minutes and has scored 20 in five straight.The Kings (1-8) could use a boost.They went winless on their just-concluded three-game road trip and have failed to score 100 points in four consecutive games.They are off to their worst start since dropping 13 of their first 14 in 1990-91.Rookie guard Bogdan Bogdanovic, the 25-year-old who spent five seasons playing in Europe, made 6 of 7 from the field and scored 14 points in Sacramento's 108-99 loss at Detroit on Saturday.He is averaging 10.7 points.Fellow rookie De'Aaron Fox is leading Sacramento at 12.7 points per game, but the Kings are looking for more early-game consistency."You have to work on it," Fox told the Sacramento Bee."You have to be in the best shape of your life to play that hard every possession, but it's something that I know I'm going to have to do.There are players in the league that do that, so I know I'm going to have to do it."
Penguins appreciative of Tocchet's contributions to back-to-back Cups:::::PITTSBURGH -- When Rick Tocchet returns to Pittsburgh, he will see another Stanley Cup banner in the rafters and be celebrated for his part in the championship.Tocchet doesn't plan on reminiscing too much about the Penguins' back-to-back titles, except perhaps for one important moment."I'm looking forward to my ring, yeah," he said.Tocchet will get his third Penguins Cup ring, his second as an assistant coach after one as a player, when he visits as coach of the Arizona Coyotes on Tuesday night.Whether it was fostering relationships with Phil Kessel and younger players or running the power play that scored on 21.9 percent of its chances during the 2016 and 2017 Cup runs, Tocchet was a valuable piece of the organization."The role he had, he did it extremely well," Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said Monday."He had a good read on the players and was able to communicate on a one-on-one basis with whatever they were dealing with hockey-wise and personally or whatever.He did a terrific job for us and played a key role."Tocchet settled into a comfortable spot on Pittsburgh's coaching staff, especially once Mike Sullivan took over for Mike Johnston in December 2015.Sullivan values Tocchet's knowledge and said over the summer they grew to trust each other through some challenging times.Tocchet doesn't want to claim an oversized chunk of the credit for the Penguins' back-to-back championships."You just do your part," Tocchet said after the Coyotes' morning skate in Washington."The players for me are the major contributors, Mike Sullivan obviously making the decisions.Even a team that wins a Stanley Cup, your fourth-line player has to do something.To win a Cup, everybody has to kind of pull the rope, and that's the way we did in Pittsburgh.Whether you're a player, coach, a scout or whatever, I think everybody contributed."The Penguins are planning a video tribute to Tocchet to play during the Coyotes' only visit of the season, and fans no doubt feel a special connection with him after he also played on the 1992 Cup team.But the 53-year-old pointed to his Stanley Cup party over the summer as closure on his Pittsburgh days and insisted his focus is on helping Arizona rebound from losing 14 of its first 16 games.Of course, one text he got in the middle of the struggles shows how likable he was to Penguins players.It was a simple message from captain Sidney Crosby: "Hang in there."That kind of camaraderie is already building with the young Coyotes, who routinely ask Tocchet about Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and others to pick his brain about some of the best in the game."Obviously guys are interested in what (Crosby has) done because of how successful he was and his relationship with coach Tocch," Coyotes rookie forward Clayton Keller said."It's good to have that relationship.Not many guys get to work with Sidney Crosby.He definitely has a lot of information."Tocchet feared early in his Arizona tenure that he was name-dropping Crosby and the Penguins a little too much.Only his new players keep asking, and he has enough in the memory bank from the past three years to keep it coming."It's mostly the players engaging: `Hey, what does Crosby do in these situations?What does Malkin do in this situation?How does this guy do that?'"Tocchet said."So that's the engagement, and I love that because they want to learn.If you're 20-year-old kids, they watch YouTube.They want to see how these guys do certain things, and I love that about it."As Tocchet passes on what Penguins stars did at practice or in key situations, he's conscious that their success as a team helped him get his first head coaching job since parts of two seasons with Tampa Bay from 2008-2010."I was very fortunate to have a great staff, work for Mike Sullivan," Tocchet said."I learned a lot from him.And I also learned a lot from the players.I was lucky enough to coach the Crosbys, Malkins, Kessels, Letangs -- high-end guys that keep you on your toes."
Jaguars' Tom Coughlin voices support for Jalen Ramsey's actions vs. Bengals:::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville Jaguars executive Tom Coughlin is backing cornerback Jalen Ramsey, saying he "was playing football within the rules" when Cincinnati Bengals receiver A.J.Green attacked him Sunday.Ramsey and Green were ejected late in the first half of Jacksonville's 23-7 victory.More Jacksonville Jaguars news Referee Brad Allen said Ramsey was ejected for instigating the fight, and Green was tossed for throwing punches.Officials warned both players following verbal exchanges earlier in the game.Coughlin took exception with Ramsey's dismissal."Our players are instructed to not retaliate or get involved or do anything that would result in eviction because that would hurt the team," Coughlin said in a statement on Tuesday."Team comes first, and Jalen was trying to not hurt his team.While he did push his opponent -- something that happened with other players during the game -- he did not retaliate, he threw no punches, and he did not fight back."Jalen was doing what Coach (Doug) Marrone has instructed him to do, which is to play tough, be physical and to make every play difficult for his opponent.There was banter going back and forth during the game, but Jalen was playing football within the rules."The NFL said Monday that Green would not be suspended for his actions.Ramsey and Green both could be fined for the fight.124 View Gallery Logan Bowles-USA TODAY Sports | Logan Bowles

Ducks' Getzlaf out up to 2 months:::::ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf will be sidelined up to two months after surgery for a broken cheekbone.The Ducks announced the extent of their latest major injury Tuesday.Getzlaf was hit in the face by a puck early in the Ducks' game at Carolina on Oct. 29.He has missed Anaheim's past three games, and he had surgery Monday.Getzlaf has one goal and six assists in six games this season for the five-time defending Pacific Division champion Ducks.He led Anaheim to the Western Conference finals last season, scoring 73 points in 74 regular-season games and adding 19 points in 17 playoff games.The Ducks are already playing without key contributors Ryan Kesler (hip surgery), Cam Fowler (knee) and Patrick Eaves (Guillain-Barre syndrome).
Ouch: Ryan Getzlaf out two months after cheekbone surgery:::::The injury woes continue for the Anaheim Ducks.Captain Ryan Getzlaf will miss the next two months as he recovers from cheekbone surgery following an errant puck to the face on Oct. 29.Getlzaf had surgery on Tuesday to repair a fractured zygomatic bone, the team announced.NEWS: Executive VP/GM Bob Murray said Ryan Getzlaf had surgery to repair a fracture to his zygomatic bone.Recovery could be up to 2 months.Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) November 7, 2017 The Ducks are awaiting the return of forward Ryan Kesler (hip), who's expected back sometime around Christmas, but GM Bob Murray is hoping it's sooner."He's skating much harder now," Murray said."He's had to learn his stride all over again, to be quite honest.For a couple years, he's been, for a lack of a better word, short-striding it.You could see he wasn't pushing.He has to learn to lengthen his stride again and get the muscles back."Also, defenseman Cam Fowler (knee) remains out for the next six weeks."He's doing lateral movement in the gym," Murray said."He's reponded much better to this one than the one last year which is amazing because they thought this was worse.He's coming along really, really well."
Who to pick up in Week 10 fantasy football:::::There's little more frustrating to a fantasy player than a surprise inactive on game day.That's what happened Sunday with running back Leonard Fournette of Jacksonville and tight end Zach Ertz of Philadelphia.Sure, Fournette missed the Jaguars' last game before the bye with an ankle sprain, but all signs were that he would play in Week 9.The Eagles told us all week that Ertz was recovered from a hamstring strain, but he couldn't get the injury to loosen up during pregame warmups and he was forced to miss the contest.Situations like these illustrate the importance of having a bench that can cover late injuries.You want to make sure that you're covered under just about any injury circumstance.The last thing you want to have to do is go to the waiver wire 90 minutes before the games start Sunday hoping you can find a last minute replacement.Sure, there might be a gift player available, but odds are you will just be picking bones off a waiver carcass.Here's who you should be looking at for Week 10: MARQISE LEE, WR, Jacksonville Jaguars (43 percent owned) Lee makes this list for the second week in a row.He is miscast as a WR1 for an NFL team but he's the best of what the Jaguars have since Allen Robinson was lost for the season with an ACL tear.The Jags are a run-first team but with safeties creeping up toward the line of scrimmage in order to stop Fournette or Chris Ivory, Lee will never see double coverage or a safety over the top.He's a solid WR3.DEDE WESTBROOK, WR, Jacksonville Jaguars (16 percent) It's extremely dangerous to rely on rookie wide receivers who have missed time due to injury.We have no idea if they know the entire route tree or what kind of rapport they have with the QB, but what we do know with Westbrook is that he was close to being active in Week 9 and will almost certainly be active this week.He could have a bigger role than expected right away due to the lack of playmakers in the Jacksonville passing game and should be worth a pickup.ROBERT WOODS, WR, Los Angeles Rams (24 percent) How many people realize that the Rams are second in the NFL in points scored (263)?Shouldn't we all want a piece of this offense?Woods was initially signed by the Rams during free agency to be their WR1, but was sort of forgotten about when the team drafted Cooper Kupp and traded for Sammy Watkins.Well, Kupp has been inconsistent and Watkins is barely startable in fantasy leagues.Woods has been the WR you can most rely on and one would think the passing offense may only get better, as quarterback Jared Goff gains experience and confidence with each game.DANNY WOODHEAD, RB, Baltimore Ravens (36 percent) We are at the point in the season where players who were injured early and placed on injured reserve could be on their way back to the lineup.Woodhead was signed during free agency to be the back who would catch four to six passes out of the backfield each game as a safety valve for QB Joe Flacco.Woodhead could play this week and certainly no later than Week 11.He had success in the past and could be a boon to teams down the stretch.One worry, however, could be that he plays a similar role as Buck Allen, so make sure not to break the bank for him as these backs could cannibalize each other.ROD SMITH, RB, Dallas Cowboys (14 percent) No one knows what will happen with Ezekiel Elliott.What we do know is that the next chapter in this courtroom drama will be heard Tuesday.Should the court once again uphold the suspension, it's almost a free for all in the Dallas backfield.While Alfred Morris and/or Darren McFadden could get shots at the starting job, it's not written in stone that they will get the job done.Some experts believe Smith is the best fit for this run offense and will get the starting job eventually.The bottom line is, if you have a dead spot on your roster, does it really hurt you to pick up Smith just in case he does end up the starter?No, and he could be the type of player that ends up winning a league.-- -- This column was provided to The Associated Press by the Fantasy Sports Network, http://FNTSY.com
Broncos sticking with Osweiler at QB:::::ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Jake Butt won't be rescuing the Denver Broncos' faltering offense, at least not this season.The rookie tight end is headed to injured reserve along with quarterback Chad Kelly, the seventh-rounder from Mississippi State who is still working his way back from knee and wrist surgeries."Chad Kelly came back to practice last week and numbers-wise it doesn't make sense for our football team" to carry four quarterbacks, coach Vance Joseph said Monday."We were hoping that Jake could come back and help us at this point, but he's not ready yet."The former Michigan star was a projected first-round draft pick before tearing his right ACL in the Orange Bowl.He slipped to the fifth round and the Broncos were hoping he'd give them a much-needed boost at the midpoint of the season.Going on IR "doesn't mean I'm going to be checked out of these meetings and waiting on next year," Butt said."I'm still going to be locked in and trying to learn as much as I can this year.But in terms of the overall health of my knee, yeah, that probably is going to help me long-term just having extra time to rehab and strengthen it and get back to full health."Joseph also announced Monday that he's sticking with Brock Osweiler as his starting quarterback despite his pair of costly interceptions in Denver's 51-23 flop in Philadelphia on Sunday.Despite making many mistakes and completing just half of his 38 throws, Osweiler energized the team after taking over for a turnover-prone Trevor Siemian and made several good decisions, such as his audible on his touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas, Joseph said."So, I think Brock deserves one more week to kind of prove that he's the guy for us," Joseph said."Because he had a great week of preparation."Joseph isn't committing to any quarterback beyond Sunday, when the Broncos (3-5) host the Patriots (6-2): "I'm only concerned about the Patriots this week and we'll see where we are next Monday."If Osweiler has another middling performance, Joseph might go back to Siemian or give former first-round draft pick Paxton Lynch a look, although he was quoted by the CBS crew Sunday as saying the ex-Memphis star wasn't ready physically or mentally to play after getting hurt in the preseason.Joseph explained Monday that he wasn't talking about "a lack of football IQ," but "I was talking more about time on the job.He's missed so much time.So, to put him in an NFL game in Week 10 wouldn't be fair to our football team or to Paxton."No matter who's calling the plays, Joseph said the coaching staff has to do a better job preparing them.Offensive coordinator Mike McCoy has stuck to a steady diet of three-wide receiver sets even though 18 of the 21 sacks and all 10 interceptions over the last six games have come out of that formation."Am I satisfied with the play calling" on offense?Joseph said."I've said this after every loss, that we've got to coach better.When you lose football games in this league, you have to coach better; you have to play better.It's a league that's really built and operated to have equal parts.So, the difference sometimes is the coaching.The difference is the scheme and play calling."So, when you don't win, absolutely you have to coach better.And that starts with me.And I understand that.Because in this league coaching is very important and the better-coached teams win.I'll leave it at that."With five losses in six games, the Broncos are mired in their worst slump since a stretch of nine losses in 10 games that cost coach Josh McDaniels his job in 2010.After each of their last four defeats, Joseph, a first-time head coach, has mentioned he didn't see it coming because the team had great weeks of practice and had put together great game plans."Well, I'll tell you this.I told the players this five minutes ago, I said, `Guys, we have worked hard and that's to your credit.We have put some good work in.But you're judged on Sundays.You're judged one day a week and that's the day you have to show up and perform,'" Joseph said."So, the practices, it's been good.But it should be good.We're NFL players and coaches.We get paid to do this job so we should have good work each week.It has not translated, obviously, in four weeks to wins."The silver lining is that Kansas City (5-3) has lost three straight so the Broncos are only two games out of the AFC West lead."We have time, but time's running out," Joseph said."So, we've got to fix it right now."-- -- For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP -- NFL
Roy Halladay Dies in Plane Crash in Gulf of Mexico:::::The news of Halladays death was quickly followed by expressions of grief on social media.We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladays untimely death, the Phillies said in a statement posted to Twitter.There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.A two-time Cy Young Award winner and an eight-time All-Star, Halladay was a 6-foot-6 right-hander known for his durability and command.After 12 major league seasons with the Blue Jays, who drafted him in 1995, he was traded to the Phillies in December 2009.Halladay made 2010 a definitive year in his career.He threw the 20th perfect game in major league history during the regular season, and in a division playoff series against Cincinnati, he threw the second no-hitter in postseason history.After the postseason no-hitter, Dusty Baker, the Reds manager at the time and a fixture in the sport going back to the late 1960s, said, That is the best-pitched game Ive seen since Ive been going to the playoffs and the World Series.One of the strongest messages of condolence on social media came from Pedro Martinez, the three-time Cy Young Award winner whose prime coincided with Halladays.Halladays career was cut short by back trouble, however.He became a much weaker pitcher in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, and he retired at 36, signing a one-day contract with Toronto to leave the game as a Blue Jay.Based on his retirement date, Halladay will not be considered for election to baseballs Hall of Fame until 2019, but he will have a strong case because of his dominance in his strongest seasons.His career record of 203-105 and his 2,117 career strikeouts are not eye-popping numbers, but using the JAWS system, an evaluation tool that accounts for a players peak seasons as well as his overall career, Halladay is ranked as baseballs 42nd-best starting pitcher.Only nine players ahead of him are not yet in the Hall of Fame, while more than 30 players below him on the list are already enshrined in Cooperstown.His postseason success and his popularity with the news media also bolster his case.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly after he retired, Halladay discussed how odd it felt not to play baseball.I find myself kind of sitting around the house thinking, Theres something missing here I should be working out, I should be running, I should be doing something, Halladay said.For a second, its kind of a little bit of panic, and then it kind of sets in: O.K., thats right.Im retiring now.Its actually a very peaceful feeling.He eventually turned to flying as an outlet, and in October he posted pictures of the plane he had recently purchased.Halladay, whose father was a pilot, knew the risks that flying presented.He joked about his wifes opposition to his purchasing the plane in a video that had been posted to YouTube by ICON but that was removed shortly after the crash.Shes fought me the whole way, Halladay said of his wife, Brandy.Hard, Brandy Halladay said in the video.I fought hard, I was very against it.She conceded after flying in the plane, though, that she understood the appeal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Piloting small planes has long been popular among athletes, and Major League Baseball has lost other athletes to similar crashes.Thurman Munson, an All-Star catcher and the 10th captain of the Yankees, died after crashing a Cessna Citation in 1979.And Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladays on the 2003 Blue Jays, died in 2006 when a Cirrus SR20 he was flying with a co-pilot crashed into an apartment building on Manhattans Upper East Side.The fact that the Pasco County Sheriffs Office led Tuesdays recovery effort carried extra emotion because of Halladays personal relationship with the department, which included the donation of a police dog that the department named Doc, in reference to Halladays nickname.You wouldnt know what Roy did because Roy wouldnt tell you what he did, Nocco said.And thats the legacy of a great man.Halladay is survived by his wife and two sons, Ryan and Braden.
Joe Girardi Didnt Sufficiently Connect With Yankees Players, Cashman Says:::::Cashman would not address any specific instances of poor communication, but some examples were evident this year.Girardi a former catcher was so frustrated by Sanchezs inattentiveness on defense that he briefly benched him and publicly criticized him in August.And during the playoffs, closer Aroldis Chapman liked an Instagram post that urged the Yankees not to bring back Girardi, though he later said it was an accident.In an interview on the WFAN radio station that ran concurrently with Cashmans conference call, Girardi disputed the idea that there were any communication problems and described his relationship with Sanchez as supportive.I think Brian was looking for something different, and evidently I didnt fit the mold, said Girardi, who nonetheless did not give an alternative reason for his dismissal.Cashman, who dismissed reports that hinted at increasing friction between him and Girardi this season or that Girardi did not work well with the analytics staff, also said that Girardis managerial gaffe in the postseason neglecting to call for a replay challenge that may have prevented a loss to the Cleveland Indians in Game 2 of an American League division series had nothing to do with his ouster.Asked if Girardi would have been back had the Yankees reached the World Series instead of losing in a seven-game American League Championship Series to the Houston Astros, Cashman said: Its tough to put a hypothetical in there.We went where we went.After the Yankees lost Game 7 on Oct. 21, they returned home the next day.Cashman gave his recommendation to Hal Steinbrenner, the teams principal owner, the next day, and Girardi was informed the following day, a Tuesday.The decision was announced two days later, on Thursday morning an off day during the World Series.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Though Cashman, whose contract has expired as well, said he had not yet reached an agreement on a new deal with Steinbrenner, he made clear that he would like to return.He said there were other priorities: the move of Kevin Reese from pro scouting director to director of player development, scouting meetings that wrapped up Friday, next weeks general manager meetings and the hiring of a new manager.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That last task is certain to garner a great deal of attention.Of the six teams that parted ways with their managers at the end of this season, only the Yankees have yet to name a replacement, and Cashman indicated that the search was just getting underway.He is winnowing a list of prospective candidates to bring in for interviews.He declined to say how many people would be interviewed but said that a previous relationship with the Yankees or managerial experience was not a prerequisite.Theres no perfect person that checks every box, Cashman said.I dont care whether theyre Hall of Famer categories.Asked if Alex Rodriguez, who served this season as an adviser to Steinbrenner while being paid $21 million for the final year of his contract, was a candidate, Cashman said, I definitely do not want to go through who may or may not be a candidate.But he promised a transparent process, one in which as with the clubs last managerial opening, which occurred after Joe Torre was pushed out 10 years ago each candidate will meet with the local news media after being interviewed.While Girardi acutely prepared but with a stilted personality seemed the antithesis of the avuncular Torre, Cashman said it would be a mistake to think the Yankees would be turning toward somebody who was solely a master communicator.The best candidate will also have to also be well versed in analytics, understand the role of sports science and be willing to challenge conventional thinking.Its an easy narrative to run to the opposite of what you already had, Cashman said.If somebody was too, for instance, structured and demanding, then you want to go from an old-school, heavy-handed personality to a new-school players manager thats not a narrative Im falling into.Were looking for the best person possible.INSIDE PITCH The Yankees did not make a qualifying offer, worth $17.4 million, to three players eligible for it: pitchers C. C. Sabathia and Michael Pineda and designated hitter Matt Holliday.Third baseman Todd Frazier and pitcher Jaime Garcia were not eligible for qualifying offers because they were acquired during the season.All the players are now free agents.Outfielder Jake Cave and pitcher Nick Rumbelow were added to the 40-man roster.

On the first Saturday of November in 1980, undefeated Georgia took on South Carolina at home.It was the Bulldogs first nationally televised game that season, and it introduced viewers across the country to the powerful freshman running back Herschel Walker, who ran for 219 yards in his teams victory.A lot has changed since then thanks to CBS, NBC, ESPN and the SEC Network, every one of Georgias games this season has been available everywhere but around here, mid-autumn still means facing the Gamecocks, a marked ability to run the ball and the eternal springing of hope.In 1980, that hope was rewarded with a national championship, Georgias only one in the past half-century.As Georgia took care of South Carolina again on Saturday, 24-10 , the Bulldogs (9-0) are once again setting their sights on a national title run.While they stayed at No.2 in the latest Associated Press poll on Sunday afternoon, the College Football Playoff selection committee named them college footballs best team in its initial rankings last week, and it is likely to keep them there when new rankings come out Tuesday night.So it was a great day to be Kirby Smart, the former Georgia safety who now serves as the Bulldogs second-year head coach.Right, Coach?Whats there to celebrate?Smart said after the game.Were going to play Auburn this week.Thats where our focus is.Referring to several high school players making their official visits, he added, The only thing significant right now is that I get back over there, talk with these recruits, and get ready for Auburn.For context, Smart like South Carolinas coach, Will Muschamp is a former assistant to Alabama Coach Nick Saban.And for all of Sabans defensive innovations, the great coachs true hallmark is his extreme-Zen outlook , in which celebrating only gets in the way of further accomplishment.At his current rate of self-congratulation, Saban, 66, is on track to bask in the glory of the five national titles he has won (so far) around a decade after he retires.And Smart is not wrong.Challenges remain for Georgia, not least Saturdays trip to No.10 Auburn (7-2).As always, Georgia finishes against Georgia Tech, whose option offense is overlooked at ones peril.Then there is the Southeastern Conference title game, which will be either a rematch against Auburn or a heavyweight fight against who else?Alabama.The Crimson Tide are also 9-0 and are currently first in the A.P.poll, first in the coaches poll and (for now) second in the selection committees rankings.We really just stayed humble, the Georgia sophomore J.R. Reed said of his teams mind-set.And we know that, hey, the playoffs really start right now, and we lose one, were out.But we dont really focus on that.Image Georgia Coach Kirby Smart celebrating with cornerback Deandre Baker after a defensive stop in the second half of the Bulldogs 24-10 win over South Carolina on Saturday.Credit Joshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald, via Associated Press I guarantee you, added Reed, referring to the fact that Georgia was at that moment minutes away from clinching its first appearance in the SEC title game since 2012, half the guys dont even know that yet.The Bulldogs were helped Saturday not only by their effort between the hedges at Sanford Stadium, but also by Kentuckys loss, which ensured Georgias spot in the SEC title game on Dec. 2.Alabama and Auburn won, making potential future Bulldogs wins against them more impressive in the committees eyes, and Notre Dames victory kept the luster on Georgias 20-19 victory over the Fighting Irish in September.Finally, Ohio State and Penn State lost, damaging the Big Tens playoff hopes and holding out the possibility that Reeds analysis aside Georgia might be able to absorb a loss and still make the four-team playoff.That mouthful of scenarios, with far-flung games involving teams Georgia will not play having profound consequences on its season, illustrates the dizzying reality of college football today.Though there are roughly the same number of good football programs in 2017 as in 1980, these days it is much harder, or at least more complicated, to be crowned national champion when the season is done.Here is how the Bulldogs captured the 1980 title.They won all their regular-season games.Then they played in the Sugar Bowl, because they were invited, and there they beat Notre Dame, which also was there because it was invited.The Irish were ranked No.7 in the final A.P.poll, making them the only Georgia opponent that finished ranked.Georgia also was the countrys only undefeated team, and so when the Bulldogs won their bowl, they were voted No.1.Ta-da!National champions.Today, 12-0 against arbitrarily weak opposition will not cut it.Teams often line up strong intersectional competition to improve their playoff rsums.They play in a conference title game.Their win-loss record is considered in the context of their schedule strength.And then they must win two more games against teams who were selected not to please bowl officials, but because they were dispassionately judged to be the best of the best.For whatever reason, in the postseason era going back to the first Bowl Championship Series title game after the 1998 season Georgia, the flagship team of one of the top states for recruiting, has been consistently great but never the best.Under Mark Richt from 2001 to 2015, for instance, Georgia finished ranked 11 times, and in the top 10 five times.But it never made the national postseason during a span in which SEC teams won nine titles.So perhaps Smarts myopic mind-set is, well, smart.Georgia has not yet done the things for which they hang your picture and speak of you a half-century hence.Smarts players showed all evidence after the game of buying into his vision, repeating his koans like keep chopping and humilitys a week away, and emphasizing that they were concerned exclusively with winning the next game.Just turn off ESPN, Reed said, youll be fine.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B 9 of the New York edition with the headline: At 9-0, Georgia Is So Close to (and So Far From) Its Goal Sign up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
After Beating Packers, Lions Set Their Sights on the Vikings:::::With every short pass from Brett Hundley, every drive that ended in a field goal or a punt and every lingering shot of Aaron Rodgers standing on the sideline, it seemed like the Green Bay Packers were falling farther from anything resembling contention.The N.F.C.North is far from having been decided, but after Green Bays 30-17 loss at home to the Detroit Lions on Monday night, the Lions certainly seem to have the better chance of challenging the Minnesota Vikings for division supremacy.And if the Packers continue to tumble and slip out of playoff contention, they might not even feel the need to bring Rodgers back once he is eligible to return in Week 15 from the injured reserve, where he landed after breaking his collarbone on Oct. 15.For now, the North is Minnesotas division to lose.At 6-2 and riding a four-game winning streak, the Vikings are two games ahead of both Detroit and Green Bay.The Upshots Playoff Simulator gives the Vikings a 65 percent chance of winning the division.But last season showed that a hot start by the Vikings does not guarantee much, as their 5-0 start to the season was undercut by a 3-8 finish, leaving the Packers and Lions to fight for the division crown on the final day of the regular season (the Packers won out).When breaking down the three contenders, the biggest argument for the Lions is their quarterback stability.Matthew Stafford, who has not missed a game since 2010, is a true franchise quarterback (with a salary commensurate of such a distinction) who has a knack for late-game heroics.On Monday he did not need another of his signature comebacks, as he completed 26 of 33 passes for 361 yards and two touchdowns in his teams blowout win.The win was just Detroits second victory in Green Bay since the start of the 1992 season (a span of 27 games).Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Packers are in dire straits with Hundley, who was rarely asked to throw the ball more than five yards on Monday night, but they at least have the benefit of having a long-term plan at quarterback (hint: Its Rodgers).The same cannot be said of the Vikings, who have a complicated quarterback controversy on their hands.Photo Case Keenum has performed well in Sam Bradfords absence, but he will soon be challenged for the starting role not just by Bradford, who is working his way back from a knee injury, but also by Teddy Bridgewater, the Vikings former starter who has missed the last 24 regular season games after a devastating knee injury in the 2016 preseason.
A Night in Belgrade With an Undercover Crowd Monitor: Try to Act Casual:::::On Thursday, I joined the Fare observer in the stands in Belgrade to see firsthand how the program works.The observer asked that his identity be kept secret so that he could continue to do his job.Today, Fare has approximately 240 volunteer observers worldwide.On Thursday, they also were in the stands at five other Europa League games in Croatia, the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, and Russia.But the match in Serbia was the one Fare officials viewed most warily.Photo You never know what they might prepare for a game, the observer said of the fans as he packed a powerful camera able to photograph and film even the farthest reaches of the stadium.Soccer in the Balkans, at every level, is inextricably tied with national identity, and this game would be no different.Ethnic tensions still simmer between several of the countries the legacy of a brutal ethnic war in the region during the 1990s and the memory of a disastrous Euro 2016 qualifying match two years ago at Partizan Stadium between the national teams of Serbia and Albania is a reminder of how they can boil over.That match descended into chaos when a drone carrying a nationalist Albanian flag hovered over the field; when a Serbian player pulled it to the ground, the reaction sparked fighting on the field between not only the teams and but pitch-invading fans.Last month, when Partizan and Skenderbeu played in Albania, a Fare observer recorded the home fans chanting, Serbs must be killed, destroyed, slaughtered.As a result of Fares documentation, UEFA, in addition to the $70,000 fine, ordered Skenderbeu to play its next Europa match behind closed doors.The observer on Thursday was monitoring his 21st match.The introductory call to the UEFA delegate signaled the start of his night; after the game he would file a full report to Fare headquarters.A graduate student in his mid-20s, he wore nondescript slacks and a jacket, following orders from Fare to blend into the crowd.Observers, for example, avoid wearing sneakers from New Balance, whose N logo has been co-opted by neo-Nazis for the last decade.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You just try to act casual, he said.Were not the C.I.A.Still, observers must stay vigilant.Fans in some countries, angry that their clubs are being punished, have tried to find and harass Fare observers at matches.A couple of years ago in Poland, one had to call the police after being identified and menacingly approached by fans after a match.The observer therefore moved carefully through the crowd outside the stadium before the game on Thursday, looking for early signs of turbulence.But things were oddly calm.Fans stood around eating seeds.Police officers wearing body armor shuffled in place, looking bored.Remember to smile, the observer said, not quite heeding his own advice.Were supposed to be normal tourists.Were having fun.Photo Things were unexpectedly subdued inside the stadium, too.The atmosphere likely owed to the huge steps the city had taken to increase security for the match.Amid heightened scrutiny from UEFA, the home club had also implored its fans to behave.The clubs, furthermore, had agreed not to allow traveling fans into one anothers stadiums.Of course the south stand, where Partizans most hard-core fans known as Grobari, or the Gravediggers sit, was still packed and rowdy.Monitoring a game, it became clear, demanded a subtle touch and thespian manner: throughout the night, the observer made token glances toward the action on the field snapping some photographs of the game, and casually clapping for the home team before surreptitiously training his focus back on the ultras.Early on he spotted a banner that read South Guard, with the O replaced by a Celtic cross, a symbol widely used by neo-Nazis to denote the concept of white supremacy.The fans on Thursday, however, had haphazardly obscured the cross with some tape, so the observer reluctantly ignored it.A suspicious skull on another banner was eventually deemed to be harmless, too.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Fare this summer released a Global Guide to Discriminatory Practices in Football, a booklet that is essentially a 75-page picture encyclopedia of slurs and offensive symbols from around the world.But observers are constantly evaluating new material on the fly.Minutes before kickoff on Thursday, for example, Partizans ultras unveiled an enormous graphic banner depicting Lazar Hrebeljanovic, a Serbian ruler who was killed in 1389 in the Battle of Kosovo while fighting an invading Ottoman army.As it fluttered across the stands, the fans belted out an old Serbian war march.It was the sort of abstruse display that reinforced the value of observers who possess expertise in local politics, history and culture.The observer determined that while the display was clearly meant to provoke the Albanians, it did not cross the threshold of discrimination.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its provocative, but if its not amplified by a further message, then its not enough, Pavel Klymenko, the coordinator of Fares observer program, said of the banner.We can report what we think things mean, but in strictly legal terms, we have to prove what the intention was, what the motive was, how the victims were affected.Klymenko offered a vivid example of the fine line that bisects all this gray area: This summer, fans of Red Star Belgrade Partizans archrival, which plays only a short walk away employed a slogan, in chants and on a larger banner, that included a homophobic slur.A Fare observer recorded the evidence, and Red Star was punished by UEFA with a partial stadium closure.A month later, the same fans used a chant and banner with wording almost identical to the previous one, except they replaced the slur with the phrase the white plague, which in Serbia refers to a sub-replacement fertility rate.Photo It was clearly another homophobic display.But because the fans phrasing was ever so slightly ambiguous obscured by a layer of self-reference UEFA took no disciplinary action.You get kind of sad, like, I cant believe Im doing this in the 21st century, the observer said about the job.But it gives me motivation when, for example, we see the observing scheme get some results.In the 2014-2015 season, Fare recorded incidents at 47 of the 113 matches it reviewed in person.In the 2015-2016 season, there were 20 incidents recorded at 188 matches, and in the 2016-2017 season, there were 25 incidents at 114 matches, according to the organization.Deterring discriminatory behavior, the organization knows, is just a first step.Changing their attitudes will take way longer, take way more time, Klymenko said.The fruits of this principle of deterrence were on view Thursday night.The Partizan ultras yelled the phrase Kosovo is Serbia!repeatedly, at one point engaging the entire stadium in a booming, call-and-response rendition of the chant.But this, too, was deemed within the bounds of acceptability, as it was seen to fall within the realm of political expression.Otherwise, there was nothing.Partizan scored in each half, the minutes ticked off the clock, and the observer seemed slightly dumbfounded, and a bit delighted, that no incidents occurred.At the final whistle, the crowd detonated a euphoric shout, and the home players left the field to joyous singing and applause.Minutes later, they reappeared, half-undressed, and waved their arms around as the fans continued to sing.It was an affecting tableau, and the Fare observer looked content.Look at them, he said.This is perfect.This is what we want.Upon leaving the stadium he sent a text message to the UEFA delegate he had called that afternoon.Dear Delegate, there were no incidents to report, the observer wrote.Thank you for your cooperation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then he peeled away, dodging a crowd of police officers in riot gear, to find a taxi.
No Russian Anthem at Olympics? I.O.C. Weighing Possible Penalties:::::Dr. Rodchenkov said the cheating was most flagrant at the last Winter Games, in 2014 in Sochi, Russia.The host country swept the standings, winning 33 medals 13 of them gold.Now the I.O.C.and Russian officials are engaged in a doping stare-down.Many athletes, antidoping officials and Olympic officials from some countries are urging Thomas Bach, president of the I.O.C., to issue severe penalties.The top Olympic officials are also considering the option of having Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag at the Pyeongchang Games or wear neutral uniforms, according to the people familiar with the case.They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The I.O.C.is unlikely to impose a total ban on Russia, an Olympic heavyweight, though it could issue a significant financial penalty, expel athletes and officials found to have been part of the doping scheme and remove any mention of Russia from the field of play, according to the people.Russian officials have threatened to pull their athletes out of the Pyeongchang Games altogether if the sanctions are too harsh.A decision is expected to be made on Dec. 5, when the I.O.C.s executive board meets.Before then the officials will receive the results of a much-delayed study by the former Swiss president Samuel Schmid into Mr. McLarens report, which linked several state organs, including the intelligence agency FSB, to the doping conspiracy.A group of 17 national antidoping agencies published a letter in September demanding that Russia be excluded from the Pyeongchang Games.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The failure to expeditiously investigate individual Russian athlete doping poses a clear and present danger for clean athletes worldwide and at the 2018 Winter Games, said the letter, whose signatories included the United States and British antidoping agencies.Photo Russia is expected to react with fury, and even withdraw its team from the Winter Games, if the I.O.C.issues a severe punishment.The Pyeongchang Olympics are scheduled to take place about six weeks before President Vladimir V. Putin stands for re-election.The position is unequivocal for all Russians will not compete under the neutral flag at the Olympic Games, Alexander Zhukov, the president of Russias Olympic committee, said in comments published on the Russian website R-Sport.They will speak for their country.This option is not even being considered.The late rush to settle on a punishment is a repeat of events ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.Then, in the wake of Dr. Rodchenkovs revelations, the I.O.C.ordered individual sports federations to determine the eligibility of Russian athletes for those Games.Some, like cycling, rowing, and track and field, adopted blanket bans, while others admitted athletes who could prove they were clean.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Last week at a meeting of the 205 eligible Olympic nations and territories, Mr. Bach said that any manipulation of samples at Sochi would constitute a direct attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and on the I.O.C.But since the start of the crisis he has emphasized his opposition to collective punishment, preferring that each athlete have a chance to establish his innocence.Mr. Bach has forcefully pushed back at calls for the I.O.C.to act more swiftly against Russia.He has said that punishments cannot be determined before the I.O.C.s inquiries have been completed.The I.O.C.also commissioned an investigation by the head of its disciplinary commission, Denis Oswald, into possible doping violations by individual athletes at the Sochi, London and Beijing Games.In the Olympic movement, everybody when we say everybody, it is everybody everybody enjoys the same rights and obligations, and everyone enjoys the right to a fair and due procedure, Mr. Bach said.I call all of you to respect this fair procedure for all our colleagues, because we always think how you would react if you were accused of some wrongdoings and what you would expect from your colleagues.No winter sports federation has publicly supported a total ban of Russian athletes at the Pyeongchang Games.Last week the I.O.C.penalized the first two athletes following Oswalds investigation.The Russian cross-country skiers Alexander Legkov and Evgeniy Belov were barred for life for doping violations at the Sochi Games.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Rodchenkov said Russia tampered with urine samples that would have failed drug tests in Sochi.Mr. Oswalds commission has taken longer than first anticipated to reach verdicts after it struggled to come up with a suitable method of detecting whether bottles previously considered tamper-proof had been manipulated.Mr. McLarens report captured the scale and audaciousness of Russias doping program, using forensic analysis to corroborate the testimony of Dr. Rodchenkov.The report said the drug tests of about 1,000 athletes across several Olympics were corrupted, but acknowledged that proving wrongdoing for individual cases would be difficult given Russias lack of cooperation in providing lab data and its history of destroying tainted urine samples that would be plainly incriminating.The World Anti-Doping Agency has cleared 95 of the first 96 athletes whose cases of doping in competitions have been reviewed.The agency in 2015 declared Russia noncompliant with global sports accepted antidoping code.Among several requirements for regaining compliance, the agency said, Russian antidoping authorities must publicly accept the findings in Mr. McLarens report and the Russian government must provide access to the stored urine samples in the Moscow laboratory.Russia has not fulfilled either of those demands yet.Russian officials have cited a continuing FSB investigation for refusing WADA access to lab samples and data.World Anti-Doping Agency leaders will meet on Nov. 16 to decide whether Russia should once again be considered compliant.Noncompliance could lead the I.O.C.to issue sterner punishments.
Kyle Martino Enters Race for U.S. Soccer President:::::When a club in England is failing and theyre in jeopardy of going into administration and disappearing, fans, former players, business people they all get together with their time, experiences and resources with the sole purpose of saving a club they love.We need to do that with U.S. Soccer.Photo We need a group, to step up and say, Enough is enough, were here to save this thing.I can mobilize that group.After having worked the weekend in his usual studio role, as the lone American on NBCs team of Premier League broadcasters, Martino, 36, is leaving the network immediately to begin traveling the country to build out his consortium and learn to speak every language of the U.S. soccer community in advance of the federations election on Feb. 10.Candidates have until Dec. 12 to announce their intention to run and submit the required nominations.Martino is the third prominent ex-U.S. player to announce his intention to run for the presidency, joining his fellow broadcaster Eric Wynalda and the two-time World Cup veteran Paul Caligiuri, who scored the 1989 goal that ended a 40-year absence for the United States from soccers biggest event and started a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.But Martinos profile could make him the biggest threat to Gulati, who has held the position since 2006.Gulati coasted to victory unopposed in the last three elections, but the entry into the race last week of his longtime aide, the U.S. Soccer executive vice president Carlos Cordeiro, led many to wonder whether that was a signal that Gulati, 58, would opt not to run.Gulati, who holds a seat on the governing council of FIFA, world soccers governing body, and serves as chairman of the United States joint bid for the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, has been cagey about whether he will enter the race.But his connections, built over three decades in the federation, would make him a formidable opponent should he decide to run.The election for president of U.S. Soccer is not so much a popularity contest as it is a coalition-building proposition.U.S. Soccers president is elected in a vote of representatives of its various councils: 25 percent shares for the youth, adult and pro councils; 20 percent to an athletes council; and the rest to a small group that includes board members, life members and even a fan representative.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even as he began his campaign to supplant him, Martino stressed that he wants to work in lock step with Gulati in the future, despite the fact that he was one of the loudest voices calling for Gulatis resignation after a 2-1 defeat at Trinidad and Tobago on Oct. 10 eliminated the Americans from next summers World Cup in Russia.Photo Whoever is president has to genuinely want to work with Sunil, because thats the only way we can bring U.S. Soccer forward, Martino said.Sunil has gotten us a seat at the head table.But whether Sunil runs again or not, my motivation will always be to protect U.S. Soccer from a president not capable of fixing our soccer problems.Who we need right now is secondary to what we need, which is a soccer vision.Carlos entering the race raises the quality of the candidates.But hes admitted hes not a soccer guy, and hes saying hes going to hire the soccer guy.Im saying the complete opposite.I am the soccer guy.And hiring the business guy is a lot easier when that part of the company is working so well.The first thing people are going to say when they see that Ive come forward is, What does he know about running a $100 million company?But the business side of U.S. soccer is thriving.We dont need an M.B.A. right now.We need a soccer Ph.D. And thats what I have.Martino said he would run on a three-pronged blueprint that he is calling The Progress Plan, which he spells out on his campaign website, everyonesgameusa.com, which went live Monday morning.Martino said he intends to keep building upon the plan, in part through his listening tour but also via a national soccer summit he is hoping to convene soon in New York.The three pillars of Martinos plan are: Transparency.Chief among his goals are commissioning an outside audit to study the ethics of how U.S. Soccer is being run and to make the position of federation president a full-time, paid post.Martino said one of his initial motivations in publicly declaring that he would not run recently was to highlight the fact that the position is currently unpaid, because that creates a barrier for entry to qualified candidates.Equality.A prime area of concern for Martino, he said, is youth players who are being priced out of the game by the financial barriers they encounter, but also players at all levels who feel unsafe in locker rooms and what he calls the mistreatment of our female athletes.Our women are World Cup winners, Martino said.Why are they playing on artificial surfaces?Why are they sleeping in beds with bed bugs?Why arent they paid the same as the men?And if you look at the U.S. soccer structure, why dont women have positions of influence?There are no good answers to these questions.Photo Progress.Martino wants to enact new standards to measure it and to create centers throughout the country to foster it by teaching a curriculum aggregated from some of the business soccer academies around the world for free to the top youth players in the sport after casting a wider net find more prospects that the current system is missing.He also wants to assemble an advisory board of former players, top coaches and representatives from a variety of levels to make recommendations to the president on major decisions, such as hiring the head coach or technical director for the mens national team.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Martino said he had the backing of several well-known men and women in American soccer but was not yet prepared to reveal names because he wants to make sure these people are not marginalized or punished for aligning themselves with a candidate.But to illustrate the sort of reach he has with influencers in the game, Martino, a former rookie of the year in Major League Soccer, provided The New York Times with letters of recommendation he has received from David Beckham and Thierry Henry, arguably the two most famous imports in M.L.S.history.I have support from high-profile U.S. players, but Ive asked them not to back me publicly to protect them from the potential political retribution Thierry and David are immune to, Martino said.Other candidates who have publicly declared their intention to run include the Boston lawyer Steve Gans, who was the first to challenge Gulati; the soccer administrator Paul Lapointe; and the New York lawyer Michael Winograd.Martino, whose unpaid hiatus began Monday, said NBC would invite him to return to his broadcasting role in the event he does not win the February election.He said he would start a fund-raising drive to finance his campaign, and that he will promptly sell his minority share in the Spanish third division club Real Mallorca to its majority owner Robert Sarver, who also owns the Phoenix Suns.I just got to the point where I felt I had to serve I had to take the leap, Martino said.I had a conversation with my wife in our kitchen, which went into the wee hours of the morning, and I told her I wont be able to forgive myself if I dont stand up for U.S. Soccer right now.I didnt dream of doing this job, but I know I have to do it.And if Feb. 10 comes and goes and Im not the president of U.S. Soccer, I can promise that whoever is, I will make sure that, if they beat me, they have soccers best interests at heart.And that they know the soccer community can mobilize and were watching them.
From the N.B.A., a Cautionary Tale on National Anthem Protests:::::So why havent N.B.A.players at least thus far in this young season joined those among the N.F.L.s rank and file who have lined up behind the now-unemployed Kaepernick in taking a knee as a means of protest?It is not because they fear the wrath of President Trump, or even the punitive arm of the N.B.A.s league office, according to Michele Roberts, the players unions executive director.They havent protested collectively, she said, because they can better do so individually.They dont need to take a knee when they can communicate their messages on their own, Roberts said in a telephone interview.LeBron James, all he has to do is tweet and everybody knows exactly how he feels.Or have Equality embroidered on the back of his sneakers, as James did before the Cleveland Cavaliers season opener several weeks ago.It is no secret that football, with its often anonymous foot soldiers in the trenches (many without fully guaranteed contracts), is a sport more designed for group expression.The N.B.A., said the former commissioner David Stern, has long been a laboratory focused on the behavior of individuals.Asked why the league felt the need to impose a stand-for-the-anthem rule, in effect at least since the early 1980s, Stern said, It was our minimal standard when you come out on the court, please stand at attention because the N.B.A.has always been something of a social cause, these great black athletes trying to work their way in what back in the day could be a hostile white environment.He mentioned outsize players and personalities like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with far greater visibility and impact in their comparatively intimate workplace.Photo In the N.B.A., superficial issues like hairstyles and tattoos have for decades been part of the discussion, and judgment.Kaepernick basically hid his Afro under a helmet, but as far back as the 1970s, Julius Ervings could excite or aggravate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By March 1996, when Abdul-Rauf was suspended, Jordan was arguably the worlds most admired athlete and the N.B.A.was enjoying exponential domestic and global growth.Still, as Williams said, Race was the elephant in the room, and though I think David tried his best to deal with it, it was something that terrified the N.B.A.Although Stern said he didnt believe Abdul-Rauf had been shunned by the league for his stance, and pointed out that he did return briefly with the Vancouver Grizzlies in 2000, Abdul-Rauf apparently believes otherwise.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Playing in the inaugural season of the Big3 league this year, his hair and beard speckled with gray, Abdul-Rauf, 48, continued to bow his head, close his eyes and pray during the playing of the anthem, which he maintains symbolizes oppression.In 2016, he told ESPN that he was at peace for keeping with his principles, despite career sacrifices.It would be nave to think that the elephant of race has left the room, but 21st-century N.B.A.players are riding and even steering it, Roberts said, and without much direction from her.When James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul used measured tones at the 2016 ESPY Awards to decry violence against African-Americans as well as against the police, Roberts said she was among the last people to hear it was going to happen.I havent had a single player ask me, What should we do?she said.And Im not intimidated or fearful of how they will be judged because I know whatever they do, they will do respectfully and with compassion.Too sweeping a generalization, perhaps.In such a volatile or hostile environment, restraint or respect is not always possible.Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors tangled on Twitter with the president over the prospect of his teams visit to the White House, and James weighed in on the exchange rather inelegantly.Tough rhetoric has been heard from coaches, too, such as Steve Kerr of the Warriors and especially Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs.But the residual effect, from the players perspective, could be that they recognize they are no longer inhabiting the island that Williams said Abdul-Rauf was on 21 years ago.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, N.B.A.players share vivid memories of how swiftly and strongly Adam Silver, the current commissioner, dealt with the ramblings of Donald Sterling, the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, in 2014.This September, Silver and Roberts signed a letter in support of the players social activism.Adam was on the money with Sterling, and hes been on the money today, Roberts said.But I dont think the players are behaving this way because the league supports them.Theyre acting based on how they feel, though they do appreciate the way the league supports them.And if somebody kneels this season during the anthem?Silver has said he expects players to stand but declined to offer what he might do if they do not.Roberts was also mum, though not completely.Im not going

Bob Bowman, Major League Baseballs Digital Mastermind, Steps Down:::::Photo The former baseball commissioner Bud Selig once called Major League Baseball Advanced Media, the leagues digital and video arm, one of the great success stories of not only the baseball business, but American business.The person most responsible for that success is Bob Bowman, its chief executive for 17 years.Major League Baseball announced on Monday that Bowman, 62, was stepping down as president of business and media when his contract expires at the end of the year.Bobs vision made our game even more accessible and enjoyable to millions of fans, Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.In 2000, the 30 owners of Major League Baseball teams voted unanimously to contribute a combined $120 million $1 million per team for the first four years for equal ownership in Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam as its known.
For Clues in Yankees Manager Search, Look to the Dodgers:::::Still, the next Yankees manager seems unlikely to resemble Francona and Maddon, with their extensive track records; a likelier model would be one of the 2017 World Series managers: Roberts and the Houston Astros A.J.Hinch.Hinch, 43, who has a psychology degree from Stanford, used humor and humility to build bonds with his players, quickly overcoming skepticism based on a failed, brief first attempt at managing the Arizona Diamondbacks, a job he landed at age 34.As well as Hinch has done in three years with the Astros, the Dodgers hiring of Roberts might be the most instructive in looking at the Yankees, who like their long-ago crosstown rivals are trying to build a perpetual contender around a strong farm system, an adherence to analytics and one of baseballs biggest payrolls.Cashman said the Yankees would be methodical in their search they have not yet finalized a list of candidates, even as five other openings have been filled.So were the Dodgers.They dismissed Don Mattingly as manager after they lost to the Mets in a 2015 division series, but it took a month and interviews with nine candidates to fill the job.Photo The Dodgers interviewed internal candidates, former managers, novices, popular organizational figures (Kirk Gibson) and even a college coach (Darin Erstad) before selecting Roberts, then the San Diego Padres bench coach.He won the job over Bud Black, now the Colorado Rockies manager, and Gabe Kapler, who was recently named the Philadelphia Phillies manager.Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, said he was looking foremost for an excellent communicator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Relentless optimism was something that was important going through the grind of a 162-game season, especially in a larger market, Friedman said last week.It can be a little bit of a grind, so having someone with infectious energy was something that we were looking for from the leader of our 25-man roster.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Like so much about baseball in recent years, the idea of a players manager has evolved, too, thanks to data.With statistical analysis and sports science playing a more prominent role in how lineups are constructed and the bench is deployed each day, the modern manager must be able to communicate these new strategies particularly with younger players who may wonder why they are not playing.Relationships are the foundation for those dialogues.Just so they can think along with you, Friedman said.And therefore, they are less caught off guard by certain moves you might make, which therefore reduces some tension that might come with in-game decisions or starting lineup decisions that in large part dont manifest themselves the same way when theres that open, honest communication throughout.Communication is not strictly top down.Decisions that were once the domain of a manager are now collaborative, involving the front office, pro scouts, player development and sports science staff members, among others.Thats why for a lot of us, getting asked questions like, who makes out the lineup?or who decides on the roster?are strange questions, said Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager and Friedmans lieutenant.We view it as such a collaboration that its not about pointing the finger at one person who goes into an office and locks the door and makes the decision by himself.The process is a lot more organic than that, and I think thats the way the game is headed.When Roberts interviewed, he did not know Friedman or Zaidi though he had worked for another Dodgers executive, Josh Byrnes, in San Diego and he had not been a manager before.Friedman said those were formidable hurdles, but when they finished the initial interview, Zaidi remarked that it was as if Roberts had the answer key.In the few areas in which Roberts was not in lock step with Friedman and Zaidi, they took the ensuing back-and-forth as a healthy sign.Obviously the relationship is way stronger today than it was a year ago, and Ill bet its stronger a year from now than it is right now, Friedman said.Thats the nature of human relationships.As long as theres trust in place, which I think we all have, we feel like, as we look ahead, the continuity that we envision is something that we feel will be a competitive advantage for us in the coming years.And something that the Yankees would like to replicate.
Womens Hockey Rivals Prepare for the Olympics by Playing Each Other  Again and Again:::::BOSTON Three days after the United States womens hockey team lost to Canada, 5-1, in an exhibition game here on Oct. 25, USA Hockey unexpectedly added Cayla Barnes, an 18-year-old freshman at Boston College, to its roster.The move may just be insurance for the coming Four Nations Cup, which begins Tuesday outside Tampa, Fla., and is the last major womens hockey tournament before the 2018 Winter Olympics.Or inserting Barnes, a prodigious defender who has won three consecutive under-18 world championships, into the lineup could be a shrewd psychological and tactical ploy.After all, Barnes is one of the few players on the American team who is somewhat unknown to Canada.Her addition is one example of the chess-like maneuvering within the most intense rivalry in womens hockey.By mid-December, the two teams will have played up to eight games against each other including one on Wednesday in the span of two months, plotting their final moves of a four-year buildup to an expected meeting in the gold medal game in Gangneung, South Korea, on Feb. 22.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I use the analogy of going into it like a test, forward Sarah Nurse of Canada said.The better prepared you are when it comes down to that time in February when we play these guys again, we want to know what theyre going to throw at us.We dont want any surprises.We want to be 100 percent prepared.

After Beating Packers, Lions Set Their Sights on the Vikings:::::With every short pass from Brett Hundley, every drive that ended in a field goal or a punt and every lingering shot of Aaron Rodgers standing on the sideline, it seemed like the Green Bay Packers were falling farther from anything resembling contention.The N.F.C.North is far from having been decided, but after Green Bays 30-17 loss at home to the Detroit Lions on Monday night, the Lions certainly seem to have the better chance of challenging the Minnesota Vikings for division supremacy.And if the Packers continue to tumble and slip out of playoff contention, they might not even feel the need to bring Rodgers back once he is eligible to return in Week 15 from the injured reserve, where he landed after breaking his collarbone on Oct. 15.For now, the North is Minnesotas division to lose.At 6-2 and riding a four-game winning streak, the Vikings are two games ahead of both Detroit and Green Bay.The Upshots Playoff Simulator gives the Vikings a 65 percent chance of winning the division.But last season showed that a hot start by the Vikings does not guarantee much, as their 5-0 start to the season was undercut by a 3-8 finish, leaving the Packers and Lions to fight for the division crown on the final day of the regular season (the Packers won out).When breaking down the three contenders, the biggest argument for the Lions is their quarterback stability.Matthew Stafford, who has not missed a game since 2010, is a true franchise quarterback (with a salary commensurate of such a distinction) who has a knack for late-game heroics.On Monday he did not need another of his signature comebacks, as he completed 26 of 33 passes for 361 yards and two touchdowns in his teams blowout win.The win was just Detroits second victory in Green Bay since the start of the 1992 season (a span of 27 games).Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Packers are in dire straits with Hundley, who was rarely asked to throw the ball more than five yards on Monday night, but they at least have the benefit of having a long-term plan at quarterback (hint: Its Rodgers).The same cannot be said of the Vikings, who have a complicated quarterback controversy on their hands.Photo Case Keenum has performed well in Sam Bradfords absence, but he will soon be challenged for the starting role not just by Bradford, who is working his way back from a knee injury, but also by Teddy Bridgewater, the Vikings former starter who has missed the last 24 regular season games after a devastating knee injury in the 2016 preseason.
How the Rams Went From Laughingstock to Contenders:::::Although questions remain about how much fans in Los Angeles will embrace the Rams they are ranked 27th in attendance this season its clear the team has found a way to recreate itself on the field.One of the keys was changing coaches.After firing Jeff Fisher, who arrived with the team from St. Louis, the Rams ripped up the playbook and hired McVay, who was then Washingtons offensive coordinator.At 31, he is the youngest head coach in N.F.L.history.Another key has been quarterback Jared Goff.Last year, the Rams made a splash by trading six draft picks to acquire the first choice, which they used to select Goff.New to the league, he struggled and lost all seven games that he started.In the off-season, the Rams added players to help Goff.They signed center John Sullivan and left tackle Andrew Whitworth to bolster the offensive line, and acquired receivers Sammy Watkins and Robert Woods.The Rams made the most of their limited draft picks by taking tight end Gerald Everett from South Alabama in the second round and wide receiver Cooper Kupp from Eastern Washington in the third round.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.(On Sunday, Woods had two touchdown catches.For the season, Everett has eight receptions and one touchdown, while Kupp has 26 receptions and three scores.)A stronger offensive line and extra receivers have helped Goff.He has been sacked 10 times this season; in seven games last season, he was sacked 26 times.With more time to throw, Goff has more touchdown passes and fewer interceptions this season.He has thrown for 13 touchdowns (including four on Sunday) and four interceptions, compared with five scores and seven interceptions last season.His adjusted yards per attempt (which accounts for the impact of interceptions) rose to 7.7 from 4.3 last season.Goff and the Rams have also benefited from Todd Gurley, a first-round pick in 2015 who has rebounded after a lackluster 2016.He has seven rushing touchdowns in eight starts after having six in 16 starts last season.He is averaging 4.3 yards a carry after averaging 3.2 (and the proverbial cloud of dust) in 2016.He has also caught three touchdown passes this season.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For all their success, the Rams have a lot of work to do to secure a playoff spot.They face the Texans at home next week, and must face Philadelphia, New Orleans, Tennessee and Minnesota all division leaders.They must also play their division rivals Seattle and Arizona on the road.Still, considering where they were last season, the Rams seem comfortable with their newfound fortune.We have to keep doing what were doing and not take our foot off the gas pedal, Goff said after Sundays game.
As Rams Prove Their Mettle, Giants Show They Have None:::::McVay said the Rams last two games have been almost perfect in all three phases, and they have remained unbeaten in four road games.That would be five if a home win in London is included.The Rams high-powered offense showed no rust as the team came off the bye, scoring on eight of its first nine possessions while reeling off six plays of 35 yards or more.The defense forced three turnovers that the offense turned into 17 points, and the special teams blocked a third-quarter punt that paved the way for Gurleys second touchdown.Its exciting, said Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who intercepted a pass by Giants quarterback Eli Manning late in the first half.A lot of guys in this locker room havent been in this situation, 6-2.Its big, and every game is going to be more important, so we are doing everything one game at a time, one day at a time.Greg Zuerlein added three field goals against the Giants (1-7), who allowed the biggest offensive performance against them in a home game since Cleveland beat them, 52-21, in the regular-season finale in 1964.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Giants had not given up more than 27 points in any of their first seven games.You lay an egg like that obviously we didnt play well, Giants halfback Orleans Darkwa said.Weve got to go back to work.We started fast.We made some plays.We put on a good drive.But we wound up turning the ball over, and you cant do that.The loss also put Coach Ben McAdoos future in question just one year after he led the team to the playoffs.He suspended cornerback Janoris Jenkins on Tuesday for missing a workout Monday, and the depleted secondary was punished by Goff, who was 14 of 22 with no interceptions.Im disappointed, said McAdoo, who insisted his team had not quit.Expected us to come out and play a better football game than we played.We have it in us.Its my job to get it out of us.Goffs touchdowns were of 8 yards to tight end Tyler Higbee, 52 to Robert Woods, 67 to Sammy Watkins and 4 to Woods.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Eli Manning (20 of 36 for 220 yards) threw two touchdown passes and became the seventh N.F.L.quarterback to reach the 50,000-yard mark with his completion of a garbage-time pass to Sterling Shepard in the fourth quarter.His touchdowns covered 5 yards to Tavarres King and 10 yards to Evan Engram.Goffs touchdown pass to Higbee came after Aaron Donald sacked Manning and forced a fumble that Connor Barwin recovered.The play that killed the Giants was the 52-yarder to Woods on a third-and-33 screen play on which Woods was barely touched.It turned a 10-7 lead into a 10-point advantage, and the Gians never looked the same in seeing their seven-game winning streak against the Rams end.
What We Learned in N.F.L. Week 9: Whats Half a Hundred Times Two?:::::Sometimes a call just truly gets blown.At the end of a skirmish in which A. J.Green of the Cincinnati Bengals repeatedly shoved and punched Jalen Ramsey of the Jacksonville Jaguars, both players were ejected.Replays showed that Ramsey had not punched back at Green, and the N.F.L.is in a difficult situation in which a player seems to be owed an apology even though his team held on to win.Heres a look at what happened in N.F.L.Week 9: Photo With Elliott and Prescott in action, Cowboys roll.The Dallas Cowboys showed just how good the team can be with Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott at full-strength, as the duo led the team to a hard-fought 28-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.Now they have to wait and see if their partnership will be broken up for the next several weeks.Elliott was on the field thanks to an appeals court briefly delaying his six-game suspension with an administrative stay, but it is expected that his fate for the next six games will be decided this week.The second-year running back took advantage of the unexpected start by rushing for 93 yards and a touchdown, helping complement a fine performance by Prescott, who threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns while running for another score, in the come-from-behind win.Prescotts success came thanks to a pair of passing touchdowns to Cole Beasley, and a 141-yard day by Terrance Williams, as the team survived Dez Bryant leaving the game in the second half with an ankle injury.It looked for much of the first half like it would be a boring matchup between teams trying too hard to be careful, but things picked up dramatically in the last two minutes before halftime.Both teams scored in the final 13 seconds of the half, with Tyreek Hill of the Chiefs scoring an unbelievable 57-yard catch-and-run touchdown as time expired.Hill had at least five defenders between him and the end zone when he caught the ball, but he used his patience and game-changing speed to weave through the crowd, nearly untouched, for the score.Kansas City then opened the second half with another touchdown drive, which briefly gave them a 17-14 lead.From that point on, though, the game was all Dallas, as both the offense and defense found a higher gear.Their much-maligned secondary even managed to end Alex Smiths season-long streak of passes without an interception when Jeff Heath stepped in front of a pass intended for Charcandrick West in the fourth quarter.Going forward, things could be truly complicated for Dallas.Elliott could be out for up to six weeks, the severity of Bryants injury is not known, and the Cowboys may be facing an extended stretch in which Prescott will be trying to keep the teams playoff hopes alive with his primary offensive support coming from players like Darren McFadden, Alfred Morris and Beasley.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With or without Elliott, Dallas will travel to Atlanta to face the struggling Falcons next week and then will host the red-hot Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11.Redskins shock Seahawks with late drive.Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson appeared to have secured his second consecutive comeback win with a dramatic touchdown pass in the games final minutes.Not to be outdone, Kirk Cousins put together one of the most impressive drives of his career, going 70 yards on just four plays to secure a 17-14 victory.Cousins did not throw a touchdown pass in the game, but his bold passes into Seattles secondary in the games final minutes were key to the shocking victory.The second long pass, a 38-yarder to Josh Doctson, set up Rob Kelley for a game-winning 1-yard touchdown run.Kelleys two touchdowns accounted for most of the scoring for Washington, and the team survived the late surge by Wilson, who threw for 297 yards and rushed for 77.Photo The Falcons Super Bowl hangover isnt going away.The Atlanta Falcons continue to struggle to hold onto leads.In what has become a dramatic Super Bowl hangover, the Falcons record dropped to 4-4 after a 20-17 loss to the Carolina Panthers in which they had a 10-0 lead until late in the second quarter.The Panthers worked their way back into the game with the teams running game, and eventually rushed for a combined 201 yards on 38 carries, with Cam Newton leading the team with 86 yards, while he and Christian McCaffrey each scored on a rushing touchdown.Atlanta continued to fight even after falling behind 20-10.They got the ball back one last time with just over two minutes remaining and a deficit of three points, but the offense mustered minus-three yards while turning the ball over on downs when Matt Ryans fourth down pass failed to connect with Taylor Gabriel.But the day was symbolized by a play earlier in the fourth quarter where Ryan threw what appeared to be a perfect 39-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones that the sure-handed receiver simply dropped, resulting in a turnover on downs.It was the type of mistake Atlanta never made during the teams run to the Super Bowl last season.- Advertisement Continue reading

makes life miserable for opponents each and every week.The addition of Jay Ajayi to the running game made them seem like something out of a video game in a 51-23 demolishing of the Denver Broncos.There were no weaknesses on display for the Eagles.Carson Wentz, who came into the game tied for the N.F.L.lead with 19 touchdown passes, threw four more, while completing 15 of 27 passes for 199 yards before being taken out in the fourth quarter with the score well out of hand.Wentz now has sole possession of the passing touchdown lead with 23, but he was focused on other things.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Touchdowns are great, but being 8-1 is what its all about, he told reporters after the game.Wentz had plenty of help, as the teams running game, powered by LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and the newly-acquired Ajayi combined to carry the ball 37 times for 197 yards and three touchdowns.Coming into the game, Philadelphia had just four rushing touchdowns all season.That the Eagles had so much success running the ball against the second-rated rushing defense in the N.F.L.was a testament to Ajayi.The pro bowl running back was traded from the Dolphins this week and went from an underperforming malcontent in Miami to energizing Philadelphia with a 46-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter.He finished with a team-leading 77 yards.The Broncos, meanwhile, tried to shake things up by switching from Trevor Siemian to Brock Osweiler at quarterback, but any improvement was hard to see in a game in which Osweiler completed just 19 of 38 passes for 208 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.He was repeatedly harassed by Philadelphias front-seven and made several mistakes, including the two turnovers, both of which led to Eagles touchdowns.The highlights were few and far between for Denver, but they included Osweiler hitting Demaryius Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown pass, Brandon McManus connecting on two field goals from 50-plus yards, and Brandon Marshall, Denvers standout linebacker, getting his first career fumble recovery for a touchdown after a

to instigate a scuffle along the sideline.Brees touchdowns went for 33 yards to Alvin Kamara and 36 yards to Ted Ginn.Kamara, who also scored on a 6-yard run, did most of the work on his TD reception, thrilling the Superdome crowd with a waving, tackle-slipping run after his short catch.The Saints also scored on Justin Hardees blocked punt, which Hardee recovered in stride and returned for a

Nick Buoniconti Will Donate Brain to Concussion Research:::::Several years ago, the league provided several million dollars to researchers at Boston University, but has since donated tens of millions of dollars to other institutions doing related research.Buoniconti arrived at the news conference in a wheelchair, wearing his Super Bowl VII ring.I owe it to the thousands of others who will follow me on this trek, Buoniconti said in the interview.My life is not what it was, and I just want to be able to help with Anns research and hopefully the research will end up helping so many other players.The disease, which can only be diagnosed posthumously, has been found in more than 100 former N.F.L.players as well as dozens of others who played football in high school and college.Symptoms of the disease include irritability, memory loss and depression.Buoniconti grew up in Massachusetts and played college football at Notre Dame and then 14 years in the N.F.L., where he led the famed No Name Defense that helped the Dolphins win two Super Bowl titles, including in the 1972 season, when they became the only team to go undefeated.He left the league after the 1976 season and worked as an agent for professional athletes; became president of U.S. Tobacco; and was a host of the HBO program Inside the N.F.L.But in recent years, Buoniconti has become more forgetful, has had trouble speaking and has had more difficulty completing basic tasks, he said in an interview with Sports Illustrated in May.Buoniconti said that he was also falling more frequently, and had to call 911 five times in the past two years.These problems, coupled with a growing body of research that connects concussions and head hits to C.T.E., led Buoniconti to donate his brain.In July, doctors at Boston University said that 110 of the 111 brains of former N.F.L.players that they examined showed signs of C.T.E.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The list includes the Hall of Fame quarterback Ken Stabler of the Oakland Raiders and the former Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson.Since that study was published, the former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, who committed suicide in prison, has also been found to have had C.T.E.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to Buoniconti, other former N.F.L.players including Warren Sapp, Matt Hasselbeck and Leonard Marshall have pledged to donate their brains to the C.T.E.Center.The doctors acknowledge that the research on the 111 brains has limitations because, rather than a random sample, most of the families who donated the brains of players did so because those players had symptoms of cognitive problems.But they assert the findings are still significant and point to other research that has suggested risks in playing tackle football before the age of 12.Buoniconti began playing at a young age as well, as did his son, Marc.When Marc suffered a spinal cord injury in 1985 while playing college football at The Citadel that left him a quadriplegic, Nick founded the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis.The Project has since been expanded to research head trauma as well.In an interview last month with The Associated Press, Marc said that his fathers recent decline has convinced him that youth football should be banned.Marc said that Nicks opinion has changed 180 degrees.Buoniconti and his wife, Lynn, spoke often about what to do to alert other former players and their families, and to help researchers.We kind of both felt that we wanted to come here to get more clarity on what Nick has, she said.He agreed, adding that too often, players try to hide their problems rather than talking about them.He hopes that will change now that he has spoken out about his own condition.Its not hard for me to go public like this because so many others depend on getting out there and not to be ashamed, he said, speaking slowly.I never, never, never dreamed it would happen to me.We just hope this will pave the way for thousands of others who are out there and in denial and can come out now.
Ezekiel Elliott Can Play Sunday After Court Ruling:::::Photo Hes playing.Hes not playing.Hes playing.Hes not playing.Well, now Ezekiel Elliott whose suspension by the N.F.L.has run into a dizzying series of court rulings is playing again.For now.A federal appeals court in New York on Friday morning temporarily blocked an earlier ruling and said Elliott, a running back for the Cowboys, could play, at least this Sunday against the Chiefs.The ruling does not resolve the case, but merely allows Elliott to play while it proceeds.Elliott was suspended by the league for six games before the season after the N.F.L.investigated domestic-assault allegations.He was the leading rusher in the N.F.L.as a rookie last season and ranks third this year.He is a crucial offensive weapon for the Cowboys, who are 4-3 and in the hunt for a wild-card berth.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here are all the twists and turns of the case: August: The N.F.L.suspends Elliott six games after his ex-girlfriend Tiffany Thompson accused him of assaulting her five times in Columbus, Ohio, where he played at Ohio State.(He was not arrested, after prosecutors decided her statements conflicted with those of some witnesses.)

Picks: Cowboys Over Chiefs; Redskins Over Seahawks:::::Being over .500 is good, and having Elliott around for at least one more week is better, but there is still cause for concern in Dallas.The Cowboys have just a 39 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to The Upshots Playoff Simulator.Catching the red-hot Eagles for a division title in the N.F.C.East seems unlikely, and if Dallas wants to beat out a crowded field of potential wild-card teams, it has little margin for error.Until Elliott actually misses a game, the Cowboys main concerns are on defense.But the Chiefs (6-2) having cooled off considerably in recent weeks.Their offense has been relying on a kicker for a large portion of its scoring, and that makes the Chiefs unlikely to keep up with Prescott, regardless of who is at running back, and especially so with Elliott suiting up.Pick: Cowboys Broncos at Eagles, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Eagles by 8.5 The reality of life in the N.F.L.is that all streaks end.The Eagles (7-1) have won six consecutive games and scored 20 or more points in 12 straight.They have started to be referred to as the N.F.C.s best team, and they have a fearsome defense and a talented young quarterback to back up that talk.While they may keep up their winning and scoring streaks for another week, a desperate opponent cannot be overlooked.The Broncos (3-4) certainly qualify as a team that can play better than it has in recent weeks, which might make the matchup competitive.Pick: Broncos Falcons at Panthers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Panthers by 1 If the Panthers (5-3) had no plans to re-sign him in the off-season, then trading Kelvin Benjamin was probably a good move.But it leaves the team awfully thin at wide receiver.Passes underneath to Christian McCaffrey, the teams rookie running back, are supposed to be a safety valve when bigger plays fail to develop; they are not supposed to be the offensive strategy.If the Falcons (4-3) got out of their rut with a win over the Jets last week, then Carolina could be in trouble at home.Pick: Falcons Redskins at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Seahawks by 7.5 It is hard to say if Deshaun Watson and the Texans gave the N.F.L.a blueprint for attacking the secondary of the Seahawks (5-2), or if Watson is just that good, but the rookie threw aggressively against them and would have won if not for a herculean effort by Russell Wilson and the Seattle offense.Kirk Cousins may not be as gifted as Watson, but he does not lack for confidence, and it would not be surprising for the Redskins (3-4) to go into attack mode to see if the Legion of Boom has truly developed some cracks.Pick: Redskins Second-Tier Games Photo Colts at Texans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Texans by 7 (Preview updated to reflect injury news) It was a huge loss for the Texans (3-4) in Week 5 when J. J. Watt was declared out for the season, but that was nothing compared with the blow the team took on Thursday when Deshaun Watson, Houstons star rookie quarterback, tore his anterior cruciate ligament during practice and was lost for the season.Watson had been sensational in recent weeks, transforming a team that had relied entirely on its defense into the highest scoring offense in the N.F.L.To reach the heights Watson reached, and to now tumble back to the reality of Tom Savage being the Texans starting quarterback, is a blow to morale that is almost unfathomable.Houston, which was favored by 13 points before the injury, is still favored by 7, which is a fairly stunning indictment of the Colts (2-6).But oddsmakers are drastically shortchanging how much of the Texans turnaround was owed directly to Watsons talent.Pick: Colts Rams at Giants, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Rams by 3.5 The Rams (5-2) emphasized this week that the team should not be complacent against the injury-riddled Giants (1-6).Both teams are coming off bye weeks, though the Rams are doing so with the optimism of consecutive wins in which they scored a combined 60 points.The Giants limped through the break and then suspended their top cornerback, Janoris Jenkins, for this game for a violation of team rules.Keeping pace with the Seahawks at the top of the N.F.C.West should provide Los Angeles with the motivation they need to stay focused.Pick: Rams Bengals at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 4.5 The Jaguars (4-3) have yet to win consecutive games this season, but their defense may have fixed its weak link.The unit has been sensational at every aspect of the game besides run defense, and the team has tried to fix that by trading for Marcell Dareus, a run-stuffing defensive tackle who is familiar with Coach Doug Marrones way of handling things.If Dareus can lift the front sevens efforts against the run from awful to mediocre, the Jaguars, who rush the passer and defend the pass incredibly well, could finally find some consistency.That is terrible news for the Bengals (3-4).Pick: Jaguars Advertisement Continue reading the main story Buccaneers at Saints, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 7 The Saints (5-2) are riding a five-game winning streak, and always play better at home, but the Buccaneers (2-5) are a tougher team than their record indicates.The Saints are right to be optimistic about their playoff chances (The Upshot gives them a 79 percent chance of making the playoffs and a 59 percent chance of winning their division), but a lot of breaks have gone their way to keep their winning streak alive, and sloppy play is bound to come back to haunt them eventually.Asking them to win is reasonable, but demanding they win by 7 may be unrealistic.Pick: Buccaneers Bottom-Tier Games Photo Bills at Jets, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NFL Network and CBS in New York Line: Bills by 3 Buffalo fans love to point out that they root for the only N.F.L.team in New York, but even if you include the Jets and the Giants, they clearly have New Yorks most talented team.Against the Jets (3-5), the Bills (5-2) will stick to the script of running the ball, passing enough to keep the defense honest and playing hard-nosed defense.It is a formula that just might end their long playoff drought.Pick: Bills Ravens at Titans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Titans by 4 The Ravens (4-4) did not take kindly to their quarterback, Joe Flacco, being brutalized on an illegal hit last week, and they responded with the entire team emulating Jefferson from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, piling on in a 40-0 blowout against Miami.Going on the road against the Titans (4-3), who got healthy during a well-timed bye week, is a much tougher task than slowing down the Dolphins.Pick: Titans Newsletter Sign Up Continue

they are not without hope, as the teams general manager, John Lynch, has shown a knack for savvy moves.His latest was to get Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots for a second-round pick.Garoppolo, a 26-year-old career backup, may not make anyone forget Joe Montana or Steve Young, but under Coach Kyle Shanahan he could turn into a franchise quarterback.Unfortunately, C.J.Beathard is expected to start this week against the Cardinals (3-4).Pick: Cardinals Raiders at Dolphins, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Raiders by 3 Im tired of this offense being awful, Miamis Coach Adam Gase told reporters this week.Were the worst offense in football.Its hard to get lower than that.It is not clear how the Dolphins (4-3) got better by trading away Jay Ajayi, a 24-year-old running back who has 1,662 rushing yards in 19 career starts, and thats one of the many reasons Miami is an underdog at home against the struggling Raiders (3-5).It would be hard to make a case for a less appealing Sunday night game.Pick: Raiders Mondays Matchup Lions at Packers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Lions by 2.5 The Lions (3-4) have lost three consecutive games, but they will feel a lot better about their season if they get a road win against a division rival.The Packers (4-3) are coming off a bye week in which they tried to fix an offense that has been horrendous since Aaron Rodgers was injured, but this is a particularly difficult matchup: Green Bays offense has been reduced to a running game powered by Aaron Jones and Brett Hundley, and the Lions do their best work stopping the run.Pick: Lions.
Fantasy Football: Who to Start in N.F.L. Week 9:::::Here are players to strongly consider starting in Week 9.Quarterback Drew Brees (NO vs.Buccaneers) Week 8 was the first game that Brees failed to throw for at least one touchdown this season, and his 17.1 fantasy points per game average is not top-5 QB material (its good for 10th best).But a matchup with the Buccaneers should bring out a nice, vintage Brees performance for his patient fantasy owners.Tampa Bay allows the seventh most F.P.P.G.(18.9) to the quarterback position, with four of the seven opposing quarterbacks topping 22 fantasy points.Dak Prescott (DAL vs. Chiefs) Before Week 8, Prescott had been cruising in terms of fantasy production, averaging 26.3 F.P.P.G.over the previous four weeks, and never falling below 15 points on the season.But the Redskins held him to 143 passing yards and no touchdowns, by far his poorest performance of 2017.He should bounce back in a big way against the once-stingy Chiefs defense, which is the fifth worst passing defense in the N.F.L.Three different quarterbacks have absolutely shredded the Chiefs secondary this season, including Deshaun Watsons 35.5 fantasy points in Week 5 and Derek Carrs 30.2 points in Week 7.Also Consider: Jacoby Brissett (IND at Texans) Running Back Lamar Miller (HOU vs. Colts) Overshadowed by the meteoric rise of Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, Miller quietly has the 11th most fantasy points among backs in seven games played.The truth is, Watsons play has increased the fantasy value of all of Houstons offensive players.Millers recent usage seems to indicate that hes reestablished himself as the teams clear top back ahead of DOnta Foreman, and he has one of the easiest schedules for a fantasy running back the rest of the season.The Colts have allowed a league-high 8 rushing touchdowns (10 total to the position) and the third most F.P.P.G.to the opposing backs (22.5).Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Adrian Peterson (ARI at 49ers) After a stunning debut with the Cardinals in Week 6, Peterson looked like the Big Easy edition in Week 7.Fresh off a bye week, look for him to get back on track against the 49ers, who defend the run as if they only have five players on the entire defense.Nine different backs have scored at least 10 fantasy points against them in eight games, and on the season San Francisco has yielded the most fantasy points total to the position.Also Consider: Orleans Darkwa (NYG vs. Rams) Wide Receiver Dez Bryant (DAL vs. Chiefs) It hasnt been a stellar fantasy season for Bryant thus far, but its been far from a disaster.His four receiving touchdowns are tied for ninth best among receivers and hes still being heavily targeted by Prescott with 64 targets (11th, N.F.L.).Hes been dealing with a knee injury but is on track to be practicing in full by the end of the week.This could be the week he finally breaks through with a big performance against the Chiefs, who have given up the most fantasy points to receivers so far this season.While the Chiefs do have one stellar cornerback in Marcus Peters, ProFootballFocus.com projects that Kenneth Acker will be Bryants primary defender this week (though dont be surprised to see Peters moved around some to help cover Bryant).Will Fuller (HOU vs. Colts) With an incredible seven touchdowns over the past four games, its time to start paying attention to Fuller, if you havent been already.His seven touchdowns have come on just 13 receptions, which is a ratio that seems unlikely to maintain, but he should continue to be a big play threat, as hes averaging 21.6 yards per target.The Colts allows a league-high 16.0 yards per reception, and the fifth most F.P.P.G to the position.Also Consider: Marquise Goodwin (SF vs. Cardinals); T.Y.Hilton (IND at Texans) Tight End Jack Doyle (IND at Texans) Doyle has 25 receptions and two touchdowns over the past three games and has emerged as Brissetts top receiving option in the Colts offense.The young quarterback should continue to lean on Doyle this week against the Texans, who are one of the weaker defenders of the tight end position, allowing the sixth most F.P.P.G.Defense/Special Teams Jaguars vs. Bengals; Rams at Giants Kicker Harrison Butker (KC at Cowboys); Blair Walsh (SEA vs. Redskins)
The N.F.L.s Most Valuable Player Might Be ... a Punter?:::::Ask Hekker about his dopeness, and he deflects it.He subscribes to the Zen concept of mushin, imparted to him by Fassel, which means a mind cleared of all distraction.Hekker has forgotten many of his punts, and when the long-snapper Jake McQuaide asks whether he liked a snap, he remembers only that he caught it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I would like to think Im a top-10 guy in the league, Hekker said, but really I have a lot more work to do.During the spring, Hekker grew disgusted when he reviewed all 98 of his punts from last season and determined that many did not land where he wanted them.Again, this was the best punting season in history.Fassel said Hekker has yet to peak, which only reinforces Sneads claim that he might be the best punter ever.That claim is not drenched in hyperbole, and does not insinuate any bias from a man who in September tacked two more years onto the six-year, $18 million deal Hekker signed in 2014.John Turney, a prominent football historian, is working on a project about punting, and he said Hekker, three times a first-team All-Pro, has produced a statistically overpowering trail that places him on a trajectory to join Ray Guy as the only full-time punters in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.I dont know what else you can ask of a specialist, Turney said.For the influence that Hekker wields on a game, his capacity for maximizing field position, diminishing scoring probabilities and running a fake, Turney considers Hekker the best special-teams player in the league.Quite a compliment, but what if Hekker is even more than that?He does not pass like Tom Brady or run like Kareem Hunt or catch like Antonio Brown, or come close to playing nearly as many snaps as they do.Hekker, who also holds for Zuerlein, has taken only 31.9 percent of the Rams special-teams snaps.Hekker Stands Apart Johnny Hekker of the Rams leads in two of puntings most important statistics: net yards and pinning the opponent inside their 20.Net punting yards 50 Hekker Vogel Martin Sanchez Palardy King Bosher McAfee Anger B. Colquitt Haack 40 Jones Wing D.

Colquitt Locke Schmidt Lee 30 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Percent of punts not returned to opponents 20-yard line But when Hekker jogs onto the field on fourth down, his mind uncluttered and his limbs loose, and with 1.2 seconds to catch the snap and rotate the ball and drill it toward a small target area some 45 yards away, he almost never makes mistakes discernible to the naked eye.And because of that, maybe, just maybe, Hekker does his job better than anyone else in the league.Sustaining Excellence Sitting in his office, arms folded, brows furrowed, Snead pondered that possibility.He inherited a 2-14 team in February 2012, two and a half months before the draft.The Rams needed receivers and defensive linemen and cornerbacks.They also needed a punter.Fassel attended Hekkers pro day at Oregon State and wanted him.Early in the seventh and final round, Snead mulled picking Hekker.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The guy actually had a punt in college that went backward, Snead remembered saying that day.Figuring that the 31 other teams had seen it, he decided to take a linebacker.Hekkers friends remind him all the time of the punt, against Wisconsin during his senior season.It traveled minus-4 yards.It keeps him grounded, as does what happened after the season, when he went searching for an agent because none deemed him worth contacting.After signing with the Rams, Hekker began watching film of punters he respected, an exercise that endures.He marveled at the technique used by Thomas Morstead of New Orleans, quiet and refined.He gaped at how purely Dustin Colquitt of Kansas City strikes the ball, especially in a venue as unforgiving as Arrowhead Stadium.He admired the misdirection deployed by Sam Koch of Baltimore, how he would show left, then crush the kick right.I revere these guys, Hekker said.I need their posters on my wall.They keep me humble.I watch them punt and I think Ive got a long way to go.Photo The craft has evolved since Sammy Baugh let em rip 75 years ago, Turney said, cycling through several phases until this current era, which rewards those few punters who can kick consistently with power and precision.The two most revealing indicators, Turney said, are net average (how far the ball travels minus return yardage or touchbacks) and the ratio of inside-the-20 punts to touchbacks.Hekker holds the career record in each, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.(Those statistics began being tracked in 1976.)To sustain that excellence, Hekker relies on a catalog of punts.A sampling: the end-over-end one that swaps distance for control, the dastardly knuckler, the directional spiral and the famed banana, adapted from Australian rules football.Spinning sideways, the banana fooled Indianapolis returner Quan Bray in its regular-season debut, in Week 1, skidding at the 11 before helicoptering out of bounds at the 7.Many punters mess with the banana in practice, but few have the confidence or audacity to try it in a game.Hekkers next trick could be the punt he has been fiddling with: It spins as if kicked with his left foot.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont think Johnnys afraid of anybody, said Jeff Feagles, the N.F.L.career leader in punts.I think theyre afraid of him.Sometimes they are afraid he wont punt at all.By his own admission, Hekker was a quarterback who punted at Bothell High School in suburban Seattle.And the Rams capitalized on his passing talent immediately.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Against San Francisco as a rookie, Hekker completed a 21-yard pass from his own end zone.Then, with about five minutes left and the Rams trailing by 4 points, he connected on a 19-yarder that keyed a go-ahead scoring drive.In all, his 13 passes since 2012 with eight completions, all for first downs or touchdowns are 11 more than any other punter has attempted, according to Sportradar.(He has also passed for a 2-point conversion.)Fassel said the Rams have called about 40 other fakes with Hekker that they checked out of at the line of scrimmage.His versatility vexes opposing coaches who every week struggle with how to set up a runback and guard against a fake.Weve been really vanilla against him, said Brian Schneider, the Seahawks special-teams coach, whose team has been foiled by Hekker twice on fakes, after a September practice.We dont have much of a choice.Demanding Standards Hekker developed that arm, and a fierce competitive streak, playing football with his four older brothers.His fear of losing motivated him across his childhood, when he would turn household chores like carrying grocery bags into the house into contests.After high school, once he had committed to pursuing punting in college, Hekker learned fundamentals at a camp in Alabama run by Mike McCabe, a former all-American punter at Illinois State.He wasnt very good, McCabe said.As a walk-on at Oregon State, Hekker beat out Ryan Allen (now the Patriots punter) as a freshman for the starting job.Throughout college, Hekker returned to Alabama to train with McCabe, who said he now learns from him.On the practice field, competing against himself, Hekker is no less demanding.This season he is trying for three or fewer touchbacks (he has one so far) and for what he considers excellent direction on eight of every 10 punts.He aims for a narrow alleyway two or three yards from the sideline.
Roy Halladay Dies in Plane Crash in Gulf of Mexico:::::The news of Halladays death was quickly followed by expressions of grief on social media.We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladays untimely death, the Phillies said in a statement posted to Twitter.There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.A two-time Cy Young Award winner and an eight-time All-Star, Halladay was a 6-foot-6 right-hander known for his durability and command.After 12 major league seasons with the Blue Jays, who drafted him in 1995, he was traded to the Phillies in December 2009.Halladay made 2010 a definitive year in his career.He threw the 20th perfect game in major league history during the regular season, and in a division playoff series against Cincinnati, he threw the second no-hitter in postseason history.After the postseason no-hitter, Dusty Baker, the Reds manager at the time and a fixture in the sport going back to the late 1960s, said, That is the best-pitched game Ive seen since Ive been going to the playoffs and the World Series.One of the strongest messages of condolence on social media came from Pedro Martinez, the three-time Cy Young Award winner whose prime coincided with Halladays.Halladays career was cut short by back trouble, however.He became a much weaker pitcher in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, and he retired at 36, signing a one-day contract with Toronto to leave the game as a Blue Jay.Based on his retirement date, Halladay will not be considered for election to baseballs Hall of Fame until 2019, but he will have a strong case because of his dominance in his strongest seasons.His career record of 203-105 and his 2,117 career strikeouts are not eye-popping numbers, but using the JAWS system, an evaluation tool that accounts for a players peak seasons as well as his overall career, Halladay is ranked as baseballs 42nd-best starting pitcher.Only nine players ahead of him are not yet in the Hall of Fame, while more than 30 players below him on the list are already enshrined in Cooperstown.His postseason success and his popularity with the news media also bolster his case.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly after he retired, Halladay discussed how odd it felt not to play baseball.I find myself kind of sitting around the house thinking, Theres something missing here I should be working out, I should be running, I should be doing something, Halladay said.For a second, its kind of a little bit of panic, and then it kind of sets in: O.K., thats right.Im retiring now.Its actually a very peaceful feeling.He eventually turned to flying as an outlet, and in October he posted pictures of the plane he had recently purchased.Halladay, whose father was a pilot, knew the risks that flying presented.He joked about his wifes opposition to his purchasing the plane in a video that had been posted to YouTube by ICON but that was removed shortly after the crash.Shes fought me the whole way, Halladay said of his wife, Brandy.Hard, Brandy Halladay said in the video.I fought hard, I was very against it.She conceded after flying in the plane, though, that she understood the appeal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Piloting small planes has long been popular among athletes, and Major League Baseball has lost other athletes to similar crashes.Thurman Munson, an All-Star catcher and the 10th captain of the Yankees, died after crashing a Cessna Citation in 1979.And Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladays on the 2003 Blue Jays, died in 2006 when a Cirrus SR20 he was flying with a co-pilot crashed into an apartment building on Manhattans Upper East Side.The fact that the Pasco County Sheriffs Office led Tuesdays recovery effort carried extra emotion because of Halladays personal relationship with the department, which included the donation of a police dog that the department named Doc, in reference to Halladays nickname.You wouldnt know what Roy did because Roy wouldnt tell you what he did, Nocco said.And thats the legacy of a great man.Halladay is survived by his wife and two sons, Ryan and Braden.
Joe Girardi Didnt Sufficiently Connect With Yankees Players, Cashman Says:::::Cashman would not address any specific instances of poor communication, but some examples were evident this year.Girardi a former catcher was so frustrated by Sanchezs inattentiveness on defense that he briefly benched him and publicly criticized him in August.And during the playoffs, closer Aroldis Chapman liked an Instagram post that urged the Yankees not to bring back Girardi, though he later said it was an accident.In an interview on the WFAN radio station that ran concurrently with Cashmans conference call, Girardi disputed the idea that there were any communication problems and described his relationship with Sanchez as supportive.I think Brian was looking for something different, and evidently I didnt fit the mold, said Girardi, who nonetheless did not give an alternative reason for his dismissal.Cashman, who dismissed reports that hinted at increasing friction between him and Girardi this season or that Girardi did not work well with the analytics staff, also said that Girardis managerial gaffe in the postseason neglecting to call for a replay challenge that may have prevented a loss to the Cleveland Indians in Game 2 of an American League division series had nothing to do with his ouster.Asked if Girardi would have been back had the Yankees reached the World Series instead of losing in a seven-game American League Championship Series to the Houston Astros, Cashman said: Its tough to put a hypothetical in there.We went where we went.After the Yankees lost Game 7 on Oct. 21, they returned home the next day.Cashman gave his recommendation to Hal Steinbrenner, the teams principal owner, the next day, and Girardi was informed the following day, a Tuesday.The decision was announced two days later, on Thursday morning an off day during the World Series.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Though Cashman, whose contract has expired as well, said he had not yet reached an agreement on a new deal with Steinbrenner, he made clear that he would like to return.He said there were other priorities: the move of Kevin Reese from pro scouting director to director of player development, scouting meetings that wrapped up Friday, next weeks general manager meetings and the hiring of a new manager.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That last task is certain to garner a great deal of attention.Of the six teams that parted ways with their managers at the end of this season, only the Yankees have yet to name a replacement, and Cashman indicated that the search was just getting underway.He is winnowing a list of prospective candidates to bring in for interviews.He declined to say how many people would be interviewed but said that a previous relationship with the Yankees or managerial experience was not a prerequisite.Theres no perfect person that checks every box, Cashman said.I dont care whether theyre Hall of Famer categories.Asked if Alex Rodriguez, who served this season as an adviser to Steinbrenner while being paid $21 million for the final year of his contract, was a candidate, Cashman said, I definitely do not want to go through who may or may not be a candidate.But he promised a transparent process, one in which as with the clubs last managerial opening, which occurred after Joe Torre was pushed out 10 years ago each candidate will meet with the local news media after being interviewed.While Girardi acutely prepared but with a stilted personality seemed the antithesis of the avuncular Torre, Cashman said it would be a mistake to think the Yankees would be turning toward somebody who was solely a master communicator.The best candidate will also have to also be well versed in analytics, understand the role of sports science and be willing to challenge conventional thinking.Its an easy narrative to run to the opposite of what you already had, Cashman said.If somebody was too, for instance, structured and demanding, then you want to go from an old-school, heavy-handed personality to a new-school players manager thats not a narrative Im falling into.Were looking for the best person possible.INSIDE PITCH The Yankees did not make a qualifying offer, worth $17.4 million, to three players eligible for it: pitchers C. C. Sabathia and Michael Pineda and designated hitter Matt Holliday.Third baseman Todd Frazier and pitcher Jaime Garcia were not eligible for qualifying offers because they were acquired during the season.All the players are now free agents.Outfielder Jake Cave and pitcher Nick Rumbelow were added to the 40-man roster.
Bob Bowman, Major League Baseballs Digital Mastermind, Steps Down:::::Photo The former baseball commissioner Bud Selig once called Major League Baseball Advanced Media, the leagues digital and video arm, one of the great success stories of not only the baseball business, but American business.The person most responsible for that success is Bob Bowman, its chief executive for 17 years.Major League Baseball announced on Monday that Bowman, 62, was stepping down as president of business and media when his contract expires at the end of the year.Bobs vision made our game even more accessible and enjoyable to millions of fans, Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.In 2000, the 30 owners of Major League Baseball teams voted unanimously to contribute a combined $120 million $1 million per team for the first four years for equal ownership in Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam as its known.
How the Houston Astros Finally Hit on a Formula That Worked for Them:::::He and Craig Biggio, another Hall of Famer who spent his full career with Houston, finished just one season in last place.They were mostly good, but never good enough.Bagwell and Biggio reached the playoffs six times together but advanced to the World Series only in their final trip, in 2005, when they were swept by the Chicago White Sox.Astros fans get a daily reminder of that loss in the teams television analyst, Geoff Blum, who hit a 14th-inning homer at Minute Maid Park to win Game 3 for Chicago.Blum played only 33 career games for the White Sox and 580 for the Astros.Now, at last, his viewers might forgive him for his fling with an enemy.Please, finally!Blum shouted in the clubhouse celebration on Wednesday night.Although its going to be weird to see those two rings side by side.Photo When the Astros earned their ring in Game 7, they wore orange jerseys for the first time in the World Series.That look is not as distinctive as their famous rainbow jerseys worn from 1975 through 1986 and on throwback nights today but orange is a part of their identity.In the teams first logo, orange smoke from a pistol formed the letter C in Colts.They were 64-96 in their inaugural season far ahead of their hapless expansion brothers, the Mets and within a few years they had budding stars like Rusty Staub and Joe Morgan.Alas, the Astros lost most of Morgans prime after a trade for the slugger Lee May.When Morgan returned as a free agent, in 1980, the Astros lost an excruciating National League Championship Series to Philadelphia despite leading the decisive finale by three runs with Nolan Ryan on the mound.Six years later, they felt the sting of another N.L.C.S.loss, this time to the Mets, again despite a three-run lead in the final game.Both heartbreakers took place at the Astrodome.Photo Its not easy to do, said Biggio, who played two decades with the Astros through 2007.What did we have, the third-longest drought or whatever it was for the World Series?Theyre hard to get, and theyre special to get.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Astros chased a ring in so many different ways.They made early forays to the Dominican Republic for Cesar Cedeo, and to Venezuela for several high-impact prospects like Bobby Abreu, Freddy Garcia and Johan Santana who mostly thrived elsewhere.They had a habit of luring Texas-bred aces through free agency, like Ryan, Doug Drabek, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte.They made shrewd trades for Bagwell and others, and drafted future stars like J. R. Richard, Lance Berkman and Biggio.Photo None of it led to a title, and by 2012, Jim Cranes first full season as owner, the team had the worst record in the majors.George Springer was a top prospect, but Altuve and Keuchel were not highly regarded around the game.Crane revived orange as part of the Astros color palate when the franchise moved to the American League in 2013, but otherwise looked forward, not back.We came in on the 50th anniversary, so we got a lot of bang out of that, Crane said in an interview at his office in the summer of 2012.But really we can put our own mark on it next year.Were going to do that.Were going to change the uniform, were going to remodel the stadium a little bit, freshen it up and create some new spaces.Crane did not want to shift leagues, he said.But baseball required it as a condition of the sale, to even the leagues at 15 teams apiece.Photo People say, Are you mad about it?Crane said then.Not really.If were going to win a World Series, we got to beat everybody.They have done that now, largely with an approach that leans heavily on analytics under General Manager Jeff Luhnow.On the field after Game 7, Crane explained that he had learned to value analytics after studying several franchises while trying to buy a team.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I could see some of the stuff they were doing that we werent doing, he said.And then I said, You know, to really get good, weve got to challenge that and go a step further.So we allowed Jeff to do some of those things, and were still doing it and hope to build the organization to an even stronger position.Photo Luhnow had made his mark in the last decade by finding amateur talent for the St. Louis Cardinals, leaving a business career for an industry that still apologizes, in some corners, for relying on numbers.After Game 7, the Astros pitching coach, Brent Strom, said the team had targeted Charlie Morton the surprise winner that night partly because of the appealing spin rate of his pitches.The Astros helped Morton become the best version of himself through data that showed he should throw more curves and four-seam fastballs, and fewer sinkers.It was sound reasoning.Yet in the middle of his explanation, Strom added, almost reflexively, I hate to say this.
Masahiro Tanaka Opts to Remain With Yankees:::::This week, Kevin Reese was promoted from the pro scouting director to the senior director of player development, replacing Gary Denbo, who took a similar position with the Miami Marlins.The third-base coach, Joe Espada, left to become the bench coach for the Houston Astros.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Tanakas decision spared the Yankees from having to make a choice between extending his contract despite an injury risk or risk losing him on the open market.In the past, two other Yankees Alex Rodriguez and C. C. Sabathia have used opt-out clauses to extract lucrative, lengthy extensions from the team, the kind of deals the Yankees have shied away from in the last three years.But what most likely prevented Tanaka from doing the same was the state of his right elbow.Tanaka has been pitching with a small ligament tear in the elbow since at least July 2014 and he has missed time with arm injuries in each of his seasons with the Yankees.He spent 10 days on the disabled list in August with what was described as shoulder fatigue.Still, Tanaka has also shown signs of dominance in each season.This season, though, he was especially erratic, finishing at 13-12 with a 4.74 earned run average, by far the worst of his four seasons with the Yankees.In a late September start at Toronto, he surrendered a career-high-tying eight runs, including three homers, which ran his total to 35 for the season 10 more than he had ever given up in his professional career, which began in Japan when he was 18.But the poor performance proved to be a turning point for Tanaka.In his final start of the regular season, at home against the Blue Jays, Tanaka carried a perfect game for four and two-thirds innings and struck out a career-high 15 batters.He was just as good in the playoffs, allowing only two runs in 20 innings in three starts against the Cleveland Indians and the Houston Astros.In the postseason, he gave up 10 hits only one for extra bases and struck out 18 while walking three.
World Series Ratings Decrease Slightly From 2016:::::Photo LOS ANGELES The Houston Astros seven-game World Series win over the Los Angeles Dodgers averaged 18.9 million viewers on Fox, down by 19 percent from the 23.4 million average for the Chicago Cubs seven-game victory over the Cleveland Indians last year for their first title since 1908.The total audience for the Series across Foxs three outlets averaged 19.56 million, the network said Thursday.That included an average of 476,000 viewers on Fox Deportes, up 34 percent from 355,000 last year, and a digital audience average of 183,000 on Fox Sports Go, an increase of 4 percent.The number of viewers on Fox was up by 37 percent from San Franciscos seven-game win over Kansas City in 2014, which averaged 13.8 million on Fox.This years Series averaged a 10.7 rating and 20 share, down from a 13.1 and 23 last year.That was the highest-rated World Series since 2004, when the Boston Red Sox defeated St. Louis for their first title since 1918.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a broadcast, and the share is the percentage tuned in among those television households with sets on at the time.
Astros George Springer, the Series M.V.P., Has Come a Long Way:::::Springer comes from an athletic family.His sisters were standout softball players.His paternal grandfather moved to the United States from Panama to play baseball.His father, George Jr., played baseball in the Little League World Series and then college football at Connecticut.It was at school that George Jr. met his wife, Laura, a college gymnast from Puerto Rico.Photo George Springer IIIs parents chose to raise their children in New Britain.It allowed them to grow up around their grandparents, aunts and uncles, and in a diverse community.Our kids, from a very early age, were connecting with kids that many of them didnt look like them or spoke a different language, said Springers father, who is a lawyer.And if you watch George now, you see how he interacts with everybody.Early in high school, Springer was 5-foot-2.By his senior year, a growth spurt added nearly a foot.In college, he developed into a coveted prospect.Yet even as he flourished on the field, he had to contend with a stutter that was evident at a young age.Self-conscious of it, he became withdrawn and avoided speaking in school or other public situations.It was only when Springer was called up to the big leagues for the first time, in April 2014, that he learned to accept himself, adopted new techniques to help with his speech and later became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Stuttering Association for the Young.It took a lot of courage, his father said, adding: This didnt happen overnight.It was hard work, most of which, quite frankly, George did.We were there to guide, assist, coach and support, but he was the one that had to be comfortable in his own skin.He was the one that had to adopt all the techniques.I give him all the credit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even now, Springer occasionally stammers during interviews, but he speaks with poise and earnestness.In his first All-Star Game, over the summer, he wore a wireless microphone in the outfield for a national television interview during the game.Photo I cant spread a message to kids and adults if Im not willing to put myself out there, he said then.On the field, Springer grew, too.He hit 20 home runs in his rookie season, in 2014, but struck out 114 times in 78 games.He cut down on his strikeout rate each season after that, and improved the quality of his at-bats so much that the Astros made him their everyday leadoff hitter in May 2016.Hes dynamic, Astros catcher Brian McCann said.Hes a free safety playing baseball.He can hit the ball 450 feet, play Gold Glove center field, score from first every time theres a double.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Springer might not be a typical choice for center field because of his size (he is listed at 6-foot-3, 215 pounds) or the leadoff spot because of his power (he hit 29 home runs in 2016 and 34 in 2017).But Astros Manager A.J.Hinch has loved the spark Springer provides at the top of the order, and it showed in the playoffs, especially in the World Series.When hes hot, were hot, Hinch said.He started off the game with a ton of energy in the most critical game of the year.With the Astros leading the Dodgers, 3-0, in the second inning of Game 7, Springer hit a 96-mile-an-hour fastball from starter Yu Darvish over the center-field fence for a two-run home run.That made him the first player to hit a home run in four consecutive games in a single World Series.His five home runs tied Reggie Jackson (1977) and Chase Utley (2009) for the most in a World Series.In all, he hit .379 (11 for 29) with seven runs batted in, eight runs scored and a World Series record eight extra-base hits.Given how he ended, it was easy to forget that he sputtered in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees after a strong showing in the first round, and that he struck out four times in Game 1 of the World Series.
Dodgers Yu Darvish Confronts His Very Bad World Series:::::Darvishs decision was based in part on the number of reporters looking to get answers from him, and his desire not to create a traffic jam in the somber Dodgers clubhouse.But there also seemed to be a measure of accountability in his choice, as if he felt it was incumbent on him to sit in the spotlight and answer all of the questions about why he had pitched so poorly.Photo I had bad days, he said, and that means somebody else had a great day.I try to think of it that way, and sometimes it works.Maybe this time it didnt work because I let my teammates down.Darvish, who came to the major leagues in 2012 amid a good deal of fanfare and joined the Dodgers in July in a trade designed to fortify their chances to win a championship, is hardly the first player to stumble so profoundly in the Series.There have been many of them over the decades and, as it turns out, Darvishs awful performance is a perfect match for the one turned in by Art Ditmar of the Yankees in the 1960 World Series against Pittsburgh.Ditmar started Games 1 and 5 for the Yankees and lost both of them, matching Darvishs 0-2 record.He also ended with the same, ugly 21.60 E.R.A.now on Darvishs rsum.And like the Dodgers in 2017, the Yankees lost that Series in seven games.In the aftermath of Game 7 on Wednesday night, Darvishs teammates did their best to keep him from feeling that he was the biggest reason they had lost the Series.Its never about one guy, Justin Turner nobly insisted.Its about 25 guys, and we lost as a team.And Turner had a point.If Kenley Jansen had not blown a save in Game 2, if Clayton Kershaw had not blown two leads in Game 5, the Series might have turned out differently.And yet Darvishs failures were particularly glaring because they put the Dodgers in big holes so early in two games, holes that the Dodgers couldnt get out of.On Wednesday night, with the fans in Dodger Stadium looking on, perhaps a little nervously, Darvish was unable to rebound from his struggles in Game 3.The leadoff hitter, the Astros George Springer, doubled, and by the time the top of the first was over it was already 2-0, Houston.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The top of the second was no better.With a runner on base and the score, 3-0, Darvish shook off a sign from his catcher, Austin Barnes, who had called for a slider, and instead threw a fastball to Springer, who drilled it into the left-field pavilion for a home run.The Astros had a 5-0 lead that was both demoralizing and insurmountable.Photo The home run by Springer, that was a tough blow, said Kershaw, the Dodgers ace, who pitched four scoreless innings in relief after Darvish departed, to no avail.Dave Roberts, the Dodgers manager, dismissed questions afterward about whether Darvish should have even started Game 7, considering how poorly he had done in Game 3.Some wondered if Alex Wood might have been a better choice, or even Kershaw, who would have been starting the game on just two days rest.But Roberts didnt think either of those options was realistic.And even after the Dodgers had fallen behind, 3-0, in the second inning, Roberts said, he thought Darvishs pitches were good enough to allow him to face Springer for the second time in the game.It was a decision that might haunt Roberts for some time, but at least he had the right analysis of the outcome.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I think anything other than a homer, he said dryly, would have been considerably better.The one thing Darvish did do successfully was retire Yuli Gurriel to end the first inning.It was Gurriel, the Astros first baseman, who made the racist gesture about Darvishs facial appearance after he homered off him in Game 3.The gesture initiated an uproar that led to Gurriels receiving a five-game suspension for the start of the 2018 season.It also put Darvish in the uncomfortable position of having to respond to a mess he didnt create, which he did with grace and without anger.In turn, Gurriel, perhaps taking a cue from Darvish, tipped his helmet to him before he batted for the first time on Wednesday night.I just tried not to hit him, Darvish said.Many of Darvishs teammates rallied to his support after the incident created by Gurriel, most notably Rich Hill, the starting pitcher for the Dodgers in Game 6.When Gurriel came to bat for the fist time in that game, Hill fidgeted on the mound before throwing a pitch so that the booing from Dodgers fans could resonate longer.After Game 7, Hill expressed his admiration for Darvish, and for any athlete who has the courage to compete, and potentially fail, in public.Whether Hill and Darvish remain teammates is not certain.Darvish will become a free agent, and while he said on Wednesday that he would like to return to the Dodgers, free agency can go in unpredictable directions.What is certain is that Darvish remains undeterred by what happened to him in the last week.I would like to come back in the World Series, he said.And I want to pitch better.
When Astros Needed to Improvise, Charlie Morton Was Ready:::::Im way better than the way Im pitching right now, Giles said after Game 2 at Dodger Stadium, when he blew a lead in the 10th inning of an eventual 7-6 victory.Im not pitching to my expectations and Im beating myself up about it.The cracks had started showing in the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium when Giles who had 34 saves in 38 chances in the regular season lost a two-run lead in Game 4.He never pitched after the fourth game of the World Series, when the Dodgers battered him for three runs in the ninth inning to break open a tie game.By then, Hinch had already shown a willingness to find other pitchers for crucial spots, eschewing the crutch that managers often depend on.Stubbornly hoping for the summer version of a reliever now fading in the fall had contributed to other teams World Series downfalls notably the Boston Red Sox in 1986 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hinch refused to bury the Astros in that same graveyard.At three critical points in this postseason, he liked what he saw from a pitcher already in the game and let him finish it.Youve got to go with the hot hand, and it worked, said the Astros owner, Jim Crane, an old college pitcher.And it worked more than once.In Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., Hinch used starter Lance McCullers Jr. to relieve Morton for the final four innings.That decision clinched the pennant for Houston.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In Game 3 of the World Series, starter Brad Peacock relieved McCullers with one out in the sixth, Hinch stuck with him the rest of the way, too.And when McCullers could not survive the third inning of his start on Wednesday night, Hinch used three relievers to get the game to Morton for the bottom of the sixth.Two former Cy Young Award winners, Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander, got loose for the Astros in the bullpen.But Morton was stifling the Dodgers, and Hinch did not stop him.I was comfortable with him closing the game around three innings, but he did it with four, Hinch said, adding that he knew he had reinforcements if needed.As much as I scripted this game, it never plays out the way you expect.The Astros did not expect Giles to falter in October, but they protected themselves by engineering their staff to be fresh through the postseason.Not a single pitcher on the team worked 162 innings the minimum to be considered for the E.R.A.title as an Astro this season.Mike Fiers led the team in innings, with 153, and he was left off the postseason roster.Photo Of course, the Astros did trade for the prototypical leading man: Verlander, who worked 206 innings between playing for Detroit and Houston and fired a complete game in the A.L.C.S.But McCullers, Peacock and Morton each made at least 22 starts in the regular season while pitching between 115 and 150 innings enough of a workload to be available for multiple innings in October, but not so much to be exhausted by the World Series.I have to give props to our medical team, General Manager Jeff Luhnow said.They kept our guys healthy and playing.At this point in the season, the difference between medical teams could win the World Series.Our doctors, our trainers, our strength guys, they kept these guys out there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the end, there was Morton, sturdy and strong, defying his history as a pitcher perhaps best known for injuries.He had left hip surgery in 2010, Tommy John surgery in 2012 and right hip surgery in 2014.In 10 seasons, he has never reached 30 starts or 175 innings.Last year was especially grim.Traded to Philadelphia after seven seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Morton tore his left hamstring running to first base in April.He spent the next several months making lonely morning drives from his home in Bradenton, Fla., to the Phillies complex in Clearwater, recovering from an injury he knew had ended his season.Its not a good feeling, because youre watching your team on TV and youre a thousand miles away and you cant do anything, Morton said.But you start to appreciate it, because it becomes your responsibility as a professional.Its not glorious; nobody knows whats really going on except the guys youre working with.But its my job.Its my job to approach each situation professionally, and I tried to do that.The Astros saw enough in Mortons statistical profile to sign him to a two-year, $14 million contract last November.They believed in his curveball, which Morton threw more than ever this season, and thought that mechanical changes could help his fastball.They were right.Morton was 14-7 with a 3.62 E.R.A.in the regular season, with a career-best 10 strikeouts per nine innings.Then he became the first pitcher in baseball history to win two Game 7s in the same postseason.Im still not a 200-inning guy, Morton said.But Im part of something special.He thought some more and turned philosophical while teammates smoked cigars and flung beer around the locker room.You just dont know, Morton said.You could bunt a ball, be running down to first base and your season could be over.Or you could be here, and be fortunate to be part of this.Thats how I look at it, because Ive been everything: Ive been the guy you couldnt count on, Ive been the guy that gets hurt all the time, and Ive been a guy you can rely on in a crucial situation.There is no more crucial situation than the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, trying to bring your team its first championship ever.Morton delivered.He stopped dreaming, but the dream never gave up on him.
9 Weeks After Harvey, Houston Celebrates World Series Win:::::Its not so much lifting Houston up it sends you in a different direction for a while, said Rabbi Amy Weiss, an unapologetically fair-weather fan who got caught up in Astros-mania and who watched Game 7 at her new home because her old one was wrecked by Harvey.You can climb into the game, into the television, and youre not thinking about your flooded house.Other wounded cities have used professional sports as large-scale therapy.The New York Yankees reached the World Series just weeks after terrorists flew planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.(They lost the Series, 4-3, to the Arizona Diamondbacks.)After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged the home, then known as the Louisiana Superdome, of the New Orleans Saints, the teams first game back at the stadium in 2006, a 23-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, seemed to capture New Orleanss resilience.In 2012, the Saints unveiled a bronze statue outside the Superdome memorializing the dramatic blocked punt in that game by the Saints safety Steve Gleason.The statue was called Rebirth.In Houston, a sport that is sometimes referred to as a game of inches captivated a city defined by them.Residents measured the personal devastation from the worst rainfall in United States history in inches the high-water marks that still stain walls and kitchens and cars and spirits.Photo So the Astros were cheered on by Rabbi Weiss, who had 31 inches of floodwater in her home.And Mr. Doucett, who had roughly 72 inches.And Bob Heyl, who had 15.And Josh and Katie Halburn, who considered themselves lucky with a mere four.And Bob Dunston, who had 180 in his two-story townhome on the San Jacinto River, his third flood in 16 months.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We think its awesome that they keep getting knocked down and keep getting back up, Mr. Dunston, 58, said of the Astros, whom he watched on Wednesday at his new rental home.Its a good distraction, because at the end of the day, after the Series is over, were still going to have to go back in and look at that property and its just going to be a screwed-up mess.From the garage floor to five feet into the second floor is 180 inches.Fifteen feet.I walked out the door.I had my computer, a bottle of Crown, a bundle of cigars, two changes of clothes and my fathers flag from his funeral.That has been the Houston way lately: to blend talk of the Astros with talk of Harvey, so that conversations go from Jose Altuve to Justin Verlander to drywall to FEMA and back again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Heyl, 69, recalled the night Harvey seeped into his world.It totaled his familys two cars.It forced him to make a sudden decision to help keep his quadriplegic 41-year-old son safe, assembling a makeshift wheelchair ramp that he used to push him onto a turned-over cabinet.A stranger in a canoe who paddled along their street-turned-river offered to help, and the two men carried Mr. Heyls son, Rich, to a bed on the second floor.In recent weeks, the radio chatter of Astros games provided the low-volume soundtrack of their Harvey recovery, as Mr. Heyl and his wife repaired their home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood known as Meyerland.Photo Youre going to see people referring to this World Series as uplifting the city for years to come, Mr. Heyl said.Its going to be, Remember the Astros.They did it.We can do it.The Astros hometown fans have been loyal, but extraordinarily distracted.Rabbi Weiss followed the team while helping to distribute one million pairs of underwear to storm victims throughout Texas, as part of the mission of the nonprofit group she runs, Undies for Everyone.Mr. Doucett watched the games at night after repairing dozens of nearby homes, handing out food and clothes to the neighborhood and helping form a group in response to Harvey called S.O.S., or Save Our Selves.As Mr. Doucett sat on his porch Wednesday watching the game with his fiance, Samantha Locke, and their friends, there was a brief interruption.Lake Forest Boulevard, with its stray dogs, curbside debris and homes in various stages of repair, felt haunted by Harvey, even two months later.Volunteers from a community group called West Street Recovery pulled up and announced they had a donation for Mr. Doucett.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a typical post-Harvey World Series watch party.Some of the guests set down their beers and helped carry panels of Sheetrock to the driveway, in the middle of the fifth inning.
For Clues in Yankees Manager Search, Look to the Dodgers:::::Still, the next Yankees manager seems unlikely to resemble Francona and Maddon, with their extensive track records; a likelier model would be one of the 2017 World Series managers: Roberts and the Houston Astros A.J.Hinch.Hinch, 43, who has a psychology degree from Stanford, used humor and humility to build bonds with his players, quickly overcoming skepticism based on a failed, brief first attempt at managing the Arizona Diamondbacks, a job he landed at age 34.As well as Hinch has done in three years with the Astros, the Dodgers hiring of Roberts might be the most instructive in looking at the Yankees, who like their long-ago crosstown rivals are trying to build a perpetual contender around a strong farm system, an adherence to analytics and one of baseballs biggest payrolls.Cashman said the Yankees would be methodical in their search they have not yet finalized a list of candidates, even as five other openings have been filled.So were the Dodgers.They dismissed Don Mattingly as manager after they lost to the Mets in a 2015 division series, but it took a month and interviews with nine candidates to fill the job.Photo The Dodgers interviewed internal candidates, former managers, novices, popular organizational figures (Kirk Gibson) and even a college coach (Darin Erstad) before selecting Roberts, then the San Diego Padres bench coach.He won the job over Bud Black, now the Colorado Rockies manager, and Gabe Kapler, who was recently named the Philadelphia Phillies manager.Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, said he was looking foremost for an excellent communicator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Relentless optimism was something that was important going through the grind of a 162-game season, especially in a larger market, Friedman said last week.It can be a little bit of a grind, so having someone with infectious energy was something that we were looking for from the leader of our 25-man roster.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Like so much about baseball in recent years, the idea of a players manager has evolved, too, thanks to data.With statistical analysis and sports science playing a more prominent role in how lineups are constructed and the bench is deployed each day, the modern manager must be able to communicate these new strategies particularly with younger players who may wonder why they are not playing.Relationships are the foundation for those dialogues.Just so they can think along with you, Friedman said.And therefore, they are less caught off guard by certain moves you might make, which therefore reduces some tension that might come with in-game decisions or starting lineup decisions that in large part dont manifest themselves the same way when theres that open, honest communication throughout.Communication is not strictly top down.Decisions that were once the domain of a manager are now collaborative, involving the front office, pro scouts, player development and sports science staff members, among others.Thats why for a lot of us, getting asked questions like, who makes out the lineup?or who decides on the roster?are strange questions, said Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager and Friedmans lieutenant.We view it as such a collaboration that its not about pointing the finger at one person who goes into an office and locks the door and makes the decision by himself.The process is a lot more organic than that, and I think thats the way the game is headed.When Roberts interviewed, he did not know Friedman or Zaidi though he had worked for another Dodgers executive, Josh Byrnes, in San Diego and he had not been a manager before.Friedman said those were formidable hurdles, but when they finished the initial interview, Zaidi remarked that it was as if Roberts had the answer key.In the few areas in which Roberts was not in lock step with Friedman and Zaidi, they took the ensuing back-and-forth as a healthy sign.Obviously the relationship is way stronger today than it was a year ago, and Ill bet its stronger a year from now than it is right now, Friedman said.Thats the nature of human relationships.As long as theres trust in place, which I think we all have, we feel like, as we look ahead, the continuity that we envision is something that we feel will be a competitive advantage for us in the coming years.And something that the Yankees would like to replicate.
Astros Outlast Dodgers to Clinch First World Series Title:::::LOS ANGELES If the Houston Astros had plenty on their minds and the weight of history on their backs it hardly seemed like a burden when they arrived at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday.A franchise that hadnt won a championship since joining the major leagues in 1962 faced the daunting task of playing Game 7 of the World Series in front of a boisterous crowd supporting the Dodgers.But the Astros appeared oddly at ease.Manager A. J. Hinch kept his pregame news conference light, shortstop Carlos Correa and second baseman Jose Altuve lounged on the grass as they awaited batting practice, and the scene inside the clubhouse was reassuring: Music played, game plans were reviewed and no one was staring into his locker.I was thinking, well, lets see how everyone looks, said Carlos Beltran, one of the veteran leaders.If I feel like were tight, we might need to say something.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Words were not necessary, only deeds.The Astros, playing coolly and confidently from the first pitch, got some big offensive contributions early from their leadoff hitter, George Springer, and used five pitchers to hold off the Dodgers for a 5-1 victory that had little of the drama that had defined the rest of the Series.
Carlos Correa Proposes to Girlfriend During World Series Celebration:::::Photo How do you top winning the World Series?Carlos Correa did it by proposing.Interviewed after the game on Fox, Correa, the Astros shortstop, said of their World Series title, Its one of the biggest accomplishments of my life, and right now I want to take another big step in my life.Producing a ring from his back pocket, Correa turned to his girlfriend and said, Daniella Rodriguez, will you make me the happiest man in the world?Will you marry me?Rodriguez answered affirmatively.Rodriguez was Miss Texas USA in 2016 and got to throw out the first ball at an Astros game in August.Her effort was not especially memorable.It was probably the most high-profile post-sports event proposal since at least 2007, when Ian Johnson of Boise States football team proposed to his girlfriend, Chrissy Popadics, after the Broncos wild Fiesta Bowl win over Oklahoma.Earlier on Wednesday, Correa showed no sign of pre-proposal nerves, as he playfully tossed a cup of water in the face of the actor Ken Jeong, who was waving a giant Dodgers flag atop the Astros dugout.Correa was 1 for 4 on the night.
Mets Promote Pat Roessler to Hitting Coach:::::To help fill the coaching staff of new manager Mickey Callaway, the Mets promoted Pat Roessler to make him the teams new hitting coach, a person in baseball familiar with the situation confirmed.The person did not want to be publicly identified because the move was not yet official.Roessler, 57, had been the Mets assistant hitting coach since the start of the 2015 season.He is a longtime hitting instructor who has held similar positions in other organizations, and had strong relationships with various Mets players.He succeeded Kevin Long, the Mets hitting coach for the past three seasons, who, along with Roessler, helped Daniel Murphy develop into an elite hitter.Long had his sights set on the Mets managerial job that went to Callaway last month.The Mets had hoped that Long would still remain in the organization, but he had drawn interest for other hitting-coach positions and managerial vacancies, including the job in Washington.(That ultimately went to Dave Martinez.)Ricky Bones is expected to remain as the Mets bullpen coach, while Dave Eiland, a former Yankees and Kansas City Royals pitching coach, is reportedly the Mets choice to fill that role for them.
How the Astros Won World Series Game 7, Inning by Inning:::::Bregman had advanced to second on the error, and he showed some aggressiveness by stealing third.The move paid off, as he was able to score on a groundout by Jose Altuve, making it 2-0.Darvish, who lasted just five outs in his Game 3 start, was able to get out of the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a grounder to first and winning a 13-pitch battle with Yulieski Gurriel, who flew out to right.It could be another short night for Darvish if he does not improve considerably in the second inning.Waldstein: All that pumping up by the fans, the P.A.and the Dodger players came to a crashing thud when the Astros plated a run before there was an out.A lot of people expect to see Clayton Kershaw come into the game early.I spoke to Mark Teixeira on the field before the game and he had an interesting point.He thinks Kershaw was only so-so in Game 5 and if he gets into this game it will be the third time the Astros have seen him.Too risky.Teixeira also thought Darvish was rusty from a long layoff before game 2 and should be sharper tonight.Someone, maybe Kershaw, was jogging around and loosening up in the bullpen in the first inning, and at one point Darvish looked up and saw it.- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Bottom 1st: McCullers gets out of a tight spot.Handed a two-run lead before throwing a pitch, Lance McCullers loaded the bases with two outs, but he was able to escape unscathed with the lead intact.Just like the Astros, the Dodgers started things with a double when Chris Taylor launched a ball to the wall in right-center.Corey Seager struck out, but McCullers hit two batters with pitches, sandwiching Cody Bellingers latest strikeout between the beanballs.But McCullers stayed cool with the bases loaded and induced a grounder to second by Joc Pederson to end the inning.Photo Top 2nd: Springer chases Darvish with a two-run homer.The Astros stretched their lead to 5-0 thanks to a surprising R.B.I.groundout from their pitcher and a mammoth two-run home run from the front-runner for World Series M.V.P., George Springer, who became the first player in Series history to homer in four consecutive games.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brian McCann started the inning by drawing an eight-pitch walk.Marwin Gonzalez, who has been in a terrible slump for most of the World Series, followed that by hitting a double to the wall that would have scored any runner on the Astros beyond McCann.With runners on second and third and no outs, Darvish got the first out of the inning on a soft grounder to second from Josh Reddick, but that brought up McCullers and the American League pitcher was swinging away rather than trying to bunt the slow-footed McCann home, and that strategy worked just fine as he hit a soft grounder to second that gave his battery-mate plenty of time to score.Darvish would last just one more batter, as Springer worked a full-count before getting a fastball he liked, and then he gave it a ride for his fifth home run of the World Series.In what should surprise absolutely no one, Brandon Morrow, who had pitched in each game of the World Series, and 13 of the Dodgers 14 playoff games, got the call to replace Darvish, and he struck out Alex Bregman on just three pitches.Photo Bottom 2nd: Double play ends Dodgers rally.Lance McCullers put two more runners on base, but once again got out of the inning without allowing a run.Logan Forsythe singled to left to start things off and he advanced to second on a groundout by Austin Barnes.With a runner in scoring position and one out, Dave Roberts sent up Kike Hernandez to pinch-hit for Brandon Morrow, and he reached base on a walk.But Chris Taylor lined out to short, and Carlos Correa was able to throw behind Forsythe to double him off at second after making the catch.With Morrow out of the game, the relievers World Series is complete, and he became just the second pitcher to appear in seven World Series games in a single season, joining Darold Knowles of the 1973 Oakland As.Morrow had a disastrous appearance in Game 5, but recovered with scoreless appearances in Games 6 and 7.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Well, even though Mark Teixeira kind of talked me out of it, Kershaw is going to pitch early in this game, as many of us thought he would.But this is not how the Dodgers envisioned it.They wanted to see Darvish go four, or so, innings and leave with a lead before handing it over to Kershaw, who would then give the ball to Kenley Jansen.Now the task is for Kershaw to keep the Astros at bay until the Dodgers can crack McCullers.Theyve been close to breaking through in the first two innings.Its looking like a matter of time.The question remains, though, how much?Top 3rd: Dodgers give the ball to Kershaw, who delivers.With their backs against the wall, the Dodgers went to their biggest gun early, and brought in Clayton Kershaw as a reliever to start the third.He needed just 10 pitches to get three outs.The left-hander got Jose Altuve to fly out to center, Carlos Correa to fly out to right, and then caught Yulieski Gurriel looking at a 95 mile-per-hour fastball that was low in the zone but high enough for home plate umpire Mark Wegner to call strike three.Photo Bottom 3rd: Astros turn to their bullpen to get out of trouble.Both teams are into their bullpens as Lance s once again started the inning by allowing a pair of base runners and was removed after getting one out.Brad Peacock got Houston out of the jam and the Dodgers have yet to score despite having had seven players reach base in the game.Corey Seager hit a ball to right-center that looked like it might be a double, but Seager wisely pulled up to stay at first when he realized George Springer had tracked the ball down quickly.McCullers reacted to the base-runner by hitting Justin Turner with a pitch for a second time it was McCullers World Series record-setting fourth hit batter but he got some help from Cody Bellinger when the rookie struck out on five pitches.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Looking to keep the game scoreless, A.J.Hinch decided McCullers, who had thrown just 49 pitches, was done, and he brought in Peacock who got a long flyout from Yasiel Puig and then got out of the inning by striking out Joc Pederson.Waldstein: Gone are the days of Jack Morris and Sandy Koufax going the distance in a Game 7.Both of the starting pitchers are gone from this game in only the third inning.This is the first time in a World Series Game 7 that both starters did not pitch at least three innings.I expected A.J.Hinch to go longer with McCullers, but he hit four batters (Justin Turner twice) and it seemed like the Dodgers were on the verge against him during his two and one-third innings.Brad Peacock was brilliant in Game 3, but the stakes are much higher now.Top 4th: Kershaw pitches two clean innings.Clayton Kershaw worked around a one-out single to Marwin Gonzalez to pitch a second scoreless inning.He is due up to bat in the bottom half of the inning, so his day could be done.Photo Bottom 4th: Peacock just what the Astros needed.After three innings of the Dodgers getting on base, Brad Peacock threw Houstons first 1-2-3 inning of the day.He got Logan Forsythe to ground out to third, Austin Barnes to pop out to third, and then struck out Clayton Kershaw, who was allowed to bat because there were two outs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Top 5th: Kershaw finally silences Springers bat.Clayton Kershaw has pitched three scoreless innings and it is pretty clear that he would have been a better option at starter than Yu Darvish was.He started the fifth by becoming the first Dodgers pitcher of the day to retire George Springer when he got the red-hot hitter to strike out on a slider up in the zone.He struck out Alex Bregman as well and then ended the inning by getting Jose Altuve to fly out to Cody Bellinger in foul territory.Waldstein: I spoke to former Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green before the game and he said the rule of thumb at Dodger Stadium is that when there is moisture on the grass, outfielders should take five steps in, because that means there is moisture in the air, which tamps the ball down.Yasiel Puigs fly ball to center earlier might have been an example.Astros center fielder George Springer took a few steps back and then had to run in to catch it.Photo Bottom 5th: Dodgers leave two more runners on base.It took three pitchers, but Houston got through another scoreless inning, with the Dodgers stranding two more runners bringing them to an ugly eight for the game.Brad Peacock got the first out, but after a walk and an infield single his day was done.Francisco Liriano was summoned to face Cody Bellinger, and got him to hit into a force-out, and then Chris Devenski was brought in to face Yasiel Puig, who hit a line drive right to first baseman Yuli Gurriel to end the inning.Waldstein: It has been amazing how the Dodgers have been unable to break through with men on base, even when hitting the ball hard.In the second inning they had runners at first and second with one out, but Chris Taylor lined into a double play.In the fifth, Yasiel Puig lined out to first with runners at first and third with two outs.How long can the Astros keep escaping these predicaments?Top 6th: Kershaw keeps it clean.Clayton Kershaw gambled to get a matchup he liked better, and the risky move paid off, resulting in a fourth scoreless inning.Carlos Correa led off with a single to left and he advanced to third base on a pair of groundouts.Marwin Gonzalez and pinch-hitter Evan Gattis were both intentionally walked, and with two outs and the bases loaded, Kershaw ended the inning by getting Cameron Maybin to pop out to third.Photo Bottom 6th: Dodgers finally get a runner across.Charlie Morton became Houstons fifth pitcher of the day and he was immediately in trouble.Joc Pederson singled, Logan Forsythe walked and after Morton got an out on a pop-up by Austin Barnes, the Dodgers got on the board with a run-scoring single by pinch-hitter Andre Ethier, making it 5-1.Morton did not allow any further damage, striking out Chris Taylor and inducing a grounder to short by Corey Seager, which means the Dodgers have now stranded ten runners in six innings.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Ethier having pinch-hit for Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers bullpen will have to try to follow the example he set with four scoreless innings of relief.Waldstein: Charlie Morton is making just the second relief appearance of his career and first since his rookie season of 2008 with the Braves.But he has the temperament for it.Astros people say he is very calm and has the ability to slow things down.He certainly looked calm with that shard of Corey Seagers bat coming at him at about 50 miles per hour.He stepped aside to avoid it, but the bat still clipped him in the leg.Unfazed, he turned and watched Carlos Correa scoop up the ball and throw Seager out for the final out of the sixth inning.Calm, indeed.Photo Top 7th: Jansen comes in early and gets job done.It is all hands on deck for the Dodgers, with the teams closer, Kenley Jansen, coming in for the seventh inning.It is an open question how long he can go, but he worked around a two-out walk to pitch a scoreless inning.Jansen got the first out on a long fly ball to center from George Springer that a sliding Chris Taylor was able to track down.He struck out Alex Bregman on seven pitches, but walked Jose Altuve.Altuve got Houstons second stolen base of the Series by taking second on a first-pitch ball to Carlos Correa, but he was left there when Correa popped out to short.Photo Bottom 7th: Dodgers cant build any momentum.Charlie Morton had an incredibly quiet seventh.The right-hander got Justin Turner to pop out to first, struck out Cody Bellinger and then ended things with a groundout to short by Yulieski Gurriel.Top 8th: Dodgers bullpen keeps rolling.Alex Wood replaced Kenley Jansen and pitched a 1-2-3 inning, retiring Yulieski Gurriel, Brian McCann and Marwin Gonzalez.The Dodgers relievers have been incredible since Yu Darvish came out of the game in the second inning, but the offense has yet to offer them much help.Waldstein: Strange only using Jansen for one inning.If that were the case, then why not save him for later in case you get a lead?Meanwhile, Charlie Morton was on deck swinging with a jacket on.He would have been the fourth pitcher to hit in this game, and only one was a starter, Lance McCullers, who collected a run batted in.Clayton Kershaw and Brad Peacock also batted.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom 8th: Morton blanks Dodgers again.Charlie Morton has successfully atoned for the run he allowed in his sixth inning by following it up with two scoreless innings.He struck out Joc Pederson, got Logan Forsythe to fly out to right, and sent the game to the ninth inning when he got Austin Barnes to fly out to center.Top 9th: Wood keeps Astros lead at four.Alex Wood was able to prevent the Astros from tacking on any insurance runs in a scoreless ninth.He struck out Charlie Morton on three pitches, Cameron Maybin on five pitches and then finished the half-inning by getting George Springer to fly out to center.The Astros are three outs away from the first championship in franchise history.Photo Bottom 9th: Dodgers go down without a fight.A.J.Hinch had showed a preference for sticking with a hot hand in terms of his relievers, and he lived up to that by sending Charlie Morton out for a fourth inning of relief.The right-hander slammed the door on the Dodgers.He struck out pinch-hitter Chase Utley, and then got matching groundouts to second from Chris Taylor and Corey Seager to end the game before he was mobbed in the middle of the field by his teammates.
A Dodger Steps Back as Fans Deliver Their Own World Series Justice:::::Gurriel, 33, apologized for his actions, and Darvish quickly forgave him.But Gurriel was hit with a five-game suspension by Commissioner Rob Manfred the next day.It will be served at the start of the 2018 season.In a World Series filled with drama and headed to a Game 7 on Wednesday night, it seems almost preordained that the Dodgers will now send Darvish to the mound to start the game, which means he will be pitching again to Gurriel, with everything on the line.Photo Before Tuesdays game, Darvish spoke to reporters about Gurriel and said he had sent a message to him stating that a face-to-face apology for what he had done was not necessary, although Gurriel had expressed a desire to make one.I told him, Hey, you dont have to do that because you made a comment, and Im not that mad, Darvish said through an interpreter.So like I really didnt care much about that.Gurriels gesture in Game 3 overshadowed a jagged outing by Darvish that night.After allowing only one run in each of his previous two starts in the postseason, Darvish coughed up four runs on six hits in just one and two-third innings.It was the shortest outing of what has been a standout major league career.But after a rough 24 hours for Darvish, his teammates huddled around him in the dugout before Game 4 of the Series and told him, Were going to win this game for you.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Dodgers kept their word in a 6-2 victory.And despite dropping Game 5 the epic 13-12 slugfest they beat Justin Verlander in Game 6.So now its Darvish on the mound for the Dodgers in Game 7 with Gurriel batting fifth for the Astros.On Tuesday, the loud boos for Gurriel meant he had replaced Astros right fielder Josh Reddick as the villain for Dodgers fans.Reddick had heard catcalls earlier in the Series for his comments about fans in Los Angeles not supporting him after his trade to the Dodgers midway through last season.But Gurriels actions in Game 3 turned Reddick into a footnote.Instead, the fans booed Gurriel loudly before Hills first pitch to him and between each pitch.And when Gurriel popped out, the boos were loud all over again.So it went for Gurriel in every one of his at-bats, including his single in the sixth inning.If the forceful reaction from fans bothered Gurriel, he did not seem to show it.But after the game, he left the clubhouse without speaking to reporters.The Astros designated hitter, Carlos Beltran, had counseled Gurriel after the incident but said he did not feel the need to say anything to him after Game 6.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He asked for forgiveness and theres not much left to talk about, Beltran said.Asked about the booing, Beltran said, Baseball is like that.And it is likely to be like that again in Game 7.
Another Game 7 Provides a Perfect Ending for the Astros:::::The Astros hopes for a Game 7 blowout stalled when the Dodgers quickly lifted starter Yu Darvish, who faced just 10 batters and allowed half of them to score.After that, the pitchers on both sides took over, making for a tense finale, if not a classic, in the first World Series Game 7 ever held at Dodger Stadium, the third-oldest venue in the majors.The Astros had never even played in a World Series seventh game; their only other trip was a four-game loss to the White Sox in 2005, which had been part of that string of abbreviated Series.Photo For historical resonance, nothing could have topped last year, when the Chicago Cubs won their first championship since 1908 against a Cleveland Indians team that had the second-longest title drought, dating to 1948.That series went seven games, with the Cubs blowing a late lead but prevailing, after a rain delay, in the 10th inning.Now, another Series between two desperate teams has gone all the way.The Dodgers were seeking their first World Series title in 29 years, and the Astros an expansion team in 1962 their first ever.Im sure M.L.B.is probably sitting back and kicking their feet up, the Dodgers third baseman, Justin Turner, said before Game 7.Counting the money?a reporter asked.Im not going to say that, but definitely enjoying it, Turner said, laughing.And knowing that its going to Game 7 is appropriate, with these two teams.This is the first season that baseball has awarded home-field advantage in the World Series to the team with the better record.The Dodgers earned the right to be the host by leading the majors in victories with 104, the most in their six decades in Los Angeles.But the Astros were not far behind, with 101 wins, making this a particularly high-powered matchup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To find the last time a World Series between 100-win teams stretched to Game 7, you have to reach back to 1931, when the St. Louis Cardinals thwarted the Philadelphia Athletics attempt at a third consecutive championship.It was so long ago that the winning pitcher, 38-year-old Burleigh Grimes, threw spitballs.The pitch had been banned for years, but since Grimes had already been throwing it, he was allowed to continue.In this World Series, according to Verlander and others, the balls arrive pre-slicked.He insisted again after Game 6 that the World Series baseballs were slippery, making it hard for a pitcher to pull down on the slider for a reliable late slash.That could partly explain the power surge that has helped make this World Series memorable though not every game has been a slugfest.Photo Indeed, Game 6 mirrored the opener: a 3-1 Dodgers victory, with the starter allowing a solo homer and Kenley Jansen perfect at the end.In Game 1, Clayton Kershaw worked seven innings for the win, but on Tuesday, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts pulled Rich Hill in the fifth, before he could face a batter for the third time.Robertss aggressive bullpen usage, a reflection of the teams analytically minded front office, has lent another intriguing sidebar to this World Series, with fans not even waiting to second-guess.They booed Roberts when he called for the bullpen in Game 6, and Hill knocked over a few cups of water in the dugout.But the Dodgers relievers were superb, after looking hopelessly trapped in a Houston fun house in Game 5 on Sunday.That game had ended up 13-12, a score so odd for a baseball game that it had not happened anywhere in the majors in almost three years.The Astros won on a single by Alex Bregman, but the game included seven homers, a total exceeded only once in World Series history by the eight homers in Game 2 of this very series, a 7-6 Astros victory here.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Just when I thought I could describe Game 2 as my favorite game of all time, I think Game 5 exceeded that and more, Astros Manager A.J.Hinch said on Sunday.Its hard to put into words all the twists and turns.Reggie Jackson thought of a few.During Game 5, when the Astros Jose Altuve crushed a game-tying homer, Jackson the Hall of Famer and two-time World Series most valuable player texted the Astros owner, Jim Crane.Altuve, the best player in the game, read the message.Says who?Says Mr. October.Altuves homer came on the first at-bat after Kershaw was pulled from Game 5.The Dodgers had given Kershaw leads of 4-0 and 7-4, and with a chance to send his team back home with a lead, Kershaw fizzled.He spun four shutout innings in Game 7, but with his team behind, he could not quite match the signature performance of a division rival.That effort, by San Franciscos Madison Bumgarner, came in 2014 and began this stretch of three Game 7s in four years.Pitching on just two days of rest after throwing a shutout, Bumgarner blanked the Royals for the final five innings of Game 7, stranding the tying run on third base at the end.Photo The Royals followed up the next year by beating the Mets, coming back in all four victories of an entertaining five-game World Series.It was the first championship for the Royals in 30 years and, of course, they were happy to wrap it up when they did, despite leaving two games not played.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In their clubhouse after Game 6 on Tuesday, the Astros were hardly despondent, and seemed energized by the chance to play one more game.Yes, they had been leading on Tuesday heading into the bottom of the sixth, but in a World Series like this, 12 outs were a lot to assume.Verlander had allowed just one hit through five innings, but did not feel close to victory with a tenuous 1-0 lead.Absolutely not, he said.Not the way these games have gone, not the way these guys lineup is.If we could have squeaked across a run or two more, I maybe would have changed my mentality.But Ive played this game too long.He has played it in the majors since 2005, all with the Detroit Tigers until a trade to Houston in August.Verlander helped lead the Tigers to the World Series in 2006, when he lost the first and last games to St. Louis.He made it back in 2012, but got flattened by the Giants Pablo Sandoval in the opener of a forgettable sweep.Those were two of the 10 World Series between 1998 and 2013 that lasted only four or five games.A few moments stood out in that time, of course; Carlos Correa, the Astros shortstop, cited two of the best when asked for his favorite memories as a fan.Luis Gonzalez off the Yankees and David Freese off the Rangers, Correa said, referring to the Arizona Diamondbacks Gonzalez, who had the winning hit in Game 7 in 2001, and the St. Louis Cardinals Freese, who homered to win Game 6 in 2011 to set up a Game 7.Both were among the previous 38 best-of-seven World Series that extended to the final game.And before now, just one other World Series had followed the pattern of the home team winning Games 1, 3, 5 and 6 and losing Games 2, 4 and 7: the spellbinding clash in 1975 between the Boston Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, who won Game 7 at Fenway Park.This World Series had the same kind of rapid momentum shifts, and was a new phenomenon for everyone: None of the 50 active players had taken part in a Game 7 of the World Series.Yet they had spent their lives waiting.Its what you sign up for, said Springer, who was drafted seven years ago, when the Astros were the worst team in baseball.For us to go from where we were a long time ago to Game 7 of the World Series against the Dodgers here its an honor.
Tottenham defender Kieran Trippier hoping to fly flag for England just like his dad:::::Kieran Trippier is hoping to fly the flag for England at next summer's World Cup, while his father Chris does the same back home in Bury.The Tottenham right-back has won two caps under Gareth Southgate and the forthcoming friendlies against Germany and Brazil present a chance to nail down his place in the Three Lions squad ahead of Russia 2018.If the 27-year-old does make the plane nobody would be happier than Chris Trippier, a die-hard England fan who has a long-standing tradition of hoisting a super-size St George's Cross outside his house to celebrate tournaments.The local authorities did not always share in the fun but Trippier has fond memories to look back on."My dad is mad for England.He had a big flag in his garden," he said."It's huge.A massive pole with a massive England flag and he brought the telly into the garden when it was nice weather.I can never forget it."The council tried to make him take it down, but he didn't.They wrote letters to him and everything but he said: 'I'm not taking it down'."The neighbours love it.I don't know who complained about it, but it's hilarious."We have a bit of banter about it to this day."Trippier is in no doubt it is being prepared for another outing in June."He's already said he'll put it up next summer," he added.That kind of dedication shows a deep-rooted passion for the national side still exists in the country, a notion that was called into question as Southgate's side wrapped up qualifying last month with a pair of colourless wins over Slovenia and Lithuania.The manager has admitted his team need to be more entertaining to win back some of the faltering fanbase, but any suggestion that pulling on the shirt does not mean enough holds no water with the Trippier family."I'll never forget when we were in France (for his debut), my parents were both crying their eyes out," he said."To make it to the senior squad, it was one of the proudest moments."From playing in the Championship I've always dreamed about playing for England, putting on the jersey.I can remember now, it still gives me a bit of shivers, the France game, when I put the jersey on and I knew I was going to play for England in my debut."Trippier still has work to do to ensure he is in England's World Cup squad rather than watching alongside his family, with just over 100 minutes on international football under his belt and Liverpool's Nathaniel Clyne on his way back from injury.But his accomplished performances for Spurs, not least in their recent Champions League win over Real Madrid, are helping build a strong case."You can learn a lot playing against Real Madrid.These are the teams you want to play against," he said."I want to play as many games as I can to hopefully prove that I can be on that plane to Russia.Germany and Brazil will be a great test for us too.These are world-class teams and individual players as well."
Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis targets Swiss success as he closes in on 100th cap:::::Steven Davis met the Duke of Cambridge last week and will earn his 100th Northern Ireland cap on Thursday, but insists the World Cup play-off with Switzerland is more important than such personal landmarks.Southampton midfielder Davis, 32, will become just the third Northern Irish centurion, following in the footsteps of Pat Jennings and Aaron Hughes when he leads Michael O'Neill's team out at Windsor Park in the first leg against the Swiss.It is another significant milestone for a player who recently received his MBE at Buckingham Palace, but Davis, one of his country's most understated figures, would rather his 100th cap slid under the radar."In all honesty I'm not counting caps," he said."I don't want anything to distract from my or the team's preparations for the game.That will be at the very back of my mind."It's a huge landmark and I'm delighted to reach it, but my focus is solely on the game and hopefully after the play-offs I can look back and say it was a special achievement."It's not my personality to be sentimental.It's more a nice feeling for my family at the game.They can enjoy it more, but your focus automatically is on the game and you are in the zone at that point."As part of O'Neill's meticulous preparations, Davis and his international colleagues have been given pamphlets of information on their Swiss opponents since meeting up in Belfast.Yet his skipper had already been made somewhat aware of the size of the task by a member of the Royal Family."It was great meeting Prince William and a great experience," Davis revealed."It's something you are not used to, but it was great to be in the room with other great people receiving their awards.They have done very well in their own fields, whether it is police, military, ambulance or professors, and it was nice to experience that with my family."It was a special day for my family and Prince William was very knowledgeable on the game.He talked about the play-offs, knew we were playing the Swiss and said it would be very difficult, but he wished us all the best.It was a memorable day."Davis, who led his country at Euro 2016, their first major tournament in three decades, was there for his services to football and admitted he was moved by speaking to others being honoured in various fields."It is very humbling to be there and recognise what people have achieved in their lives," he added."I got an award for doing something that I have loved and it's not something I ever expected, but I'm very proud of.I'll probably keep in touch with a few of the award winners."There was a guy from Glasgow who had lost his son and then went on a campaign to raise money for a teenage cancer fund, it was nice to share that experience."
Wall charts to the World Cup - Liverpool's Joe Gomez targets England place to crown rapid rise:::::Joe Gomez was putting up wall charts in his parents' house at the last World Cup - now the defender is pressing his case to be involved on the biggest stage with England.The 20-year-old was one of several surprise call-ups to an experimental senior squad, with Liverpool team-mates Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Daniel Sturridge among the names conspicuous by their absence.A lack of game time cost the duo their place, whereas Gomez's run under Jurgen Klopp means he in line to make his senior debut in the upcoming friendlies against Germany and Brazil.Both opponents offer quite the baptism of fire for a level-headed player who has come a long way since England bombed out of the World Cup in 2014."It was probably towards the back end of 2014 when I signed a deal at Charlton," the defender from south east London said."Even though I'm young, it was a while back.It seems a while ago."Obviously I watched the games at my mum and dad's house in Catford."I remember getting the timetables from magazines - either Match of the Day or Match Attax, and just tuning in and keeping up to date."It would have taken a lot to convince me that would be a reality (to go this time)."Obviously I would grab the chance if it was put in front of me.It does seem like quite a journey.It's had its ups and downs."I had a season when I was injured and it took a lot to stay strong through that."But this is the sort of thing that was my motivation to get the opportunity to play for England at senior level and I'm just happy to have the opportunity to play."Gomez swapped Charlton for Liverpool in 2015, with his bright start to life at Anfield brought to a shuddering halt by an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered when playing for England Under-21s that October.It led to a 15-month lay-off that ended his 2015-16 campaign and meant he made just three appearances last term.Gomez has returned strongly this season and Southgate - the Under-21s manager when he was injured - intends to try the defender in a three-man back line, despite him being utilised as a full-back by Klopp this season."Ideally I want to end up as a centre-back," he said."That's where I think I can progress the most and develop to be the best I can be."But I enjoy playing at full-back and it's helped me with my development to this point."For me being a young player getting regular games, regardless of the position, I'm just happy to be able to learn.But I do see myself moving inside towards centre-half and hopefully playing most of my career there."Asked if that was Klopp's view too, Gomez said: "Yes, I believe so.I think with injuries opportunities have come to play at full-back."But while I'm here I will just focus on wherever the manager wants me to play.I'm happy to play wherever, whether it's full back of centre half.I will adapt to whatever he wants and I'm happy to do so."And Gomez is happy to have kept the faith in his ability and not left Liverpool on loan in the summer."At the time my main aim was to attack the off-season and to be in the best possible shape for pre-season," he said."I saw it as a fresh start, a blank page to progress again.It was in the back of my mind that I could potentially go out on loan if I didn't see things going the way I wanted them to go."But the manager gave me the belief that I could work my way into the team."I'm thankful that it feels like the right decision to stay and work for my place."I was aware that I could go out on loan because I went a year without regular football, but thankfully I got that at my club."

Andy Murray confident of successful comeback from hip injury:::::Andy Murray believes he will get back to his best after targeting a new year comeback from a hip injury.However, the 30-year-old will not rush his body and admitted there was always a doubt following an injury.The two-time Wimbledon champion has not played competitively since labouring his way through this year's tournament at SW19 and limping out at the quarter-final stage to Sam Querrey.However, the Scot hopes to be fit for the season kick-off with an appearance at the Brisbane International, which starts on December 31.And he intends to get back to challenging for major honours, although he conceded the Australian Open might be an ambitious quest.Ahead of an exhibition match against Roger Federer at his Andy Murray Live charity event in Glasgow, he was asked whether he could get back to 100 per cent fitness.Murray said: "You never know when you're coming back from any injury, but that's what I'm working towards, for sure.We have to see, but I believe that will be the case."When I get back on the court next year and start playing again, it might not come immediately at the beginning of the year."I have been hitting the ball very well in practice - it's just that there is a difference between that 75-80 per cent practice and going flat out at 100 per cent for two and a half or three hours on the match court.Until I do that I can't say for certain, but I think I'll be able to come back just fine."Murray plans on getting to Australia early to acclimatise in a bid to offset his lack of sharpness, but he will not feel compelled to play if he is not totally fit."Things have been going pretty well so far in the rehab, but you just never know," said Murray, whose medical team chose rest and recovery instead of surgery."I've been training for a few weeks now.Some days I've felt great and some days not so good."But I will come back when I'm ready and when I'm 100 per cent fit.I probably made a bit of a mistake trying to get ready for the US Open but it was the last major of the year and I wanted to give it a go."And now it's time to give my body the rest and recovery it needs.I'll come back when I'm ready."Federer had reinforced that message moments earlier.The 36-year-old had a similar lay-off last year after struggling with knee problems and came back rejuvenated, winning his first Grand Slam event for five years at Wimbledon and following it up with a US Open triumph.He told Murray: "Take your time, however long it takes.When you come back you want to be at 100 per cent, otherwise the problem is you feel you just can't beat the best at the big tournaments, so it's wise and worthwhile to take the extra week, extra month maybe."I'm sure Andy is going to have a lot of years left, so he shouldn't hurry, but as a professional athlete you always want to come back as quick as possible."You need to have goals but sometimes they need to be postponed."
Patrick Roberts credits Brendan Rodgers for instilling winning mentality at Celtic after side set new domestic record:::::Patrick Roberts has credited Brendan Rodgers with changing the mentality of the Celtic squad after setting a new domestic record at the weekend.Rodgers has yet to lose a domestic match since taking charge of the Parkhead club last year, and with last week's win over St Johnstone, broke a 100-year-old British record by going 63 games unbeaten.Roberts, who re-signed for the Hoops after developing into an important player on an 18-month loan prior to this season, says the former Liverpool boss has been hugely important in the run."Our willingness to win every game and to not lose has probably got us this far," he said."And the manager is instilling that in us from the get-go."From last season and this we've had the same mentality and focus all year round, and that in itself is why we've been so successful."The 20-year-old winger, who expects to be fit to return after the international break following a niggle, believes his Celtic manager has similarities to Pep Guardiola, who is in charge of parent club Manchester City.He said: "In the Premier League, Guardiola is playing the football he's played at Barcelona and Bayern Munich."The gaffer here is similar, he tries to play football at every opportunity, even when we're under pressure, and he's instilled that in every player."We're always getting better at it and you see in the Bayern game we controlled the game at times and that's down to the manager."
Jonny May and Elliot Daly defy expectation to be in contention for England's autumn series opener:::::Jonny May and Elliot Daly have defied expectations to be in contention for England's autumn series opener against Argentina on Saturday.The wings were expected to miss the Twickenham showdown after sustaining injuries but have been included in a 26-man squad that will be trimmed to a matchday 23 on Thursday morning.May suffered a minor hamstring injury during training in Portugal last week and was expected to miss out against the Pumas, but his recovery has progressed well and he could be involved.Daly damaged knee ligaments on Champions Cup duty for Wasps last month and after being ruled out of the Tests against Argentina and Australia, he is now poised to start on the wing.Anthony Watson is set to start on the other wing, Mike Brown completing the back three, with May offering bench cover unless he is ruled out, in which case Semesa Rokoduguni is present to step in.
Scotland captain John Barclay admits concern over head injury sustained in late September:::::Scotland captain John Barclay admits he had concerns over the nature of his head injury after six weeks out.The back row forward was knocked out in late September by his international colleague Magnus Bradbury in a game against Edinburgh, and has only just made his comeback.The 31-year-old, who is set to captain his country in the upcoming autumn tests in the absence of Greg Laidlaw, played more than an hour for the Scarlets as they beat Benetton at the weekend after he was finally given the all-clear to return to action.However he admitted his prolonged absence left him anxious ahead of his return, but was relieved to come through unscathed."I was a little rusty, which was a confidence thing as well (as physical)," he said."Before the game I was a little anxious just because of the nature of having a concussion and having symptoms for as long as I did."It gave me peace of mind that everything is fine and that was great for me as an individual."He added: "It was a really tricky few weeks.I was out for six weeks and had never had head knocks before."I wouldn't say I was prone to them, I've had my fair share as a professional rugby player but it just dragged on a little bit and took time, which was frustrating because there was no golden rule (for recovery), it just takes as long as it takes."I had some symptoms and had to just wait and bide my time for them to go away."I was running out of time, which was playing on my mind a little bit."It wasn't ideal over the last six weeks, but I was lucky I got 60-odd minutes for Scarlets last weekend and got a game under my belt, and I felt quite good and well rested - obviously a little bit rusty - but I was thankful to get a little run out before the weekend."If selected, Barclay will lead Gregor Townsend's side out at Murrayfield on Saturday against Samoa before matches against New Zealand and Australia and is raring to go on home turf after a mixed summer, which saw wins over Australia and Italy but defeat to Fiji."We had a pretty tough summer," he said."(Starting) with Samoa, it will be a tough few weeks starting this weekend but we're lucky the ticket sales have been amazing."It will almost be sold out for Samoa which I don't think has been done before, so that's exciting and we have an exciting group of players."
'We're always great as underdogs' - Northern Ireland's Jamie Ward says pressure is on Switzerland in World Cup play-off:::::Jamie Ward has cranked up the pressure on Switzerland by telling them Northern Ireland will thrive as the underdogs in their World Cup play-off.The Northern Irish missed out on being seeded for the draw last month by virtue of their world ranking, so knew they would face either the Swiss, Italy, Croatia or Denmark over two legs to determine their Russia fate.Nottingham Forest forward Ward, back in Michael O'Neill's fold for the first time since March having overcome a calf problem, had no qualms with that and has told Switzerland they have to handle the expectation.Vladimir Petkovic's team arrived in Belfast on Tuesday ahead of Thursday's first leg, and Ward said: "They've got to take their chances.Everyone is expecting them to win in the football world."They're obviously the seeded team, so the pressure's more on them than us."We're always great as the underdogs, so I think it was a bit of a bonus us not being seeded."If you're seeded, you get a little more pressure on yourself so we'll go into this game as underdogs again.Hopefully we can be worthy winners."We'd love something heading over there.I think we're strong at home and you've seen that over the last few years."If we play the way we can play, I don't see why we can't take a lead out there or at least a positive result."Should O'Neill's team find a way past the Swiss, they would end a 32-year exile from the World Cup finals and become the first Northern Irish side in history to make back-to-back major tournaments.With Wales and Scotland already out of the running, and the Republic of Ireland involved in their own play-off, Ward feels the Northern Irish are still not getting the recognition they warrant."I think people see it as it's Northern Ireland and they've not done well for a long time, but on the other side they will go and buy players from the Republic squad," he added."Premier League clubs are happy to do that.We're just as good as them, but it's obviously someone taking a risk or a chance on us and letting us prove we're worth playing at the next level."
Burnley midfielder Jack Cork called into England squad following withdrawal of Jordan Henderson:::::Burnley midfielder Jack Cork has been called up to the England squad for the first time.The 28-year-old has been drafted in by manager Gareth Southgate for the upcoming friendlies against Germany and Brazil.Southgate has turned to the former Swansea and Southampton man after Raheem Sterling, Fabian Delph and Jordan Henderson became the latest withdrawals from his injury-hit squad.The Football Association said in a statement on Tuesday night: "The arrival of Cork means Gareth Southgate will continue his preparations at St. George's Park with a 22-man squad."Henderson had been due to arrive at St George's Park later in the week after missing Liverpool's win against West Ham with a thigh problem.City winger Sterling is out with a back complaint and Delph - looking for his first England cap since November 2015 - injured his calf towards the end of Sunday's win against Arsenal.Alli, Kane and Winks have already pulled out with injury issues of their own, with Southgate bringing in Michael Keane and Jake Livermore in reaction to those absences.The only boost on the injury front has come in the shape of Chelsea defender Gary Cahill.The 31-year-old was assessed by his club's medical team after Sunday's 1-0 defeat of Manchester United and will take his place among Southgate's 21-man group for training this afternoon.This is hardly the ideal scenario to be facing two of the world's best sides, especially as England already approached this international break without several key players.Adam Lallana - England's reigning player of the year - continues to be sidelined, where he is joined by the likes of Danny Welbeck, Nathaniel Chalobah, Tom Heaton and Ross Barkley.Southgate had plumped for a bold squad for the last matches of 2017, with Tammy Abraham, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Joe Gomez called up for the first time as Daniel Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chris Smalling were overlooked.Jermain Defoe, Aaron Cresswell, Fraser Forster and Livermore were others from the previous squad to not be involved in the initial 25-man group, although the latter was subsequently called up on Monday.
Roger Federer played a game in a kilt in Scotland (VIDEO):::::Roger Federer, the man who might become the first-ever person to defeat Father Time, played an exhibition match vs. Andy Murray in Glasgow, Scotland on Tuesday.Both players had good reason to be in a jovial mood; Federer won two majors on the year, and the match was Murray's first public outing since he suffered a hip injury at Wimbledon.After taking the first set 6-3, Federer was interviewed and said that if someone brought him a kilt, he'd wear it.A woman in the crowd delivered, and Federer held up his end of the bargain.Here's the maestro hitting a backhand in the traditional Scottish garb.Murray would come back to win the second set 6-3, which set up a decisive 10-point tiebreaker.Midway through the breaker, Federer presented Murray with a tartan hat that had some gnarly fake hair attached.In keeping with the light hearted atmosphere, Murray put it on."Now your turn" Federer gave Murray a hat to wear.#AndyMurrayLive pic.twitter.com/4wWPFCaa1n Ashish TV (@Ashish__TV) November 7, 2017 Federer ended up taking the tiebreak 10-6 to win the exhibition.No word on whether the hat impeded Murray's play.The only thing that could have made this whole thing more Scottish is if Federer celebrated his victory with a bagpipe solo.
Roy Halladay, modern Stoic and Cy Young winner, dies at 40:::::I never heard Roy Halladay raise his voice, never saw him lose even a sliver of his perpetual cool, never once saw doubt or fear in his eyes.His father, Roy Sr., once told me his son grew up in the same earnest manner that we saw from him in the major leagues.He reminds me of a golden retriever, the father said.I once wrote he was the modern Stoic, a Marcus Aurelius on the mound.Confine yourself to the present, Aurelius said, and that was Halladay, especially when it came to his craft.He devoted himself totally to the next pitch, damn the money, fame and statistics.So humble was Halladay that he would hand over his pay stub to his wife, Brandy, without ever looking at it.Were probably the only people in the business who think baseball players are paid too much money, she once told me.He feels like his job is to do his best every day, and the fact that hes making so much money is hard on him.Just by being himself, Halladay somehow became the best pitcher in baseball with a dearth of attention.When I once asked him about such a rare achievement in this noisy world of sports, he replied, Its definitely by choice.For me the satisfaction is always the competition, and the self-gratification knowing you did something to the best of your ability and I think thats all it will ever be for me.Its not ever going to be who knows me and what do they think about me.Its ultimately going to come down to how I went about doing my job.Never before or since have I seen ferocity of greatness combined with such humility.Halladay was the genuine article: a gentle, charitable soul with the most aggressive, attacking pitching style you could ever find.To use the past tense to describe him is painful.Roy Halladay is gone.Just 40 years old.Father, husband, son, friend, coach, volunteer, humanitarianeverything you wish for when a boy becomes a man is what Roy became.He died Tuesday doing what he loved: flying his own airplane.He was an experienced pilot.His Icon A5, a state of the art amphibious aircraft worth about $200,000, barely two months old, crashed into the Gulf of Mexico near his Florida home.Flying was in his blood.Roys dad was a commercial pilot.Roy learned how to fly way back when he was in high school in Colorado and earned his license after his playing career.Hes a good pilot, his father once told me, proud that Roy brought to the cockpit that same sense of calm and self-assuredness he took everywhere.When Roy Sr. went shopping for a new home in Colorado when his son was a boy, he had one requirement: the basement would have to be at least 60 feet, six inches long.They found one.The father built a batting cage in that basement, hung a tire with a mattress behind it, and the boy would practice humming fastballs through the target.When the father tucked him in at night, and before he would turn out the light, the father and son would talkalmost always about baseball.Can you imagine, the father would say, what it would be like to be in the major leagues?Can you tell me what that would feel like?And the boy would imagine it.Getty Images On other nights, the father would ask him what it would be like to pitch in Yankee Stadium, or in the World Series.It all came true, except for the World Series part.The first time Roy pitched in the postseason, in 2010 with the Philadelphia Phillies, he no-hit the Cincinnati Reds.At his peak, nobody was better.So driven was Halladay that he had one goal every year: to finish with fewer walks than games started.He actually did it three times (2003, 2005, 2010), including twice while striking out more than 200 batters.Halladay and Cy Young are the only pitchers ever to combine precision and power quite like that.His story is unique.Halladay pitched to a 10.64 ERA in 2000, and was so bad he was demoted all the way to Class A ball to re-learn how to throw a baseball.With the help of Toronto minor league pitching coach Mel Queenand a book Brandy bought him about the mental side of pitching, by Harvey DorfmanHalladay changed from an overhand four-seam fastball/curveball pitcher to a three-quarters sinker/cutter menace.Over the next 11 seasons, and until his arm gave out at age 36, Halladay was 175-78 with a 2.98 ERA.In that span nobody had a better winning percentage (.692), nobody threw more shutouts (19) and nobody came close to throwing so many complete games (64).Halladay changed pitching.His boring cutters and sinkerstwo pitches that appeared the same to the hitter, except one would break late to the left and one to the rightbecame a new template.Many pitchers copied his style.Nobody was as expert at it as Halladay.Halladay deserves to go into the Hall of Fame immediately.That may surprise some people.He was that goodthe accepted best pitcher in the game for an extended run.But it surprises people because Halladay never sold himself, never wanted the trappings that would have raised his profile.I think thats where he finds a lot of his happiness, his father once told me.To stand up and do what hes been asked to do.Hes expected to perform well and he expects to be there and earn his money and give them what they pay for.Ive always been proud of him.Hes a delightful young man to hang around with.Hard work served him well, fueling his mind and soul as much as his body.He would leave for spring training workouts at 5 a.m.that is, until somebody else beat him to the Phillies complex one day, so he moved up his commute time to 4:45 in the morning.I got to know him well in 2005, when I suited up and played for the Toronto Blue Jays for one week of spring training for an SI story.He said very little, and when he spoke he did so in soft, measured tones, and yet everybody in the complex, from teammates to trainers to clubbies, revered him.The pitching coach, Brad Arnsberg, called him T.P.: Total Package.Ill never forget stepping into the batting cage to face him.The baseball seemed so heavy and moved so fast I had the impression that he could actually throw it through a brick wall.The boring action was that powerful.The baseball was loud as it passed by me, the seams spinning so fast they whistled as they cut through the air.He made the baseball angrier than anybody else could.A few years later, during another spring training, this time in Clearwater with the Phillies, Roy sat down with me at a bench near the Phillies practice fields.The sun was getting low in the sky.Seeing Halladay in repose like that threw me a bit; the man did not do idle well.It was then that that I asked him what he wanted out of life, having already scored the millions of dollars and the respect of his peers.My wife and I talk about it a lot, especially with our sons, he said.I really believe if you lead a good life and always try to do the right things I think youre always impacting someone.Thats what weve tried to instill in our kids.For us its more important to try to be a good person, all around, especially with other people.Our kids go to Christian schools and things, we still have those beliefs but for us its really been about were going to try to live as quality a life as we can.And hope our kids can do the same and try to be good influences.Halladay made good on a life too brief.He went up in that plane, no doubt filled with the joy he always took from flying.He left behind a beautiful family and a beautiful legacy, and for those that knew him, that legacy is more about the man he was, less about the pitcher he became.And in that last moment, when a life in full ended too soon, the words of Marcus Aurelius from The Meditations never befit him better: And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last.

The best moments of Roy Halladay's incredible career:::::Roy Halladay died tragically on Tuesday after his plane crashed in the Gulf of Mexico, just off Florida's western coast.He was 40 years old.The eight-time All-Star and two-time Cy Young award winner was one of the most dominant pitchers of his era, but he'll be equally remembered as a universally admired professional around the game.He was, by all accounts, a man who attacked his craft with the utmost dedication.In honor of the great who has left us far too soon, here are five of the best moments from Halladay's storied career.September 6, 2003: The 10-inning, 98-pitch, two-hour shutout In an era when teams became increasingly cautious with pitch counts and games trended longer and longer, Halladay distinguished himself with an anachronistic propensity to pitch late into games, and to do so quickly.Halladay threw a complete game 67 times, more than any pitcher over the past two decades, but he only once threw an extra-inning shutout.On this September afternoon, Halladay shut out the Tigers and allowed just three hits over 10 innings before Bobby Kielty gave Halladay the much-deserved win with a walk-off base hit in the bottom of the tenth.Perhaps most impressively, Halladay threw just 98 pitches over the ten innings, and the official game time was a remarkably brisk 2:03.Halladay hadn't reached his peak yet, but this was one of the most Halladay-ian performance of his career.September 27, 1998: 21-year-old dominates in second-career start Halladay was a first-round pick in the 1995 draft, but his path to stardom was not without its detours.After a strong start to his career, Halladay's struggles prompted the Blue Jays to send him to Class A Dunedin in the spring of 2001.The organization, however, maintained a steadfast belief in Halladay that was richly rewarded, and nights like this made maintaining that belief easier.Making just his second career start, Halladay no-hit the Tigers for 8 2/3 innings at the SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) before allowing a pinch-hit solo home run Bobby Higginson.It was the only hit Halladay gave up that night, as he got the final out to seal a 2-1 victory.He struck out eight and flashed his Cy Young potential.September 27, 2010: Halladay pitches himself into the playoffs, finally Sometimes in sports, a player's individual greatness is an unfortunate mismatch with the futility of his team.Such was the case with Roy Halladay; the Blue Jays went 20 years between playoff appearances from 1994 until 2014, and Halladay's career fell smack in the middle of the drought.Halladay was finally traded to a contender after the 2009 season, when the Blue Jays traded him to the Phillies for Travis d'Arnaud, Kyle Drabek and Michael Taylor.With six games left in his first season with the Phillies, Halladay took the mound with an opportunity to clinch the NL East and his first-career playoff berth.In typical Halladay fashion, he pitched a complete-game shutout and allowed just two hits to beat the Nationals 8-0 and clinch the division.The performance doubled as his last start in his second Cy Young season.May 29, 2010: Perfection Cy Young's, leading the league in strikeouts, 20-win seasonsthese are all fantastic, but nothing punctuates a pitcher's resume quite like a perfect game.On a balmy May night in Miami, in the beginning stages of a Cy Young season, Halladay earned his timeless capsule of perfection.Halladay needed 115 pitches to secure his first and only perfect game, which came in a 1-0 win over the Marlins."Early in my bullpen I was hitting spots more than I have been," Halladay said after the game."I felt like I just carried that out there."October 6, 2010: The postseason no-hitter Since 1876, there have been 296 no-hitters, which averages out to roughly two per year.There have been two postseason-no hitters in the history of baseball.One was a perfect game thrown by Don Larsen in the 1956 World Series, the other being Halladay's no-no in the 2010 NLDS.In his first-ever postseason start, Halladay no-hit the Reds in a 4-0 victory in Game 1 of the Division Series, striking out eight and walking just one on 104 pitches.The Phillies would go on to lose to the Giants in the NLCS in six games, but Halladay's performance in front of an electric Philadelphia crowd is one that will never be forgotten.Like the man himself.
Warriors-Cavs: Draymond Green explains 'mood' Instagram:::::While memes usually have the power to do all the talking, Golden State's Draymond Green decided to offer a little more explanation to his "Mood" Instagram that he posted Tuesday.In a series of tweets posted two and a half hours after the initial Instagram, Green said that "FYI people should really stop making assumptions...I'm still trying to figure out how y'all made Bron post out to be about the Celtics...I just thought the pic was dope and that was my mood today...I'm always the first to say when I'm going at someone... and always will."Confused already?Let's break it down, because as with all Twitter/Instagram "feuds," there's a little back-and-forth, he said-she said nonsense to follow.On Monday night, LeBron James posted an Instagram with the caption "Mood" depicting an image of fist from the TV show Arthur, that is usually meant to show frustration.Mood... A post shared by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Nov 6, 2017 at 7:07pm PST LeBron tends to use cryptic memes and online posts to send messages, but not typically this early in the season.However, a 4-6 start seems like an appropriate time to start the memes.People were also assuming the anger had to do with the Celtics beating the Hawks since LeBron posted shortly after former teammate Kyrie Irving scored 35 to get Boston's ninth win of the season.Some time went by and nothing happened, until Green posted an Instagram of his own Tuesday afternoon with the same caption as LeBron.MOOD... A post shared by Draymond Green (@money23green) on Nov 7, 2017 at 11:54am PST A little later, LeBron posted another Instagram of the Arthur meme, but with four pictures of him holding his fist like the meme.The caption said "Mood Forever" along with a crown emoji and the #striveforgreatness.Mood Forever.... #StriveForGreatness A post shared by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Nov 7, 2017 at 1:46pm PST And then that's when we got Green's Twitter explanation.Let alone me posting something to "troll" him and idk wth he even posted about... neither do y'all... Draymond Green (@Money23Green) November 7, 2017 I just thought the pic was dope and that was my mood today...I'm always the first to say when I'm going at someone... and always will Draymond Green (@Money23Green) November 7, 2017 So today my good people y'all shot and y'all missed!!!Draymond Green (@Money23Green) November 7, 2017 Whew, got all that?I guess memes can't explain everything after all.
Zoo with Roy: Remembering the late Roy Halladay:::::In the winter of 2010, a still-anonymous Phillies fan started a blog with a simple mission.The goal of this blog, in the most simple terms, is to convince Roy Halladay to go to the zoo with me, the inaugural post read.And so the blog was named I Want to Go to the Zoo With Roy Halladay.ZWR, as it became known, gained a steady following and its author eventually parlayed the success into a weekly guest column in the Philadelphia Inquirer.But after nearly four years, it had yet to accomplish its original goal.That is, until one momentous day in August 2014.I'm at the zoo with Roy Halladay?!pic.twitter.com/5453vwPKvo Zoo With Roy (@zoowithroy) August 8, 2014 I highly recommend reading ZWRs recap of the day at the zoo, because it offers a wonderful look at his life beyond the field.Roy was amazing with my family, which I appreciated more than anything.He was beyond sweet with my kids, held our baby a bunch (even when he cried), and asked to pose for some pics with both of my kids to send back home to [his wife] Brandy.He truly is a good person.Halladay died on Tuesday in a plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico at the age of 40.He did plenty of good deedslike buying a K9 dog for the sheriffs department that eventually confirmed his deathso it would be irresponsible to say that one day at the zoo tells you all you need to know about him.But it comes pretty damn close.
How did Roy Halladay die? Latest on ICON A5 plane crash:::::Former Major League pitcher Roy Halladay has died after his plane crashed off Florida's Gulf Coast in Pasco County on Tuesday afternoon, the Pasco Sheriff's office announced.Here's the latest on what we know about the crash.Halladay was the lone occupant in his two-person, single-engine ICON A5 light sports aircraft.Roy Halladay next to his plane and photo of crashed plane have same tags.No confirmation on identity of person dead.pic.twitter.com/D5bfhASZC1 Justin Granit (@JustinGranit) November 7, 2017 The plane went down into the water about a quarter mile west of Ben Pilot Point in New Port Richey.No mayday calls were made to Tampa Air Traffic Control.The 911 call came in at 12:06 p.m.ET.National Transportation Safety Board investigators are scheduled to arrive at the crash scene Tuesday evening."The FAA will release the aircraft registration after local authorities release that information.The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate.The National Transportation Safety Board will determine the probable cause of the accident," FAA spokesperson Kathleen Bergen said.The specifics of the crash are still under investigation and work to recover debris from the plane will continue for the next few hours, according to the sheriff.ICON Aircraft said they were notified of the crash and are investigating the incident.This isn't the first time an ICON A5 aircraft has unexpectedly crashed.In May, the company's lead aeronautical engineer Jon Karkow, 55, and his colleague Cagri Sever, 41, were killed during a crash in Napa County, Calif. An investigation suggested the crash was attributable to pilot error.In April, an A5 aircraft partially sank into the ocean off Biscayne National Park in Miami after a landing mishap.Both the pilot and passenger escaped unhurt and did not require medical attention, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage.The aircraft, known for its forgiving flight characteristics, folding wings and appeal to recreational pilots, made its maiden flight in 2008.ICON built the wing of the A5 to remain stable even when airflow is disrupted over certain areas, which can happen when the aircraft flies too slowly or if the wings are pitched too vertically.In October, the company featured Halladay in an article about him receiving the first 2018 model of the plane."I've been dreaming about flying since I was a boy but was only able to become a pilot once I retired from baseball," Halladay said in the article."Not only is it the safest and easiest aircraft I've ever flown, it is hands-down the most fun."Halladay's father is a pilot and the former pitcher has often expressed his love for flying on social media.ICON CEO and Founder Kirk Hawkins said last month, "Roy gets it; he epitomizes the spirit of ICON.While he's an experienced pilot and flies his own turbine aircraft for A-to-B transportation, his true passion is for the adventure of sport flying, which is why he fell in love with the A5.I was even more excited to see his wife Brandy's excitement for the A5.The pure joy on her and Roy's faces talking about flying the A5 together is exactly why we started ICON."What do clouds feel like?I didnt know either until I got my new Icon A5!Im getting bruises on my arms from constantly pinching myself!pic.twitter.com/BaObEUj3Xo Roy Halladay (@RoyHalladay) October 13, 2017 Halladay was 40 years old.
Former Cy Young winner Roy Halladay, 40, killed in plane crash:::::Roy Halladay, an eight-time all-star, two-time Cy Young winner, and one of only two men to throw a postseason no-hitter, died on Tuesday in a plane crash.He was 40 years old and the sole victim of the accident off of Florida's western coast.Halladay starred for the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies from 1998 to 2013 and was widely regarded as the best pitcher in baseball in the latter half of his career.Among pitchers with at least 200 decisions, his .659 winning percentage ranks seventh all-time.At 6' 6", with a heavy, late-moving sinker and a hard cutter, he was one of the most imposing righties of his era.He didnt walk hitters much, and he didnt need to strike them out; he just mowed them down and kept on churning.In an era where even unquestioned aces could struggle to make it out of the middle innings, Halladay completed 67 of his 390 starts.That was more than any pitcher in the last two decades.From 2006 to 2011, he finished no worse than fifth in the Cy Young votingevery year.And yet despite those numbers and accolades and his draft selection No.17 overall, in 1995, out of high school in Colorado, Halladays career had once been considered a flop.In spring training in 2001, after two so-so big-league seasons, the Jays demoted him to Single-A ball.They figured he was damaged goods, unlikely ever to succeed at the big-league level; a team psychologist broke the news to him.The Jays later tasked a no-nonsense coach, Mel Queen, with berating the minors-sequestered Halladay in hopes of toughening him up.(Queen had once supposedly saved Pat Hentgens career by pushing him up against a wall.)In the teams judgment, Halladay was too eager to please, too rattled by failure.The version of Halladay that returned to the majors that July was a tougher, more methodical pitcher, with a new arm slot and a rediscovered curveball.He went 53 with a 3.16 ERA in 16 starts.The next year he was 197 and an all-star, and in 2003, at 26, he went 227 with a 3.25 ERA, winning his first Cy Young.Along the way he developed a pregame routine where, on the days of his starts, he would speak to no one, not even teammates.He told Sports Illustrated in 2010 that the minors demotion had saved his career"I vowed that if I was going to be out of baseball I would be able to look back and say I did everything to the best of my ability."Drew Hallowell/Getty Images Though Halladay excelled in Toronto, the Jays didnt.Not once did the team make the playoffs in his 12 seasons there.When, after the 2009 season, the Jays shipped him to Philadelphia for a bundle of prospects, Halladay joined a team that had won its division three years running.His first season in Philly, he won 21 games and the Cy Young.And at home against the Reds in game one of the Division Series, making his first career postseason start, Halladay threw a 104-pitch no-hitter, striking out eight and walking just one.But the Phillies lost in six in the League Championship Series to the eventual champion Giants.(Halladay went 11 dueling Tim Lincecum, his predecessor as NL Cy Young winner.)After 2010, he had one more great season with the Phillies, and two so-so ones, in which injuries and age finally got the better of him.He retired after 2013.But he had not departed baseball entirely; he served the Phillies as an instructor in spring training earlier this year and coached both his sons baseball teams.He is survived by his wife, Brandy, and his sons, Braden and Ryan.In death, he joins the wrenchingly populous fraternity of baseball players killed in plane crashes.Roberto Clemente was killed on New Years Eve in 1972 when an overloaded DC-7 he had chartered to bring aid to earthquake-ravaged Nicaragua crashed into the Atlantic.Yankees catcher Thurman Munson died in 1979 while practicing landings in his Cessna Citation.Jim Hardin, who pitched in the late 60s for Earl Weavers Orioles, crashed his Beechcraft Bonanza in Key West in 1991.Journeyman pitcher Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladays, died along with a flight instructor in 2006 when their plane was blown into a building on Manhattans Upper East Side.Onetime National League Rookie of the Year Ken Hubbs crashed his Cessna into Utah Lake during a storm in 1964.Marv Goodwin, who pitched from 1916 to 1925 and had served in the U.S. Army Air Service, died after a crash at a Houston air force base in 1925.Halladay appeared to love the Icon A5 he crashed; it was the first model year 2018 aircraft the aviation startup produced.The model had previously sparked controversy because of an onerous purchase agreement that called for buyers to waive certain legal rights against the manufacturer.And in April, two Icon employees died in an A5 crash.The National Transportation Safety Board found that pilot error was likely at fault.In 2003, the Toronto Star asked a 25-year-old Halladay, on the cusp of his first Cy Young, what vocation he would have chosen had he not wound up in baseball.He said though he couldnt do it during his baseball career because of the terms of his contract, that he would have done and would one day do what his father did: He would become a pilot.
NFL opposes Republican tax plan because of stadium funding:::::The NFL has opposed the tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans that could force teams to front more money for stadium construction, Reuters reports.According to Reuters, under the proposed bill, local governments won't be able to use tax-exempt, public-purpose bonds to fund the construction or renovation of stadiums.Those bonds are often use to fund public works projects, such as transit and schools.You can look around the country and see the economic development thats generated from some of these stadiums, NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said, according to Reuters.These sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country, so we will continue to make our opposition known on that.But many economists dispute the idea that cities and localities benefit from taxpayer-funded stadiums.President Donald Trump has taken shots at the NFL this year regarding some of its players protesting racial inequality during the national anthem.Trump has proposed ending subsidies for stadiums, as did his predecessor, Barack Obama.
Texans Sign QB Josh Johnson After Releasing Matt McGloin:::::The Texans just signed a quarterback who has not thrown a pass since 2011 while Colin Kaepernick remains a free agent.Houston signed quarterback Josh Johnson, who last appeared with the Bengals in 2013 but has not thrown a pass since 2011, after the team released Matt McGloin.McGloin was signed after star rookie Deshaun Watson suffered a season-ending knee injury during practice last week, which thrust backup Tom Savage into the starting role.Watson and Savage were the only two quarterbacks on the active roster, which forced the team to sign another signal caller.Savage was 19 for 44 for 219 yards and one touchdown as the Texans lost to the Colts 20-14 on Sunday.Johnson, 31, has thrown five touchdowns and 10 interceptions in his career.Kaepernick, for comparison, is more than a year younger than Johnson and has thrown for 72 touchdowns and 30 interceptions.There is speculation that the reason Kaepernick remains unsigned is due to his social activism.Kaepernick became a subject of controversy last season when he began not standing during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in America.The former 49ers quarterback has filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement that accuses owners of colluding to not sign him.A number of league personnel have been deposed in relation to the grievance, including Texans owner Bob McNair.McNair himself has engulfed himself in controversy recently.During a meeting among NFL players and owners to discuss the national anthem protest issue, McNair warned against having "inmates running the prison," a remark he later apologized for.The Texans, now 3-5 on the season, host the 6-2 Rams on Sunday.

Roy Halladay death: Former Blue Jays pitcher dies in plane crash:::::Former Major League pitcher Roy Halladay has died after his plane crashed off Florida's Gulf Coast in Pasco County on Tuesday, the Pasco Sheriff's Office announced.He was 40 years old.The United States Coast Guard, the Pasco Fire Department and the Pasco Sheriff's Office all responded to the scene after a call came in after noon.The sheriff's office could not confirm the flight path or if there was one.The tail number of the ICON A5 light sports aircraft matched the number belonging to the former Blue Jays and Phillies ace.Halladay pitched 16 years in the majors from 1998 to 2013.He won two Cy Young Awards and finished his career with a 203105 record and 3.38 ERA in 416 career games.He pitched 67 complete games and 20 shutouts.In 2013, he signed a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Blue Jays, where he played the first 12 years of his career.He was a six-time All-Star with Toronto.Halladay was traded to the Phillies before the 2010 season.He threw a perfect game against the Marlins in the regular season and then tossed the second post-season no-hitter in major league history in the first postseason appearance of his career.He never pitched in the World Series but posted a postseason ERA of 2.35 in five playoff starts.Halladay often posted on social media about being an avid pilot.He started flying after he retired from baseball.MLB players mourn the sudden death of Cy Young winner Roy Halladay I have dreamed about owning a A5 since I retired!Real life is better then my dreams!!Thx Kirk & everyone @ICONAircraft pic.twitter.com/wkk6TtjAY4 Roy Halladay (@RoyHalladay) October 13, 2017 I keep telling my dad flying the Icon A5 low over the water is like flying a fighter jet!His response.....I am flying a fighter jet!!pic.twitter.com/30eVjz9eS6 Roy Halladay (@RoyHalladay) October 31, 2017 Cant begin to explain all the breathtaking views I have seen thru the open windows of demos & now my very own Icon A5!Thx to all at Icon!pic.twitter.com/BZsXqcHFmt Roy Halladay (@RoyHalladay) October 13, 2017 What do clouds feel like?I didnt know either until I got my new Icon A5!Im getting bruises on my arms from constantly pinching myself!pic.twitter.com/BaObEUj3Xo Roy Halladay (@RoyHalladay) October 13, 2017 Halladay is eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2019.Halladay is survived by his wife, Brandy, and two children."We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay's untimely death.There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game," the Phillies said in a statement."It is with the heaviest of hearts that we pass along our condolences to Brandy, Ryan and Braden."The Blue Jays issued the following statement: "The Toronto Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise's greatest and most respected players, but even better human being.It is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends."
NASL's appeal vs US Soccer ruling: What league is hoping to prove:::::The survivability of the NASL hangs in the balance of a court familiar to many American sports fans: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.This is the same federal appeals court that ruled against New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.Its also the same court that will hear arguments brought by Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott in his case against the NFL.For NASL and the U.S. Soccer Federation, the Second Circuit is critical for a different case.NASL has petitioned it to review whether U.S. District Court Judge Margo Brodie wrongly denied NASLs petition for a preliminary injunction.Brady, Elliott and the NASL share something else in common: they have placed their trust in the same attorney, Jeffrey Kessler.In advocating for NASL, Kessler insists that U.S. Soccer and its alleged co-conspirators (Major League Soccer, Soccer United Marketing and United Soccer League) have violated federal antitrust law.They have done so, Kessler charges, by blocking NASL from competing with MLS as a so-called Division I or top-level pro soccer league and by attempting to push NASL out of Division II so that Division II can be occupied alone by USL.Put more bluntly, Kessler maintains that U.S. Soccer has unlawfully sought to destroy NASL.Absent judicial intervention, it is quite possible that NASL will go out of business.To delay such an adverse consequence, NASL wants a federal court to enjoin (block) U.S. Soccer from reclassifying NASL during the duration of this litigation.The litigation could last years, meaning an injunction would be a game-changer for NASL.Injunctions are very difficult to obtain and petitions for them are often denied.NASL had to convince Judge Brodie of four elements: (1) it would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction; (2) it has a likelihood of success on the merits of the legal arguments; (3) the balance of hardships tips in NASLs favor; and (4) an injunction for NASL would be in the publics interest.As SI's Brian Straus explained, Judge Brodie found three of those elements to be in place.In fact, Judge Brodie expressly agreed with NASLs assertion that the league faces a likely total loss of its business in the absence of an injunction.She also highlighted how NASL stands to lose interest from prospective investors who are exploring the possibility of bidding for as many as six potential new NASL teams in 2018.Unfortunately for NASL, Judge Brodie found one elementlikelihood of success on the meritsmissing.Stated differently, while Judge Brodie was convinced that NASL is harmed by U.S. Soccers actions, she wasnt convinced that U.S. Soccer is breaking the law in inflicting such harm.To that end, Judge Brodie wrote that NASL fails to demonstrate unreasonable restraint of trade.The judge took notice of how U.S. Soccers standards for classifying professional soccer leagues are arguably designed to promote quality of professional soccer in the U.S. and Canada.Further, Judge Brodie stressed that U.S. Soccers Board of Directors are required to act in the best interest of their accompanying non-profit, membership organizationU.S.Soccerrather than any pro soccer league.[M]embers of the Board, Judge Brodie asserted, may not blindly benefit MLS to the detriment of NASL or other professional leagues.Judge Brodie also appeared swayed by how certain business restrictions imposed by U.S. Soccer can advance the quality of soccereven though, NASL charges, such restrictions might put NASL out of business and even though MLS and USL have periodically received exemptions from complying with those same restrictions.For instance, U.S. Soccer stipulates that membership in Division I is contingent upon, among other things, featuring a minimum number of teams as well as a group of teams that play in three different time zones and in stadia with at least 15,000 seating capacity.These restrictions, U.S. Soccer contends, are critical for the success of pro soccer.If there are too few teams, for example, there will be repetitive matchups and fans will be inclined to tune out.National broadcasters also prefer that teams be dispersed across time zones and placed in larger markets.NASL insists, correctly, that U.S. Soccer has it has not always held MLS to these restrictions.U.S. Soccer responds by noting that MLS requested different types of restriction waivers than those sought by NASL.As to USLs compliance with other restrictions, U.S. Soccer emphasizes that the Division II league showed improvement in attempting to comply with restrictions whereas, from U.S. Soccers view, NASL did not.Breaking down the appeal Kessler hopes a yet-to-be-named panel of three judges on the Second Circuit construes the law differently than Judge Brodie.The judges will review the key legal issues de novo, meaning as new and without an obligation to defer to Judge Brodie.This non-deferential standard of review helps Kessler and NASL, although it by no means assures victory.In fact, Judge Brodie is seldom reversed on appeal.According to Westlaws Judicial Reversal Report, 23 of Judge Brodies rulings have been appealed to the Second Circuit and only four of them were remanded or vacated; 19 (83%) were upheld.U.S. Soccer likely gains confidence from such data.Kessler charges that Judge Brodie made fundamental legal errors.First, he contends that Judge Brodie applied a far too scrutinizing standard in assessing whether NASL has a likelihood of success on the merits.Judge Brodie treated the motion for a preliminary injunction as one for a mandatory injunction.The latter seeks to alter the status quo and requires a more conclusive showing than an ordinary preliminary injunction.In her opinion, Judge Brodie noted that U.S. Soccer has rejected a request by NASL, which currently holds Division II sanctioning, to play under that distinction for the 2018 season.From that logic, the judge reasons, an injunction would alter the status quo, as NASL has already been rejected.Kessler ardently disagrees, stressing that NASL only wants to preserve the status quo and remain a Division II league.As a result, how the Second Circuit interprets status quo will play a pivotal role in NASLs appeal.Kessler also insists that Judge Brodie failed to properly infer wrongful behavior by U.S. Soccers Board of Directors, which Kessler portrays as inherently conflicted.He does so by stressing ties between the boards members and MLS.NASLs petition is for expedited hearings to hear what it regards as an emergency motion.In the coming days, the Second Circuit will likely indicate a schedule for the appeal.In the meantime, the league's championship match, between the San Francisco Deltas and New York Cosmos, is set for Sunday.If NASL has its way, it won't be the last one.Michael McCann is SIs legal analyst.He is also an attorney and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at the University of New Hampshire School of Law, and co-author with Ed O'Bannon of the forthcoming book Court Justice: The Inside Story of My Battle Against the NCAA and My Life in Basketball.
LiAngelo Ball among 3 UCLA players reportedly arrested in China:::::LiAngelo Ball was one of three UCLA players who were arrested in China for shoplifting, Jeff Goodman of ESPN.com reports.Along with Ball, fellow freshmen Cody Riley and Jalen Hill were also arrested and being questioned about stealing from a Louis Vuitton store, according to Goodman.The Bruins are in China for their season opener against Georgia Tech, which will be played Friday in Shanghai."We are aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China," UCLA said in a statement according to ESPN."The University is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time."Goodman reports that around 20 police officers came to the Hyatt Regency Hangzhou around 8 a.m. local time Tuesday to speak with Georgia Tech and UCLA players.He adds that players from both teams were kept in a room for hours and not allowed to talk with their coaches.According to Goodman, Ball, Hill and Riley were seen getting into a police vehicle around 1 p.m. local time.Additionally, Goodman reports that LaVar Ball previously told ESPN he would be traveling to China for the game, but neither LaVar or UCLA coach Steve Alford has returned Goodman's calls or texts.Ken Sugiura of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported police inspected the UCLA team bus as players were waiting to go to practice and searched the cargo department.After the search, the players were taken off the bus and returned to the Hyatt Regency Hangzhou where both teams were staying, according to the AJC.Sophomore Justin Moore and freshmen Jose Alvarado and Jon Brown were the Georgia Tech players also questioned by police, but it was determined they were not involved in the activities being investigated, according to a statement from Georgia Tech obtained by the AJC.

Everton owner claims Diego Simeone is his top manager target:::::Everton owner Farhad Moshiri has said that Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone is his No.1 target to become the new manager at Goodison Park, and Liverpool fans can't get enough of the high expectations set by the owner.Everton's majority shareholder Moshiri is being very ambitious in thinking that Simeone would take the job, although the Red half of Liverpool believe that the Argentinian would never leave Madrid midway through the season, according to TalkSport.More likely candidates for the Everton job include Watford boss Marco Silva, former England manager Sam Allardyce, and current caretaker manager David Unsworth.However, that hasn't stopped Moshiri setting his hopes high.These high hopes have caused Liverpool fans to voice their opinions on the matter, taking to Twitter to poke fun at the prospect of Simeone joining the Toffees.When you read that Everton want Diego Simeone to be their next manager pic.twitter.com/hR90hNI82J fivetimesclub (@fivetimesclub) November 7, 2017 Everton are "targeting" Diego Simeone as their next manager, in the same way that I'm "targeting" Rihanna as my next girlfriend.Behave.The Gaffer Tapes (@TheGafferTapes) November 7, 2017 Simeone is one of the most respected manager in the sport, and his style of football along with his animated personality on the touchline has allowed Atletico Madrid to compete in La Liga and Europe with the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus among others.The fact that Simeone is acknowledged as one of the best managers in world football has also caused some commotion amongst Everton fans on Twitter, with one fan making a very bold and brave promise to his followers if Simeone does indeed join Everton in the near future.If Diego Simeone becomes the new Everton manager I will get a tattoo of him naked in the same pose as Kate Winslet in Titanic #EFC Big Blue Sam (@CJD1878) November 7, 2017 Football fans would be intrigued to see a new and exciting Everton should the Argentine move away from La Liga in favour of the Toffees, but that fan would surely regret his promise.

Jalen Ramsey: Jaguars' Tom Coughlin on AJ Green fight:::::Jaguars executive Tom Coughlin commended cornerback Jalen Ramsey for his handling of Sundays scrap with Bengals receiver A.J.Green.I want to voice my support for Jalen Ramsey following the incident in our game on Sunday, Coughlin said in a statement Tuesday.Our players are instructed to not retaliate or get involved or do anything that would result in eviction because that would hurt the team.Team comes first, and Jalen was trying to not hurt his team.While he did push his opponent something that happened with other players during the game he did not retaliate, he threw no punches, and he did not fight back.Jalen was doing what Coach [Doug] Marrone has instructed him to do, which is to play tough, be physical and to make every play difficult for his opponent.There was banter going back and forth during the game, but Jalen was playing football within the rules.In the final seconds of the first half, Ramsey shoved Green and Green retaliated by grabbing Ramsey by the neck from behind and wrestling him to the ground.Green proceeded to punch Ramsey in the helmet.The referee in the game, Brad Allen, said Ramsey was the instigator in the incident and pointed out that a player doesnt have to throw a punch in order to be ejected for fighting.The NFL announced Monday that neither player would be suspended as a result of the fight, though NFL rules call for a fine of more than $30,000 for a first instance of fighting.
Arsene Wenger not punished for accusing Sterling of diving:::::Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger won't be facing any disciplinary action from the English FA for his comments regarding Raheem Sterling.The Frenchman accused Sterling of diving to win a penalty, during the Gunners' 3-1 loss to Manchester City on the weekend, after coming into contact with Nacho Monreal in the Londoners' box."I believe it was no penalty," Wenger said to BBC after the match."We know that Sterling dives well, and he does that [win the penalty] very well."Wenger also added: "You can accept it if City win in a normal way, they are a good side, but the way it happened is unacceptable."According to Sky Sports, the longtime gaffer will not face any penalty for his outburst as he is understood to have danced on the line, but did not overstep.Wenger also disagreed with a few other refereeing decisions stemming from the game.But as things stand, he remains on the good side of the FA.The result leaves the Gunners some 12 points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, and they have a tough challenge coming up after the international break, with a clash against rivals Tottenham set to follow.

Defensive trio proving crucial to Manchester City's success:::::LONDON (Reuters) - With Manchester City scoring at will and playing some bewitching attacking football, it has been easy to overlook the contribution made by their three most defensive outfield players.Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City vs Arsenal - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - November 5, 2017 Manchester City's Fernandinho in action with Arsenal's Sead Kolasinac.REUTERS/Phil Noble Fernandinho, John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi are never likely to hog the headlines in a team that has plundered 52 goals in all competitions and features flamboyant playmakers Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva behind deadly finishers such as Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus.Yet statistics suggest they hold a valid claim to being the three most important players in Pep Guardiolas squad, following an unbeaten start to the season that has left City eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.Their record of conceding just 11 goals in 17 matches in all competitions this season is impressive enough on its own, yet the argument gathers pace when you consider their contributions to Citys domination of possession and attacks.Argentine centre back Otamendi, for example, has had more touches in the Premier League and Champions League combined than any other City player this season, with England centre back Stones second and Brazil midfielder Fernandinho fourth behind De Bruyne.It is a similar story with passing.Otamendi is once again at the top of the charts for passes attempted, ahead of Fernandinho in second place with Stones in third.While for pass completion, Stones leads the way for City ahead of Otamendi in second place and Fernandinho in fourth all three of them currently registering above 90 percent.Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City vs Arsenal - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - November 5, 2017.Manchester City's John Stones in action with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez.Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith In fact, Stoness rate of 96.6 percent is bettered in European leagues only by the 96.7 percent completed so far by Paris St Germains Thiago Silva.It is not out of the ordinary for a holding midfielder such as Fernandinho to sit near the top of a teams touch and passing charts Nemanja Matic has dominated both for Manchester United this season.Yet the figures for Otamendi and Stones are more unique.Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City vs Arsenal - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - November 5, 2017.Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez in action with Manchester City's Nicolas Otamendi.Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith It suggests that all three are the glue binding this most exhilarating of attacking forces together and the bedrock of the goals being bagged by Aguero and the like.Not that they havent been scoring themselves.Stones and Otamendi have netted three times apiece this season while Fernandinho has scored twice.Needless to say, Guardiola has been the first to recognise the trios significance.I think Fernandinho right now is one of the three best holding midfielders in the world, he said ahead of Sundays 3-1 win over Arsenal.Just as with John (Stones) and Nico (Otamendi), Fernandinho has achieved another level, with his positivity and his mentality.He gives us a lot, with the ball and without the ball.That contribution could end up being the key to any success City go on to enjoy this season.

Olympics - Absence of Russia in Pyeongchang would be 'blow' to Games: Kremlin:::::MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Tuesday said it hoped Russia could mend its relations with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), adding that the countrys absence from the Pyeongchang Winter Games would be a blow to the Olympic movement.FILE PHOTO - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov speaks on the phone before a session of the Council of Heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Sochi, Russia October 11, 2017.REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Calls from some athletes and anti-doping agencies for a blanket ban of Russians in Pyeongchang have been growing louder amid ongoing IOC investigations into doping at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.The IOC is re-testing all Russian athletes samples from the 2014 Games following revelations by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscows discredited anti-doping laboratory, of a scheme to cover up home competitors positive samples.The IOC has said it would decide on the participation of Russian competitors at the Pyeongchang Olympics in February during its executive board meeting next month.Russia topped the medal table in Sochi with 12 golds, 10 silver and nine bronze.We hope that dialogue with the IOC will be continued and all issues will be settled, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters.We wouldnt like to talk about the worst scenario linked to the non-participation of our athletes at the Games.This would be a blow to the international Olympic movement.Russian cross-country skiers Alexander Legkov and Evgeniy Belov were banned for life from the Olympics last week by the IOC as part of an investigation into allegations of widespread doping among Russians and sample tampering by laboratory and security officials at the Sochi Games.The Sochi scandal is part of a broader doping affair that has led to the suspension of Russias anti-doping agency RUSADA, its athletics federation and Paralympic Committee.RUSADA has been suspended by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since a report published in November 2015, led by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, found evidence of state-sponsored doping and accused it of systematically violating anti-doping regulations.Peskov said that there were a string of problematic issues regarding Russian athletes use of banned performance-enhancing drugs, but they had nothing to do with alleged state-sponsored doping.We categorically deny this possibility, Peskov said.Authorities in Russia have never acknowledged the states role in the scandal.
Interview - Bayern must bring in new blood to stay on top: Lewandowski:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Bayern Munich must make sure they bring in top players every season to stay competitive and ease the pressure on an ageing squad, Poland captain Robert Lewandowski said on Tuesday.Poland's national soccer team captain Robert Lewandowski poses for a picture after an interview with Reuters at a hotel in Warsaw, Poland November 7, 2017.REUTERS/Kacper Pempel Lewandowski, with the national team for friendlies against Uruguay on Friday and Mexico on Monday, also told Reuters in an interview that Bayerns first-choice players need back up.We shouldnt delude ourselves.Each club needs to get a top player every two or three years to refresh the team, to bring some new blood, new quality, he said.After a stuttering start to the season, Bayern sacked their Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti and brought back 72-year-old Jupp Heynckes for his third spell in charge and the move has worked.Since Heynckes returned on Oct. 14, the club have won their seven matches in all competitions, reclaiming top spot in the Bundesliga after falling behind RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund.They have also reached the last 16 of the Champions league.At this point we really have a good team, but it is known that players are getting older, added Lewandowski.We are succeeding (in replacing them) today, because we have a young Josh Kimmich, who is really good at his new position and shows that a young player can be a replacement for such an experienced and wonderful one as Philipp Lahm.The 22-year-old Kimmich, who was a central midfielder, has replaced retired former Germany captain Lahm as Bayerns starting right back and has become an integral player in that position for club and country in just a few seasons.Poland's national soccer team captain Robert Lewandowski speaks during an interview with Reuters at a hotel in Warsaw, Poland November 7, 2017.REUTERS/Kacper Pempel NO REST However, Lewandowski feels his recent injury problem may have been down to having to play too much without adequate cover at Bayern to give him the rest his body needs.The 29-year-old came off after scoring just before halftime in the home win over Leipzig in the Bundesliga on Oct. 28 with a muscle problem he feels may have been prevented.Slideshow (5 Images) I had a minor injury.At the same time, injuries to other players who could not play at all meant I did not have an opportunity to rest or play for a shorter time, he said.Sometimes even playing 20-30 minutes less in a game or just missing a game means everything comes back to normality.Maybe my injury was due to the fact that there was no time to rest.The Poland striker became the first player to score 16 goals in a single European qualifying campaign for the World Cup and finished as the continents top scorer en route to Russia 2018.His sparkling performances helped his country seal their first World Cup spot since the 2006 tournament in Germany and they will be relying on him to excel at the finals.There has been media speculation that Lewandowski is unhappy with Bayerns transfer policy but his focus is on the World Cup.The tournament is so important that no one will think about changing club in that time, he said.
Weightlifting - North Korea not among entrants for world champs in U.S.:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Weightlifting powerhouse North Korea are not on the list of entrants for this months world championships in the United States.FILE PHOTO - North Korean spectators cheer for North Korea's Kim Un Guk as he competes in the men's 62kg weightlifting competition at the Moonlight Garden Venue during the 17th Asian Games in Incheon September 21, 2014.REUTERS/Olivia Harris The countrys lifters, who have won five Olympic gold medals since 2008, were expected to shine in Anaheim, but did not feature on the entry list released by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on Tuesday.North Korea gave no explanation for not entering a team for the championships, which take place from Nov. 28-Dec. 5.It would be the first time North Korea has failed to send a team to the worlds since 2009, when the hosts were South Korea.The North Koreans chances of dominating the competition had improved drastically after the IWF cracked down on doping and China, Russia and seven other nations were banned for one year.North Korea have never topped the medals table at a world championship in any major sport but excel at weightlifting.Diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, however, have escalated in recent months, with U.S. President Donald Trump vowing to halt the countrys nuclear ambitions.The World Championships organising committee had said last month it did not foresee any visa problems for the North Korean team.In recent years weightlifting has become the most successful sport for North Korea, who came second in the medal count at the London 2012 Olympics and fourth in Rio de Janeiro last year.They have also made the top four at the past three world championships.
Sock happy to swap Augusta for ATP Finals:::::(Reuters) - Jack Sock was so certain he would not qualify for next weeks ATP Finals that he had a tee time booked at Augusta National, but the American will have to wait another day to cross that round of golf off his bucket list.FILE PHOTO - USA's Jack Sock celebrates winning the final against Serbia's Filip Krajinovic at the Rolex Paris Masters.REUTERS/Charles Platiau Sock, who started last week in 24th position in the Race to London rankings, only secured the eighth and final spot in the season-ending showpiece with a breakthrough win at the Paris Masters on Sunday to reach a career-high ninth in the world.For Sock, who is the first American to secure a berth at the season finale since Mardy Fish in 2011, the win means he will be among the elite field at the Nov. 12-19 tournament rather than golfing at the home of the prestigious Masters tournament.Golf is my second passion.Athletically its what I love to do when I am away from tennis.Obviously it wouldve been a bucket list thing for me to do, Sock said in an interview.But I would trade a tee time there to be here in a heartbeat.Sock did not know he had a shot at reaching the ATP Tour Finals when he stormed back from 5-1 down in the decisive set of his second-round clash with Kyle Edmund in Paris.He said he was only told of his chances after a third-round win over Lucas Pouille.The 25-year-old American is now eager to extend his season as he gets ready to battle in a field that includes world number one Rafael Nadal and six-times champion Roger Federer.Obviously I got a lot confidence from the biggest title of my career and being a part of this event... said Sock.Im going to play some free tennis here and enjoy my time out on court and take all the confidence from the last few weeks of my season and definitely carry those into training for the offseason and into 2018.Sock, who is the American number one for the first time in his career after winning his third title of the season, may be making make his singles debut at the elite eight-player event but he insists he is not just happy to be there.The rest of the field in London will be made up by debutants Alexander Zverev of Germany, Bulgarias Grigor Dimitrov and David Goffin of Belgium, and former qualifiers Austrias Dominic Thiem and Croatias Marin Cilic.I have played a lot of these guys and beaten some of them, and especially with the confidence after last week, I have the belief in myself to go out and do some damage in this event, said Sock.
Latin Americans fined again over homophobic chanting:::::ZURICH (Reuters) - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru were fined sums ranging between 10,000 and 40,000 Swiss francs (7,603 to 30,412 pounds) on Tuesday as FIFA continued its clamp down on homophobic chanting by fans in Latin America.Homophobic chanting at soccer matches is widespread in some Latin American countries, especially when the visiting goalkeeper runs up to take a goal kick, and until recently it was overlooked by soccer authorities.FIFA has already imposed numerous fines on federations in the region during the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition.The latest bouts of fines concerned matches played last month.Chiles federation said last month that it had tried to educate fans but the problem was deep-rooted and needed to be tackled by other parts of society.Mexicos federation last year staged a campaign urging its supporters to stop homophobic chants.FIFA also said on Tuesday that Serbias federation was fined a total of 160,000 Swiss francs for crowd trouble at two games.It said the Serbians were fined 90,000 francs for improper conduct by fans, which included letting off incendiary devices, political and discriminatory banners and political chants during the 3-2 defeat by Austria last month.It was fined a further 70,000 Swiss francs for similar offences in the match against Georgia three days later, which Serbia won 1-0 to qualify for the World Cup.Austria was fined 10,000 francs and warned for misbehaviour by its fans at the Serbia match.Bosnia (47,500 Swiss francs), Egypt (20,000 Swiss francs), Estonia (30,000 Swiss francs) and Greece (30,000 Swiss francs) were among other federations to be fined by FIFA.They could not immediately be reached for comment.

FIFA demands visa, work permit and tax exemptions for 2026 World Cup:::::MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - The United States and other countries hoping to host the 2026 World Cup should provide government guarantees on visa-free travel plus work permit and tax exemptions for their bids to be accepted, according to documents published by FIFA on Tuesday.The logo of FIFA is seen in front of its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland September 26, 2017.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann - RC17EB887400 The U.S wants to host the 2026 tournament in a joint bid with Canada and Mexico, who would also have to commit to the government guarantees for their proposal to be accepted by soccers world governing body.Morocco is currently the only other country to have indicated they will bid for the finals, which will be the first to feature an expanded 48-team field.FIFA wants a visa-free environment, or at least non-discriminatory visa procedures, while the work permit exemptions apply to anyone involved with the World Cup and tax exemptions relate to the soccer governing body and its subsidiaries.While FIFA has asked for - and received - similar exemptions in the past, their inclusion in a revamped World Cup bid process will mean the current U.S. administration of President Donald Trump will need to sign off on the exemptions.Sunil Gulati, chairman of the joint U.S, Mexican and Canadian United Bid Committee has previously stated that Trump supports the attempt to bring the World Cup to the United States, which hosted the 1994 finals.FIFA produced new bidding criteria after the organisation was heavily criticised over the selection process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals, won by Russia and Qatar respectively.Formal submission of the completed bids has to be made by March 16, 2018 and FIFA will decide whether to select one of the candidate bids at their congress in June next year, or re-open the process if none of the bids are accepted.OVERVIEW DOCUMENT Regarding immigration and travel guarantees, the FIFA overview document on government guarantees states: In order to cover the needs of the respective groups of individuals, the Government is requested to generally establish a visa-free environment or facilitate existing visa procedures for them.Regardless, any visa procedures must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.As a presidential candidate, Trump called for a total ban on Muslims entering the U.S. as a counter-terrorism measure.The courts have blocked his latest executive action barring entry into the United States for people from several Muslim-majority countries.The FIFA document adds however that: It is understood that such ease of access to the Host Country/Host Countries must by no means adversely affect the national immigration and security standards in the Host Country/Host Countries.The document also says a bidding nations government is requested to guarantee the issuance of valid work permits unconditionally and without any restriction or discrimination of any kind to people involved in the preparation, organisation and hosting of the tournament.It adds that the government must grant a general tax exemption for FIFA, the 2026 FWC (FIFA World Cup) Entity, the 2026 FWC Subsidiaries (if applicable) and any other FIFA subsidiary limited to the period of preparation, delivery and wrap-up of the Competition, commencing on the date of appointment of the Host Country/Host Countries and ending on 31 December 2028.FIFAs enhanced bidding guidelines are part of a series of reforms enacted after a corruption crisis in 2015 engulfed the organisation.They include ethics, human rights and transparency commitments plus demands on stadium size and infrastructure.
India vs New Zealand: The Series Win Makes Us Proud, Says Virat Kohli:::::India captain Virat Kohli says the bowler-friendly conditions made them 'nervous' after losing the toss before prevailing against New Zealand in the series-deciding third Twenty20 on Tuesday.India beat New Zealand by six runs in the rain-curtailed match to claim the series 2-1.Commenting on the win against the Kiwis, Kohli said that having won a few matches on the trot make them proud."We have won a few on the trot and it makes us very proud.This stadium is beautiful, the outfield wonderful and the crowd made it special.I am surprised there were no games here earlier," he added.Talking about the delayed game, Kohli further added, "I think we were really happy to get a game.This crowd deserved to watch some action.Ever since the ODIs started, we expected them to give a good fight.We were nervous to start here, with the damp pitch."Due to a rain-curtailed match, the 20-over match was reduced to an 8-over-a-side match.Batting first, India made 67 for five and in response Kiwis could only reach 61 for six in eight overs.Jasprit Bumrah starred with the ball, striking twice and bowling the all important penultimate over of the game.He ended with figures of two for nine in two overs."We thought if we can take the run-rate up, it's not going to be so easy.Rohit and MS (Dhoni) came up with Bumrah bowling the second last, and Hardik Pandya bowled the last over well."When Hardik got hurt, I was thinking god forbid if I had to bowl the last four balls," said Kohli seeing the funny side of Pandya's spirited fielding effort in the final over.New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said India showed they are one of the best teams in the world by winning the pressure games regularly."It was a tricky surface and runs on board on that surface was handy.It came down to the couple of deliveries.Shame to not get across the line in this decider.As soon as you ran your fingers on the ball, it made life difficult," said Williamson."In this part of the world, wickets can be flat.We showed good fight.You have to be on top of their game to win here, they are one of the best teams in the world.I think there have been number of strides forward for us.Fairly new group and it's not easy, guys coming here for the first or second time.It's a tough place to play," he added.(With PTI inputs)
3rd T20I: Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal Shine As India Beat New Zealand By Six Runs To Win Series 2-1:::::A disciplined bowling display from the bowlers in Thiruvananthapuram helped India earn their first bilateral Twenty20 series win against New Zealand as the visitors fell short by six runs in the decider to lose the three-match series 1-2 in a rain-curtailed 8-over-a-side match.Jasprit Bumrah (2/9) and Yuzvendra Chahal (8 runs in 2 overs) starred with the ball as the batsmen could not catch up with the ever-rising required run-rate.For New Zealand, Colin de Grandhomme was the only saving grace who remained not-out on 17.Playing spoilsport, the rains reduced the decisive match of the series and first ever International match at Greenfield Stadium to an eight-overs per side affair.Stroke-making was not easy under the conditions and all the hosts could manage to put on board was 67 for five, featuring only seven boundaries, including three sixes.However, the Indian pacers and spinners bowled their hearts out in a short but exciting contest.They were well supported by agile fielders.A wily Bhuvneshwar Kumar mixed it up nicely after being hit for a gigantic six by Colin Munro (7) while Jasprit Bumrah was splendid with his line and length.Bhuvneshwar cleaned up Martin Guptill (1) with a slower one while Bumrah saw the back of dangerous Munro.The early wickets pegged New Zealand back and they could never settle and eventually buckled under pressure.Young leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal too contributed in choking the Kiwis, giving away only eight runs in his quota of two overs.Hardik Pandya bowled the last over with the Kiwis requiring 19 runs.A massive six by Colin de Grandhomme threw tension in the air for the home fans but Pandya managed to pull it off.Earlier, Both Shikhar Dhawan (6) and Rohit Sharma (8) struggled to time the ball, with Trent Boult having a perfect bowler-friendly platform to execute his skills.Kane Williamson handed the ball to Mitchell Santner to bowl the second over and the left-arm spinner surprised the Indians with some vicious turn.The Indian openers had no choice but to go after the bowlers and lost their wickets in successive balls from Tim Southee at the start of third over.Both of them were caught by Santner.Virat Kohli tried to lift the gloom by smashing Ish Sodhi for a four and six but the Indian skipper could not clear the ropes in his second attempt and was caught by Boult at deep mid-wicket.India managed 31 runs in the first four overs and now Shreyas Iyer (6) and Manish Pandey (17) needed to provide impetuous to the innings.Pandey lofted Sodhi over long-on for a six but Sodhi, like the Rajkot match, used his variations nicely to trouble the Indians and had Iyer caught by Guptill.Hardik Pandya (14 not out) made his presence felt with a massive hit off Santner but could not get any more big shot.Pandey became victim of exceptional athleticism from Santner at the deep.Pandey hoicked Boult, attempting six, but a full-stretched air-borne Santner not only stopped the ball from soaring over the ropes but threw it towards de Grandhomme for an easy catch.(With PTI inputs)
Ashes 2017: Steven Finn Ruled Out With Knee Injury:::::Paceman Steven Finn is out of England's entire Ashes tour of Australia with a knee injury, team officials said on Tuesday.Finn, who missed the opening tour match in Perth last weekend, had scans which revealed a torn left knee cartilage.The Middlesex seamer sustained the injury during practice last week in Perth and will now return home, where he will consult a specialist to see whether he needs an operation.A team spokesman said England would shortly announce his replacement for the rest of the Australian tour.It ends another miserable tour to Australia for Finn, who left the previous 2013/14 trip under a cloud when coach Ashley Giles declared him "unselectable".Finn only made the current tour when he was added to the squad in place of the suspended Ben Stokes."When you're a late call-up to the squad and have been out of selection for the past six months or so, you definitely do have a point to prove," Finn said last week before the injury.Coach Trevor Bayliss told reporters on Tuesday: "He had an injection a couple of days ago which they thought would help."Among those in contention to replace Finn are Tom Curran, who played for England earlier this year, Tom Helm or Liam Plunkett, who has signed up to play in a ten-over tournament in the United Arab Emirates next month.
Anil Kumble Opens Up On Unpopular 'Headmaster' Tag, Shares Challenges Of Life:::::Cricket legend Anil Kumble, who resigned as India coach in June under controversial circumstances citing his untenable relationship with India captain Virat Kohli, attributed his approach to a disciplined upbringing that eventually got him the unpopular tag of a "headmaster" later in his illustrious career.Kumble, in a chat with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, talked at length about his childhood learnings that went a long way in him becoming a champion cricketer.Patiently listening at the other end was Hyderabad-born Nadella, a self-proclaimed cricket fan.When Nadella asked Kumble about the values he inherited from his parents, Kumble said: "The self-belief.It comes from the values that you inculcate, looking up to your parents and grand-parents.""My grandfather was a headmaster in school and I know that term (headmaster) kept coming back to me later in my career.Some of them here will understand (what I am talking about)," said Kumble drawing a gentle laugh from the audience.Since then, India's leading wicket-taker has maintained silence on the issue and so has Kohli.The conversation between Kumble and Nadella revolved around Microsoft CEO's book titled 'Hit Refresh', released recently.Both talked at length about the 'Hit Refresh' moments in their lives.Kumble said the Australia tour in 2003-04, when India managed to draw the four-Test series, was the time he faced the challenge of reinventing himself."As a cricketer, you have to hit refresh literally at the end of every series.Challenges from one series to another are different.But I would like to mention the Australia tour in 2003-04 when I was at the crossroads of my career," he said."I was competing for a place in the eleven (with Harbhajan Singh).People had started talking about my retirement as I was in my 30s.I got an opportunity in the Adelaide Test which we famously won."I was expensive on day one but came back to take a five-wicket haul.I understood the need of doing something different.So I started bowling a different type of googly, something I had learnt during my tennis ball days.That is when I realised I can make subtle changes to improve my game," Kumble added.Asked about the defining moment in Indian cricket, Kumble picked the World Cup win in 1983 and Australia's tour of India in 2001 when the hosts bounced back to win the series 2-1."The best part of playing in the 90s was that we almost won everything at home.But if you have to pick one hit refresh moment, it was the Australia-India series in 2001.I did not take part in that due to injury."That was the time when the team realised its true potential.Since then Indian cricket has gone from strength to strength and we are number one at the moment," he said.Kumble also opined that cricket has lagged behind in using the cutting-edge technology in not only making the sport more fair and exciting but also in strengthening the fan-athlete connect.(With PTI inputs)
Senior National Badminton Championships: Kidambi Srikanth, HS Prannoy To Clash In Final:::::Olympic medallists Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu will battle for supremacy in the women's singles final of the Senior Badminton National Championship after scoring contrasting victories on Tuesday.Saina, who is currently ranked World No.11, hardly broke a sweat as she defeated fifth seed Anura Prabhudesai 21-11 21 -10 while World No 2 and top seed Sindhu was surprisingly stretched by Ruthvika Shivani before prevailing 17-21, 21-15, 21-11 in the semifinals.In the men's singles, it will be a clash between World No 2 Kidambi Srikanth and giant-killer H S Prannoy in a repeat of their semifinal battle at the French Open Super Series a little over a week ago.Second seed Prannoy overcame Subhankar Dey 21-14 21-17, while top seed Srikanth saw off young rising shuttler Lakshya Sen 21-16, 21-18.The possibility of a Saina versus Sindhu clash was high after the star shuttlers confirmed their participation in the tournament.Saina hasn't competed at the Senior Nationals since winning back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007, while Sindhu too gave the domestic tournament a miss after winning the 2011 and 2013 editions.The two, who are employees of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), have met twice in international competitions.Their first meeting was at the 2014 Syed Modi International before they played each other in India Super Series this year.While Saina prevailed in 2014, Sindhu had the last laugh in Delhi.A lot has happened between those two battles with Saina becoming the World No 1 in 2015, while Sindhu rising to the pinnacle of world badminton after clinching the silver at Rio Olympics.Saina, who had won the bronze at London Games, had suffered a career-threatening knee injury to crash out early from the Rio Games and spent the next few months recovering and scripting her way back to the top.Sindhu, meanwhile, scaled new heights in international badminton after winning the 2016 China Open, India Open and Korea Open this year, besides winning the silver at the Glasgow World Championship.Saina, 27, who had won the silver in 2015 World Championship, bagged a bronze at the Glasgow edition to show that she was getting back to her best.The men's singles final is also expected to be a close affair.Srikanth and Prannoy have played four times in their international career but it was the former who had the last laugh on the last three occasions.The only time Prannoy had beaten Srikanth was way back at the 2011 Tata Open.Srikanth has been in the form of his life as he clinched four titles after reaching five finals this season to join the likes of two-time former Olympic champion Lin Dan, three-time Olympic silver medallists Lee Chong Wei and current Olympic gold medallist Chen Long.Prannoy too have been in fine form as he reached the semifinals at Indonesia Super Series Premier and French Open Super Series to achieve his career-high ranking of World No 11.He had outwitted Chong Wei twice and defeated Chen once during this season.Among others, mixed doubles combo of Satwik Sai Raj R and Ashwini Ponnappa will face top seeds Pranaav Jerry Chopra and Sikki Reddy N after they emerged winners following the retirement of their semifinal opponents Sanyam Shukla and Sanyogita Ghorpade midway in the first game.Pranaav and Sikki, however, had to dig deep to stave off a spirited challenge from Alwin Francis and Aparna Balan 21-16 22-24 21-8 in a match that lasted a little over an hour.Top seeded women's doubles pair of Sikki Reddy N and Ashwini Ponnappa will meet Sanyogita Ghorpade and Prajakta Sawant in the final.The top seeded combo defeated Aparna Balan and Sruthi K P 21-10 21-14, while Sanyogita and Prajakta outlasted Rutaparna Panda and Mithula U K 18-21 21-12 21-16 in another semifinal.

he had scored 26 runs in boundaries from five deliveries (3x6, 2x4) and managed only 23 from the remaining 32 deliveries, which is far less than run a ball.It will be interesting to see where Kohli and chief coach Ravi Shastri slot Dhoni in the next game.A school of thought suggests that Dhoni will be suited at No 4 in case India lose early wickets as it will give him time to settle down.The Indian team's performance has been one of contrast in the first two games.
India vs New Zealand: Prayers To Lord Ganesha With Rain Threat Over T20I Decider:::::According to the day's forecast, two showers are expected - in the afternoon and after 5 p.m.According to the day's forecast, two showers are expected - in the afternoon and after 5 p.m.The Pazhavangadi Ganapathy temple, in the heart of city, witnessed a good rush of devotees on Tuesday morning with many breaking coconuts with just one prayer in mind - that the rain gods should be benevolent.After all, the decider T20 between New Zealand and India is to be held at the brand new Greenfield Stadium in the evening.For the past two days the city has been experiencing rains.According to the day's forecast, two showers are expected - in the afternoon and after 5 p.m.The match at the state-of-the-art stadium begins at 7 p.m.According to legend, the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy temple is one where cutting across caste, creed or religion, breaking a coconut with prayers is one way to keep the rains away."This is God's own country and God will be kind, as the city is to witness its first international match after a gap of 30 years.The last time an international match was staged here, even India captain Virat Kohli was not born, as well as all of us," said a group of youngsters who had arrived early in the morning at the temple.The silver lining, despite the rains and more rains forecast, is that the ground has one of the best drainage facilities.The organisers are certain that even if the rain gods play truant, once the rain stops, in 10 minutes the ground can be made match ready.Tickets for the match have all been sold out, leaving many locals disappointed.More than 40,000 tickets were sold for the match, in the nearly 50,000-capacity stadium.Giving a political twist to the sports event, three-time former Congress legislator M.A.Wahid, who lost in the 2016 polls and in whose constituency the stadium is located, said that had it not been for the strong stand taken by then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in 2012 the stadium would not have become a reality."The then Left opposition led by the youth wing of the CPI-M had obstructed when work commenced for the stadium then," said Wahid in a social media post on Tuesday.The rival teams are expected to arrive at the stadium around 5 p.m.
Mary Kom Enters Asian Boxing Championships Final:::::Mary Kom will now vie for her fifth gold medal at the Asian Boxing Championships.Mary Kom will now vie for her fifth gold medal at the Asian Boxing Championships.AFP Five-time world champion MC Mary Kom remained on course for a fifth gold medal at the Asian Boxing Championships after she advanced to the final of the event on Tuesday being held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.Mary Kom defeated Japan's Tsubasa Komura in a unanimous 5-0 verdict to make the summit clash for the fifth time in her sixth appearance at the event.Should she go on to win the final, the Indian would be clinch her first Asian Championships gold medal in the 48kg category.The 35-year-old Rajya Sabha MP, who is also a former Olympic bronze-medallist, returned to her preferred weight category after five years of competing in 51kg, which was made an Olympic category in 2012.Once again, it was a bout fought largely on defensive tactics.The Japanese boxer seemed too wary to go near the Indian, who literally had to lunge at Komura for her right hooks to connect.Mary Kom's patience with Komura's tactics ran out in the second round and she increased the pace and ferocity of her own attacks to unsettle the Japanese.The shell guard to stave off Komura's feeble right straights ensured that the star Indian boxer hardly took any blow in what turned out to be a lopsided contest.
Taskin Ahmed Gets Married, Fans Troll Him And Wife:::::Bangladesh seamer Taskin Ahmed tied the knot with his childhood friend Sayeda Rabeya Nayeem a week back and while it was a very special moment for the young Bangladeshi pacer, fans in Bangladesh were not too happy with the 22-year-old getting married so early on in his life.The couple were at the receiving end on social media as fans took to Facebook to express their disappointment but some took it to a new low by speaking ill about his wife.While some said it was a "shameful" event, others said that they were not too impressed with his wife.Taskin had a forgettable tour in South Africa.The young seamer went wicketless in the first Test while he was dropped in the second Test.Taskin only managed to pick up a couple wickets in the entire tour as Bangladesh lost the Test series 2-0 which was followed by a 3-0 drubbing in the ODIs.The T20Is weren't any different as the visitors lost 2-0 there as well.
India Vs New Zealand: Singling Out MS Dhoni Doesn't Explain Middle-Order Crisis:::::Despite a valiant 37-ball 49 by former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India succumbed to a 40-run loss against New Zealand in Rajkot on Saturday.Since then, calls for Dhoni's retirement from the T20 format of the game have increased exponentially.Remember, this is the same Dhoni who steered India to their maiden T20 World Cup triumph in 2007, albeit at a younger age.Former India cricketers VVS Laxman, Ajit Agarkar and Aakash Chopra have been vocal in criticising Dhoni after his performance in Rajkot.Laxman, in a televised show after India's loss against New Zealand in the second T20I, said that Dhoni has to pave way for youngsters in the T20 format as they would get an opportunity to blossom and get confidence by playing international cricket.Dhoni has 82 T20Is to his name scoring 1,281 runs at an average of 35.58 with a top score of 56.His ODI stats dwarf his T20I statistics.He has accumulated 9,826 runs in 309 matches at an impressive batting average of 51.71.However, in a 50-over format where he gets the chance to settle in, he isn't afforded the same luxury in the T20 format where one needs to go all-guns blazing right from the outset.Dhoni is a player who reads the match situation and then takes the subsequent call at the crease.Going back to the second T20I match against the Kiwis, Dhoni came into bat after India were reeling at 67/4 in 9.1 overs.He is a careful batsman than a careless one and he will continue to be the former.With Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah next, Dhoni knew there wasn't much batting left for India.Taking risks would anyway cost India eventually but one has to admit, the visitors outperformed India not because Dhoni didn't perform but the whole team failed as a unit.Singling out Dhoni for his slow start and the loss would be demeaning to a player of his calibre.India's middle-order seldom get a chance to perform considering the impressive form of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and skipper Virat Kohli.But when chances come their way, they hardly come to the fore.The ICC Champions Trophy final loss against Pakistan is a testament to this fact.Hardik Pandya, Kedar Jadhav and Manish Pandey have had their share of cameos but their scores hardly translates into big ones.The vacuum left in the middle is somewhat filled by Dhoni.Age may not be by his side but his wealth of experience in all the formats of the game can help the Indian team achieve their goals a great deal.
Mitchell Starc Takes Two Hat-Tricks For New South Wales In Same Match:::::With less than a fortnight to go for The Ashes 2017, Australian pacer Mitchell Starc seems to be recovering well from his injury.The Aussie pacer took his second hat-trick of the match to deliver Sheffield Shield victory for New South Wales over Western Australia at Hurstville on Tuesday.Starc dismissed Jason Behrendorff and David Moody with the last two balls of his 15th over and Jon Wells with the first of his 16th.Earlier on Monday, Starc first clean bowled Jason Behrendorf, then trapped David Moody leg before wicket before scattering the stumps of Simon Mackin with consecutive deliveries to take his first hat-trick of the match.Starc had registered a career-best haul of eight for 73 against South Australia at Adelaide Oval late last month.It capped an impressive domestic match for Australia's two Test strike bowlers -- Starc and Josh Hazlewood.Hazlewood took three for 13 on the way to figures of three for 24 in Western Australia's first innings of 176.Starc and Hazlewood are expected to share the new ball in the opening Test of the Ashes series against England in Brisbane, starting on November 23.With AFP Inputs.
India vs New Zealand: Ravi Shastri, Shikhar Dhawan Visit Renowned Thiruvananthapuram Temple Ahead Of Final T20I:::::Ravi Shastri, coach of the Indian cricket team, and star opener Shikhar Dhawan sought some divine help ahead of the third and final T20I at Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram.Shastri and Dhawan visited the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, offering their prayers and spending some time at the famous shrine before making their way back to join the other members of the team.With the series level at 1-1 and the Kiwis flying high, India will need all the help they can get in the deciding T20I.Images of Dhawan and Shastri were posted on a Facebook page by the name of Trivandrum Indian.India were outgunned by New Zealand in the second T20I in Rajkot and the hosts will be more than eager to get back to winning ways.However, it won't be easy against a side that India doesn't have a good record in Twenty20 cricket.The two teams have been pitted against each other on eight occasions, out of which one match was abandoned in 2012.Out of the rest, Team India have managed just win match -- the first T20I in this series in Delhi.Barring that the Kiwis have won six times and will look to continue their domination over India in the shortest format of the game.The Indian batsmen failed to come to the party in Rajkot.Only Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni made any real contribution with the bat.The Indian skipper will be hoping that is not the case in the decider in Thiruvananthapuram.
Next Gen ATP Finals Draw Branded A 'Disgrace':::::Players had to choose female models who had the letter 'A' or 'B' hidden on their bodies.Players had to choose female models who had the letter 'A' or 'B' hidden on their bodies.Twitter The Next Gen ATP finals delivered all the promised drama even before a ball was hit Monday with organisers issuing grovelling apologises after a draw ceremony blasted as "sexist".The inaugural under-21 version of the ATP World Tour Finals starts Tuesday in Milan, bringing together emerging stars tipped to rival Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.But a social media storm was whipped up after Sunday's draw ceremony when the players had to choose female models who had the letter 'A' or 'B' hidden on their bodies, to determine the round-robin group in which they would play.South Korean player Hyeon Chung looked visibly embarrassed as he was asked to pull off a female model's glove with his teeth during an evening designed as a tribute to Milan's famous links with the fashion industry.ATP executive president Chris Kermode apologised Monday describing the ceremony as "unacceptable, personally disrespectful and (that it) won't happen again"."It's unfair and unreasonable we put these guys out there.It wasn't their choice, it's in no way to do with any of the players here tonight," he stepped in to add when the eight players were questioned."Disgrace", wrote former women's number one Amelie Mauresmo on her Twitter account, while fellow French player Alize Cornet wrote: "Good job @ATPWorldTour Supposed to be a futurist event right?#backtozero", as Judy Murray, mother of former men's number one Andy Murray, tweeted "awful".Kermode said that he hoped that the focus would be on the planned innovations which would be tested during the five-day tournament including shorter sets, no-ad scoring, a no-let rule and electronic line calls to increase the pace of play."I've receive a huge amount of mixed response.We're not trying to 'mess with the game of tennis' but to try things that in five to 10 years we might eventually integrate into the sport."We want while the sport is in the best place it has ever been to try to look towards innovating for the future."These guys are the future and they're going to be here for a long time."The tournament gets underway without any big name player with Germany's Alexander Zverev, at 20 already too strong for the group, playing an exhibition match in Milan on Tuesday before flying to London for the ATP World Tour Finals.'Something unreal' The highest-ranked player in Milan will be Russian Andrey Rublev, ranked 37th, and a winner this year on clay at Umag.Rublev said he was honoured to be considered among the heirs to Nadal, Federer, Djokovic and Murray."These top four guys are something unreal, they are legends, I grew up with them and they are still top.To get close to them you have to put in a lot of work, only time will show."The 20-year-old Rublev is one of three Russians in the field including 45th-ranked Karen Khachanov, and 65th-ranked Daniil Medvedev.Khachanov sees a bright future for Russian men who have not held a Grand Slam since Marat Safin won the 2005 Australian Open."A lot of players from Russia are here.It's just a new generation, young guys playing together, getting connected," said Khachanov.Canadian Denis Shapovalov (ranked 51), American Jared Donaldson (55), Croat Borna Coric (48), South Korea's Chung (54) and Italian qualifier Gianluigi Quinzi (306) complete the line-up."The US has a rich tradition in tennis greats, there's been a lot of talk of a drought of a Grand Slam winner, just that the game has become more international, looking at this group so many continents are touched," said Donaldson."This tournament is about innovation, trying new things.It's definitely a cool, unique thing."For Shapovalov the most difficult change is getting used to the 'no-let rule'."For me that would be pretty challenging," said the Canadian.Chung added: "I'm so happy to be part of these great players here.I'm trying to play my best this week."The top two from each group will progress to the semi-finals, with the final next Saturday determining the best young player in the world and the winner earning USD 1.2 million (1.03 million euros).

Lewis Hamilton Avoided Taxes On His Private Jet: Paradise Papers:::::Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton avoided paying taxes on his private jet using an elaborate scheme now under investigation by British tax authorities, new leaked documents revealed.The driver received a 3.3 million ($4.4 million, EUR3.7 million) VAT refund in 2013 after his luxury plane was imported into the Isle of Man -- a low-tax British Crown Dependency, according to the BBC and Guardian newspaper.The revelations are the latest to emerge from the so-called Paradise Papers, released by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).They allege accountancy firm EY and Appleby -- the Bermuda-based law firm at the centre of the leaks -- assisted Hamilton and dozens of other clients in setting up seemingly artificial leasing businesses to get multi-million-pound VAT rebates.The complex arrangements, which involved the individuals forming entities that rented their own jets, may contravene Europe-wide rules forbidding refunds for personal use, the media outlets said.Representatives for Hamilton could not be reached by AFP for comment.His lawyers told the BBC a review by a tax barrister found the structure was lawful, and that some VAT had been paid through the arrangements.There is also no indication Hamilton was directly involved in creating the scheme, and simply followed professional advice, the Guardian said.EY said it does not discuss individual clients."All our advice, whether in planning or compliance, is based on our knowledge of tax law and providing transparency to tax authorities," it added in a statement.Appleby did not respond to a request for comment.Leaked documents showed as many as 50 such schemes involving the Isle of Man, according to the BBC.Its government announced on October 24 it had asked Britain's finance ministry to help investigate business jet imports into the EU through its territory.A British treasury spokesman said it could not comment on individual taxpayers' information.Tax specialists who reviewed the leaks for the ICIJ consortium confirmed to AFP that Hamilton's arrangements appeared to be "at the very minimum, aggressive tax planning: an artificial scheme, designed to obtain a tax advantage."Rita de la Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, added: "If the scheme is being used to disguise private use of the jet, then the situation is of a more serious tax avoidance scheme."Hamilton, recently crowned world champion for a fourth time and one of richest sportsperson in the world, bought the jet -- a Bombardier Challenger 605 -- for 16.5 million.He has frequently posted photographs of its use for holidays and personal trips on social media.Under European tax rules, when a company or individual imports an aircraft they must pay 20 percent of the purchase price in VAT, which can be reclaimed only on business use.
MS Dhoni Would Never Block Way For Any Youngster, Virender Sehwag Counters VVS Laxman:::::Virender Sehwag batted for MS Dhoni, saying he would never block the way of any youngster.Virender Sehwag batted for MS Dhoni, saying he would never block the way of any youngster.AFP MS Dhoni received some flak from former cricketers, especially VVS Laxman, following the second T20I against New Zealand on November 4.Despite scoring a solid 49 off 37 when India had already lost half their side in the chase, the likes of Laxman and Ajit Agarkar decided to criticise the former India captain, saying that it was time he gave up T20 cricket.Laxman had said it was time Dhoni gave youngsters a chance in T20 format.However, Dhoni's former teammate and swashbuckling India opener Virender Sehwag provided the perfect counter to Laxman's statement.Speaking to India TV, Sehwag backed Dhoni and said that he would never block the way for any youngster and step down at the right time."Team India needs MS Dhoni at the moment, even in T20 cricket.He will step down at the right time.He will never block the way for any young cricketer," the big-hitting opener said.Sehwag had earlier said that the Indian team was "yet to find a suitable replacement" for Dhoni.But Sehwag did have a small advice for Dhoni,"Dhoni should realise his role in the team.He has to change the momentum early while chasing a strong total.He has to score from ball one and the team management should make him understand this point"."The team management needs to tell him that he has to play freely from the first ball.The management should assure him that even if he gets out, he should keep on playing attacking cricket," he added.Chasing 197 for a win in Rajkot, Dhoni came into bat with 67 for four in 9.1 overs.Despite Virat Kohli going great guns at the other end, India didn't have too much batting left after Dhoni.The likes of Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah were the players left.Dhoni made a slow start and failed to rotate the strike as regularly as some of the experts would have liked.During his stay in the middle, Dhoni scored 26 runs in boundaries from five deliveries (3x6, 2x4) but managed only 23 from the remaining 32 deliveries.India lost Kohli in the 17th over with the score on 123 and Dhoni departed in the final over as India fell short by 40 runs.India play the series-decider on Tuesday and certainly Dhoni's batting position will be under spotlight as the home team aims to go for the kill at Thiruvananthapuram.

Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic Fall Out Of ATP Top 10:::::Andy Murray plummeted from third to 16th after not playing since July with a hip injury.Andy Murray plummeted from third to 16th after not playing since July with a hip injury.AFP Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic dropped outside the ATP top 10 for the first time in years in the latest rankings released on Monday.The 30-year-old Murray plummeted from third to 16th after not playing since July with a hip injury.The Scot's last appearance outside the top 10 was in October 2014.The three-time Grand Slam winner last appeared on court at Wimbledon, losing in the quarter-finals to American Sam Querrey.Shortly after that he was nudged off the top of the world rankings by Rafael Nadal, who sealed the end-of-year top spot at the Paris Masters last week.Murray is due to face world number two Roger Federer in a charity exhibition match in Glasgow on Tuesday before he starts his preparations for the Australian Open by playing in Brisbane.Djokovic, struggling with an elbow injury, was also last seen in action in the Wimbledon quarter-finals when he retired against Tomas Berdych.The 12-time Grand Slam winner ends the year in 12th, down five places, for his lowest ranking since March 2007.Djokovic is hoping to make a comeback at the exhibition World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi next month.American Jack Sock, who beat Filip Krajinovic 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 in the Paris Masters final on Sunday, climbs 13 rungs to ninth in the ATP chart.Sock's exploit in the French capital earned him a ticket to the World Tour Finals next week.Nadal's participation in the season-ending tournament in London is in doubt after the world number one and 16-time Grand Slam champion pulled out of Paris before his quarter-final with a knee injury.
India v New Zealand: India beat New Zealand by 6 runs in a thriller, clinch T20 series 2-1:::::THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Indian bowlers defended a modest-looking 67 with admirable discipline as the hosts pipped New Zealand by six runs in the rain-hit third Twenty20 to claim the series 2-1, on Tuesday.Playing spoilsport, the rains reduced the decisive match of the series and first ever International match at Greenfield Stadium to an eight-over per side affair.Stroke-making was not easy under the conditions and all the hosts could manage to put on board was 67 for five, featuring only seven boundaries, including three sixes.However, the Indian pacers and spinners bowled their hearts out in a short but exciting contest.They were well supported by agile fielders.A wily Bhuvneshwar Kumar mixed it up nicely after being hit for a gigantic six by Colin Munro (7) while Jasprit Bumrah was splendid with his line and length.Bhuvneshwar cleaned up Martin Guptill (1) with a slower one while Bumrah saw the back of dangerous Munro.The early wickets pegged New Zealand back and they could never settle and eventually buckled under pressure.Young leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal too contributed in choking the Kiwis, giving away only eight runs in his quota of two overs.Hardik Pandya bowled the last over with the Kiwis requiring 19 runs.A massive six by Colin de Grandhomme threw tension in the air for the home fans but Pandya managed to pull it off.Earlier, Both Shikhar Dhawan (6) and Rohit Sharma (8) struggled to time the ball, with Trent Boult having a perfect bowler-friendly platform to execute his skills.Kane Williamson handed the ball to Mitchell Santner to bowl the second over and the left-arm spinner surprised the Indians with some vicious turn.The Indian openers had no choice but to go after the bowlers and lost their wickets in successive balls from Tim Southee at the start of third over.Both of them were caught by Santner.Virat Kohli tried to lift the gloom by smashing Ish Sodhi for a four and six but the Indian skipper could not clear the ropes in his second attempt and was caught by Boult at deep mid-wicket.India managed 31 runs in the first four overs and now Shreyas Iyer (6) and Manish Pandey (17) needed to provide impetuous to the innings.Pandey lofted Sodhi over long-on for a six but Sodhi, like the Rajkot match, used his variations nicely to trouble the Indians and had Iyer caught by Guptill.Hardik Pandya (14 not out) made his presence felt with a massive hit off Santner but could not get any more big shot.Pandey became victim of exceptional athleticism from Santner at the deep.Pandey hoicked Boult, attempting six, but a full- stretched air-borne Santner not only stopped the ball from soaring over the ropes but threw it towards de Grandhomme for an easy catch.
Rani Rampal: Winning Asia Cup great, but we need to succeed in 2018: Rani Rampal:::::NEW DELHI: Back in the country after helping the Indian women's hockey team lift the Asia Cup title for the first time in 13 years, captain Rani Rampal and experienced goalkeeper Savita Punia are naturally beaming when speaking of the team's success over the past ten days.On Sunday, India extended its unbeaten run in the tournament held in Japan to a fabulous sixth game, beating China 5-4 in the penalty shootout to be crowned Asian champions.And yet amid the unmistakable pride and satisfaction following their achievement, there is a tone of measured expectancy and hope when the two stars talk about 2018, in which India will participate in the sport's three biggest events - the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and lastly the World Cup.The Indian team put behind it a middling year - during which they finished eighth out of ten teams at the World Hockey League Semi-Finals in South Africa, swept Belarus 5-0, endured a poor run in the Australian Hockey League and did well in a low-key tour of Europe - to claim gold in the Asia Cup and thus seal passage to the World Cup.But for Rani and Savita, this victory is only a stepping stone into the next year, where they are determined to do the country proud and remind everyone that they mean business."The next year is very important for us.These tournaments happen every four years.Naturally, now that we have won the Asia Cup, expectations will increase.We as a team need to enter these tournaments with the same confidence we had entering the Asia Cup," Rani told TOI Sports in an exclusive chat on Tuesday."That said, we cannot be content with winning the Asia Cup.We have to improve if we want to be compared with world class teams.Physically and mentally, there is lot to work on.There is plenty of hard work to be done.Everyone needs to see the confidence we have from training hard."(TOI Photo)Four months ago, the team finished eighth out of ten in the WHL Semi-Finals in Johannesburg.According to Rani, the catalyst for a change was shift in the players' mindset as well as the arrival of Harendra Singh , who in 2016 coached the junior men's team to the World Cup title."If you look at 2016, we won the Asian Champions Trophy.In Johannesburg, we had a very good team but we failed to play to our potential.We did not deserve to finish eighth out of ten teams.But that is part of sports - that you go somewhere and don't play as well as you expected to.Sometimes, in a short span of time, you finish where you did not expect to finish.We were stunned to finish eight, and our confidence dipped," she said."But we moved on, telling ourselves that though we did not qualify for the World Cup, we had one shot left to do so - the Asia Cup.We were determined to prove that we were good and we were determined to qualify for the World Cup.For the country, getting into the World Cup is a big deal and that was our singular motivation.We all decided that.It was not about winning the Asia Cup; it was about qualifying for the World Cup.When your target is so important, you focus solely on that and it becomes your common mindset."We were confident, largely because of Harendra sir's appointment as coach.He had coached the men's team to success, so we as a team felt confident of repeating that success under sir.Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, the mindset had changed.We had to qualify for the World Cup, that's it.For a player, there is no bigger tournament than the World Cup.We wanted to keep it simple, but also remained determined to win gold.Knock-outs are never easy, and we had mentally prepared ourselves for the toughest quarter-final, semi-final and final.We spoke of how if we were unable to grab the early momentum in games, we try to force games into shootouts.We consider ourselves good in shootouts and we have a very good goalie in such situations."(PTI Photo)Savita, who was adjudged Goalkeeper of the Tournament at the Asia Cup, concurs."That was our goal - to qualify for the World Cup.And qualification would only come with a gold medal.We wanted to qualify on merit, so that when we do travel to the World Cup, it is with a different level of confidence.Personally - and I can speak for Rani too - this was our third Asia Cup and we already had bronze and silver medals, so our mission was to win gold.We discussed about how victories are not based one or two performances, but a collective goal," she said.She too underlines the arrival of Harendra as pivotal in the women's team undergoing a shift."Once Harendra sir came on board as coach, the target was the Asia Cup.The fact that he coached the junior men's team to the World Cup title last year acted as additional motivation for us.We started to think that maybe this was our time now.Being the last tour of the year, we had collectively decided that we had to win the Asia Cup to qualify for the World Cup and enter 2018 ready for the three tough tournaments ahead," she said.Savita's brilliance in the penalty shootout during the final proved the difference between victory and defeat, as well as a ticket to the World Cup, and in particular, her stunning save with the scores locked at 4-4.It would prove the defining moment of her spectacular tournament - she conceded just five goals while India's strikers scored 28 - but for Savita, the good work by her strikers, headlined by Rani who scored twice in the shootout, as well as Harendra's confidence after full-time never let the butterflies in her stomach get out of control."To everyone it would naturally look like an extremely pressure situation, but somewhere inside I had a certain positivity because my strikers were scoring consistently.Before the shootouts, our goalkeeping coach Bharat bhai and our coach told us that our strikers would score at least three goals and that I would save at least two goals.So after that, it fell on me to prove their trust in me.That meant I had to remain calm and focus on the goal.If I thought too much about the result, it could distract me," she said."To be honest, there had been such situations during the past few years.But still, it all comes down to the goalkeeper's performance on the day, in that minute ... so that's what you train for, what you practice for.We went into the final knowing how good China were, despite having beaten them in the league stage.We prepared for a low-scoring final score followed by a penalty shootout.When the buzzer blew at 1-1, it reminded us of the Olympic Qualifiers when Rani scored a goal and then I saved the decisive goal in sudden death.When Rani scored her first goal in sudden death on Sunday, I told her 'didi, we have to repeat the same performance from the Olympic Qualifiers'.In shootouts, the player and goalkeeper have an equal chance at succeeding and failing, so it hinges on how calm and cool you remain."And then there were Harendra's words during the brief period between full-time and the shootout, which lifted the experienced goalkeeper a notch."He also told us to stay cool because that was part of what we trained for.He wanted us to execute just that during the shootout.And that's what panned out in sudden death.That was our coach's experience talking ... he has been coach of a world champion team, he oversaw a penalty shootout win in the semi-finals of the Junior World Cup ... so we were inspired by his comments to us before the shootout because there was intent and experience in his words.It was critical."
Anil Kumble: Headmaster tag came back to me later in my career: Anil Kumble:::::NEW DELHI: Former India coach Anil Kumble , known to give it all on the field, attributed his approach to a disciplined upbringing that eventually got him the unpopular tag of a "headmaster" later in his illustrious career.Kumble, in a chat with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , talked at length about his childhood learnings that went a long way in him becoming a champion cricketer.Patiently listening at the other end was Hyderabad-born Nadella, a self-proclaimed cricket fan.When Nadella asked Kumble about the values he inherited from his parents, Kumble said: "The self belief.It comes from the values that you inculcate, looking up to your parents and grandparents.""My grandfather was a headmaster in school and I know that term (headmaster) kept coming back to me later in my career.Some of them here will understand (what I am talking about)," said Kumble drawing a gentle laugh from the audience.Kumble, who earned the reputation of a hard taskmaster, quit as India coach in June under controversial circumstances, citing his untenable relationship with India captain Virat Kohli Since then, India's leading wicket-taker has maintained silence on the issue and so has Kohli.The conversation between Kumble and Nadella revolved around Microsoft CEO 's book titled 'Hit Refresh', released recently.Both talked at length about the 'Hit Refresh' moments in their lives.Kumble said the Australia tour in 2003-04, when India managed to draw the four-Test series, was the time he faced the challenge of reinventing himself."As a cricketer, you have to hit refresh literally at the end of the every series.Challenges from one series to another are different.But I would like to mention the Australia tour in 2003-04 when I was at the crossroads of my career."I was competing for a place in the eleven (with Harbhajan Singh ).People had started talking about my retirement as I was in my 30s.I got an opportunity in the Adelaide Test which we famously won."I was expensive on day one but came back to take a five- wicket haul.I understood the need of doing something different.So I started bowling a different type of googly, something I had learnt during my tennis ball days.That is when I realised I can make subtle changes to improve my game."Asked about the defining moment in Indian cricket, Kumble picked the World Cup win in 1983 and Australia's tour of India in 2001 when the hosts bounced back to win the series 2-1."The best part of playing in the 90s was that we almost won everything at home.But if you have to pick one hit refresh moment, it was the Australia-India series in 2001.I did not take part in that due to injury."That was the time when the team realised its true potential.Since then Indian cricket has gone from strength to strength and we are number one at the moment," he added.
Kidambi Srikanth: It's Saina vs Sindhu, Srikanth vs Prannoy in Senior Nationals finals:::::NAGPUR: Olympic medalists Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu will battle for supremacy in the women's singles final of the Senior Badminton National Championship after scoring contrasting victories on Tuesday.Saina, who is currently ranked World No.11, hardly broke a sweat as she defeated fifth seed Anura Prabhudesai 21-11, 21-10 while World No 2 and top seed Sindhu was surprisingly stretched by Ruthvika Shivani before prevailing 17-21, 21-15, 21-11 in the semi-finals.In the men's singles, it will be a clash between World No 2 Kidambi Srikanth and giant-killer HS Prannoy in a repeat of their semi-final battle at the French Open Super Series a little over a week ago.Second seed Prannoy overcame Subhankar Dey 21-14, 21-17, while top seed Srikanth saw off young rising shuttler Lakshya Sen 21-16, 21-18.The possibility of a Saina versus Sindhu clash was high after the star shuttlers confirmed their participation in the tournament.Saina hasn't competed at the Senior Nationals since winning back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007, while Sindhu too gave the domestic tournament a miss after winning the 2011 and 2013 editions.The two, who are employees of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), have met twice in international competitions.Their first meeting was at the 2014 Syed Modi International before they played each other in India Super Series this year.While Saina prevailed in 2014, Sindhu had the last laugh in Delhi.A lot has happened between those two battles with Saina becoming the World No 1 in 2015, while Sindhu rising to the pinnacle of world badminton after clinching the silver at Rio Olympics.Saina, who had won the bronze at London Games, had suffered a career-threatening knee injury to crash out early from the Rio Games and spent the next few months recovering and scripting her way back to the top.Sindhu, meanwhile, scaled new heights in international badminton after winning the 2016 China Open, India Open and Korea Open this year, besides winning the silver at the Glasgow World Championship.Saina, 27, who had won the silver in 2015 World Championship, bagged a bronze at the Glasgow edition to show that she was getting back to her best.The men's singles final is also expected to be a close affair.Srikanth and Prannoy have played four times in their international career but it was the former who had the last laugh on the last three occasions.The only time Prannoy had beaten Srikanth was way back at the 2011 Tata Open.Srikanth has been in the form of his life as he clinched four titles after reaching five finals this season to join the likes of two-time former Olympic champion Lin Dan, three-time Olympic silver medallists Lee Chong Wei and current Olympic gold medallist Chen Long.Prannoy too have been in fine form as he reached the semifinals at Indonesia Super Series Premier and French Open Super Series to achieve his career-high ranking of World No 11.He had outwitted Chong Wei twice and defeated Chen once during this season.Among others, mixed doubles combo of Satwik Sai Raj R and Ashwini Ponnappa will face top seeds Pranaav Jerry Chopra and Sikki Reddy N after they emerged winners following the retirement of their semifinal opponents Sanyam Shukla and Sanyogita Ghorpade midway in the first game.Pranaav and Sikki, however, had to dig deep to stave off a spirited challenge from Alwin Francis and Aparna Balan 21-16, 22-24, 21-8 in a match that lasted a little over an hour.Top seeded women's doubles pair of Sikki Reddy N and Ashwini Ponnappa will meet Sanyogita Ghorpade and Prajakta Sawant in the final.The top seeded combo defeated Aparna Balan and Sruthi KP 21-10, 21-14, while Sanyogita and Prajakta outlasted Rutaparna Panda and Mithula UK 18-21, 21-12, 21-16 in another semi-final.
Mary Kom: Mary Kom, Sonia enter Asian Boxing Championships final:::::HO CHI MINH CITY (Vietnam): MC Mary Kom (48kg) remained on course for a fifth Asian Championships gold after making the finals along with Sonia Lather (57kg) while five others settled for bronze medals at the continental showpiece on Tuesday.Former world champion L Sarita Devi (64kg), Priyanka Chaudhary (60kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), Seema Punia (+81kg) and Shiksha (54kg) signed off with bronze medals after losing their respective semi-final bouts.Mary Kom started the day brightly for India, defeating Japan's Tsubasa Komura in a unanimous 5-0 verdict to make the summit clash for the fifth time in her six appearances at the event.Should she go on to win the final on Wednesday, which will be against North Korea's Kim Hyang Mi who got the better of Mongolian Nandintsetseg Myagmardulam, the Indian would be claiming her first Asian gold medal in the 48kg category."It is a very special medal for me like all others I have won because every medal has a story behind it," Mary Kom said."I am delighted to be in the final.I was expecting a tough fight but I managed to figure Komura out early enough.I am already looking towards the final but I am not going to think too much and put pressure on myself," she said."I will just go out and do my best, just like I have done so far in this tournament."The 35-year-old Rajya Sabha MP, who is also a former Olympic bronze-medalist, returned to her preferred weight category after five years of competing in 51kg, which was made an Olympic category in 2012.Once again, it was a bout fought largely on defensive tactics.The Japanese boxer seemed too wary to go near the Indian, who had to quite literally lunge at Komura for her right hooks to connect.Mary Kom's patience with Komura's tactics ran out in the second round and she increased the pace and ferocity of her own attacks to unsettle the Japanese.The shell guard to stave off Komura's feeble right straights ensured that the Manipuri hardly took any blow in what turned out to be a lopsided contest.Sonia, in contrast, had to steer past a very aggressive Yodgoroy Mirzaeva, who lacked accuracy in placement of punches but not persistence.Mirzaeva's wild swings were easy to deflect for the Haryana-boxer, a former silver-medallist at this event, but it was nonetheless a draining contest given the Uzbek's relentless attempts at connecting something.In the end, Sonia was unanimously adjudged the victor and will be up against China's Yin Junhua in the summit clash tomorrow.However, things went downhill for India after that as Asian Games bronze-medalist Sarita went down to China's Dou Dan in the semi-finals.Shiksha too ended with a bronze medal after being out-punched by Chinese Taipei's former youth world champion Lin Yu-Ting in the semi-finals.Also signing off with bronze medals were Priyanka and Lovlina.Priyanka lost to Korean Oh Yeonji, while Lovlina went down to Kazakhstan's Valentina Khalzova.In India's last bout of the day, Seema, who got a direct entry into the semis courtesy the small size of the draw, lost to Kazakhstan's Guzal Ismatova to end with a bronze medal.
Either improve intercepting skills or stay at No. 6: India hockey coach:::::BENGALURU: Chief hockey coach Sjoerd Marijne warned that India will always remain at number six in the world rankings if the players don't improve their ball-intercepting skills.After winning the Asia Cup, the Indian team is gearing up for the Hockey World League Finals , to be held in Bhubaneshwar from December 1-10."I think we can improve in every area.The Players need to improve intercepting balls because launching counter attacks is one of the strong points of India.We are too good at that and we can be a danger for any country.If we can't do that (improving ball interception), we will always be number six," Marijne said.The World rankings are led by Argentina and they are followed by Australia, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany.The coach, who replaced sacked Roelant Oltmans , further emphasised that the Indian team needs to work on consistency."Sometimes we are really good but the level drops too low, and if we do not work on it, rival countries would get goals against us.We need to work on consistency," he said.Talking about the Hockey World League Finals, Marijne expected some surprise results."If you consider the rankings, Argentina are number one team in the world and Australia are number two.But, there are few others, like Spain, who did good things this summer.Competition in men's hockey is getting tougher and tougher.We may get to see some surprise results, which is good for global hockey," he said.Marijne though said it's difficult to predict how India will fare in the tournament."I don't want to put ourselves in pressure situation, but there could be some underdogs among lower-ranked teams.I cannot promise India winning Hockey World League, but I would like them to go for it."While talking about India's Asia Cup title-triumph, Marijne appreciated leadership qualities displayed by some players."In some crucial matches, players made quick on-field decisions to turn matches in our favour.I am very happy with this leadership qualities of our players, who turned the heat on the rivals at right moments," Marijne said.Normally, it is Sreejesh, SV Sunil, Harmanpreet Singh and Sardar Singh , who lead from the front and make on-field decisions, he said.

IOA executive council overrules president, shifts AGM venue:::::NEW DELHI: In a big blow on the authority of Indian Olympic Association IOA ) president N Ramachandran , the executive council decided to shift the venue of the Annual General Body from Chennai to New Delhi against his wishes besides reversing another decision taken by him.Ramachandran did not attend the emergent executive council meeting called by secretary general Rajeev Mehta after 19 of the 27 members of the top decision making body demanded it.In Ramachandran's absence, senior vice president Virendra Nanavati chaired the meeting.Twenty-one of the 27 executive council members attended today's meeting while vice-president Anurag Thakur expressed inability to attend it as he was busy with assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh.Ramachandran has already called a meeting of executive council in Chennai on November 9.He has also called the AGM on December 14 in Chennai to elect the new office bearers of the IOA, including the president and secretary general."The decision taken today will be ratified at the Executive Council meeting called by the president on November 9 in Chennai," Mehta said.Ramachandran's support in the council has been reduced to a few members and if some are to be believed he can be removed from his post before or during the AGM on December 14.He now faces the prospect of being outmanoeuvred by his rivals at his home turf in the IOA power struggle as all the members who attended the meeting today decided to be present in the meeting called by him on November 9."The executive council today decided to hold the AGM in Delhi instead of in Chennai on December 14.We have also named the election commission and returning officer to conduct the elections on December 14 during this AGM.All of them are the same as those who conducted the elections in February 2014," vice-president Tarlochan Singh said.Asked if it is legal to hold an executive council meeting on the demand of the members and not by the president, Tarlochan said, "Under the IOA Constitution, the Executive Council can also called a meeting.If the majority of members want a meeting, the president or the secretary general will have to call it."There is overwhelming majority, 19 out of 27 wanted this meeting and today 21 turned up.This is totally legal.The president should have been graceful enough and attend this meeting.But unfortunately, he chose not to attend this.Neither he called the meeting nor attended it."The meeting also decided to reject the arbitrators appointed by Ramachandran in the factional feud in the Andhra Pradesh Olympic Association.Another vice-president R K Anand lashed out at Ramachandran for creating unnecessary trouble despite being ineligible to contest elections as per the age limit of 70."We are not following the Lodha Committee recommendations but we are totally following the National Sports Code as far as tenure and age limit guidelines are concerned.Ramachandran is 69 and I think he will be 70 sometime in August next year.He is not eligible to contest for the post of president," Anand said."The post of IOA president is four years.A candidate will have to fulfil the qualification to remain in office for four years before contesting the election," he said.The members though did not go the extreme and did not take any decision on a motion by Hockey India to take action on Ramachandran for tarnishing the image of the IOA.HI had cited Ramachandran's recent action to appoint arbitrators on his own without consulting anybody and the attempt to recognise the erstwhile Indian Amateur Boxing Federation as a clear attempt to please Abhay Singh Chautala who once headed the body."We did not want to take the extreme step because we don't want controversy.It is better if he (Ramachandran) is sidelined automatically.If he continues to create issues we will not leave him," said Anand, who is also the president of Jharkhand Olympic Association.

Future arrives, a little late, as Next Gen revolution begins:::::MILAN: The future arrived late but after some old-fashioned glitches, two Russian trailblazers fired the first shots in what could be a revolution in tennis at the Next Gen ATP Finals on Tuesday."Tennis Re-invented" is the catchphrase of the tournament launched this year by the ATP to showcase the young men it hopes will lead it towards a brave new world, together with a raft of innovations designed to catch a new wave of tennis fans.Sunday's botched draw ceremony branded as "sexist" and "trashy" was hardly what the ATP had in mind - forcing them and sponsors Red Bull to apologise after players had to select glamorous models to determine their round-robin group.And all the talk of new technology, gizmos and enhanced fan experiences looked a little lame when, minutes before Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev were scheduled to appear for the tournament's opening salvos, workmen were still welding pieces of the temporary stadium together.It hardly felt state-of-the-art.Yet once the crowds, many of them children, eventually filled the humongous aircraft hanger-sized hall at the Fiera Milano, there was much to savour as Khachanov and Medvedev showcased their considerable skills - and the new rules that would make traditionalists wince.There is a school of thought that men's tennis, still in the midst of its golden era, is not broken.So don't fix it.Yet the ATP knows the clock ticks ever louder on the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - who are all in their 30s.Hence it wants to promote the "Next Gen" led by Germany's Alexander Zverev , who withdrew from Milan to concentrate on playing with the 'grown ups' at next week's ATP Finals in London.With a black hole looming, that is why they have invested so much time and effort into making the Milan event rock.Featuring the top seven players in the ATP rankings aged 21 and under - minus world number three Zverev - and with an Italian wildcard, it is tennis on fast forward.On a two-tone blue singles only court, backdropped with a deep red mock-up of Milan's iconic La Scala opera house, things did feel very different indeed.For starters sets were played to four with a tiebreak at 3-3.With no advantage points, deuce effectively became 'sudden death'.Five of the first six games of the match, eventually won by Medvedev in one hour 48 minutes, were decided that way.A shot-clock ticked away in the corner to enforce the 25-second rule between points - ironic considering the tardy start.Electronic Hawkeye calls replaced line judges with an automated, rather unnerving, British accented voice calling instantaneously "OUT" or "FAULT".Italian crowds don't need an excuse to make noise and the scrapping of any requirement for them to stay silent, or stay still during play, meant a constant hubbub soundtracked the action.Experienced Brazilian chair umpire Carlos Bernardes still presided over the action - yet even he got left behind.In the second game of the third set he instinctively called out "let" when a Medvedev serve flicked the net - forgetting that service, for this week at least, are fair game.Another novelty was the sight of the players wearing headphones at the end of sets - not to listen to their favourite tunes, but to take advice from their coaches.Any notion that the tournament would be a "hit and giggle" affair was quickly put to bed by action between world number 45 Khachanov and Medvedev, ranked 20 places lower.They did the organisers proud as Medvedev hit back to win the Group B match 2-4, 4-3(6), 4-3(3), 4-2.
Big hearts, sharp minds bowl over India's Italian boxing coach:::::GUWAHATI: Left thoroughly "confused" by the sheer enormity of India at first, the country's first foreign coach for women youth boxers, Raffaele Bergamasco , says the "big hearts" and "sharp minds" of his wards have only added to his astonishment three months into the job.Bergamasco, who has coached the Italian youth and senior teams of both men and women, took up the Indian offer in July this year."From 2001 to 2007, I was coaching the elite women's Italian team.From 2008 to 2016, I coached men - youth and elite - for Italy.I have participated (as a coach) in three Olympics - Beijing, London, Rio," Bergamasco said.Bergamasco's trial by fire starts at this month's Youth World Championships for women, scheduled from November 19 in Guwahati.Asked to speak of his India experience so far, Bergamasco spoke fondly of the roller-coaster ride, which also included learning English and Hindi to add to the fluent Italian he is accustomed to."Being in India has been very very enjoyable.The first day I came here, it was very confusing.It's a very big country with a lot of people but after two days, I fell in love with India."I have been studying English for five days a week otherwise it would have been very difficult for me.I have to speak to so many people all the time in the camp, so it was important for me," he explained."I have also learnt some Hindi.I can say 'namaste', 'namaskaar', 'aap kaise ho?(How are you)," he said grinning.Bergamasco, under whose tutelage the Italian boxers have gone on to win world and European level medals, said he foresees a bright future for India."India is a very strong boxing nation because of two qualities which I did not see in my Italian boxers.A big big heart, and a very sharp mind.They have to work a little bit on the technical aspects such as coordination," he said."India's future is very bright.Boxing will be very big in India.The boxers in India have what it takes to get an Olympic gold medal," he predicted.Bergamasco was also full of praise for the Indian coaches who are working with him, including chief coach Bhaskar Bhatt "I can only say thank you to the Indian coaches who are working with me.They are a very good team, they helped me in picking up English.Step by step I think, we are getting in sync in planning," he said.Asked what the aspects he wants to improve in Indian boxing, Bergamasco said, "They have to change diet, change timing to ensure that every aspect of training is compartmentalised.They are adapting slowly although.I know it has been difficult for them."
Olympic marathon champion Sumgong gets four-year ban for EPO:::::Olympic marathon champion Jemima Sumgong of Kenya has been banned four years for using the banned blood-booster EPO Sumgong's ban was announced by the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya , which ruled Sumgong ineligible from April 3.The gold medalist at the Rio de Janeiro Games failed an out-of-competition doping test on February 28.She declined to have her backup "B" sample tested.Sumgong argued at a tribunal that she had tested positive for EPO after seeking treatment at a Kenyan hospital for an ectopic pregnancy.She said she was given a blood transfusion and other unknown medication by an unidentified doctor.The anti-doping agency rejected the explanation after Sumgong failed to provide documents relating to her visit to the hospital.Last year, Sumgong became the first Kenyan woman to win Olympic gold in the marathon.
Sandhu, Ghosal, Tandon advance to quarters:::::MUMBAI: Former national champion Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu entered the quarter-finals of the main draw by shocking Malaysian seventh seed Ivan Yuen in four games in the $50,000 CCI International JSW Indian Squash Circuit 2017 on Tuesday.Sandhu, who came through two rounds of the qualifiers in the PSA event to enter the main draw, showed greater application and skill to topple his higher ranked Malaysian rival 4-11, 11-6, 11-2, 11-2 in 51 minutes at the Cricket Club of India.In another surprise, wild card Ramit Tandon of India shunted out the number 8 seed Abdulla Mohd al Tamimi of Qatar 11-7, 4-11, 11-4, 11-3 in 45 minutes to join compatriot Sandhu in the quarters.India's main hope, third seed Saurav Ghosal , hardly broke a sweat as he outclassed English qualifier Joshua Masters to make it a triple delight for the Indian fans.Ghosal, ranked 21st in the PSA circuit, simply outclassed Masters 11-4, 11-2, 11-3 with a flurry of brilliant shots that brooked no answer from his bewildered rival to enter the quarters.Sandhu, ranked 69 in the world, took time to settle down against his 46-ranked Malaysian rival to drop the opening game.But he took control of the match from there on by running up big leads early in each of the next three games.He led 6-1 in all these games and did not allow Yuen to fight his way back.In fact the Malaysian, who was penalized on quite a few occasions for coming in the Indian's way, seemed to throw in the towel once the lead became too big in all the games.Sandhu hit fluently on both flanks, was the faster of the two and took the ball early.He also played some excellent drop shots to fox his rival.[Q] Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu (IND) beat [7] Ivan Yuen (MAS) 4-11, 11-6, 11-2, 11-3; Joel Makin (WAL) beat [6] Chris Simpson (ENG) 11-8, 8-11, 11-6, 8-11, 11-7; [Q] Mazen Gamal (EGY) beat [4] Omar Abdel Meguid (EGY) 4-11, 11-7, 11-3, 8-4 (retired); [5] Nicolas Muller (SUI) beat [Q] Ammar Altamimi (KUW) 11-7, 8-11, 11-5, 11-7;[WC] Ramit Tandon (IND) beat [8] Abdulla Mohd al Tamimi (QAT) 11-7, 4-11, 11-4, 11-3; (4) Saurav Ghosal (IND) bt (Q) Joshua Masters (ENG) 11-4 11-2 11-3.
IOC suspends Frankie Fredericks after France charges:::::LAUSANNE: Former world sprint champion Frankie Fredericks was on Tuesday suspended by the International Olympic Committee in the wake of corruption charges brought against him by French authorities.The IOC Ethics Commission, while stressing the "importance of respecting the principle of the presumption of innocence", recommended suspending the Namibian four-time Olympic silver medallist because of "the impact on the reputation of the IOC".The IOC's executive board duly added: "Considering the gravity and urgency of the situation and its impact on the reputation of the IOC, the IOC EB decides to suspend Mr Frank Fredericks from all the rights, prerogatives and functions deriving from his quality as an IOC Member."Fredericks, who denies any "involvement in untoward conduct", is being investigated by French authorities over a $299,300 (262,000 euros) payment he received from Papa Massata Diack, son of ex-International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) president Lamine Diack , on October 2, 2009 -- the day Rio won the bid.Fredericks appeared before a Paris judge last Thursday.French investigators are looking into the possibility that bribes were paid over the awarding of both the 2016 Olympics to Rio and the 2020 Tokyo Games.The investigation centres to a large extent around the activities of Papa Massata Diack, who along with Lamine Diack also faces charges in France over millions of dollars paid to cover up doping failures by Russian athletes.Fredericks insists that the payments, first revealed by France's Le Monde newspaper in March, were received for promotional services provided between 2007 and 2011 under a contract signed on March 11, 2007, and had nothing to do with the Olympics.Following the corruption allegations, 50-year-old Fredericks stepped down as head of the IOC committee evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics.The IAAF provisionally suspended Fredericks from its ruling council on July 17 as it launched a probe into the corruption allegations against him.
Premier League: West Ham appoint David Moyes as new manager:::::LONDON: West Ham have appointed former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes as their new manager, the struggling Premier League club announced on Tuesday."We believe David is the right man to turn things around and get the best out of the players at the club," joint chairman David Sullivan said.The Hammers sacked manager Slaven Bilic on Monday after a poor run of results that have left the east London side languishing in the relegation zone.Sullivan believes Moyes, 54, is the perfect choice to steer the club to safety."We need somebody with experience, knowledge of the Premier League and the players in it, and we believe David is the right man to turn things around and get the best out of the players at the club."He is highly regarded and respected within the game, and will bring fresh ideas, organisation and enthusiasm."Moyes has been out of management since he resigned from Sunderland at the end of last season, having failed to save them from relegation.Despite that, and an underwhelming stint in Spain with Real Sociedad, Sullivan and his co-chairman David Gold are backing him to help shore up a leaky defence as well as getting the best out of big-money summer signings Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez Bilic was let go following a chastening 4-1 loss to Liverpool at the London Stadium on Saturday that leaves them 18th in the table and facing a fight for Premier League survival.Bilic, who also played for West Ham, is the fourth Premier League managerial casualty of the season following the departures of Crystal Palace boss Frank de Boer, Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare and Everton's Ronald Koeman.
Hockey: 'Jobless Goalkeeper' Savita hopes Asia Cup win ends nine-year wait:::::NEW DELHI: India goalkeeper Savita Punia has received many accolades for her on-field heroics but she could not secure a job for herself despite all the success in a nine-year international career.Last Sunday, Savita produced a stunning save in a tense shootout in the thrilling final against China to help India win the Asia Cup women's hockey title and secure a berth in next year's World Cup.The team broke a 13-year-old jinx when Savita foiled an attempt from the rivals to ensure a 5-4 win.India had failed to qualify for the last World Cup and finished ninth in the 2010 edition."I am very happy that I could contribute in team's win.I work harder to bring more laurels and will not let my unemployment affect my game," Savita said after team's return from Japan."I have been trying for a job for last nine years.I was promised a job under the Haryana Government's 'Medal Lao, Naukri Pao' scheme, but I have only been given assurances by officers."I am 27 now and still depend on my father's income.I am playing for my country for last 9 years and every time after a win, I hope to get a job but nothing changes."Savita, who hails from Hisar, made her international debut in 2008 and has just completed 150 caps in Asia Cup.She started playing Hockey as per the wish of her grandfather Mahinder Singh and starred in India's bronze medal effort in Junior Asia Cup in 2009."I should take care of my parents but it is opposite in my case.My father is a pharmacist and it is not easy to run a family with his solo income," said Savita.She had also applied for a coaching job with SAI after Rio Olympics but did not get any response from them."Sometimes I get very tense when I see my parents.My mother is worried that I don't have a job.My father encourages me to do well and I never let my game affected with my unemployment.But it is constantly in my mind when I am out of the ground," she said.Savita hopes that Asia Cup win will help her to get a job."We have a sports minister who has been an Olympic medallist.I hope he will understand this and this title win also help me to get a job," she said while giving credit to goal-keeping coach Bharat Chhetri and chief coach Harendra Singh for her performance."I also hope that this will raise the profile of women Hockey in India and more girls will take up the game."
IOA: Chautala shows up at IOA meeting before making a hasty retreat:::::NEW DELHI: Tainted former IOA president Abhay Singh Chautala showed up at the emergent executive council meeting of the Indian Olympic Association without any invite on Tuesday before making a hasty retreat after some members objected to his presence.Chautala, whose election as IOA president in December 2012 was declared null and void by the International Olympic Committee , barged his way into the meeting hall at the IOA Bhawan and sat for around 10 minutes.Later one executive council member G S Mander objected and requested the chair to expel non-members.The meeting also passed a resolution that whatever is being said by any non-member of the council will not be recorded.IOA secretary-general Rajeev Mehta said Chautala was not invited for the meeting."We have not invited him for the meeting.He came on his own.He sat for around 10 minutes and after opposition from Mr Mander he left the meeting hall.""We cannot throw him out but after the resolution was passed he left."When Chautala was asked when he came for the meeting, he said, "I just came to meet the people and say hello to them."The election of Chautala and Lalit Bhanot as president and secretary-general in December 2012 led to the IOA being banned by the IOC till February 2014.The IOA was forced to amend its constitution to bar charge-framed individuals who committed offences which could attract more than two years jail term from being elected as office bearers.
Ashes: Steven Finn ruled out of Ashes with knee injury:::::SYDNEY: England fast bowler Steven Finn has been ruled out of the Ashes series against Australia after scans showed he has torn his left knee cartilage, the England and Wales Cricket Board ECB ) said on Tuesday.The 28-year-old quick, a 2010-11 and 2013-14 Ashes tourist, missed the opening tour match in Perth after sustaining the injury in practice last week."...(Finn) will now return to the UK in the 48 hours where he will meet a knee specialist to ascertain whether he will have an operation," the ECB said in a statement, adding the board will announce a replacement later.All-rounder Moeen Ali , who has a side strain, will miss this week's day-night match against a Cricket Australia XI but was on track to be available for a return to action in the warm-up game in Towsnville starting November 15."Mo Ali ... more precautionary now, we will just leave him out of this one and make sure he's right," England coach Trevor Bayliss told reporters in Adelaide.Finn was added to the squad as a replacement for Ben Stokes after the all-rounder was suspended following his arrest on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm outside a nightclub.Bayliss also responded to reports in the Australian media on Tuesday that said Stokes would soon face a England and Wales Cricket Board disciplinary hearing and could join the squad in time for the third Test."I haven't spoken (to anyone) or heard of anything since we have been here," said Bayliss."If we concentrate on that, and wondering if he is coming or not, that might take the focus off what we're trying to achieve so we have just been going about preparing with the players we have got here."If he happens to turn up at some stage, it's a bonus.If he doesn't, bad luck, we will just get on with what we have got."ECB director of cricket Andrew Strauss said England were looking for "clarity" over Stokes's position.England begin their campaign to retain the Ashes at the Gabba in Brisbane on November 23.
ML Jaisimha: ML Jaisimha, the cricketer who sent back Suchitra Sen's champagne:::::They remember his walk; its languid cool.Blend that with the fresh creased flannel, the upturned collar, the easy charm.Even film-stars indulged him.The Hyderabad batsman, a biography says, once returned a bottle of champagne sent by diva Suchitra Sen with the words that it meant nothing unless she delivered it herself.She did eventually.ML Jaisimha truly walked through life like it was a breeze.But Jaisimha was much more than a Page 3 star cricketer before Page 3 had been born.Business professor Aaron Levenstein once aptly said that "statistics are like a bikini.What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."In Jaisimha's case - 2056 runs in 39 Tests with three centuries at an average of 30.68 and nine wickets - they hardly capture the impact and influence that the cricketer had both on and off the field."His audacious batting could light up a stadium but he could also play to the needs of the team and shut down one end," Test cricketer Abbas Ali Baig told TOI.The two had played alongside since school.Fellow Test cricketer Chandu Borde said that he was an elegant player with beautiful timing."And he was among the first of his generation who started playing lofted shots," he said.Jai, as friends called him, is also known to have played the reverse sweep.Jaisimha's Test career spanned over 12 years, from 1959 to 1971.In his very second Test, he set a world record batting on all five days (20 not out and 74) and earning a draw for India against the formidable Australia in 1960.Nobody had done it before.Even in his last Test innings, his obdurate 23 in an 81-run stand with Sunil Gavaskar (220) was vital in India's first series win (1-0) over the West Indies.Captain Ajit Wadekar acknowledged Jaisimha's contribution in his autobiography, My Cricketing Years."He held on, though shaken by a barrage of bouncers, to enable us draw the final Test," he wrote.Jaisimha's finest cricketing moment came against Australia in 1968 when he almost single-handedly took India to the verge of an improbable win scoring 74 and 101.He had walked into the game as a mid-tour replacement for an injured B S Chandrashekhar.The incredible backstory of him reaching Australia is graphically recounted in his biography My Way, penned by Hyderabad-based sports journalist A Joseph Antony with Jayanthi, the cricketer's wife.Jai, son of a real estate construction magnate, hopped from Madras to Singapore to Perth to Sydney to Brisbane, "merry-making" all the way.After reaching the hotel, he again had an "all-night drink and discussion with (captain) Tiger Pataudi."He had no time to practice at the nets.After watching him bat, cricketer-writer Jack Fingleton praised his "correct upright stance, free and flawless backswing of the bat with strokes on all sides.His footwork is exemplary.So one fell to wondering why this debonair and elegant batsman shaping excellently in crisis was not in India's original side."In his autobiography Sunny Days, Gavaskar described Jai as, "one of the shrewdest cricketing brains in the country."Baig says he was a born leader."He was a shrewd observer who could assess a match situation in no time.He led the Hyderabad with distinction for so many years.His only fault is that Hyderabad never won the coveted Ranji Trophy under him," he said.It's a tribute to Jai's reputation as a skipper s that MAK Pataudi played under him for Hyderabad while Jaisimha played under the Nawab for India.Youngsters profited from his words of wisdom.Stories of his generosity, especially in helping out young cricketers, are legion.Wrote Gavaskar: "Jaisimha nursed me on my first tour with the Indian team to the West Indies in 1970.So little wonder then that I should name my son 'Rohan Jaivishwa'".Interestingly, Jaisimha wrote the foreward of Sunny Days while Gavaskar returned the compliment in Jai's biography.Recalling his teenage years, the Mumbai batting maestro recalled that "it was clear as soon as we arrived in Hyderabad that he (Jai) was everybody's hero.The youngsters were all trying to walk and even bat like him.When he came for practice, everybody dropped everything and watched him."Jaisimha died of lung cancer at the age of 60 in 1999.Baig says: "He was quite a phenomenon.It was a privilege to play along with him."One time, my father hung a poster of Karl Marx in my bedroom;

Weightlifting: North Korea not among entrants for world champs in U.S.:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Weightlifting powerhouse North Korea are not on the list of entrants for this months world championships in the United States.The countrys lifters, who have won five Olympic gold medals since 2008, were expected to shine in Anaheim, but did not feature on the entry list released by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on Tuesday.North Korea gave no explanation for not entering a team for the championships, which take place from Nov. 28-Dec. 5.It would be the first time North Korea has failed to send a team to the worlds since 2009, when the hosts were South Korea.The North Koreans chances of dominating the competition had improved drastically after the IWF cracked down on doping and China, Russia and seven other nations were banned for one year.North Korea have never topped the medals table at a world championship in any major sport but excel at weightlifting.Diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, however, have escalated in recent months, with U.S. President Donald Trump vowing to halt the countrys nuclear ambitions.The World Championships organizing committee had said last month it did not foresee any visa problems for the North Korean team.In recent years weightlifting has become the most successful sport for North Korea, who came second in the medal count at the London 2012 Olympics and fourth in Rio de Janeiro last year.They have also made the top four at the past three world championships.
NFL opposes U.S. Republican tax plan on stadium funding:::::(Reuters) - The National Football League said on Tuesday it opposes a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans that could force teams to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction.FILE PHOTO: The NFL logo and set are seen at New York's Radio City Music Hall before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft April 25, 2013.REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Under the legislation unveiled last week, local governments could no longer fund the building or renovation of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax-exempt, public-purpose bonds, the sort of bonds typically used to fund schools, libraries and public transit.According to the NFL, building new stadiums enhances economic development in cities that are home to the venues and federal tax breaks should be available.You can look around the country and see the economic development thats generated from some of these stadiums, NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told a conference call.These sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country, so we will continue to make our opposition known on that.President Donald Trump has called for an end to the subsidy, at least for the NFL, after some of its players angered the Republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system.His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in 2015.A report last year by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based social sciences research group, found that of the 45 major-league stadiums built or overhauled since 2000, 36 were at least partly funded by tax-exempt municipal bonds.The NFLs Oakland Raiders are expected to begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020 and construction on a new stadium is already underway.Lockhart refused to what, if any, impact the bill could have on the viability of the new stadium.That is a hypothetical at this point and wed have to see how the final bill comes out, he said.What gets proposed out of the writing committee from the party in control very often is not what is eventually signed into law, so well have to see where that goes.
FIFA demands visa, work permit and tax exemptions for 2026 World Cup:::::MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - The United States and other countries hoping to host the 2026 World Cup should provide government guarantees on visa-free travel plus work permit and tax exemptions for their bids to be accepted, according to documents published by FIFA on Tuesday.The logo of FIFA is seen in front of its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland September 26, 2017.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann The U.S wants to host the 2026 tournament in a joint bid with Canada and Mexico, who would also have to commit to the government guarantees for their proposal to be accepted by soccers world governing body.Morocco is currently the only other country to have indicated they will bid for the finals, which will be the first to feature an expanded 48-team field.FIFA wants a visa-free environment, or at least non-discriminatory visa procedures, while the work permit exemptions apply to anyone involved with the World Cup and tax exemptions relate to the soccer governing body and its subsidiaries.While FIFA has asked for - and received - similar exemptions in the past, their inclusion in a revamped World Cup bid process will mean the current U.S. administration of President Donald Trump will need to sign off on the exemptions.Sunil Gulati, chairman of the joint U.S, Mexican and Canadian United Bid Committee has previously stated that Trump supports the attempt to bring the World Cup to the United States, which hosted the 1994 finals.FIFA produced new bidding criteria after the organization was heavily criticized over the selection process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals, won by Russia and Qatar respectively.Formal submission of the completed bids has to be made by March 16, 2018 and FIFA will decide whether to select one of the candidate bids at their congress in June next year, or re-open the process if none of the bids are accepted.OVERVIEW DOCUMENT Regarding immigration and travel guarantees, the FIFA overview document on government guarantees states: In order to cover the needs of the respective groups of individuals, the Government is requested to generally establish a visa-free environment or facilitate existing visa procedures for them.Regardless, any visa procedures must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.As a presidential candidate, Trump called for a total ban on Muslims entering the U.S. as a counter-terrorism measure.The courts have blocked his latest executive action barring entry into the United States for people from several Muslim-majority countries.The FIFA document adds however that: It is understood that such ease of access to the Host Country/Host Countries must by no means adversely affect the national immigration and security standards in the Host Country/Host Countries.The document also says a bidding nations government is requested to guarantee the issuance of valid work permits unconditionally and without any restriction or discrimination of any kind to people involved in the preparation, organization and hosting of the tournament.It adds that the government must grant a general tax exemption for FIFA, the 2026 FWC (FIFA World Cup) Entity, the 2026 FWC Subsidiaries (if applicable) and any other FIFA subsidiary limited to the period of preparation, delivery and wrap-up of the Competition, commencing on the date of appointment of the Host Country/Host Countries and ending on 31 December 2028.FIFAs enhanced bidding guidelines are part of a series of reforms enacted after a corruption crisis in 2015 engulfed the organization.They include ethics, human rights and transparency commitments plus demands on stadium size and infrastructure.

It Can Take a Mountain of Money to Raise a Winter Olympian:::::American ice dancing duo Rachel and Michael Parsons, left, and snowboarder Mike Trapp.They've all spent tens of thousands of dollars a year on training as they vie to go to the Olympics.The rewards for competing in the Olympics this winter in Pyeongchang are largely symbolic for the vast majority of athletes who won't win medals or sign lucrative endorsement deals.And the financial strain their years of training puts on their families can hit hard."Its a daunting challenge," said Richard Parsons, whose two eldest children are the reigning U.S. and world junior ice dance champions.Rachel and Michael Parsons' win at the 2017 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Taiwan this year marked a milestone in their quest to compete at the 2022 Olympics if not sooner, should they clinch the spot as alternates for Team USA at the 2018 Games.Once theyve qualified for the Olympics, athletes flights, accommodations, food and training are paid for by the United States Olympic Committee.But getting to that point?That's on the athletes, and often their families.Olympic Hopefuls Gear Up for Winter Games American Olympic hopefuls are doing everything they can to be ready for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) The cost of the Parsons' 12-year journey thus far has been over $500,000, to cover the ice time, coaching, choreography, dance classes, costumes, ice skates, registration fees and travel expenses necessary to help Rachel and Michael compete at the elite level on the international stage, their dad said."When they were starting out, it was just a thousand or two a year early on.Then it started ramping up steadily as they started competing nationally and then internationally," Richard Parsons said, noting the annual expenses increased from an average of $40,000 a year to $75,000 last year.And the Maryland family is not an outlier in how much it spends eye-popping expenses are par for the course for most Olympians.Parsons said some teams in their sport spend more than $100,000 a year to train at the elite level.Mike Trapp, the 2011 and 2012 U.S. snowboarding champion, said an average season training costs about $35,000 in equipment, coaching and traveling expenses.It's more expensive in a year leading up to the Olympics.The native of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, is training in Italy ahead of World Cup qualifiers in December and January.In order to score a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, Trapp needs to finish in the top three in one of five events taking place in Italy, Austria and Slovenia.It took nearly two decades of training and discipline, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars, just for Trapp to reach the cusp of Olympic selection.Rachel and Michael Parsons.Photo credit: Daphne Backman/Ice-dance.com FUNDING THE 'A TEAM' The United States is one of the only countries with an Olympic committee that is not supported through funding from the federal government.The separation was established in 1978 with the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which gave sole control over Americas representation in the games to the USOC and the various sports' national governing bodies under the committee.Under this legislation, the USOC has complete control over the intellectual property associated with the Olympic Games, giving it exclusive distribution rights over logos and other licensing material.The autonomy also means the USOC is responsible for raising and allocating all of the funding needed for the U.S. to compete in the Olympics and Paralympics.It does this through trademark licensing, corporate sponsors and broadcast revenue.Some of the money is also distributed to various sports' national governing bodies to help fund athlete development.Richard Parsons said that once his kids made the jump to the junior level in ice dancing they began receiving support from the U.S.Figure Skating Association, which helped offset some of their costs.The money is allocated based on performance, or "likelihood that an athlete will win a medal," according to Team USA spokesman Mark Jones.This pay-for-performance model leaves some organizations struggling to support their athletes.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "U.S.Ski and Snowboard can only fund the A team," Trapp said.As a B team member, Trapp, who moonlights as a mechanic during his summers, has had to foot the bill for his training."I'm doing this all on my own dime," he said."That job keeps the dream alive."The A team is fully funded in the U.S. ski teams budget, which allocates about $100,000 per athlete annually, according to U.S.Ski President Tiger Shaw."But theres a $2 million funding gap in paying for travel costs for B and C team athletes."Members of the B and C teams are billed $15,000 to $20,000 at the beginning of each season to close the gap.Shaw acknowledged that is a significant amount of money, but the only other option, he said, is to cut half the team.He said the organization works with the athletes to help them find sources of revenue.EXPENSIVE SCHOOLING Like many elite athletes competing in snowsports, Trapp attended a ski academy during his formative school years, albeit part-time.From sixth to 11th grade, Trapp transferred out of his regular school curriculum for part of the year to train at Waterville Valley Academy in New Hampshire, where tuition for a three-month season cost $15,000, not including equipment and race fees.That figure pales in comparison to the $55,000 tuition Olympic gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin paid to attend Burke Mountain Academy in Vermont full-time.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) Shiffrin was born in Vail, Colorado, "an epic ski town," she told NBC.Both her parents and her older brother are skiers, and they grew up with skiing as their "family recreational sport."She recalled starting out in a kids' "Fresh Tracks" training program by age 5.When it came time for high school, the prodigy who was already winning races opted for a ski academy.She gained entrance to one of the country's most exclusive ski academies, where Shiffrin trained for hours each day, learning "a lot about time management" and "being responsible."Shiffrin went on to claim gold in the slalom in Sochi.But it's not just expensive to attend an exclusive training program.To even be considered for admission to an elite ski school, applicants usually need a solid foundation in skiing and a resume of winning races."You had to apply and get in, and part of that process obviously is showing your skiing resume you couldnt just be a beginner," said Gordy Megroz, a graduate of Stratton Mountain School in Vermont.And though some ski schools offer junior classes for skill-development training, "realistically youd need to live within four or five hours of the ski area to be able to get to practice, races and lessons," said Megroz, highlighting the geographical difficulties some aspiring athletes face.He learned to ski growing up in Vermont, he said, by standing on his father's and grandfather's skis when he was as young as 2 years old.He started competing when he was 10.His parents drove him to races on weekends."You have to pay for everything from season passes to equipment to race fees," Megroz said."Its certainly an expensive sport no disputing that.People who get into ski racing probably are pretty affluent."Former U.S.Ski Team coach and co-founder of the alpine skiing World Cup, Robert "Bob" Beattie, said the cost of ski racing is pricing out talent who have no income and "killing our sport.""We're only getting kids with money," Beattie said in a March interview with the Aspen Times."Kids like Billy Kidd, Jimmie Heuga and Buddy Werner would never be ski racers now.They could never afford it.Their parents didn't have that kind of money."Kidd and Huega became the first American men to win Olympic medals in skiing, taking silver and bronze respectively in the slalom at the 1964 Games.'WE'VE HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES' Chasing the Olympic dream is a risky venture, and for most families, raising an Olympic athlete is a tremendous investment with no guarantee of a monetary return.Many Olympians are young, and a lot of their expenses are covered by

Still Obsessing Over Tonya and Nancy Nearly 25 Years Later:::::Pop quiz, hotshot.Where were you the evening of Feb. 25, 1994?Well, if you're over the age of 35 it's a fairly safe bet you were huddled around a television that night watching Olympic figure skating.But this wasn't just any Olympic ice skating.It was appointment television because it was was Tonya Harding versus Nancy Kerrigan, the Super Bowl of ice skating showdowns.And the appeal had nothing to do with their competition on the ice.Their duel would become the third-highest-rated sporting event ever to that point.Long before the days of Facebook or Twitter or any social media, when people still largely digested their information from newspapers and the evening news, the showdown between Kerrigan and Harding captivated the nation.And to this day we're still not over it hence the upcoming film starring Margot Robbie and Amy Adams, "I, Tonya."It was on Jan. 6, 1994 at the U.S.Figure Skating Championships in 1994 just one month before the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway that Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee leaving skating practice.Video of her plaintively screaming "Why?Why?"amid sobs played on endless loops on the evening news for days afterward.In a 2013 "Today" show interview, Kerrigan spoke about the horrific incident."Watching anything sort of horrific, its disturbing to see anybody in pain," Kerrigan said."To think its me its a lifetime ago.It hurts to see anybody in such pain.Its a long time ago.I just moved on."Check Out the New Olympic Skating Stadiums South Korea is ahead of schedule in constructing venues for the 2018 Winter Olympics and NBC got an exclusive tour of the arenas that will host skating events.Some of the biggest events of the games will take place here.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) It was later revealed that Jeff Gillooly, Harding's then-husband, had hired Shane Stant to maim Kerrigan in a bid to knock her out of the upcoming Olympics.To this day, Harding disputes her level of involvement, but she was ultimately convicted of hindering the investigation.Harding received three years' probation, 500 hours of community service and a $160K fine, and was banned from the U.S.Figure Skating Association for life.But before all that, she was free to compete in Lillehammer, and she did.After a series of mishaps, Harding came eighth.Kerrigan, healed from the attack, took home silver.Not surprisingly, over the past 23 years, the lives and careers of Harding and Kerrigan careened along distinctively different paths.Kerrigan was inducted into the Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004, has served as a special correspondent covering various Olympic Games and this year, at age 47, returned to spotlight by competing on "Dancing with the Stars."Welcome to Pyeongchang: A Look Inside the 2018 Olympic Venue The years weren't as kind to Harding.She released a sex tape showing her with Gillooly, was arrested on domestic violence charges in 2000 and appeared on Fox's "Celebrity Boxing" in 2002.Now, thanks to the upcoming film, a new generation will get to relive the Kerrigan-Harding feud.This is the VERY FIRST LOOK at @itonyamovie also starring @imsebastianstan and #allisonjanney Coming soon to theaters!A post shared by @margotrobbie on Oct 19, 2017 at 8:34am PDT "To be honest, when I read the script, I didnt know who Tonya Harding was, and I didnt realize it was a true story," Robbie, who plays Harding, told Vanity Fair."I thought it was entirely fictionalized and our writer Steve was so creative to come up with the quirky characters and absurd incidents."Robbie is not the first to portray Harding onscreen.Both Melanie Hutsell and Amy Poehler parodied her on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," in 1994 and 2002, respectively.Tina Yothers played the athlete in Comedy Central's spoof, "Spunk: The Tonya Harding Story" in 1994, as did Alexandra Powers in NBC's drama, "Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story" in 1994.Robbie told Vanity Fair after the film was completed she and the director screened it for Harding, who was moved to tears."I think it is a lot for someone to have the most traumatic events of their life encompassed in a two-hour film," Robbie said."I feel like you have to be very brave to let someone do that.I dont know if I could do that, and she handled it incredibly."Pyeongchang 2018: The Comebacks
The Pyeongchang Olympics Are Encouraging Visitors to Stay in a Buddhist Temple:::::The Woljeongsa Temple is a short drive from the Olympic Stadium.Visitors walk through an ornate temple gate.A serene path lined with fir trees leads visitors to 60 temples and eight monastaries, some dating back nearly 1,400 years.Thousands of sports fans from all over the world will descend on Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in February, and many will book traditional accommodations.But why book a hotel room or an Airbnb when you can stay in a Buddhist temple?South Korea's tourism organization is encouraging tourists to lodge in sacred temples for part of their stay during the games to learn about traditional Korean Buddhism and culture, experience the daily life of a monk and breathe fresh mountain air.More than 30 Buddhist temples around South Korea open their doors to visitors, at least five of them in Gangwon Province, where the Winter Games will take place.Sometimes, we want to escape from everyday life and rejuvenate our minds and bodies in nature, reads the official Pyeongchang Olympics website.One of the best ways to do so is to take a temple stay trip....It could be a perfect time to refresh your mind and body.When the world conceives of South Korea, it usually thinks of its military standoff with North Korea, K-pop music and global brands such as Samsung and Hyundai, said David A. Mason, an American professor of Korean tourism at Sejong University in Seoul.Mason has lived in South Korea for more than 30 years, and was part of the committee that helped create the Temple Stay program that opened up the South Korea.With our Temple Stay program, we can show an entirely different and balancing side of Korea: the quiet simplicity and subtle beautiful artworks, charming aspects like the green tea ceremony, beautiful mountains and a profoundly deep enlightened spirituality with roots 1,600 years deep -- the Outside-of-the Seoul-urban part of Korea, Mason told NBC in an email.On a typical day in a temple, guests are awoken at 4 a.m. by a moktak, a wooden percussion instrument used for the morning chanting ceremony.Visitors can practice Buddhist meditation and other traditions such as lotus flower making, wood block printing and cooking communal meals of rice and vegetables are cooked and served in moderate amounts so there is no waste.Leisurely walks through the forest are encouraged.Despite the tranquil imagery, tourists should keep in mind that staying in a mountain temple in the depths of winter wont be as comfortable as in spring or fall, except for people who love cold, Mason said.But on the other hand, having this unique and very pleasant experience of authentic Korean traditional culture might well be the most memorable part of many tourists visit, he said.'These Spiritual Burpees Are a Real Test' Mohammed Sami, who stayed at the Woljeongsa temple in Pyeongchang in January of 2015, said not everything went as expected during his stay with his girlfriend.The couple, visiting from Toronto was looking forward to guided meditation sessions and making lotus flower lanterns, but neither of these activities were offered at the time of their stay because there were too few people, they were told.Still, they took part in bead making and prayer services and enjoyed breathing the fresh mountain air, and Sami said he'd recommend that others stay there as part of the Temple Stay program.Even in the bone-chilling winter, it's a wonderful place to experience, especially when the entire place is covered in snow, Sami said in an email.The pagoda in the middle of the the temple is beautifully lit up at night.The ceremonious ringing of the bells and banging of the drums by the monks is definitely something to experience; you do get to strike the bell yourself.The pine tree forest close by is really calming.It occurred to one temple visitor that his temple would actually be more work than relaxation when he realized how often he would have to sit cross-legged.Journalist Andrew Sun, who described himself as a "meat-eating, Facebook-addicted non-believer" in an article in The South China Morning Post, stayed at the Beomosa temple near Busan.Making prayer beads, which was meant to be a sort of meditation in motion, was more of a physical struggle than he had expected, Sun wrote."The drill is that for each bead we insert the string through, we must perform a full prostration from a standing position," Sun wrote, adding that there were 108 beads total and they had to maintain a strict tempo."These spiritual burpees are a real test and most of the group fall behind or resort to a kneeling bow."Sun said he only managed to clear his mind toward the end of his 24-hour stay."Im not sure I feel enlightened, but at least Ive stopped caring that my phones battery is almost dead," he wrote.Buddhism's Revival in South Korea The idea of foreign tourists staying in their temples was not originally welcomed by the Jogye Order, the representative order of traditional Korean Buddhism.They were imagining drunken European soccer hooligans burning down their temples, Mason said.But Mason and the rest of the special tourism committee, created in 2001 by former president Kim Dae-Jung to build new tourism initiatives, convinced the order to try out the concept when they presented it as a missionary opportunity for tourists interested in Buddhism and as a means of spreading the heritage of Korean Buddhism and traditional Korean culture.For 500 years, Buddhism was suppressed in South Korea, forcing monks to take refuge in monasteries deep in the mountains and exiled from most of civilization.But as of the late 20th Century, when paved roads and electric lines were brought into those temples (and now full internet and cellphone access, with other luxuries), these are now some of the best places to live -- grand monasteries right inside national parks and provincial parks, amidst the best scenery of the nation, Mason said.Foreign tourists aren't the only ones taking advantage of this program.South Koreans from Seoul often stay in these temples as a low-priced health spa option and to reduce the stress from urban life, Mason said.A night in a temple starts at about $44 per night for an adult, with stays ranging from two days to up to a month.Day trips are also available starting at $27.The the official Temple Stay website provides more details and reservation information.Although it was created by the government, the Temple Stay program was handed over to the Jogye Order in 2005 after a few years of operation.Mason calls this "a textbook excellent case of how religious tourism should be run by the religion themselves, even if government and commercial interests help get the program going, in order to keep it 'authentic' and not 'Disneyfied.'"

Would a US Men's Ice Hockey Gold in 2018 Be Another Miracle?:::::The NHL will not allow its players to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics.Mens head coach Tony Granato is up for the challenge of putting a competitive team on the ice with players from college and other leagues.The Winter Olympics are approaching against a backdrop of nuclear-armed tension, NHL players won't be playing in the hockey tournament and the men's team from Russia is the distinct favorite to win gold.What was true in 1980 is also shaping up as the situation for Team USA at the 2018 Olympics.The NHL has refused to let its players represent their countries at the games, but the bona fide Russian stars playing in the world's second-best hockey league, the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League, can still make the trip to Pyeongchang.Bookies have Team Russia as the front-runner in the run-up to the 2018 Games, while some of the Americans playing may be unknown even to serious hockey fans.Still, if you ask the captain of the "Miracle on Ice" team, it won't count as a miracle if the group of American college kids and professionals playing in minor leagues or abroad beats Russia this time around.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "We're a good team, we're not unknowns anymore.The days of the 'Miracle on Ice,' those days are over," said Mike Eruzione, now director of special outreach at Boston University."1980 will never happen again."Russia has won four world championships in the last decade, but it's a perennial underachiever at the Olympics, last medaling in 2002 and only winning silver before that.Russia was eliminated by the U.S. in the first round at the 2014 Sochi Games despite being on home ice.The Soviet team, by contrast, won gold in seven of nine tries.But Russia's time may be at hand, after the NHL said in April that it would not disrupt its season for 17 days to accommodate Olympic play.NHL players have participated in the Olympics since 1998.The KHL, which features teams from across Europe and one in China, has plenty of Russian players who were all-stars back in North America.Ilya Kovalchuk, who once led the NHL in goals, retired from the New Jersey Devils in his prime to move to Russia.He could have returned to the U.S. over the offseason this year, but has called the Olympics "one of the main factors" in deciding against it.His SKA Saint Petersberg teammates, Pavel Datsyuk and Slava Voynov, won Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings and L.A. Kings, respectively.(Voynov went to jail on a domestic violence charge in 2015, then decamped for Russia.)Meanwhile, the all-time highest-scoring foreigner in the KHL is Brandon Bochenski, a Minnesota native who's relatively unknown stateside but was the captain of Barys Astana in Kazakhstan.He retired this year with 154 goals in seven KHL seasons, after scoring just 28 goals in five years in the NHL.Bochenski last played for the Kazakh national team he's a newly minted citizen.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) U.S. men's coach Tony Granato is picking players for his roster among Americans playing abroad, in domestic minor leagues (unless their contract would allow them to play in the NHL) and in colleges.The list will be announced around Jan. 1.The Team USA line-up for an international Olympic tune-up tournament this November offers a glimpse into who will be playing in Pyeongchang, and it lacks the star power of their Russian rivals.Brian Gionta, who won a Stanley Cup in 2003 with the New Jersey Devils, is the most recognizable name on the list, but the 38 year old is eligible for the Olympics only because no NHL team signed him this year.The other player on the list with prior Olympic experience is Ryan Malone, 37.He last played in the NHL in 2014 and retired before suiting up again this year for the Iowa Wild of North America's top minor league, the American Hockey League.He has one assist in eight games, in which his team has been outscored by eight goals when he's been on the ice (excluding power plays).But navigating the Olympics without NHL players isn't bothering coach Granato."I think we have a tremendous talent pool of players that are available to us," Granato said."We'll be able to put together a fun team, an energetic team and a skilled team that'll make the Americans proud."Granato noted the way players in the U.S. grow up dreaming of wearing the jersey: "You're playing in the basement of your house and you're pretending like you're Mike Eruzione and Jim Craig and Mark Johnson."Eruzione is, of course, familiar with winning against a much-hyped team from Russia, scoring the game-winning goal in the "Miracle" game and taking the gold-medal podium as Team USA's captain.But despite the long odds, he always thought they could make the podium."I always tell people, if you think you're going to lose, you probably will," Eruzione said.He knows all the ex-NHL stars that Russia will have in 2018, while the U.S. will be missing guys like Patrick Kane and budding stars Auston Matthews and Jack Eichel.But he noted some very big differences between his team and today's that make it hard to compare the two.For one thing, his 1980 team had six months of training to gel as a team, while none of the top Olympic teams will train together for anything like that much time.Eruzione's team had an average age of 21, while this team will probably be much older.Oh, and the U.S. junior players, some of whom are in contention to make the team, are the reigning world champions, having beaten Canada in a shootout.Team USA Concerned About N. Korea, But Trusts USOC With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., how do Olympic hopefuls feel about traveling to South Korea for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games?(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) "I don't see this as being a super huge challenge, other than coming together as a team," Eruzione said.He knows one of the college players who starred on that victorious world junior team, Jordan Greenway, from his work at Boston University, where Greenway is a junior.He's an "awesome kid," big and competitive, Eruzione said, and definitely has a chance of making the team."It's obviously a big change," Greenway said of the NHL's decision not to participate in the Olympics."I think everyone's really excited just to kind of see how it turns out."Eruzione didn't have too much advice for the collegiate players who may end up taking the ice against some of the best Russian players of their generation with the whole world watching.They already have plenty of international experience, he said."You're still playing on a sheet of ice.Who's in the crowd is really irrelevant," Eruzione said."Just go out there and play."

WNBA Star Says She Was Sexually Abused in Powerful Post:::::A file photo of Breanna Stewart of USA Basketball Women's National team during a game at Galen Center on July 25, 2016, in Los Angeles.Stewart says she was the victim of sexual abuse as a child.The Seattle Storm forward describes the abuse in an essay posted Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, on the Players Tribune website.Former UConn basketball star and current forward for the Seattle Storm Breanna Stewart detailed in a blog post Monday that she suffered sexual abuse as a child.Simply titled "Me Too," a nod to the social media movement started following abuse allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, Stewart wrote about a two-year period of sexual abuse that took place at a relative's house, beginning when she was 9 years old."I don't know how to say this part.I haven't told many people," she wrote."I'm not the most vulnerable person - I don't talk about my feelings much - so this is uncomfortable."The blog appeared Monday morning in The Players' Tribune, a website that allows professional athletes to connect with fans in their own words, according to the site.Stewart included details of how the abuse would happen and how she felt helpless."I couldn't sleep.I was always on guard."She talked about the night she decided, as an 11-year-old, to wake up her mother and tell her what had been happening to her.Stewart's parents called police and the man, who she describes as a construction worker who smelled like cigarettes and dirt, confessed and was arrested, according to Stewart.She said she immersed herself in basketball.In fact, the day of her predator's arrest, she told her father she wanted to go to basketball practice that night.Her basketball skills took her from her home near Syracuse, New York, to UConn, where she won four National Championships and left as one of the most popular players in Huskies' history.'Late Night': Pompeo Talks 300 Episodes of 'Grey's Anatomy' Ellen Pompeo tells Seth Meyers about how she thought every year would be the last year of "Grey's Anatomy.""I can't believe people aren't sick of me yet," she says as the show celebrates its 300th episode (Published Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2017) Now with the WNBA's Seattle Storm, Stewart says she still carries horrible memories with her."Even though I play in front of thousands of people or talk to reporters all the time, I have quiet moments every day that no one sees," she wrote."Thats often when I think about it.I could be surrounded by my teammates or friends or complete strangers, living life as I normally would, and memories like lightning will strike."She said after recently reading Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney's account of sexual abuse she feels "less alone."Stewart said her father has always told her that one day she might be comfortable enough to talk publicly about what happened to her and that she may even save someone's life."That's why I'm writing this," she added."This is bigger than me."Stewart, the first overall pick in the 2016 WNBA Draft, was named WNBA Rookie of the Year for the 2016 season.

Trade grades: Who wins the Bledsoe-Monroe deal?:::::The deal Bucks get:?Guard Eric Bledsoe Suns get:?Center Greg Monroe, protected first-round pick and a protected second-round pick From the moment he sent his now-infamous "I Dont wanna be here" tweet, Bledsoe was an obvious fit for the Bucks.Bledsoe's long arms -- his wingspan measured 6-foot-7?at the NBA draft combine in 2010, more than 7 inches greater than his height without shoes -- and strength should make him an ideal defender for Jason Kidd's system, which utilizes length and recovery speed to trap and prevent offenses from finding open shooters on the weak side (as ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz detailed earlier this year).The question was always whether Milwaukee could find a trade package that satisfied Phoenix's needs without surrendering promising youngsters Malcolm Brogdon or Jabari Parker.Ultimately, because Bledsoe's trade value was so low, the Bucks were able to hold on to Brogdon and Parker and use a first-round pick as the carrot for the Suns, according to the trade being finalized as reported by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe.That came at a cost in terms of the matching salary.Instead of getting off the bad, longer-term deals for Matthew Dellavedova, John Henson or Mirza Teletovic, Milwaukee was forced to give up center Greg Monroe in addition to the pick.Dealing Monroe hurts the value of this trade for the Bucks in both the short and long term.For the remainder of this season, Monroe was likely to be Milwaukee's best center.While he was off to a slow start before being sidelined with a calf strain, Monroe was the only Bucks 5 who provided much offensive punch, averaging 18.8 points per 36 minutes on efficient .572 true shooting last season, as compared with 14.5 per 36 for Thon Maker and 12.6 per 36 for Henson.During 2016-17, Milwaukee outscored opponents by 3.7 points per 100 possessions with Monroe on the court, per NBA.com/Stats, and was minus-2.2 per 100 with him on the bench -- worst for any player on the roster, even star Giannis Antetokounmpo.Eventually, the Bucks may be confident they can replace Monroe's scoring as part of the second unit with Parker, who could slot into a reserve role when he returns from a torn ACL suffered last February.Still, Parker is months away from playing, and Milwaukee's best chance at making noise in this season's playoffs would include him, Bledsoe and Monroe.The bigger challenge presented by trading Monroe may come next summer, when his contract would have expired.Bledsoe is signed for $15 million in 2018-19, a reasonable sum for a starting point guard but still one that will make it more difficult for the Bucks to avoid paying the luxury tax -- probably a non-starter for a small-market team without a track record of success.Adding Bledsoe's salary moves Milwaukee within $16 million of the projected 2018-19 luxury-tax line ($122 million) with Parker as yet unsigned.(After failing to come to terms on an extension before the deadline earlier this month, Parker will be a restricted free agent next summer.)If Parker plays well after his return, the Bucks could be vulnerable to another team making a big offer to him in restricted free agency and forcing them into the tax by matching.Milwaukee can save $7 million by waiving Teletovic and stretching the final season of his contract, but that would leave the team with cap hits for both Teletovic and Spencer Hawes (waived this summer) for the next two seasons.And, of course, the Bucks now have one fewer first-round pick (and one fewer second-round pick as well) to use either for a cost-controlled salary as the team's payroll rises or to help offload bad salaries.Those caveats noted, this is still a trade worth making for Milwaukee.The Bucks got Bledsoe at an incredibly low cost in terms of assets, even getting protection on the first-rounder in case things go south to mitigate the risk.Adding Bledsoe while keeping Brogdon gives Kidd the ability to get 48 minutes of quality play at point guard, where Dellavedova has been ineffective, as well as playing both players together in ultra-versatile lineups.While he has more tools at his disposal, the pressure on Kidd to win now surely ratchets up following this trade.Dealing picks for a starter who will soon turn 28 accelerates the Bucks' timetable to win the next two seasons, before Bledsoe becomes an unrestricted free agent who will be difficult for Milwaukee to re-sign given the team's tax limitations.Phoenix Suns: C Because contracts aren't always zero-sum, getting Monroe doesn't help the Suns as much as it hurts the Bucks.Surely, Phoenix demanded Monroe instead of one of Milwaukee's longer-term deals once the Bucks weren't willing to include Brogdon or Parker (or multiple first-round picks).Still, unless the Suns can get off one of their other long-term deals, they've created only marginal cap space (an estimated $13 million or so, pending the Milwaukee pick) for the summer of 2018 by trading Bledsoe for an expiring contract.The summer of 2019, when Tyson Chandler and Jared Dudley come off the books, remains a better time for Phoenix to get active in free agency.For now, the team will have to hope that space can be used to add additional draft picks (or young talent) by taking on salary from teams that need to clear cap room or are ducking the luxury tax.The Suns could also maximize their return for Bledsoe by shipping Monroe to a third team prior to the deadline.He could have some value as a quality player on an expiring contract between now and February, though the market for centers is limited right now.Moving Monroe early could also help Phoenix clear a roster spot to convert starting point guard Mike James' two-way contract into an NBA deal without waiving second-year wing Derrick Jones.Pending those additional moves, this return for Bledsoe has to be considered something of a disappointment.Consider that the Minnesota Timberwolves traded Ricky Rubio last summer for a first-round pick and no salary in return.Rubio's value surely wasn't as high as Bledsoe's at the time, and while the first-rounder the Timberwolves got no longer looks as good as Milwaukee's because the Oklahoma City Thunder subsequently added Paul George and Carmelo Anthony, Minnesota got huge benefit from clearing enough cap space to sign Jeff Teague and Taj Gibson as free agents.Last summer was surely the time to move Bledsoe, whose unhappiness on a losing team was predictable -- particularly after the Suns sat him out after last year's trade deadline to pursue a better pick.Bringing Bledsoe back, and subsequently sending him home after his apparent subtweet, did nothing to improve his trade value.Given that situation, Phoenix probably did as well as could be expected.The market was unlikely to move dramatically between now and the trade deadline unless a huge injury created a need for a point guard.At least this way the Suns get to move on with an additional draft pick in hand.UPDATE: ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski has reported the details of what Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel described as "unique" protection on the first-round pick going from the Bucks to the Suns.Phoenix will get the pick only if it falls from 11-16 this year -- so the least four spots in the lottery or bottom two among playoff teams -- or 4-16 in 2019.By 2020, the pick is top-seven protected, and if it hasn't conveyed by 2021 the Suns will get it unprotected.Because of the narrow band for the pick to convey this season, most likely Milwaukee will keep it.(Neil Johnson of ESPN Stats & Info noted that their Basketball Power Index model currently gives the pick a 32 percent chance of conveying, but that doesn't account for the likelihood the team improves after adding Bledsoe.)I also suspect the Bucks will be good enough in 2018-19 to pick outside the top 16.So I think the most likely scenario is Phoenix won't see the pick until 2020.At that point, there's a lot of uncertainty about where Milwaukee might pick.The Bucks could be substantially improved if their young talent, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, grows into the core of a contender.But there is a risk that Bledsoe's free agency could leave Milwaukee weaker by 2019-20.The Suns have given themselves the potential upside of an unprotected pick in 2021, the last year of Antetokounmpo's current contract.The Bucks keeping this year's pick would also mean they would have somewhat less wiggle room with regard to the 2018-19 luxury tax, while Phoenix would create a bit more cap room for the summer of 2018.Ultimately, I like the protections a tiny bit more for Milwaukee because of the greater value of a current pick over one down the line.But the protections do convey much more potential downside for the Bucks than standard lottery protection.
Nike 'working to implement a solution' after string of jersey tears:::::After at least five of Nike's NBA jerseys ripped on players this season, the world's largest shoe and apparel giant has acknowledged it will make substantive changes.The company, which signed an eight-year, $1 billion deal with the NBA that began this year, said in a statement provided to ESPN on Monday night that the initial product presented to teams needs more reinforcement."Nike has always put the athlete at the center of everything we do and we have worked hard to create the most advanced uniforms in the history of the NBA," the company said in the statement."They are lighter and deliver great mobility and sweat wicking characteristics, and the feedback from players has been overwhelmingly positive.However, during game play we have seen a small number of athletes experience significant jersey tears.We are very concerned to see any game day tear and are working to implement a solution that involves standardizing the embellishment process and enhancing the seam strength of game day jerseys.The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance and we are working with the NBA and teams to avoid this happening in the future."Nike did not reveal how many jerseys, if any, will be discarded in the process.When they ripped, Nike's jerseys didn't just tear, they fell apart on the biggest of stars and in ways that made video of the moments spread quickly on social media.In the closing minutes of an opening-night game, the jersey of?Cavaliers?star?LeBron James, Nike's highest-paid current NBA player, ripped down the middle.Eight days later, Nike president and CEO Mark Parker told CNBC that "we've isolated the issue and we feel like we've got command of the situation and feel good about where we are."But it didn't end.Warriors?forward?Draymond Green's jersey ripped in a fight with the?Wizards'?Bradley Beal, and last week?76ers?rookie?Ben Simmons' jersey completely tore after being tugged at while he was fighting for a rebound.Cavaliers forward?Kevin Love had to go the locker room after his jersey tore when he pulled it over his head.While the jerseys tore on some of the most high-profile players in the league, Nike has seemingly skirted any criticism from the players; all five -- including the?Lakers'?Tyler Ennis, whose jersey tore in the first preseason game -- are Nike spokesmen.NBA players have dealt with torn jerseys in the past, but not with this frequency.The authentic NBA jersey made by Nike promises to dry 15 percent faster than the previous Adidas jersey, and it is partly made out of recycled bottles.A similar version of the jersey was used in the 2016 Olympics with no known issues.Despite the embarrassment for Nike, there have been no known complaints from consumers about the jerseys they've purchased, which has minimized the business impact of the mistake.
One-game suspension of Bucs WR Mike Evans upheld:::::Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver?Mike Evans' one-game suspension for drilling New Orleans Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore in the back on Sunday has been upheld by appeals officer James Thrash, the league announced Tuesday."I want to sincerely apologize for my actions during Sunday's game," Evans said in a statement Tuesday."I saw my quarterback getting shoved and I let my emotions get the better of me.My response was not appropriate and not a true indication of who I am as a player and a person.I take pride in playing the game the right way and I realize it was unprofessional and hurt my team."Evans will miss Sunday's game against the New York Jets and will be eligible to return to the Buccaneers' active roster on Nov. 13.With a base salary for 2017 of $690,000, Evans' one-game suspension this week will cost him $40,588.23 in lost wages.Evans was flagged 15 yards for running across the field and drilling Lattimore in the back, then pouncing on Lattimore when he hit the ground.A Saints player then tackled Evans to get him off Lattimore.The dustup started when Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston -- who was not playing at the time -- pushed Lattimore in the back of his helmet while appearing to suggest that he go back to his own sideline.Lattimore turned around and shoved Winston in the chest.Then Evans flew in for the tackle.Before the suspension was announced Monday, Buccaneers coach Dirk Koetter called the actions of Evans and Winston "totally unacceptable.""Totally, totally unacceptable behavior, first by Jameis and then by Mike.Jameis cannot, under any circumstances, come off the sideline when he's not even playing in the game.And trash talking is trash talking, but to go out and tap another player, touch another player, whatever you want to call it at all on the field -- that's inexcusable," Koetter said."The Saints player responded and then Mike responded.That's not acceptable either.That's not having your teammates' back.That's just wrong."Evans leads the Buccaneers in receptions (40), targets (72) and receiving yards (532), and his four touchdown receptions are tied with Cameron Brate for the team lead this season.Information from ESPN's Jenna Laine contributed to this report.
Auburn holding out Danjel Purifoy, Austin Wiley during investigation:::::Auburn?will leave forward Danjel Purifoy and center Austin Wiley on the sideline indefinitely as the school sorts through what it calls "potential eligibility issues."The Tigers hosted Barry University for an exhibition game Thursday night, a game Barry won 100-95.The regular season begins Nov. 10 against Norfolk State."To avoid any potential eligibility issues, Auburn Athletics has decided to hold men's basketball players Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy out indefinitely," the school announced in a statement."Because this is related to an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further at this time."The move to sit the two sophomores is believed to be related to the FBI investigation into college basketball corruption that included the arrest of Auburn assistant coach Chuck Person.Person, who was suspended without pay by the university, is facing six federal charges, including solicitation of bribes and bribery conspiracy.According to the federal complaint, Person is alleged to have received roughly $91,500 from a cooperating FBI witness in order to influence student-athletes at Auburn to hire the witness in a financial advisory role.The complaint involved two unidentified Auburn players, whom the school would not name.Wiley, a 6-foot-11 from Hoover, Alabama, averaged 8.8 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in 23 games last season.He has not been practicing during the preseason while nursing a leg injury.Purifoy, who is from Centreville, Alabama, played in 29 games last season, averaging 11.5 points and 4.7 rebounds.
Former star pitcher Halladay killed in Florida plane crash:::::Roy Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner who pitched a perfect game and a playoff no-hitter for the Philadelphia Phillies, died Tuesday when his private plane crashed into the Gulf of Mexico.He was 40.Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said during a news conference that Halladay's ICON A5 went down around noon off the coast of Florida.The sheriff's office marine unit responded and discovered Halladay's body in shallow water near some mangroves.No survivors were found.Police said they couldn't confirm if there were additional passengers on the plane or say where it was headed.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.Halladay, who retired after the 2013 season, was an amateur pilot who often posted on social media about small planes .His father was a corporate pilot."I have dreamed about owning a A5 since I retired!Real life is better then my dreams!!"Halladay tweeted on Oct. 13.ICON aircraft had posted a video with Halladay trying out a new plane.The video showed Halladay taking delivery of a new ICON A5, a two-seat "light-sport aircraft" that can land on water.In the video, Halladay said the terms of his baseball contract prevented him from having a pilot's license while playing, and that his wife was originally against the idea of him getting the aircraft."She's fought me the whole way," Halladay said."Hard.I fought hard.I was very against it," Brandy Halladay said in the same video, before explaining why she eventually understood and approved of her husband's desire to have the plane.The couple have two sons, Ryan and Braden.Halladay spent 12 seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays followed by four seasons with the Phillies.He was 203-105 with a 3.38 ERA and an eight-time All-Star."Such a sad day," former Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard tweeted."We lost a great ball player but an even better human being."Other baseball players to die in plane crashes included Pittsburgh Pirates star Roberto Clemente in a relief mission from Puerto Rico traveling to earthquake victims in Nicaragua on New Year's Eve in 1972; New York Yankees catcher Thurman Munson piloting his own plane near his home in Canton, Ohio, in 1979; and Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle piloting his own plane in New York City in 2006.Halladay was nominated several times for the Roberto Clemente Award, given by Major League Baseball to players for sportsmanship and community involvement.The Halladay Family Foundation has aided children's charities, hunger relief and animal rescue.A 6-foot-6 right-hander, Halladay was a throwback on the mound.Durable and determined to finish what he started, Halladay won the AL Cy Young in 2003 after going 22-7 and the NL prize in 2010 after going 21-10."You know, if my career's two years, three years shorter than it could have been because I wanted to go out and pitch deep into games, I'm fine with that," he said in a retirement news conference.In 2011, Halladay was part of the "Four Aces" rotation in Philadelphia with Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels and Roy Oswalt.Halladay and the Phillies lost 1-0 to St. Louis in the deciding Game 5 of the NL Division Series."To the world, Roy was one of the best pitchers in baseball, but to me, he was an inspiration, a great mentor, teammate, and most important, a friend," said Hamels, now with the Texas Rangers."His preparation and work ethic has and will forever be ingrained in me.Roy was a man of few words, but he lit up when his boys were around.His family and this game were everything to him, and there will never be a day in my own life that I won't miss him."Chris Bourjos, the Toronto-area scout who signed Halladay, first saw him pitch in St. Louis in the summer of 1994, before his senior season as a prep star in the Denver area.Halladay's family had a pitching mound in the basement of its home."Perfect pitcher's body, tall, lean athletic.And the velocity!At that time, 93 miles an hour was pretty special," Bourjos, the father of Tampa Bay center fielder Peter Bourjos, recalled Tuesday.Nocco, the sheriff, personally knew Halladay."Many of you know Roy as a Cy Young winner, future Hall of Famer, one of the best pitchers ever to pitch the game of baseball," Nocco said."We know Roy as a person, as a caring husband who loved his wife, Brandy.He loved his two boys tremendously ... and we are so sad for your loss."Nocco said Halladay knew many members in the sheriff's office, and that Halladay was part of a charity fishing tournament last Friday."He was probably one of the most humble human beings you'll ever meet," Nocco said."For somebody who won two Cy Youngs, one of the greatest pitchers in baseball, he would walk in the room as if he was anybody.Didn't matter who he met, he was kind, generous.His family purchased a dog for us K-9 Doc.K-9 Doc is out there working, saving lives, making our community safer."The dog was named as a nod to Halladay's nickname Doc."He was one in a million," Nocco said."It is a true loss for us."The A5 was a newer model from ICON, based in Vacaville, California.According to the NTSB's website, two other ICON A5s crashed earlier this year, the only reported U.S. accidents involving the aircraft since it debuted three years ago.Both were attributed to pilot error.Last May 8, an A5 crashed into the side of a canyon during a flight at Lake Berryessa, California, killing the pilot and his passenger.The NTSB ruled the crash was caused by the pilot flying too low, causing the plane to strike the canyon wall.A month earlier, another A5 made a hard landing in the water off Key Largo, Florida, injuring the pilot and his passenger.The pilot told investigators the plane descended faster than he expected.He tried to abort the landing but the plane struck the water, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.The NTSB ruled that the pilot had failed to properly maintain his descent rate.ICON declined to comment after Halladay's crash.Halladay was an old-style workhorse who pitched 67 complete games and 20 shutouts.A three-time 20-game winner, he was with Toronto (1998-2009) and Philadelphia (2010-13).Halladay pitched a perfect game for the Phillies at the Florida Marlins on May 29, 2010.That Oct. 6, against Cincinnati in the NL Division Series, he became only the second pitcher to throw a postseason no-hitter, joining Don Larsen, who accomplished the feat for the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series.In his second big league start, Halladay held Detroit hitless for 8 2/3 innings.When he retired, Halladay said he wanted to avoid back surgery."As a baseball player, you realize that's something you can't do the rest of your life," Halladay said."I really don't have any regrets.You realize there's other things for you to accomplish in life."He is eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2019."Absolutely I would love to be there," he said during spring training this year, when he was a guest instructor for the Phillies."I think every player who ever played the game would love to be there.It would be a tremendous honor."In a statement, the Blue Jays said the organization "is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one the franchise's greatest and most respected players, but even better human being.Impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.""I wanted to be Roy Halladay.I'm heartbroken, rest easy Doc ," tweeted former pitcher Dan Haren, who posted a photo of a signed Halladay jersey .More AP baseball:

GOP tax bill would have impact on pro, college sports:::::The Oakland Raiders decided to move to Las Vegas largely because Clark County, Nevada, agreed to finance a new stadium with $750 million in tax-exempt bonds.Now, that tax exemption could be going away, leaving the county on the hook for even more money.The GOP tax reform bill released last week would bar state and local governments from issuing tax-exempt bonds for stadium construction, a common feature of stadium deals over the past two decades.It's one of a few reforms in the bill that would affect the world of sports.Getting rid of stadium subsidies has long been a popular talking point in Washington, and it's not a partisan issue, either.Former president Barack Obama's 2015 budget sought to do away with the tax exemption for stadium bonds.President Donald Trump asked in a tweet last month why the NFL was getting "massive tax breaks" amid the controversy over players kneeling during the national anthem."Change tax law!"Trump tweeted.And Congress apparently listened."It's good policy," said Ted Gayer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the lead author of a study on stadium subsidies."It's always been kind of a no-brainer politically and, I think, economically."The Brookings study, released last year, found that the federal government subsidized stadium construction to the tune of $3.2 billion since 2000.During that stretch, 36 stadiums were built or renovated in part with tax-exempt bonds.The Raiders' stadium would get a $120 million tax break if the law isn't changed, according to the Brookings analysis.Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, and Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, cited those figures when they introduced a bill earlier this year to end the subsidies.Rep. Steve Russell, an Oklahoma Republican, introduced a similar bill in the House."Using billions of taxpayer dollars for the subsidization of private stadiums when we have real infrastructure needs in our country is not a good way to prioritize a limited amount of funds," Lankford said."Tax reform could be a unique opportunity to enact this into law.I'm pleased this idea is gaining momentum."The NFL argues that communities benefit from stadiums because they create jobs and spur economic development, but many economists say cities never recoup their investments and that the financing deals amount to handouts for wealthy team owners.A new stadium can cause the value of a professional franchise to skyrocket."We've always believed the construction of new stadiums and renovations of existing stadiums are economic drivers in local communities," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said."If the idea is to promote economic growth, this would be a step backwards."Getting rid of the tax exemption would have a negligible impact on federal revenue, bringing in $200 million over 10 years, according to the bill.Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat and a proponent of the stadium deal, said the bill would harm her district, which includes Las Vegas."Eliminating the tax exemption for stadiums could cost Clark County more money to build projects that are already underway," Titus said in a statement."This is an attack on local governments that will take money away from our communities and hamper infrastructure nationwide."The elimination of a tool that NFL owners use to defer the costs of new stadiums could be seen as an irony given many owners' support for Trump, who is pinning his hopes on the tax-reform package as he seeks a major legislative accomplishment.Redskins owner Dan Snyder was one of several owners who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, and he's looking for a site to build a new stadium.A Redskins spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Even if the bill becomes law, teams will still find ways to build stadiums with public money, Gayer said."The overwhelming amount of the subsidy comes at the local level, not at the federal level," he said."What's driving that is, if you're Las Vegas and you want a team, you can't just create a football team.You have to entice a team.There's a fixed supply ... and that creates these bidding wars."IMPACT ON COLLEGES The bill would also get rid of a tax deduction that many universities use to entice donors to buy season tickets, and it would levy a new 20 percent tax on salaries of public university employees who make more than $1 million many of whom are football and basketball coaches.Many schools require donors to give thousands of dollars to a booster fund in exchange for the right to purchase tickets.Eighty percent of the amount donated is tax-deductible, and the schools tout the tax benefits as an enticement to give.Getting rid of the deduction will harm athletic departments that use the contributions to fund sports that don't generate revenue, said Liz Clark, director of federal affairs at the National Association of College and University Business Officers."We do know that for some athletic programs, that this can be a critical source of revenue," Clark said."Eliminating this deduction will hurt the revenue stream and will make it harder for those programs to meet expenses."Duke University, for example, requires donations of at least $4,000 per seat for the right to buy coveted men's basketball season tickets at Cameron Indoor Stadium.Michael Schoenfeld, vice president of public affairs and government relations at Duke, said getting rid of the deduction was tantamount to "a tax on education and a tax on opportunity for all students, which is not in anyone's interest."The tax on salaries above $1 million would also drive up costs for universities, although they could save money by keeping coaches' salaries below that threshold.Some universities already keep base salaries low by pairing it with compensation from other sources like private athletic donations and sponsor payments.AP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this report.

UConn trio headline AP women's hoops All-America team:::::Geno Auriemma has had a lot of great players at UConn, many of whom have been preseason All-Americans.Never, though, has he had three from his team honored by The Associated Press in the preseason until Tuesday.The Huskies trio of Gabby Williams, Katie Lou Samuelson and Napheesa Collier headline the AP women's basketball preseason All-America team, marking the first time any school has had three of the five players on the squad."They earned a lot of respect from a lot of people around the country for the way they played and the kind of season that we had.Obviously no one was saying that at the beginning of last season and look at the way it happened and they ended up being on the All-America team," Auriemma said."It goes to show that the team they pick at the beginning of the season doesn't always finish the season as All-Americans."The three UConn players are joined by South Carolina's A'ja Wilson, who was a unanimous choice by the 32-member national media panel that selects the weekly AP Top 25 poll.Kelsey Mitchell of Ohio State was the fifth member.The senior Buckeyes guard became the eighth player to be a three-time preseason All-American, joining Breanna Stewart, Alana Beard, Maya Moore, Brittney Griner, Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings and Courtney Paris.Wilson, Samuelson and Collier were all honored as first-team All-Americans last spring.Mitchell and Williams were on the second team."It's great to be recognized as one of the five best players in the country," Wilson said."I know the other four from playing USA Basketball with them and they are definitely a great group to be part of."South Carolina's star post player averaged 17.9 points and 7.8 rebounds to help the Gamecocks win the national championship in April.Mitchell, who finished one vote short of being a unanimous pick, scored 22.6 points for the Buckeyes and hopes that she can lead the team to the Final Four being played in Columbus at the end of the season."Kelsey Mitchell has an unbelievable work ethic.One of the hardest people I've been around.Her will and drive to be a great player is like nobody I've ever encountered," Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said.Samuelson, Collier and Williams were a huge part of the Huskies going undefeated last season until they lost in the Final Four to Mississippi State on a last-second shot in overtime.UConn is No.1 in the AP's preseason poll.Samuelson and Collier each averaged just over 20 points a game last season while Williams had 14.3 points and 8.4 rebounds for the Huskies.With so much talent returning, it's no surprise the Huskies were No.1 in the preseason AP poll.The AP started choosing a preseason All-America team before the 1994-95 season.The Associated Press' 2017-18 preseason All-America team, with school, height, year and votes from a 32-member national media panel (key 2016-17 statistics in parentheses): A'ja Wilson, South Carolina, 6-5, senior, 32 votes (17.9 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 58.8 fg pct.)Kelsey Mitchell, Ohio State, 5-8, senior, 31 (22.6 ppg, 3.9 apg, 81.8 ft pct.)Katie Lou Samuelson, UConn, 6-3, junior, 30 (20.2 ppg, 119 3-pointers, 84.0 ft pct.)Napheesa Collier, UConn, 6-1, junior, 26 (20.4 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 67.8 fg pct.)Gabby Williams, UConn, 5-11, senior, 17 (14.3 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 58.1 fg pct.)Others receiving votes: Lexie Brown, Duke, 6; Victoria Vivians, Mississippi State 5; Kalani Brown, Baylor, 4; Kristine Anigwe, California, 3; Jordin Canada, UCLA 2; Brooke McCarty, Texas 1; Morgan William, Mississippi State, 1; Azura Stevens, UConn, 1; Shakayla Thomas, Florida State, 1.AP Sports Writers Pat Eaton-Robb and Jake Seiner contributed to this story.Follow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg
Bucks get Bledsoe from Suns for Monroe, 2 draft picks:::::Eric Bledsoe's disgruntled days are over.The talented guard is getting a fresh start with the Milwaukee Bucks, who have another proven scorer to take some pressure off All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo.Bledsoe, who wanted out of Phoenix, was traded to the Bucks on Tuesday in exchange for big man Greg Monroe and two 2018 draft picks.The 27-year-old Bledsoe had not been with the Suns since Oct. 22, when he posted "I Don't wanna be here" on Twitter, the same day the Suns fired coach Earl Watson.He had been averaging 15.7 points per game, second behind Devin Booker, and was the team's on-court leader.He was sent home by the Suns after the tweet, reducing the team's leverage because everyone in the league knew Phoenix was trying to trade him.Bledsoe had asked to be traded before the season, Suns general manager Ryan McDonough has said.The NBA fined the eight-year NBA veteran $10,000 for the tweet.Adding Bledsoe will take some of the focus off Antetokounmpo, the Bucks' primary ball-handler.Milwaukee had lost four of its last five games before visiting the Cavaliers, but adding Bledsoe's scoring ability alongside Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton on a team that also includes rising guard Malcolm Brogdon could help."We're excited.Eric's excited," Bucks coach Jason Kidd said in Cleveland.Bledsoe will take his physical on Wednesday and is expected to join the Bucks in San Antonio in time for Thursday's game against the Spurs.Middleton can't wait to see what Bledsoe brings."He'll be another great player for us, a guy who can create for others and create for himself on offense," Middleton said."I'm excited to play with him.We can do a lot of things.We'll have more ball-handlers on the court at the same time.He's going to be a great for us."Already a dangerous and up-and-coming team, the Bucks could go to another level with Bledsoe."He adds a veteran point guard, a guy who plays with pace and can get into the paint, can make the right play," Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said."He's been on the cusp of being an All-Star the last three years.He brings a different dimension to their team.He can shoot the basketball, get in the paint, run pick-and-roll and he's a good defender also."It's a good pickup for them."Bledsoe averaged more than 20 points and six assists per game in each of the last two seasons with the Suns, including career highs in points (21.1) and assists (6.3) last season.Bledsoe spent the past five seasons in Phoenix after his first three years with the Clippers.The 27-year-old Monroe, who joined the team as a free agent in 2015 after five years in Detroit, has been sidelined recently because of a left calf strain.Over three seasons with the Bucks, he averaged 13.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists over 165 games.Without him, Milwaukee will likely consolidate the center position and look ahead to early next year, when the front line should get a boost with the return of injured forward Jabari Parker.The 6-foot-11 Monroe has an expiring contract, which means even more room for a Suns team with loads of cap space.They also could have as many as three first-round picks next season."Moose did everything we asked him to help us win, from being a starter to being asked to go to the bench and help us have a stronger bench," Kidd said."I wish him the best because he did everything we asked."Milwaukee's first-round pick will belong to the Suns in 2018 if in the range of 11-16 overall; in 2019 if in the range of 4-16; in 2020 if in the range of 8-30; and in 2021 it will be unprotected.The Suns get Milwaukee's second-round pick next year if in the range of 48-60 overall.Phoenix, rebuilding with an extremely young roster featuring Booker and T.J. Warren, has not made the playoffs in six years.AP Sports Writers Bob Baum in Phoenix and Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report.More NBA basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball
Eagles, Steelers remain top 2 in the latest AP Pro32 poll:::::Halfway through the NFL season, some familiar teams have been playing especially well.The dominating Philadelphia Eagles.AFC powerhouses the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots.And Carson Wentz and his high-flying Eagles remained on top in the latest AP Pro 32 poll .Philadelphia received all 12 first-place votes for 384 points Tuesday in balloting by media members who regularly cover the NFL.The Eagles (8-1) have won seven games in a row and have the league's best record."The latest act in Carson Wentz's brilliant 2017 season was carving up a Broncos defense that was formerly the top-ranked in the NFL," said Jenny Vrentas of The Monday Morning Quarterback."Eagles fans may be waiting for the other shoe to drop, but they are the best team in football right now."The Steelers and Patriots, both 6-2 and coming off byes, kept the second and third spots.The surprising Los Angeles Rams, coming off a 51-17 rout of the Giants at New York, jumped three places to No.4."This dynamic offense shows no signs of letting up after leaving a slew of Giants dazed and confused in the Meadowlands," said SB Nation Radio's Ira Kaufman.The Minnesota Vikings, who also were on a bye last week, remained at No.5.The surging New Orleans Saints, who have six in a row, moved up two places to No.6.Both teams face road tests this week as Minnesota meets the Washington Redskins and New Orleans heads to Buffalo to play the Bills, who are undefeated at home.The reeling Kansas City Chiefs, who have lost three of four after a 5-0 start, slid three spots to No.7.The Chiefs have a bye this week before returning to action on Nov. 19 against the Giants.The Dallas Cowboys, who have won three in a row, jumped three spots to No.8."Dominated the Chiefs," Fox Sports' John Czarnecki said of the Cowboys' 28-17 win over Kansas City.The Carolina Panthers, who trail the Saints by only a half-game in the NFC South, gained a spot to land at No.9.The Seattle Seahawks slid four spots to round out the top 10.For more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/APNFL
NFL HALFWAY: Rams, Bills, Jags succeeding with new coaches:::::Of the half dozen first-year NFL head coaches, Vance Joseph inherited what was widely considered the best situation: a team just one year removed from a Super Bowl parade with a championship-caliber defense and a renovated offense.Unlike the other five teams that averaged 4.4 wins last season, Denver was coming off a 9-7 season and the job only came open because of Gary Kubiak's health concerns.Yet, it's the Broncos (3-5) who are spiraling with five losses in their past six games while Sean McVay's Rams (6-2), Doug Marrone's Jaguars (5-3) and Sean McDermott's Bills (5-3) are primed for playoff pushes.Even Anthony Lynn's Chargers (3-5) are on the rise after a winless first month that included three losses by a field goal or less.While the 49ers are an NFL-worst 0-9, Kyle Shanahan could end up being the biggest winner of them all with his team jockeying for the top pick in next year's draft."Of course it wears on you," Shanahan said of all the losing."If you sit there and you think about those words and the record too much and, yeah, it will affect you big time."But sitting and dwelling on that and worrying about your ego and things like that, it's not going to make you play better."The dive has started to fray nerves in Denver, where calls for offensive coordinator Mike McCoy's job fill the airwaves.Suddenly, all that winning ugly over the past couple of years, highlighted by Denver's defense carrying a diminished Peyton Manning to victory in his Super Bowl 50 farewell, looks pretty good in retrospect.When Kubiak quit, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips joined McVay in L.A. and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison joined McDermott in Buffalo.Phillips is having his customary first-year effect with the Rams, who sport the largest point differential in the NFL, and Dennison is directing an offensive turnaround with the Bills, who could end the league's longest playoff drought they haven't qualified since 1999.The Rams have missed out every year since 2004 and the Jaguars every season since 2007.If they continue their resurgence, the Chargers might get in for the first time since 2009.Even the Broncos haven't lost hope because they're only two games behind the Chiefs, losers of three of four (but with a favorable schedule the rest of the way)."We have time," Joseph said, "but time's running out.So, we've got to fix it right now."The problems in Denver are mostly on offense, where Joseph spent his first eight months on the job pondering whether Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch would be his quarterback only to see Brock Osweiler emerge as his best bet.Joseph has seen his team average an NFL-worst 14 points since Week 3, suffer its first shutout in a quarter century and get blown out at home coming off a bye week by the battered Giants.After a 51-23 loss at Philadelphia on Sunday that shattered the defense's not-my-fault aura, defensive end Derek Wolfe said the "Broncos are beating the Broncos" with too many mistakes, turnovers, drops and flags before the snap and after the whistle.Joseph acknowledged the coaching staff has to clean up its act, too.Joe Woods' defense is having too many breakdowns in coverage, Brock Olivo's special teams are too sloppy and McCoy stubbornly sticks to a steady diet of three-receiver sets even though his quarterbacks have 18 sacks and 10 turnovers out of that formation over the past six games."It's a league that's really built and operated to have equal parts.So, the difference sometimes is the coaching.The difference is the scheme and play calling," Joseph said."So, when you don't win, absolutely you have to coach better.And that starts with me.Because in this league coaching is very important and the better-coached teams win."Right now that includes the Bills, Rams and Jaguars.BILLS: McDermott is doing more with less than his predecessor Rex Ryan.Fewer than two dozen players remain from last year's roster and the losing culture is finally fading in Buffalo.McDermott has gotten the most out of QB Tyrod Taylor and the Bills lead the NFL with a plus-11 turnover margin.The next four games are critical: road games against the Chargers and Chiefs sandwiched in between home games against the first-place Saints and Patriots.RAMS: With help from McVay and a better supporting cast, former top overall draft pick Jared Goff has made a huge jump this season.After failing to win the starting QB job until halfway through his rookie season, Goff is undergoing a sophomore surge not unlike Carson Wentz's in Philadelphia.The Rams hit the halfway point in first place in the NFC West.Down the stretch, they'll be tested by fellow NFC division leaders Minnesota, New Orleans and Philadelphia.JAGUARS: Having spent the previous two years as Jacksonville's O-line coach, Marrone knew exactly what he had with turnover-prone QB Blake Bortles.So he built a run-first team that could control the clock, limit Bortles' passes and play to an already-stout defense.Drafting RB Leonard Fournette and LT Cam Robinson beefed up the ground game, and DE Calais Campbell has proven to be the NFL's best free-agent signing.The Jaguars looked poised for a strong finish and their best season in a decade.49ERS: Shanahan arrived with a lot of optimism as he brought his deep offensive knowledge and playbook from Atlanta to a team in need of a change.But San Francisco got off to the worst start in franchise history.QB Brian Hoyer went from starter to the bench before getting cut when GM John Lynch acquired Tom Brady's longtime backup Jimmy Garoppolo.The only drama down the stretch will be if they can avoid 0-16 and get a good look at Garoppolo before determining whether to draft a quarterback with a premier pick in April.CHARGERS: The relocated Chargers didn't leave their heartbreak in San Diego when they moved to L.A.They've already lost four games by eight points or fewer.McCoy's last two teams in San Diego lost 17 games by that same one-score margin.They've once again had stretches of strong play and a string of solid victories with an undeniable collection of veteran talent.But narrow losses due to poor late-game execution and bad breaks have kept them from rising to the top of the AFC West.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL With contributions from

NFL HALFWAY: Wentz, Goff exceed expectations in Year 2:::::Jared Goff and Carson Wentz have answered almost all the questions they faced following suspect rookie seasons as the top two picks in the 2016 draft.Both young quarterbacks have their teams in first place in their divisions after they became the first QBs drafted Nos.1 and 2 in the same year to each throw four TD passes on the same day this weekend.Wentz had gotten off to a promising start as a rookie in Philadelphia before a rough second half.He lost seven of his final 10 games while throwing more interceptions than touchdowns with a pedestrian 5.8 yards per attempt.Goff's year was considerably worse after being taken one spot ahead of Wentz by the Rams.There were hopes he could quickly become the face of the franchise that had just arrived in Los Angeles.Instead, he couldn't even win the starting job until halfway through the season and finished the year averaging 5.3 yards per attempt with a 63.6 passer rating.That has all changed.Goff and Wentz have undergone sophomore surges to put their teams in contention in the NFC and lead a group of players who have been far better in the first half of this season than many expected.Wentz has led the team with the NFL's best record as the Eagles (8-1) have a 2 ?-game lead over Dallas in the NFC East following a 51-23 win over Denver .He leads the NFL with 23 TD passes , including 17 in the past five games."I think he's progressed at a rate as fast as anybody I've seen really," Washington coach Jay Gruden said about Wentz before losing to him last month."His ability to make plays in the pocket, his ability to stay in the pocket in the face of a rush and still deliver balls accurately, his command of the offense."Goff has had a staggering level of improvement from his rookie year with obvious help from new coach Sean McVay and better talent surrounding him.His numbers have shot up in every category .He has increased his yards per attempt from 5.3 to 8.3 to go with 13 TDs, only four interceptions and a 97.9 rating.That performance has helped put the Rams in first place in the NFC West following Sunday's 51-17 win over the Giants."I think he's just continuing to take an ownership of our offense.We talk about being an extension of the coaching staff and I think he is truly starting to become that," McVay said."But he's only going to continue to grow and get better.And in terms of where we want him to be, I think we just want him to just continue to take those daily steps, and he's done that and been receptive."Here are some other players who have been pleasant surprises in the first half of the season: Baltimore RB Alex Collins: A fifth-round pick by Seattle in 2016, Collins lasted one year with the Seahawks and was cut before the start of this season.Unable to make a Seattle team in desperate need of a running back, Collins has thrived in Baltimore after being promoted from the practice squad in Week 2.He leads the Ravens with 521 yards rushing and his 5.6 yards per carry are second in the league halfway through the season.Chicago DE Akiem Hicks: The former Canadian college star spent his first four seasons in New Orleans and New England before showing flashes last season when he joined the Bears.He has ramped up his game this year and already has tied his career high in sacks with seven , justifying the big contract extension he signed in September.Dallas DE DeMarcus Lawrence: After having one sack a year ago when his playing time was limited by a suspension and bad back, Lawrence has been a pleasant surprise on Dallas' defense with 10 1/2 sacks in his first eight games , ranking second in the league.He is finally fulfilling the potential the Cowboys believed he had when they drafted him in the second round in 2014 in hopes he would replace DeMarcus Ware.Seattle WR Paul Richardson: Just halfway through his fourth season in the NFL, Richardson has already set career highs in yards receiving (415) and touchdowns (five) as he has turned into Russell Wilson's most dependable deep threat.He caught two TD passes in the Week 8 thriller against Houston and has nine catches of at least 20 yards two more than he had in his first three seasons combined.Washington RB Chris Thompson: Thompson is the leading rusher and receiver in Washington, ranking in the top 15 in the league in yards from scrimmage .He already has set his career high in yards receiving halfway through his fifth season and is closing in on the best rushing mark in his career as well as being a key part of Washington's offense.More AP NFL: pro32.ap.org and twitter.com/APNFL
Winning T-wolves eager for litmus test vs. champion Warriors:::::The last time the Minnesota Timberwolves won five straight games, five head coaches and nearly nine long years ago, Al Jefferson was the centerpiece of the team.Kevin Love was a rookie, still coming off the bench.Fifteen different players started at least one game.Karl-Anthony Towns had just turned 13.President George W. Bush was still in the White House.The woebegone Wolves have waited a long time for this.They will play at Golden State on Wednesday night, just one-half game behind the defending NBA champion Warriors for the best record in the Western Conference.Forget for a moment that the regular season is merely 12 percent complete.For the first time in, well, 13 years or so the Wolves will be a legitimate participant in a marquee national game on ESPN rather than a token opponent."You want to see where you are and how you measure up," coach Tom Thibodeau said."Everyone in the league is chasing them."These Wolves (7-3) have produced the franchise's best 10-game start to the schedule since a 9-1 record in 2001 when Kevin Garnett was 25, Terrell Brandon was the point guard and Anthony Peeler was the first player the off the bench.With only three players who've been on the roster longer than three years, there aren't as many scars in the locker room as all that franchise futility would suggest.The last few seasons have been frustrating enough, though."It's something that's changing around here, and I'm glad to be a part of it," said Shabazz Muhammad, who with fellow reserve Gorgui Dieng has the longest tenure in their fifth year.The 2008-09 team finished 24-58, so the early January success was clearly not a harbinger.The Wolves have lost 461 games between the end of that streak and now, so even three solid weeks to start a season is an accomplishment.Thibodeau was hired to take them much further than that, of course.The hard-driving, no-nonsense coach sure won't be satisfied with this team's progress anytime soon, and neither will these players, from 17-year veteran Jamal Crawford to Towns, who's still only 21."We just want to keep doing more of what we're doing," Crawford said after practice on Tuesday.That's continuing to better the defense, for one.The Wolves have held three consecutive opponents under 100 points, with newcomers Jimmy Butler, Jeff Teague, Taj Gibson and Crawford beginning to pick up the tendencies of their returning teammates and the young core of Towns and Andrew Wiggins starting to learn the principles of helping and switching under the defensive-minded Thibodeau.Chemistry is just as important when they're guarding the basket as it is when they have the ball."It's still a work in progress,' Thibodeau said, "but I think we are moving in the right direction."The depth, and the versatility of that depth, is another area of vast improvement.The second team, which Thibodeau has played together as a unit for several stretches at a time, includes Tyus Jones, Crawford, Muhammad, Nemanja Bjelica and Dieng.When they are in, there has not been a drop-off at all from the star-studded starting lineup.The Wolves are shooting 3-pointers more effectively and often, too, another long-running weakness of this team going back dozens of players and a handful of head coaches.With Towns in the paint and Wiggins on the wing, the Wolves already have two of the league's best offensive players."They can definitely score.They have three or four guys out there that can get 20 on any given night," said Charlotte Hornets power forward Marvin Williams, whose team lost at Minnesota on Sunday night."They are definitely tough to stop."Then there's Butler, the alpha wolf who Thibodeau wanted so badly as a tough, experienced two-way player who would not only challenge his teammates to excel but selflessly defer to them on the court as needed."When I feel like it's my time to shoot, I'll shoot it," Butler said."But as of right now, my teammates are rolling.Feed them.Let them get us going."Butler's attitude and perspective might be the biggest upgrade the Wolves have made among so many."Often times you hear people say things, and they never do the things that they say.But when you watch what they're doing, it tells you what's important to them," Thibodeau said."Jimmy has always played that way."For more AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball
Pick Six: Oklahoma, Texas among teams set for tourney return:::::Oklahoma went from the joy of a 2016 Final Four appearance to the misery of a 20-loss campaign last season.Now the Sooners have a chance to redeem themselves ."Last year motivates me every day," Oklahoma forward Khadeem Lattin said."It's something I lose sleep over, I've lost plenty (of) sleep over.I'm ready to get it right."Oklahoma isn't the only team left out of last season's NCAA Tournament that believes it will earn a bid this time around.Plenty of teams have chances for a big turnaround.Especially with many of the nation's top incoming freshman headed for programs coming off disappointing seasons.Which teams that missed the 2017 tournament are mostly likely to return in '18?Here's a sampling: ALABAMA 2016-17 record: 19-15, lost in first round of NIT Alabama's hopes of earning its first NCAA Tournament berth since 2012 may depend on the uncertain status of freshman guard Collin Sexton and top returning starter Braxton Key.Alabama announced Monday that the NCAA hasn't yet cleared Sexton to play and that Key has a meniscus injury that requires surgery with no timetable set for his return.Sexton was rated as the country's No.5 prospect according to composite rankings compiled by 247Sports .Alabama returns Dazon Ingram, shot blocker Donta Hall and Riley Norris while adding Ohio State transfer Daniel Giddens.MISSOURI 2016-17 record: 8-24 New Missouri coach Cuonzo Martin has dramatically improved the talent base of a program that has finished in the SEC basement the last three years.Missouri landed top recruit Michael Porter Jr., a preseason AP All-America selection .Porter headlines a Missouri recruiting class that was ranked fourth nationally according to the 247Sports Composite , behind only Duke, Kentucky and Arizona.Missouri returns Jordan Barnett, Kevin Puryear and Terrence Phillips, who all had double-figure scoring averages last season.OKLAHOMA 2016-17 record: 11-20 After going from the Final Four in 2016 to 20 losses season last season, Oklahoma should find a happy medium between those two extremes.The Sooners lost their leading scorer in Jordan Woodard but return three starters in Kameron McGusty (10.9 ppg last season), Rashard Odomes (10.1) and Khadeem Lattin (8.4).Oklahoma also adds promising freshman point guard Trae Young, rated as the nation's No.23 recruit in his class by the 247Sports Composite.TEXAS 2016-17 record: 11-22 Texas' freshman class should help the Longhorns rebound from a dismal 2016-17.Texas' incoming group was ranked sixth in the 247Sports Composite and features 6-foot-11 forward Mohamed Bamba, the nation's No.3 overall recruit.Freshman Matt Coleman could take over immediately as the Longhorns' top point guard.Texas returns guards Andrew Jones and Kerwin Roach Jr., who each averaged over nine points last season.Tulane transfer Dylan Osetkowski was the Green Wave's leading rebounder two years ago.No 25 TEXAS A&M 2016-17 record: 16-15 Texas A&M is the only team in the preseason Top 25 that failed to earn an NCAA bid last season.Robert Williams' surprising decision to return for his sophomore season rather than entering the NBA Draft makes the Aggies legitimate NCAA Tournament contenders, though he has been suspended for the Aggies' first two games.Williams, one of four returning starters, averaged 11.9 points and 8.2 rebounds last season.Texas A&M also returns Tyler Davis (14.1 ppg, 7 rpg last season), Admon Gilder (13.7 ppg) and Tonny Trocha-Morelos (8.1).Davis and Trocha-Morelos are both 6-10.TCU 2016-17 record: 24-15 After winning the NIT in coach Jamie Dixon's first season, the Horned Frogs have their sights set on their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1987.TCU returns all five starters, including preseason all-Big 12 forward Vladimir Brodziansky.The Horned Frogs also add VCU graduate transfer Ahmed Hamdy and New Mexico Junior College transfer Shawn Olden, who began his college career at Pepperdine.More AP College Basketball: http://collegebasketball.ap.org Follow Steve Megargee at www.twitter.com/stevemegargee
