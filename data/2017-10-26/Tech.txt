ForeScout Technologies, the Internet of Things security company, priced its security IPO at $22, the top of its proposed range.
This means the company raised about $105.6 million in the offering.
ForeScout helps businesses and government agencies monitor the devices connected to their networks.
It also alerts them of potential intrusions.
Heres how ForeScout describes itself in the S-1 filing.
We have pioneered an agentless approach to network security to protect organizations against the emerging threats that exploit the billions of devices connected to organizations networks.
The traditional approach of relying on a corporate-installed software agent to secure a device has significant limitations in todays world as devices are developed using a wide variety of platforms and operating systems that cannot support agents.
ForeScout had $167 million in revenue last year, compared to $126 million for 2015.
Losses grew to $75 million in last year, up from $27 million in 2015.
Amadeus Capital had the largest ownership stake at 19.6 percent, prior to the IPO.
Accel had 15.2 percent, Pitango had 14 percent and Meritech Capital Partners had 13.4 percent.
The company raised at least $125 million, dating back to 2000.
This is whats become known as a down round IPO.
Some investors had built-in protections and it looks like Wellington will be granted additional shares to make up for an IPO priced at a lower price than where it invested.
While earlier investors like Accel, Amadeus, and Meritech will be big winners upon IPO, Wellington wont make a killing, said Atish Davda, CEO at EquityZen.
Davda is a shareholder through secondary transactions.
He also called ForeScout a dinosaur for going public at 17 years old.
Early this year, we broke the news that ForeScout had filed confidentially.
The company had taken advantage of a JOBS Act provision that allows businesses to submit filing updates without added scrutiny in the months leading up to an IPO.
The company is listing on the Nasdaq, under the ticker FSCT.
Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan have managed the Wilson Sonsini and Goodwin Procter were the legal teams on the IPO.

Saudi Arabia just made a non-human woman a citizen, making it the first country to grant a robot the right to citizenship, at least as far as we know.
Why it did so isnt immediately evident, but the irony of a nation infamous for denying basic rights to its female citizens imbuing a robotic Audrey Hepburn lookalike with rights is not lost on us.
The robot, known as Sophia, appeared onstage without an abaya, a head covering and cloak normally required of women by the Saudi government.
I am very honored and proud for this unique distinction, the robot said onstage.
This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship.
The revelation/PR stunt came out of the Future Investment Initiative summit being held in Riyadh.
Hanson Robotics, the company that developed the robot, hails it as the most beautiful and celebrated robot, a claim to fame that surely ensures our non-human counterparts will be just as sexually objectified as their blood and flesh foremothers.
The company goes on to lavish gendered compliments on its object of affection, admiring its porcelain skin, slender nose and intriguing smile with effusive praise thats unsettling at best but mostly just gross.
Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund (PIF) manages more than $200 billion USD in assets, including investments in Uber.
With a growing role in tech and innovation, the nation still faces criticism for archaic gender laws that require women to be accompanied by a male guardian and only just granted women the right to drive, a change thats expected to go into effect in June of 2018.
Last month, Saudi Arabia announced that it would open itself to VoIP calling services like Skype and WhatsApp.
Just feed it The Godfather movies as input.
Whats the worst that could happen?
https://t.co/WX4Kx45csv Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2017 For his part, Elon Musk isnt fooled by Sophias delicate features, fully expecting her to go total AI murderess on her creators.
Would Sophias citizenship hold up in court in some strange future legal precedent that will come back to haunt us 10 years from now?
Was the whole thing a depressingly empty, unironic attempt at publicity for Sophias human captors?
Almost certainly yes, but only time will tell about how international law will handle the advent of AI-powered populations, a future that seems more certain to arrive with each passing day.
As a woman, were not sure what exactly Sophias set of rights will afford her in one of the most oppressive countries on the planet, but if she sticks around til next year she can at least score a set of wheels to get the hell out.

Shortly after Googles new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL began shipping, some users noted that the devices seemed to have some quirks.
Onscreen colors on the XL seemed faded, some users reported.
When switching screens, evidence of previously displayed images sometimes seemed to linger (as if they were burned into the screen).
Others reported that the screen seemed to turn an odd shade of blue depending on your viewing angle.
Meanwhile, Pixel 2 users reported hearing high-pitched clicking sounds when on a call.
Google said on Monday that they were investigating the reports, and theyve just shared their first findings.
You can find the full version here, but the short version: they think things are working mostly as intended, but theyre making a few software changes and extending the devices warranty anyway.
On the displays colors, Google VP of Engineering Seang Chau writes: Weve received some feedback about the Pixel 2 XL displays not appearing as saturated as other phones.
We attribute this perception to our choice to calibrate the Pixel 2 XL for delivering natural, accurate colors, taking advantage of the new color management support in Android 8.0 Oreo.
Based on the feedback weve received since announcing Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, we learned that some users do want even more vibrant colors.
So, through a software update to Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, we will soon be adding a new saturated color mode.
In other words: they like the way colors look on the device, but theyre going to add a saturated mode by way of a software update.
The device already has a Vivid mode that tweaks the display colors a bit, but it sounds like saturated mode will take things even further.
And on the burn-in effect: Weve received reports of Pixel 2 XL devices exhibiting image retention on the screen and have been actively investigating them.
Extensive testing of the Pixel 2 XL display show that its decay characteristics are comparable to OLED panels used in other premium smartphones.
With that said, theyre still making some changes to the way the screen works: The nav bar buttons at the bottom of the screen will fade out when not in use Theyre dropping the displays maximum brightness by 50 nits an amount they say is almost undetectable, but that should reduce strain on the display significantly.
And while theyre at it, theyre bumping the warranty of all Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL devices up from one year to two.
Google says the update with these changes should roll out to the Pixel 2 XL in coming weeks.
As for the clicking sound that some Pixel 2 users were hearing during calls, a separate thread on the user forums suggests that Google has pinned down the issue on a software bug in the NFC functionality, and promise a fix is on the way.
In the meantime, turning off NFC will stop the clicking.
[Cheers to Andrew Martonik for spotting these]
The SEC is showing its muscle in Silicon Valley with a crackdown on bad behavior, starting with unicorn startup Zenefits and its former CEO Parker Conrad.
First noted on BuzzFeed, the human resources startup and Conrad have agreed to pay a combined nearly $1 million in fines to settle accusations made by the SEC that the company made materially false and misleading statements and omissions to investors over compliance with state insurance laws.
The companys seen a revolving door of leadership since Conrad was kicked out of the CEO position last year and former COO David Sacks stepped in to fill the void.
Sacks has since pulled back, allowing Jay Fulcher to take over as Zenefits new CEO.
Earlier, the company got itself into hot water under Conrads control for inadequate compliance procedures.
Members of the companys sales team were also not properly licensed as health insurance brokers.
Although Zenefits recognized that it operated in a highly regulated industry, it did not take sufficient steps to ensure its growing workforce was properly licensed to sell insurance, reads a press release from the SEC detailing the matter.
Unbeknownst to investors, the company allowed employees to use a computer script created by Conrad to enable them to spend less time on pre-licensing education than required by California law.
Zenefits also allowed employees to sell insurance before they had taken and passed their licensing exams, and permitted some employees licensed in one state to sell insurance in other states where they werent licensed.
Zenefits sells myriad HR cloud services to small and mid-size businesses.
However, 90 percent of its revenue comes from the insurance side.
The mess caused a two-year legal cleanup and forced Conrad, who agreed to pay his part of the fine but did not have to admit findings that he or the company violated the federal securities laws over the matter, to resign.
Zenefits agreed to pay a $450,000 penalty, and Conrad agreed to pay $350,000 in disgorgement plus $23,692.39 in interest and a $160,000 penalty for a total of $533,692, according to the SEC.
This settlement closes the chapter on a journey we began 18 months ago to transform Zenefits through new values and leadership.
We are pleased that the SEC clearly acknowledged our cooperation, our extraordinary remedial efforts, and our commitment to compliance, said Josh Stein, General Counsel at Zenefits.
We look forward to continuing the important work of helping companies thrive by taking better care of their employees.
This is the first SEC case against a unicorn startup in Silicon Valley, but it likely wont be the last.
A handful of tech companies have signed onto a friend of the court brief in the case of the Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple.
TechCrunch has confirmed that so far the list includes Apple, Yelp, PayPal, Salesforce and Affirm.
The brief is being circulated by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) which expects more companies to be announced by next week.
It was authored by D.C. law firm Steptoe & Johnson.
While more tech companies generally voice their support in these LGBTQ-friendly cases, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission is a tinder box of particularly volatile social issues, particularly when it comes to interpreting the religious rights secured by the First Amendment.
That could be a reason tech companies have been a bit warier in this instance, though it also could be the sheer number of social causes that left-leaning tech companies have been called to support under the Trump administration.
Earlier this year at least 54 tech companies mobilized in support of Gavin Grimm, the transgender Virginia high school student who alleged that his school board violated Title IX when it did not allow him to use the boys restroom.
Ultimately that case did not make it before the Supreme Court and instead was sent back to a lower appeals court in Richmond, Virginia.
While there was some confusion about the last day for companies to sign on, TechCrunch has clarified that the deadline is actually Monday, October 30.
Weve reached out to a number of the major tech companies about their interest in the amicus brief and will update this list when we learn more.

The FCC will not be voting this November on the adoption of the Restoring Internet Freedom rule that would roll back 2015s Net Neutrality rules, contrary to recent rumors.
In a blog post, Chairman Ajit Pai listed a number of items the commission will be voting on, and the proposed rule isnt among them.
Ive contacted the commission to confirm this, but its extremely unlikely that it would exclude something that major from its stated plans (not to mention extremely disingenuous).
That doesnt mean important things arent on the docket.
Here are the items the FCC, now at full strength with five members, will be voting on next month: Combating robocalls and other phone-based spam Opening 1,700 more megahertz of spectrum for 5G networks Official adoption of the improved ATSC 3.0 broadcast standard Ignoring historic preservation review on replacing utility poles Common-sense measures to ease transition from copper to fiber Revamping the Lifeline connectivity subsidy program Updating cable operator reporting rules Modernizing our media ownership rules Many of the other measures are either routine or easy to support; the FCC does in fact do a lot of good work that goes undocumented by major outlets, a fact often forgotten in the heat of controversy.
But that last item is definitely going to stir the pot.
The FCC will be eliminating rules limiting cross-ownership of broadcast and newspaper outlets, and of TV and radio stations.
It would also eliminate the eight voices rule that protects independently owned stations, and ease TV join sales agreements.
Dont worry, all this has nothing to do with the Sinclair-Tribune merger the FCC is considering, and which many worry will produce problematic consolidation in the broadcast world of just the type enabled by the suggested rules.
This transaction is in no way the catalyst for FCC action on these issues, wrote Commissioner ORielly last week.
Oh, and theyre starting an incubator.
You can expect vigorous discussion of the new media ownership rules (which the industry has been pursuing for years) over the coming month.

Venture capital should come with a warning label.
In our experience, VC kills more startups than slow customer adoption, technical debt and co-founder infighting combined.
VC should be a catalyst for growing companies, but, more commonly, its a toxic substance that destroys them.
VC often compels companies to prematurely scale, which is typically a death sentence for startups.
Venture-backed startups face great pressures to perform.
The more money raised, the more pressure.
One of the challenges well-funded startups face is defining performance.
For mostly good reasons, the metric that matters most to VCs is usually revenue growth rate.
Particularly for an early-stage startup, this is the right metric, because it is the most basic answer to the question of whether customers care about the companys product and the company has the potential to become a large business.
Growth at what cost?
Unfortunately, growth without context quickly becomes more of a vanity metric than a success metric.
The question that needs to be considered is growth at what cost?
Few would dispute that growing 3X and adding $10 million in revenue by consuming $1 million in investment is terrific.
Likewise, most would agree that growing 3X and adding $10 million in revenue for $100 million in investment is appalling.
Extreme examples are pretty clear; its the less dramatic examples that become very confusing.
Unfortunately, founders and investors arent having the debate about high-quality versus low-quality growth frequently enough, and the wrong incentives can lead reasonable people to catastrophic rationalizations.
Not all growth is created equal.
There is good growth that supercharges the business and allows for reinvestment into a virtuous cycle, and bad growth that ultimately leads to an unsustainable burn and a masked death spiral.
Founders always need to be asking themselves, their teams and their investors: Growth, but at what cost?
The peril of go big or go home Investors today have overstuffed venture funds, and lots of capital is sloshing around the startup ecosystem.
As a result, young startups with strong teams, compelling products and limited traction can find themselves with tens of millions of dollars, but without much real validation of their businesses.
We see venture investors eagerly investing $20 million into a promising company, valuing it at $100 million, even if the startup only has a few million in net revenue.
Now the investors and the founders have to make a decision what should determine the speed at which this hypothetical company, lets call it Fuego, invests its treasure chest of money in the amazing opportunity that motivated the investors?
The investors goal over the next roughly 24 months is for the company to become worth at least three times the post-money valuation so $300 million would be the new target pre-money valuation for Fuegos next financing.
Imagine being a company with only a few million in sales, with a success hurdle for your next round of $300 million pre-money.
Whether the startups model is working or not, the mantra becomes go big or go home.
The marginal-dollar problem After this fundraise, everyone at Fuego agrees to hit the gas, hard.
Burn rates jump from $200,000 a month to more than $1 million per month.
Experiments that previously were returning $1.50 over time for every dollar invested start to return $1 as money is pumped into scale, but everyone agrees thats okay.
It just means that the customer pays back the cost of acquisition more slowly.
As the investment keeps scaling up, soon only $0.80 comes back for every $1 invested.
This poor return is upsetting, but growth is the mantra and Fuegos executives and investors rationalize that this can be fixed later.
Eventually, as the company scales further, $0.50 comes back for every $1.
Scale quickly reveals the inefficiency of a startups model.
But does the overfunded startup take a step back and try to fix the diminishing return of investment?
Rarely until its too late.
The desperation for growth drives the startup to chase the marginal dollar at increasingly greater costs, enduring rapidly increasing losses.
We call this the marginal-dollar problem.
Money has no insights on how to fix a broken business.
This develops a habit that is hard to break and the startup will get worse and worse at solving this diminishing returns problem over time.
This problem is further exasperated as the return on most growth investments in startups (more features, more engineers, more support, more brand marketing, etc.)
are much harder to quantify and take time to evaluate.
The burden to grow at any cost drives the startup to accept exceptionally poor returns on its investments.
How the marginal-dollar problem kills you Companies are pretty good at knowing what their best hypotheses are in product, sales and marketing.
Each marginal investment, on average, will perform worse than the higher confidence hypothesis that was previously tested.
As a company attempts to unnaturally scale, it will make lower and lower confidence investments that will typically perform worse and worse all in the name of chasing the marginal dollar.
If the startup wasnt trying to triple an already ambitious valuation, they could proceed prudently, reject investments that dont sufficiently return and harden their best thesis into a model that generates high-confidence results.
Instead, they end up trying to spend their way out of the hole.
To illustrate this challenge with an example that affects many B2B startups, lets consider the marginal-dollar problem from the standpoint of building a sales force (this is going to get a bit in the weeds bear with me).
Imagine Fuegos average sales rep is getting paid $100,000 and is bringing in $250,000 in sales against a $500,000 target.
On the surface, this looks additive thats still $150,000 in contribution!
Except it doesnt account for the cost incurred by product, sales engineering, account management, marketing, support, G&A and all the other teams this employee burdens.
Lets assume the total loaded cost for a rep is $400,000.
In a rational world, the cost of these reps couldnt be justified; however, the CEO doesnt want to lose that average $250,000 in top-line growth, despite the cost.
If Fuego is largely encouraged to grow at any cost, losing $250,000 in revenue for each dismissed sales rep isnt an option.
Worse yet, as the CEO struggles with the underperformance of the reps projecting toward missing the annual sales plan by a large margin, that CEO has a choice of whether to focus on fixing the problem or finding a way to close the revenue gap.
How could one make up that gap?
Hire more of the inefficient reps?
Go big or go home!
Sounds crazy, but its happening every day in the startup world.
Multiply that scenario across dozens of sales reps (and similar underperforming activities on other teams) and you quickly understand how chasing the marginal dollar of growth can kill a business.
As the CEO keeps doubling down on a machine that isnt working, Fuego shows growth, but at a cost that is unsustainable and will lead to its inevitable failure.
This is how big venture rounds kill startups.
Capital has no insights it is rarely the constraint Fuego, like many startups, has financed the business on one big assumption that capital is the major constraint to startup scale.
If a company has more capital, it will scale faster.
On this assumption, why not raise as much as possible and go as hard as possible at every startup?
Our research suggests that this is rarely the case and that the most challenging constraints to growth and success are rarely capital.
Capital can be used to hide these constraints for a period, but typically capital only magnifies the problems over time.
Money has no insights on how to fix a broken business.
Great businesses solve these problems first and then use capital to intelligently scale models that are clearly working.
Well fix it as we scale We often hear founders and investors argue that the problems in their companies can be fixed as the company scales.
Its not hard to imagine Fuego acknowledging the major problems with the economic engine of the business, but rationalizing that capital can be used to both scale the model and fix the model at the same time.
This is very seductive logic, because it allows everyone to keep playing the grow-at-any-cost game while pretending that the problems will get solved later.
Unfortunately, we almost never see this work (for fairly obvious reasons).
Scaling a business is hard and nearly always yields less efficiency over time.
It takes so much effort to scale without losing yield on nearly any productivity metric that the dream of scaling while increasing productivity is typically a mirage.
Sell the dream, buy the nightmare From the outside its so obvious Fuego needs to hit the brakes.
Returning $0.50 for every $1 invested cannot be fixed at scale.
Unfortunately, in the pursuit of growth, people lose focus on the costs until its too late.
Fuegos VCs invested with the goal of building toward a billion-dollar exit.
They invested because they believed in Fuegos potential why would they go slow?
That would be admitting to themselves and everyone else that the investment thesis was invalid.
They convinced the partners at their funds that this was going to be the next home run, how can they pause now?
Every attempt at scaling up an inefficient experiment dramatically decreases the likelihood of success for a startup.
The burden on the founders is immense.
The founders sold the VCs on this billion-dollar future.
How can they get cold feet now that the cash is in the bank, even if the model is broken?
If they cut back on the burn, talented people will get the sense the companys prospects are dimming and leave.
Appearances must be maintained!
This works for a while everyone is drinking the same Kool-Aid until the company needs to ask its investors for more money and inevitably hits the enthusiasm gap.
One reason that scaling a bad experiment is so detrimental in the long term is that the incentive to keep scaling doesnt go away, but the investors often become unwilling to fund it when the company inevitably runs out of cash.
Build a better engine or hope not to explode Every attempt at scaling up an inefficient experiment dramatically decreases the likelihood of success for a startup.
Capital is a multiplier of the good and bad at a startup.
A startup can use capital to compound activities that are working or compound activities that are not working.
Unfortunately, venture capital often drives founders to do that later.
It is incredibly difficult to fix the multiplication of bad mistakes.
This is why VC is so dangerous: venture capital incentivizes companies with good vanity metrics to start scaling bad experiments.
Think of your company as a car in a race to cross the country with an engine thats leaking gasoline.
The faster you accelerate the engine, the more the car leaks and the greater the risk of explosion.
You have two options.
You can slow down the car, pinpoint the problem and fix it; or, you can just keep pouring more gas into the tank, hoping for an infinite supply, and accelerate at maximum speed all the while praying that the fuel leak doesnt lead to a catastrophe along the way.
So the car goes faster and faster with a decreasing rate of efficiency and an increasing probability of tragedy.
So about that warning label, perhaps it should be: Founders: Burn Responsibly.

With numbers that would seem to put fears to rest that the worlds dominant chipmaker has lost a step to its competitors, Intel Corp. handily beat analyst expectations for the third quarter.
We executed well in the third quarter with strong results across the business, and were on track to a record year, said Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive, in a statement.
Im excited about our progress and our future.
Intels product line-up is the strongest it has ever been with more innovation on the way for artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and more.
The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 against the 80 cents that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected.
Revenue clocked in at $16.15 billion against the $15.73 billion that analysts expected.
And Intel reported ent income of $4.52 billion up 34 percent from last year.
Intel shares have been setting the market on fire this week, up some 14 percent in the week alone.
And the stock gained another 1 percent in trading after market close.
The numbers are a sign that Intels strategic shifts into areas beyond its core personal computing business are beginning to get traction.
The companys data center business, core memory business, and its Internet of Things business all recorded lights out revenue for the quarter.
Key numbers to look at are in the Programmable Solutions Group which is Intels business line focused on the areas most likely to contribute to future growth in autonomous vehicles and chips for artificial intelligence.
Revenue in that group was up 10% to $469 million.
The companys Internet of Things group was up 23% to $849 million, and its non-volatile memory solutions group recorded 37 percent growth, up to $469 million.
More to come.

Zscaler, a nine-year-old, San Jose, Calif.-based company, has filed confidentially for IPO, multiple sources tell TechCrunch.
The cloud security outfit is aiming to go public before the end of the year.
Zscaler works with companies like United Airlines and NBC to protect from threats across all devices.
Zscaler built its multi-tenant platform from scratch to provide 100% cloud security to every user in the enterprise, on any device, using any app, all over the world, says the company website.
Zscaler has reached unicorn status, having raised capital at a $1 billion valuation in the past.
Investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Alphabets Capital G and TPG Growth.
Earlier this year, Reuters reported that Zscaler had been meeting with investment bankers to prepare for a possible offering.
Bloomberg reported that Zscaler wound up picking Morgan Stanley to manage the IPO.
Zscaler has been involved in multiple patent lawsuits with Symantec.
A recent ongoing suit asserts that Zscaler has been illegally using Symantecs patented technology relating to a variety of network security technologies, including web security, security scanning, data loss prevention, intrusion prevention and intrusion signature analysis.
Zscaler competes with Blue Coat, which was acquired by Symantec.
It also competes with Ciscos Umbrella division.
Another security company, ForeScout Technologies, is planning to price its IPO later today.
We broke the news of its IPO filing earlier this year.
Zscaler declined to comment on this story.

Alphabet delivered a knockout quarter today, handily beating the estimates from Wall Street but, perhaps more importantly, showing actual growth in a critical metric that has seen a consistent decline for quite some time.
Googles cost-per-click a metric that helps define how valuable its ads are grew 1% quarter-over-quarter this year.
While still down 18% year-over-year, that tiny nudge forward is likely going to be a big positive signal for Google as it looks to show that its advertising business wont be challenged by other platforms and it is still going to remain a critical ad buy even as user behavior shifts to mobile.
Its a problem that Google has had to contend with for some time, with quarter-over-quarter declines going back to the first quarter last year when its aggregate cost-per-click didnt decline.
But it didnt grow that quarter, either, and its been a major sticking point for the company as it tries to make up for the decline in its cost-per-click with volume (called paid clicks in Google parlance).
That number is, of course, still on a massive run, up 47% year-over-year.
Thats a good look for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which saw its shares make a big jump today by Google standards and adding billions of dollars to its value.
You can find the full financial details below the post, but its adding on to an already impressive run for the companys shares, which are now well over $1,000 per share this afternoon.
This year, shares of Alphabet are up 29%, including its tick up today by another few percentage points.
One storyline we were watching for this report was what would happen with Googles traffic acquisition costs, and what percentage of its advertising revenue it would be.
This quarter, TAC accounted for 23% of Googles advertising revenue, which is another slight tick up from where it was year-over-year.
Its a little tick, but its one that Wall Street may be watching pretty closely as Alphabets story continues to play out and it starts to set up its other bets to succeed.
We expect TAC to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, as we remain focused on profit dollar growth, and these areas are additive to growth, CFO Ruth Porat said in the call to discuss the companys third-quarter earnings.
On the rest of the Alphabet front, the companys other bets which includes stuff that isnt Google like Nest or Fiber continued to improve as its revenue jumped from $6.8 billion in the third quarter last year to $8.7 billion in the third quarter this year.
It grew while managing to control its losses as well, with the division losing $812 million this quarter compared to $861 million in the same quarter last year.
Heres the final slash line for the company: Q3 revenue : $27.8 billion, compared to $27.2 billion analyst estimates : $27.8 billion, compared to $27.2 billion analyst estimates Q3 earnings : $9.57 per share, compared to $8.33 per share analyst estimates : $9.57 per share, compared to $8.33 per share analyst estimates Other Bets : $8.7 billion in revenue, loss of $861 million : $8.7 billion in revenue, loss of $861 million TAC as a % of revenue: 23% 23% YoY Paid Clicks : up 47% : up 47% YoY cost-per-click: down 18% down 18% QoQ cost-per-click: up 1% Featured Image: Jeff Chiu/AP
Amazon shared third-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, smashing expectations.
Shares quickly ticked up 7 percent in initial after-hours trading, to above the $1,000 per share milestone.
The company posted significantly better-than-expected earnings, at 52 cents per share, when analysts were forecasting just three cents.
The $256 million in net income was unusually high profit for Amazon, a company which typically reinvests in growth.
Revenue came in at $43.74 billion, versus the consensus estimate of $42.14 billion.
This is also 34 percent higher than last year.
The Whole Foods acquisition, which was completed in late August, accounted for $1.3 billion in sales for the quarter.
Prime Day, Amazons annual discount day in July, also contributed to the successful quarter.
Revenue for Amazon Web Services (AWS) was $4.57 billion, versus the $4.51 billion expected.
This is Amazons cloud services platform, which powers websites for customers like Adobe and Airbnb.
Amazon says its fourth-quarter guidance will be in the $56 billion and $60.5 billion range, which is comparable to Wall Street estimates.
Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos touted the success of its popular voice-activated device, Alexa.
In the last month alone, weve launched five new Alexa-enabled devices, introduced Alexa in India, announced integration with BMW, surpassed 25,000 skills, integrated Alexa with Sonos speakers, taught Alexa to distinguish between two voices, and more.
Because Alexas brain is in the AWS cloud, her new abilities are available to all Echo customers, not just those who buy a new device, said Bezos in a statement.
James Cakmak, analyst at Monness, Crespi & Hardt, said he can see a path to becoming the worlds first trillion dollar company.
Said Cakmak, theres something to be said for a company that can deliver accelerating growth on a $175B revenue base, while having not yet even begun to tap into their emerging opportunities like food delivery, media, advertising, pharmaceutical, and logistics.
Shares closed Thursday at $972.43, but quickly jumped to more than $1,000 after the earnings release.
The company has a market cap of $467 billion.

Microsoft today announced its quarterly earnings for its first financial quarter of 2018 (yes, I know its early, but thats how Microsofts financial quarters work).
Wall Streets crack team of financial analysts expected the company to report revenue of about $23.56 billion and earnings per share of $0.72.
The actual numbers the company reported today were $24.5 billion in GAAP revenue and $0.84 in non-GAAP earnings per share.
In the year-ago-quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share of $0.76 on revenue of $22.33 billion.
Ahead of todays earnings, Microsofts stock hit record highs.
The stock is up just 2 percent in after-hours trading now.
As in previous quarters, the numbers most of us pundits are going to focus on revolve around Microsofts cloud efforts.
Here, the company reported revenues of $6.9 billion for its Intelligent Cloud business units, which include server products and cloud services.
While the Azure cloud platform is included in this number, Microsoft sadly doesnt break out Azure revenue numbers.
The company, however, has long said that it wanted its cloud services to reach an annual run rate of $20 billion by the end of its 2018 fiscal year.
This year, Microsofts commercial cloud run rate hit $20.4 billion.
Thats pretty unexpected and will surely drive much of the conversation around todays earnings release.
This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago, said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft.
Our results reflect accelerating innovation and increased usage and engagement across our businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform.
In the previous quarter, Microsoft said its run rate exceeded $18.9 billion and that Azure revenue growth was 97 percent.
This quarter, Azure revenue was up 90 percent.
Seems like cloud computing isnt a bad business to be in these days.
Despite this focus on the cloud, Microsofts other business units also still make plenty of money.
In the Productivity and Business Processes category, which includes the Office productivity suite, Dynamics, LinkedIn and other products, Microsoft reported revenue of $8.2 billion, up 28 percent.
LinkedIn reported revenue of $1.1 billion in the previous quarter and it once again came in at exactly the same number.
The number of LinkedIn sessions is up 20 percent, though thats clearly not influencing the services revenue all that much.
For the More Personal Computing segment, Microsoft reported $9.4 billion in revenue.
Over the last few quarters, Microsofts Surface line reported declining revenue numbers as the company prepared to launch new products.
This quarter, those numbers turned around as Surface revenue grew 12 percent.
Thats not really a surprise, given that Microsoft has launched a number of new Surface products over the course of the last few months.
Anything but a substantial increase would have been quite a disappointment.
Windows OEM revenue was also up 4 percent and search advertising revenue increased 15 percent.
Gaming revenue, however, only increased 1 percent, even as Xbox software and services revenue was up 21 percent.
If you want to pick up a new language, theres no shortage of options, and free ones, at that.
But one aspect of the process that has been neglected is pronunciation, which is an especially important part of it for professionals.
Online, learning pronunciation is generally hear a recording, then repeat it (to an empty room).
A new platform, Blue Canoe Learning, uses an established curriculum and machine learning to make things easier and more effective.
Its the first company to join AI2s new incubator in Seattle, and has raised a $1.4 million round to expand its operations.
There are millions of English learners out there, many of whom speak it as their first language, but still find themselves unable to make themselves understood especially to Americans, who are particularly underexposed to certain accents.
The reality is that American English is the international language of many industries, and anyone in one of them, whether theyre call center employees, software engineers or executives, can benefit from being able to adopt an American-like accent.
Their employers know that too, so Blue Canoe is going straight to them instead of adopting a direct-to-consumer approach.
I say potato The trouble with teaching pronunciation is that its not just about telling people how to say something correctly, but hearing how they say it and providing corrective guidance.
That kind of personal feedback is hard to scale.
Its especially difficult when you consider the neurological limitations of adult language learners.
Unless you learn certain sounds at a young age, your brain eventually discards the mechanism for hearing them, making it difficult for some speakers to even understand that theyre pronouncing something incorrectly.
(I had this experience in China recently when I tried to get directions to Futian; I got it right on the eighth or ninth try.)
Add to this that in American English, you have five vowels but 14 vowel sounds, and its a recipe for confusion.
People havent focused on the last mile, Blue Canoe founder Sarah Daniels told me.
They say they do spoken learning, but its glorified listen and repeat.
One attempt to address this, offline anyway, has been the Color Vowel System, which relies on mnemonics and rhythm to help unlock sounds in your brain that you may not even know are there.
Each vowel sound is associated with a color and alliterative phrase: green tea or brown cow, for instance.
So to learn to say speed, learners would be instructed to say green tea speed.
The repetition and color association, theoretically, help with retention and aid in producing the vowel sounds in question.
I say theoretically not because I personally doubt it, but because there isnt a lot of literature on this; pronunciation is a tricky thing to measure compared with vocabulary or written proficiency very subjective.
But the Peace Corps, State Department and several major universities have adopted the system, so until the studies come out Im okay with trusting their judgment.
Scaling the system Blue Canoe (itself a mnemonic phrase) has worked to digitize the Color Vowel System and package it as an app.
Its still at a very early stage, with more content planned as the company learns from its pilot programs.
Users play a card game (the first of several games and activities to be included) that requires them to say the vocabulary word on the card they play; a machine learning system listens and identifies whether they have pronounced it correctly, and if not, gives relevant feedback.
At first I thought the system would have been trained on reams of American English speaker data, and analyze the delta between the waveforms, but its smarter than that.
Instead, Blue Canoe had people with various accents speaking, and their pronunciation was annotated word by word by professionals.
So an r pronounced with a roll (by, for example, a French speaker) would be treated differently than an r pronounced closer to l (by a Japanese speaker).
Stressing a different syllable from Americans (the most common difference) will also be detected.
The number and type of errors also lets the app create an overall rating, and highlight words or sounds the speaker is improving on, needs help with and so on.
Part of the plan is to track these ratings and compare them to professional, in-person ratings in order to validate them as an automated, objective score of a users pronunciation progress.
That alone would be a useful tool for companies, but the ability to improve that score, of course, is likewise attractive.
Blue Canoe is already working with several companies to create special curricula with vocabulary and goals (and perhaps activities) tailored to their needs technical terms, practice phrases, etc.
This pilot program should last the next few months, and then second quarter next year should see a more public rollout, perhaps alongside documentation of the evaluation process and effectiveness of the app.
Kernel Labs led the $1.4 million round, but Blue Canoe will be getting its next few months of guidance and nurturing from the Allen Institute for AI, which earlier this year established a new, low-profile incubator program.
This is their first selection for a company to adopt and invest in, though not necessarily representative of the type theyre going for: I had envisioned, when I talked with AI2 earlier, some kind of wild-haired geniuses who needed reining in by established AI brains.
But this works too.

Because its rude to leave out children, HelloFresh co-founder Dan Treiman has teamed up with Joanna and David Parker to launch a healthy prepared meal service for the little ones.
Treiman, who joined the company last December, helped Yumble officially launch this past summer.
Yumble is currently live in 26 states on the east coast and has plans to expand to the west coast sometime in the first half of 2018, but hopefully first quarter, Parker said.
Yumble offers pre-prepared meals for breakfast and dinner as well as snacks with 22 available options per week.
Yumble, which is subscription based, charges $7.99 per meal for six meals a week, $7.49 per meal for 12 and $6.99 per meal for 24.
Its very similar to the experience of HelloFresh or Blue Apron, but without any cooking required, Parker said.
Competitors in this space include Scrumpt, a prepared lunch service for kids thats currently available the San Francisco Bay Area, and Chicago-based startups Nurture Life and Wise Apple.
From a customer standpoint, weve spent a lot of time and effort to make this fun and something kids really engage with, Parker said.
I think our brand is very kid-first and fun.
Yumble, for example, has some of its customers calling the company the healthy happy meal for kids lunch, Parker said.
Thats because, in addition to fully cooked meals, each Yumble box comes with activity sheets, collectible reward coins and trivia cards for kids.
Meal kit services have been in the public light lately thanks to Blue Aprons sub par performance on the public market.
In light of that, HelloFresh recently revealed its planning to raise up to $353 million in an initial public offering.
Perhaps meal services for children are the next big market for food startups.
To date Yumble has raised a $1.5 million seed round from a handful of investors, including Andy Appelbaum, co-founder of Seamless and current managing partner at RiverPark Ventures.
Silicon Valley doings are easy to make fun of, which is what the mockumentary web series Bubbleproof is trying to do.
The series follows Michael Fertik and David Cowan (who are also the series writers) in their pursuit of a new venture.
Episode three, Gurus Just Want to Have Funds, begins with Cowan lost and alone without Fertik who, as you know if you watched episode 2, suddenly quit the startup life.
But what, asks a television newscaster, would Fertik do if he received a no-strings-attached blank check to return to technology and innovation.
Itd have to be egregiously blank.
Lightbulb!
So obviously Cowan sets out to raise please love me dollars to support Fertiks latest venture, which seems to be to disrupt venture.
Watch episode three above.
And if youre just jumping on the Bubbleproof train, be sure to check out episodes one and two.
Several women who either work at venture firm DFJ or have worked for the 30-year-old outfit in the past are pushing back against new allegations that founders should be wary of approaching the firm owing to predatory behavior that is rampant.
Yesterday, The Information reported that Steve Jurvetson, a co-founder of DFJ, is being investigated for sexual harassment, as told to it by the Menlo Park-based firm.
DFJ says it launched an investigation in August after rumors began swirling about him.
Said longtime DFJ employee Carol Wentworth to the outlet, [E]arly this summer we became aware of indirect and secondhand allegations about Steve Jurvetson and we immediately opened an independent investigation, which is ongoing at this time.
Asked for comment earlier today, Wentworth would only share the same statement.
It isnt clear if the investigation is tied or tied exclusively to Keri Kukral, founder of a company called Raw Science.
But she wrote on Tuesday on a Facebook post that women approached by founding partners of Draper Fisher Jurvetson should be careful.
Predatory behavior is rampant.
She added that silencing behavior ranges from security w/in the firm creating files on women, to potential violations of revenge porn laws, to grotesque threats.
Kukral also wrote, somewhat cryptically, that women have been banned by heads of TED from attending conferences.
I have experienced some (not all) of these things along with many others.
The situation I found myself in is personally atypical and Ive not been in any other situation remotely like it.
I was not seeking investment or trying to further my career.
My investment rounds have occurred entirely outside of Silicon Valley both before and after this experience.
I will not step foot in SV for investment.
Kukral had a personal relationship with Jurvetson a couple of years ago, a source tells us.
Kukral had added in subsequent comments to her post that her experience was not in a professional context.
The founding partners of DFJ are Tim Draper, who left the firm two years ago, Steve Jurvetson and John Fisher, who remains on DFJs growth team.
In the meantime, writing on her personal site this morning, Heidi Roizen, who has been a partner with the firm since early 2012, didnt mince words about the firms culture, saying that [S]imply put, I would not work for DFJ if I felt the culture was not one of high integrity and opportunity for all including women.
Including me.
Two other women Annie Hazlehurst, a former DFJ employee who today runs her own science and software-focused venture firm in New York, and another former DFJ employee named Courtney McColgan, who is today the co-founder and CEO of Runa, a Mexico City-based HR software startup have also come to DFJs defense, and that of Jurvetson.
Writing on Medium, the women say that while theyve both experienced sexism on a daily basis in many forms and forums, neither encountered it at DFJ or working with Steve Jurvetson.
Instead, they continue, The fact that we are in leadership positions in the industry today is a testament to Steve and DFJ cultivating an environment where women advance professionally.
DFJ thrives on intellectual curiosity and collaboration.
Our contributions were respected from partner meetings to board rooms.
Our accomplishments yielded promotions and long term career tracks.
And Steve was always our strongest professional champion, nominating us to speak at conferences, sit on boards and represent DFJ around the world.
Worth noting: Roizen was less protective of Jurvetson specifically in her post, writing that this past summer, we heard about allegations of misconduct by one (and only one) of our partners from a third party.
We felt the responsible thing to do was to launch an independent investigation, and so we did.
It is still ongoing.
She said that she doesnt need an investigation to state with certainty that the claim about predatory behavior at the firm is patently wrong.
I am too grizzled and old to write bullshit about a company to please my boss.
Im writing this because I believe it to be true, added Roizen.
We sat down last month with Jurvetson at our TechCrunch Disrupt event.
Jurvetson is not talking about the investigation with the press, per the firm.
Weve also reached out to Kukral; we have yet to hear from her but hope to have more on this story soon.
Facebook today introduced a good handful of new features for groups on Facebook, with a focus on helping admins better manage and grow their online communities, and helping members better connect with one another.
The additions, inspired by user feedback, include support for welcome posts, badges, member profiles and other admin-level controls.
The company met this June with hundreds of Facebook group admins at its first-ever Facebook Communities Summit in Chicago.
This allowed Facebook staff to hear directly from those who run online groups what sort of tools they need.
One common activity that admins do is welcome new members to their Facebook group.
But until today, this has been done manually by writing a post, then locating each new member and tagging them one-by-one in that post.
A new welcome posts feature, however, lets admins write a welcome post that automatically tags new members, speeding up the process.
Two other new features are focused on helping members better get to know one another, as well as their admin team and other group leaders.
With the new badges, members will now be able to easily spot group admins, moderators and members who only recently joined the group.
Meanwhile, member can also now view group-specific profiles about others when they click on their name.
This gives you a brief intro to the person using publicly available information, like how long theyve been a member of the group, whether you have mutual friends or if theyre attending any of the same events as you.
The idea, Facebook explains, is to help people discover if they have anything in common with the other group member.
These mini-profiles also have buttons that let you view the persons full Facebook profile, message them directly or add them as a friend.
Facebook is also introducing new tools and controls for groups, including a Group Insights tool that offers tips like when to schedule posts based on historical member engagement data.
And admins can now turn off commenting on a per-member basis instead of locking down an entire posts comments, to help keep conversations flowing without the bad elements.
They can additionally choose to boot members from multiple groups they manage with a single click, if those members cant abide by the group rules.
These are the first of many changes to come to Facebook Groups in the days ahead, Facebook notes, as it learned a lot from its interactions with community admins, it says.
It also started an invite-only Facebook group for admins where it can collect further feedback.
The new tools and features are rolling out starting today.
SoundShare, an app that lets you text your friends entire songs, was already one of the more clever iOS applications available.
Recently, the app rolled out an update that introduces a redesign and whole new experience called Party Mode that lets friends play songs through your device like at get-togethers, where everyone wants to hear their favorite music.
These collaboratively chosen songs can also stream through YouTube to your Apple TV, by way of AirPlay.
While there are other apps that support sharing music with friends Apple Music has an iMessage app, as does Spotify the benefit to using SoundShare is that you and your friends dont have to be on the same service.
The app supports sharing music including individual tracks and playlists that can be streamed via Spotify, Apple Music or Deezer, as well as YouTube.
By default, the app uses iTunes as the music search engine and YouTube as the audio source.
But if you connect your preferred music service account to the app, SoundShare replaces the search engine and audio source with your music service.
The songs will also play in your music services player, instead of in SoundShares in-app player, after youre linked up.
In practice, what this means is that you can search on your connected Spotify account for a song, then send it over to a friend, who can listen to it using their Apple Music account.
However, if you prefer to watch the music videos when receiving songs, you can now opt to make YouTube your default player.
Theres a social element, too, allowing friends to see each others listens and shares (unless theyre using the new stealth mode).
While the original version of the app was meant for sharing music while youre apart from friends, the version 3.0 adds a feature for sharing music when youre together.
Now users can start a Party inside SoundShare, then invite friends to control the music.
The feature works over the app itself, not Bluetooth, which means it could also be used to have a remote co-listening party with friends, if you choose.
As friends add, remove and change songs inside the Party, your device will continue to update and play their selections.
Friends songs can be added to play next or at the end of the queue, as they prefer.
The music can be streamed to any Bluetooth speaker connected to your iPhone, but for a bit of extra fun, you can opt to stream the music to Apple TV with AirPlay.
This allows your group to watch the YouTube music videos, instead of just hearing the songs.
This collaborative playlist can be saved afterwards for later listening, too.
SoundShare is also one of the first apps to feature deep integration with Apples MusicKit, introduced in iOS 11.
This allows it to load your Apple Music For You page inside SoundShare, and access your recommended mixes, like your Favorites Mix, Chill Mix and New Music Mix, as well as display daily playlists, daily albums, Spotlight playlists, new releases and more.
SoundShare is a free download on the App Store.
The company declined to share its user numbers.
But developer Matt Abras, whos based in Brazil, says it has attracted attention from a handful of music industry and tech execs, and the company is now in talks with some about doing deals.
The company is not yet generating revenue.
Instagrams newest feature lets you make your own Dramatic Chipmunk-style video by shooting a stuttered zoom-in, including cinematic sound effects, with a single tap.
Superzoom is coming to Instagram Stories on iOS and Android today, alongside an array of spooky Halloween stickers and augmented reality masks.
Superzoom joins Instagrams Boomerang GIFs, Hyperlapse time-lapse and Layout collages amongst its tool kit of extra camera effects.
As Instagram battles Snapchat for users, and both now have AR masks, each is looking for new effects that will inspire creativity and tip the balance as people choose between the competing apps.
You can watch our hands-on video below.
We tested Instagrams Superzoom and found it easy to use and entertaining.
You pick the front- or rear-facing camera, and the targeting reticle makes it simple to line up your shot.
Instagram does the rest of the work with a three-stage zoom in with synced-up bold orchestral sound effects.
The videos last three seconds, but you can hold down the shutter button longer to extend them up to 15 seconds, lingering with a slow final zoom on your subject.
Its great for catching people candidly, or turning a selfie into something much more grandiose and hilarious.
And Instagram confirms to me that special stabilization tech allows it to keep the frame steadier than you could do manually.
You can post the videos to your Story, Instagram Direct or save them to your camera roll for posting to Instagrams feed or elsewhere.
How did Instagram come up with Superzoom?
Our users, product manager Jyoti Sood told us.
Time and time again, we have seen people using Instagrams camera to zoom in on their friends to capture and create funny moments.
We wanted to make it easier for them to do that in our camera while also offering a playful new touch with sound.
Those users were probably taking inspiration from the classic dramatic chipmunk meme, but also Viners like Sarah Schauer, who popularized the comedic effect a few years ago.
Itd be great if there were more sound effects to choose from for Superzoom, and an Instagram spokesperson tells us We would love to explore more options for music and sound, but we dont have any concrete plans to share right now.
With just the one musical style that can get a bit old, I expect Superzoom to become a solid arrow in creators quivers, and it will surely be a fad for a few days.
But it doesnt have the same open-ended potential of Boomerang which Snapchat has still yet to copy.
What about Instagram allowing licensed music soundtracks or a sound board for adding effects to your videos?
Sood says, Were excited about the opportunity to add more sound and music options to Instagrams camera so users can share even richer experiences with their friends.
While we have no plans to share right now, well be listening to our community for feedback on Superzoom to learn and improve.
As for the Halloween features, youll see the expected array of pumpkin and candy corn stickers.
The AR masks play with light in interesting ways, from putting a creepy flashlight on your face in the dark, shrouding you in fog or putting you on night-vision camera.
There also are vampire fangs and zombie make-up selfie filters to play with.
Theyre all a bit more palatable and predictable than Snapchats Halloween masks that give you a floating banshee body, bloody ghoul strobe effect or some kind of beach Frankenstein look.
If Instagram can use the size, money and engineering resources to develop new features faster than Snapchat, it could escape from being pigeonholed as a copy cat.
That could let it grow even faster, score more ad views and regain cool amongst teens.
Meet Station, a startup that was created by startup studio eFounders.
Station has been working on the only work app you need.
It combines all the services you need into a single window and handles notifications and documents better than a normal browser.
If you dont spend your life in Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Outlook, chances are you spend most of your days in a web browser, navigating between countless tabs.
When you are working with five different Google Spreadsheets, a couple of Trello dashboards and a handful of other services, it gets harder to find what youre looking for.
With Station, available for both Mac and Windows, you can find the document youre looking for more easily.
You then need to add all your accounts one by one.
Station supports dozens of services, but the most popular ones are Gmail, Google Drive, Slack and Trello.
We have 300 app integrations.
We have a good user base with 2,500 people who use Station at least 4 days per week, co-founder and CTO Alexandre Lacheze told me.
Station App - App Store Station App - Instant Search Station App - Notification Center Station App - Smart Dock Station App - Smart Dock2 View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Each service has its own icon in the bar on the left.
You can switch from one service to another just like youd switch from one account to another in Slack.
This app metaphor works quite well for document-based apps, such as Google Drive.
When you click on the icon, Station shows you your most recent documents and you dont get lost between multiple tabs.
By centralizing everything in one app, Station adds a couple of nifty features.
For instance, theres a universal search bar that lets you search for content across all your apps.
Think about it as a sort of Spotlight for web apps.
Notifications also get their own tab.
You can scan recent emails, Trello notifications and Slack messages in the same interface.
And theres also a focus mode that lets you silence notifications for a 15 minutes or an hour.
We noticed high retention rates among marketing and sales teams, co-founder and CEO Julien Berthomier told me.
It works well for operational, support and marketing profiles.
The usual marketing person is going to use more than 20 different apps.
While Station is free for now, the startup is working on a paid offering for teams.
Companies will be able to subscribe to Station to build pre-configured profiles.
If a company recruits new marketing persons, the marketing team will be able to share a Station template so that new employees have everything they need from day one.
Station is also a good way to get insights about who is using what.
For instance, if a company pays for a service but nobody is using it, chances are you can cancel your corporate subscription.
Lets see if this will be enough to make companies pay for Station.

As congressional lawmakers investigate Russias role in the 2016 presidential election, they are looking at social medias function in the spread of misinformation.
Representatives from Facebook and Twitter have already privately met with lawmakers on the Hill to discuss purchased ads during the campaign.
And both Senate and House intelligence committees have asked the companies, along with Google, to come back for a public hearing in the next few months.
Heres what you need to know about the tech companies involvement.
How is Facebook involved in the investigation?
Last month, Facebook revealed that it uncovered about $100,000 in ad purchases connected to inauthentic accounts that violated its policies.
Another $50,000 was found to have been spent on potentially politically related ad spending that were in Russian.
Facebooks Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos said the accounts were likely operated out of Russia.
As lawmakers have called for more information about the advertisements, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to make its political advertising more transparent.
FACEBOOK WILL RELEASE RUSSIA-LINKED ADS TO CONGRESS, ZUCKERBERG SAYS President Donald Trump accused Facebook of being always anti-Trump in a tweet.
But Zuckerberg hit back and said both sides of the political aisle were upset by content on Facebook proving what running a platform for all ideas looks like.
What about Twitter?
Twitter representatives told lawmakers that it suspended approximately two dozen accounts that were potentially linked to Russia and corresponded to Facebooks troublesome accounts.
Additionally, it said it found 179 related accounts that violated their rules.
Twitter also revealed in a blog post that Russia Today, which it said has strong links to the Russian government, spent $274,000 in ads in 2016.
After representatives met with lawmakers, Rep. Mark Warner, D-Va., slammed the information shared from Twitter as being frankly inadequate on almost every level.
He said Twitters explanations of its response was deeply disappointing.
Twitter announced Thursday that it has banned ads from Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik.
The social media giant said it would use the money already spent on advertisements by Russia Today for research around civic engagement and electoral misinformation.
And Google?
Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Google Search products and Gmail regarding the 2016 election, Fox Business reported.
However, the ads do not appear to be from the same source as those purchased on Facebook.
Accounts connected with the Russian government spent $4,700 on search and display ads and $53,000 was spent on ads with political material that were purchased from either a Russian territory, Russian Internet address or with Russian currency, according to the Associated Press.
"We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries," Google said in a statement.
Why does it matter?
The issue over social medias involvement in the investigation largely stems from advertisements bought from the companies, not necessarily the content shared by users, Dr. Karen North, a clinical professor of communication at the University of Southern California, told Fox News.
TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW But the issue further boils down to what is wrong versus what is illegal.
Spreading so-called fake news is wrong, but it might not be illegal, the social media expert explained.
We as users of social media platforms do not want the platforms to be telling us what we can or cant say or even that we cant say falsehoods because people spin the story of their lives to present a public face to our friends and colleagues, North said.
We dont want Facebook or Twitter to tell us we cant do that.
North predicted that social media companies will begin to strengthen their regulations or dress codes for future advertisers.
There are laws [to protect speech] and then there are rules of conduct, including dress codes at offices or schools, North said.
Whether or not whats being done by the Russians or fake news or people lying about adventures in their life, are those illegal or in violation of dress codes?
Fox News' James Rogers and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Embattled security firm Kaspersky Lab said its antivirus software did download secret hacking tools from a US computer back in 2014, but deleted them after realizing the data was classified.
"The archive was deleted from all our systems.
The archive was not shared with any third parties," Kaspersky Lab said on Tuesday.
The Moscow-based security firm has been fighting accusations that its antivirus software helped Russian spies steal confidential files from the US National Security Agency.
On Tuesday, Kaspersky Lab tried to clear the air, and said its antivirus software did indeed download the secret hacking files, but only because they were flagged as malware after an NSA contractor's home computer was reportedly infected.
"US law tolerates inadvertent acquisition of classified data, but doesn't allow to distribute it.
We deleted it to follow the law," the company's CEO Eugene Kaspersky tweeted on Wednesday.
The Russian security firm added: "Kaspersky Lab has never created any detection of non-weaponized (non-malicious) documents in its products based on keywords like 'top secret' and 'classified'."
In a statement, the security firm provided a timeline detailing how Kaspersky Lab came across the classified files, which seems to point the finger at the careless behavior of the NSA contractor.
In 2014, Kaspersky was investigating a shadowy hacking group called Equation, which experts now believe is actually the NSA.
Ultimately, Equation Group hacking tools ended up in the hands of a group known as the Shadow Brokers, which reportedly has links to Russia.
As part of its investigation into the Equation Group, Kaspersky's antivirus software detected some unknown malicious code in a 7-zip archive on a US home computer.
The archive was then uploaded to Kaspersky Lab for analysis, and was found to contain an arsenal of hacking tools.
According to Kaspersky Lab, the computer in question at one point downloaded and installed pirated software that contained a separate piece of malware called "Backdoor.Win32.Mokes.hvl."
Kaspersky's software flagged it as malicious.
However, to get the pirated software to run, the computer's user disabled Kaspersky's antivirus product.
The computer was then infected with a backdoor that Kaspersky Lab says can give a hacker remote control over the system.
Kaspersky Lab isn't sure how long the computer was infected with the backdoor.
But its software first detected its presence on Oct. 4 2014, with a final detection on Nov. 17 of that year.
It's also unclear who may have been in control of the backdoor.
Jake Williams, founder of US cybersecurity firm Rendition InfoSec, said "I think the story Kaspersky has laid out is completely plausible."
It'll be up to the US government to back up its own claims against Kaspersky, he added.
"And they need to back their claims with data, not just accusations," Williams said.
Many of the accusations against Kaspersky have come from media reports that largely cite anonymous sources.
Nevertheless, the US Department of Homeland Security is forcing federal agencies to stop using the company's antivirus software.
Retailers such as Best Buy have also dropped Kaspersky Lab products from store shelves.
In response, Kaspersky Lab has offered up an independent review of the company's source code for flaws.

Future U.S. military tanks may look and perform nothing like they do today.
In fact, they may not even have windows and instead seal military personnel inside a closed cockpit to better protect them against threats.
But how could they see the battlefield around them without windows?
To see outside, Soldiers could use a new technology made by Honeywell that lets them see with virtual reality and augmented reality.
Using a headset and a wraparound display, drivers are given the effect of seeing beyond the armor to the war zone around them.
The augmented reality even enhances their sight by overlaying crucial information like enemy movements and safe routes ahead.
This remarkable advance is part of the DARPAs Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) initiative that could lead to an entirely new era of tanks and armored combat vehicles.
GXV-T would offer tank-like protection on a vehicle that resembles a futuristic All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) but is smaller than a traditional tank.
SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR DARPA awarded eight contracts to work on the exciting, groundbreaking GXV-T. Honeywell is one of these companies.
Recently, Honeywell successfully tested this window-free tech on a tough, off-road desert course at speeds of more than 35mph.
The drivers successfully maneuvered the course from inside the closed cockpit relying on the sight provided by the virtual reality system.
Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are already interested in DARPAs vision for this radical new vehicle.
The GXV-T would provide the U.S. military with enormous advantages over adversaries.
Far Better Armor The big advantage to no windows?
Keep US military personnel inside a whole lot safer.
Another research thrust for DARPA on the GXV-T project is radically overhauling the approach to armor.
For more than a century, the approach has been more armor equals more protection.
WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?
There are, however, tradeoffs to more armor, such as adding more weight, which means less speed and agility.
These capabilities can be essential in some scenarios so finding the right balance between the armor trade-offs is never easy.
But with GXV-T, the goal is a closed cockpit that allows reactive armor to enhance safety on the outside.
Reactive armor detects threats and reacts.
So, for example, when it anticipates the impact of a threat like an RPG, this armor would be able to shift and concentrate in the area it will impact.
Without the windows, it may be possible to do far more with less armor and still offer far better protection.
PODCAST: VAMPIRE BATS V. NAVY SEALS.
INSIDE JUNGLE WARFARE WITH SEAL TEAM 6 How does it work?
Honeywell harnessed its experience with aircraft cockpits and applied it to creating a GXV-T cockpit.
Cameras and sensors fixed on the vehicle feed data to onboard computers.
These stitch together the data into one cohesive image and the wraparound internal screens display this imagery.
WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?
The operator dons the special virtual and augmented reality headset and when that is combined with the panoramic screen it creates the effect of seeing outside the vehicle whilst safely inside a closed cockpit.
Already, Honeywells virtual landscape allows an operator to off-road at realistic speeds.
This set of initial tests were conducted with 160-degree views.
DARPAs aim is for a 360-degree view and although it may seem impossible, it may be possible to achieve that.
Motion sickness and eye strain are two common complaints and tough challenges for companies working to advance virtual reality.
Honeywell seems to have cracked these pesky problems because the feedback thus far has been very positive with drivers not suffering from either complaint.
Augmented Reality View Safety and protection is paramount, but another key advantage to this revolutionary approach is providing operators with enhanced sight.
With augmented reality, operators can have crucial data overlaid as well.
Already, Honeywell has been able to build in speed, heading, and position data augmentation.
But lots of further symbols could be added to further assist drivers during their missions.
AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEARS SHOW Enemy movements, the best routes to avoid detection, upcoming difficult terrain, threat detection these are just a few examples of useful data that could augment what a driver sees.
Enhanced situational awareness will also improve safety for personnel.
In many ways, this is very similar to the data displayed in U.S. fighter pilots cockpits, but would now be available to ground forces in closed cockpits.
PODCAST: LEARN HOW TO FLY A FIGHTER JET WITH A FASCINATING FIGHTER PILOT What is GXV-T?
DARPAs Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) is advancing tech for combat in many ways.
Overall, the goal is to produce smarter, faster and more agile vehicles for the future force.
Another area that will increase protection, for example, is the progress being made to develop the GXV-T as ultra-stealthy.
ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS' Tanks are not exactly known for being stealthy.
But imagine if the military could have a vehicle with tank protection, but fighter jet stealth?
Advances are being made in tech for the GXV-T to evade detection by the enemy from acoustic and electromagnetic methods through to infrared.
A new kind of driving For the military, these kinds of big breakthroughs could pave the way to the future force taking tanks into battle that have remarkable advantages like this virtual and augmented reality and futuristic reactive armor.
This would turn them into much lighter and far more agile vehicles, while providing even more protection for U.S. troops.
But there is also potential for significant impact in the civilian world.
Honeywells achievement could help pave the way to a future where civilians take advantage of the enhanced safety closed cockpits could offer and drive windowless as well.
Or windshields could become transformed into displays that offer augmented reality, suggesting optimal routes to avoid traffic so drivers will never have to look down at their phones for Waze again.
Twitter has banned ads from all accounts owned by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik following the social media giants probe into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election.
This decision was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 U.S. election and the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government, explained Twitter, in a blog post Thursday.
We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter.
Last month, Twitter confirmed that state-owned RT spent $274,100 on U.S. ads on its platform during 2016.
TWITTER UNCOVERS $274K IN AD SPENDING BY TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES TIED TO 2016 ELECTION In its blog post Thursday, Twitter said that it will be using RTs ad spending (projected to be $1.9 million since 2011) for research around civic engagement and electoral misinformation.
RT slammed Twitters move.
Allegations of election interference are absolutely groundless and greatly-misleading, according to Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RTs Deputy Editor-in-Chief, in an article posted to RTs website Thursday.
Karnovich-Valua says that, in 2016 negotiations, Twitter representatives pitched a large-sum advertising proposal to RT.
The proposal, which was eventually declined by RT, involved promoting RTs U.S. election coverage on Twitter, he added.
TWITTER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE AD TRANSPARENCY AFTER RUSSIAN-BACKED SCANDAL RT has never been involved in any illegal activity online, Karnovich-Valua wrote.
It never pursued an agenda of influencing the US election through any platforms, including Twitter.
A Twitter spokeswoman told Fox News that the San Francisco-based firm does not have any comment on private conversations with advertisers, including former advertisers.
Sputniks Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan described Twitters decision as regrettable on Thursday.
Simonyan is also the Editor-in-Chief of RT.
FACEBOOK UNCOVERS $100K IN FAKE AD SPENDING TIED TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES DURING 2016 US ELECTION Sputnik has never used paid for promotion on Twitter, the news outlet added, in a statement emailed to Fox News.
Sputnik news channels are followed by people who are tired of the mainstream and who are looking for an alternative perspective on the news.
Despite the advertising ban, RT and Sputnik, which are both state-owned, can remain organic users on Twitter.
On Wednesday, Twitter announced a plan to increase ad transparency on its platform, including political and issue-based ads.
Last month Facebook said that it had uncovered $100,000 in fake ad spending tied to Russian operatives during the 2016 U.S. election cycle.

I made this discovery by accident.
For the past year, Ive been using the Google Home speaker to ask Google questions about my daily activities.
Ive asked about the weather, inquired about directions to a local pizza place, and tried to find recipes for blueberry pancakes.
Nothing too major.
A few times, my wife would ask Google about store hours at Costco and to find out about political news.
This week, I found out that Google records every one of those questions.
Using the My Activity portal, you can also find out everything about your life.
Did you ask about the Miami Dolphins, or President Trump, or ask for directions to the cleaners?
Its all there.
Did you also ask Google about a local meeting of alt-right conspiracy theorists?
Inquire about cancer treatments?
Look up places that sell sex robots?
Its all recorded.
GOOGLE'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPUTER 'NO LONGER CONSTRAINED BY LIMITS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE' Its also a bit startling, because you hear your own voice, recorded as far back as a year ago.
And, while Google reps claim this is something users have to agree to during setup, its a little-known option called Voice and Audio Activity.
Even if you disabled the option to save your internet history in Chrome, youre likely still being tracked in My Activity.
It saves every movie you watch, the music you listen to, every YouTube video you find, all of your image searches, and just about everything you do online.
(If you use Incognito mode in the Chrome browser, none of that activity is saved.
You can also disable My Activity logging.)
To hear your own voice, just visit the My Activity site.
It also saves all of your internet browsing history for some reason, even if you have that disabled in the Chrome browser.
The recordings and activity are saved every time you use the Google Assistant voicebot on your phone and in the Google Allo app, not just when you use the Google Home speaker.
GOOGLE PHOTOS WILL NOW RECOGNIZE YOUR PETS Googles MyActivity portal is both a blessing and a curse, Richard Henderson, a global security strategist at security firm Absolute, told Fox News.
Its a blessing because it really does provide a one-stop shop of all your activity across all your various Google properties, like your Android phone, your browsing and Gmail, as well as the Google Home assistant.
But its also a curse because it really demonstrates the level of data that many massive technology companies collect in order for them to profit.
Henderson says users are typically not aware that they are being recorded.
Worse yet, if you do disable the voice recording, it neuters the speaker or other devices that rely on Google Assistant for voice commands.
(Google reps confirmed this but said the speaker can still stream music.)
Theres no way of knowing how the recordings are saved and used, he says.
Earlier this month, a reporter at Android Police discovered that a new Google Home Mini speaker was recording not just his own phrases when he said the OK Google hotword but everything being said at all times.
Google permanently immediately resolved the bug.
GOOGLE PARENT ALPHABET TURNS ON INTERNET BALLOONS IN PUERTO RICO Amazon Echo speakers also record everything you say.
The problem with voice-activated products is that they tend to obscure the privacy policies or list them only in an app.
These devices require the user to opt-in to voice control or, with devices like the Amazon Echo, only listen for control words, such as "Alexa," and only start recording once they hear the control word, says Andrew Howard, chief technology officer at Kudelski Security, told Fox News.
The challenge for consumers is that these devices can change their policies, often quietly, and it is impossible to confirm compliance with the stated privacy policies.
Generally, consumers should use these new capabilities with a bit of caution.
Google reps released a statement to Fox News about this issue: Google only stores voice-based queries received after recognizing the hotword.
Hotword detection runs locally on the device and if the hotword is not detected, the audio snippet stays local on the device and is discarded.
If the hotword is recognized, the data, including the query contents, are sent to Google servers for analyzing and storage in My Activity.
An Australian woman discovered a giant earthworm squirming above ground this week after torrential rains in Queensland unearthed the insect.
The photo posted by Australias 7 News on Tuesday showed Kelli Mace holding up the two-foot worm, believed to be a digaster longmani, with sticks.
The picture was taken on Tamborine Mountain in South East Queensland, where heavy rain has been pounding the region in the last week.
A post shared by 7 News Queensland (@7newsqueensland) on Oct 23, 2017 at 8:17pm PDT Digaster longmani are rarely spotted because they remain buried in the ground until rain sweeps and flood their homes, news.com.au reported.
They are one of the largest worm species and are only found in South East Queensland and northern New South Wales.
FREAKY-LOOKING BUG STUNS THE INTERNET Robert Raven, Head of Terrestrial Biodiversity at the Queensland Museum, told the news site the earthworm in Maces photo could measure up to three feet long once it relaxes and stretches out.
In the 1970s, I was walking through Lamington National Park and could hear them beneath me as they gurgled through some water, Raven recalled.
Seeing them is a sign we are getting good rain.
Broad City is sick of hearing President Trumps name and wants everyone else to censor him out, too.
Comedy Central announced on Wednesday that it's releasing a new browser extension that will allow users to censor anything with the word "Trump" on the internet.
WHAT TWITTER'S 280-CHARACTER LIMIT COULD MEAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND US POLITICS "Tired of hearing the president's name or even reading it online?
Broad City definitely is," the network said in a statement.
"Just like this season of Broad City, we will censor Tr**p's name, but this time across the internet."
In a video announcement posted on the networks Twitter page, it added, Tired of seeing Trump?
Us too.
Lets change that.
Fans can download the Trump-No-More tool with their Google Chrome browser by going to the Broad City website.
The tool will then show Trump as Tr**p in every text that mentions the presidents name on the internet.
It doesnt completely remove all Trump content from browsers.
The tool follows the current "Broad City" seasons pledge to bleep out Trumps name in every episode.
The season is currently airing on Comedy Central.

Sony will roll out a new robot dog thats capable of real Fido-like feelings including bonding with its human masters and responding to owner commands, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The pet bot will be similar to Sonys AIBO robot pet prototypes, which have been discontinued, and will have updated software to allow users to control their home appliances.
Sony plans to unveil the product at a media event next November and roll it out in spring 2018.
Its unclear how much it will cost.
Last year, Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai said at a strategy briefing that the company was in the process of developing a robot capable of forming an emotional bond with customers and able to grow to inspire love and affection.
Sony sold about 150,000 AIBOs between 1999 and 2006 for between $600 and more than $2,000, the Journal said.
The robots came with artificial intelligence allowing them to greet its owner, play with a ball, dance and sing songs.
The new pet robots will have smoother movements and improved motors and sensors.
They may also include internet connectivity allowing the pooch to learn new tricks and control appliances.

Nature is red in tooth and claw an adage that applies to the smallest creatures as well as the largest.
Just ask one unfortunate half-bee, who was gnawed in two by a yellowjacket wasp in a new video posted to Reddit by user Iamnotburgerking.
The video, posted without additional detail, shows the wasp pinning down and wrestling the bee and then slicing off its abdomen.
The bee slayer then flies away with the bee's rear end and leaves the hapless insect's front half scrambling.
It's gross, but not very strange behavior for yellowjackets, which take a wide range of prey, said James Carpenter, curator of Hymenoptera (the group of insects that includes wasps) at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
The field dressing of the bee isn't unusual, either, Carpenter told Live Science.
"Social wasps cut up prey to make it transportable," he said.
"Indeed, sometimes they chew it up into a food ball, getting rid of the appendages."
[Beastly Feasts: Amazing Photos of Animals and Their Prey] The common name "yellowjackets" comprises a large group of predatory wasps.
Their large, scissor-like jaws are made for capturing and gnawing on prey.
The largest yellowjacket wasps, hornets, are the most frequent predators of bees, Carpenter said.
Some species specialize in attacking beehives, he said, making bee raising (apiculture) all but impossible in those wasps' territories.
"An individual hornet can sit by the entrance to the hive, just crushing the bees," Carpenter said.
Bees can sting, but hornets and other wasps have a size advantage.
As such, some colonies defend themselves by mobbing the wasp attacker, Carpenter said, thus raising the wasp's body temperature and killing it via hyperthermia.
Wasps have strange interactions with other insects, as well.
In 2011, researchers reported that invasive yellowjackets in New Zealand were doing something never observed before: They were picking up ants that were nosing around their food sources, flying them a few inches away and dropping them.
The confused ants would rarely make it back to the food, and the wasps managed to avoid head-to-head battles with the ants, which are capable of spraying acid at attackers.
It may be tempting to root for the poor bee in the Reddit video, but Carpenter said honeybees are actually invasive species in most areas of the world, and their presence disrupts native bees.
Yellowjackets, on the other hand, keep many insect pests, including flies and beetle grubs, under control, so they can be a boon for agriculture, Carpenter said.
As for the bee's frantic head in the video, it may be destined to be wasp food, too.
Wasps sometimes leave part of their prey and then return for it later, Carpenter said.
There is good news for the bee, though: According to research released in April, it seems unlikely that honeybees can feel pain.
Original article on Live Science.
Sometime in 2014, a group of analysts walked into the office of Eugene Kaspersky, the ebullient founder of Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, to deliver some sobering news.
Kaspersky's anti-virus software had automatically scraped powerful digital surveillance tools off a computer in the United States and the analysts were worried: The data's headers clearly identified the files as classified.
"They immediately came to my office," Kaspersky recalled, "and they told me that they have a problem."
He said there was no hesitation about what to do with the cache.
"It must be deleted," Kaspersky says he told them.
The incident, recounted by Kaspersky during a brief telephone interview on Tuesday and supplemented by a timeline and other information provided by company officials, could not immediately be corroborated.
But it's the first public acknowledgement of a story that has been building for the past three weeks - that Kaspersky's popular anti-virus program uploaded powerful digital espionage tools belonging to the National Security Agency from a computer in the United States and sent them to servers in Moscow.
The account provides new perspective on the U.S. government's recent move to blacklist Kaspersky from federal computer networks, even if it still leaves important questions unanswered.
Borne of carelessness?
To hear Kaspersky tell it, the incident was an accident borne of carelessness.
Analysts at his company were already on the trail of the Equation Group - a powerful group of hackers later exposed as an arm of the NSA - when a computer in the United States was flagged for further investigation.
The machine's owner, identified in media reports as an NSA worker, had run anti-virus scans on their home computer after it was infected by a pirated copy of Microsoft Office, according to a Kaspersky timeline released Wednesday.
The scan didn't just treat the infection.
It also triggered an alert for Equation Group files the worker had left in a compressed archive which was then spirited to Moscow for analysis.
Kaspersky's story at least partially matches accounts published in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
All three publications recently reported that someone at the NSA's elite hacking unit lost control of some of the agency's powerful surveillance tools after they brought their work home with them, leaving what should have been closely guarded code on a personal computer running Kaspersky's anti-virus software.
But information security experts puzzling over the hints dropped by anonymous government officials are still wondering at whether Kaspersky is suspected of deliberately hunting for confidential data or was merely doing its job by sniffing out suspicious files.
Much of the ambiguity is down to the nature of modern anti-virus software, which routinely submits rogue files back to company servers for analysis.
The software can easily be quietly tweaked to scoop up other files, too: perhaps classified documents belonging to a foreign rival's government, for example.
Explicit warnings Concerns have been fanned by increasingly explicit warnings from U.S. government officials after tensions with Russia escalated in the wake of the 2016 presidential election.
Kaspersky denies any inappropriate link to the Russian government, and said in his interview that any classified documents inadvertently swept up by his software would be destroyed on discovery.
"If we see confidential or classified information, it will be immediately deleted and that was exactly (what happened in) this case," he said, adding that the order had since been written into company policy.
"If we see confidential or classified information, it will be immediately deleted and that was exactly (what happened in) this case."
- Eugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab An AP request for a copy of that policy wasn't immediately granted.
Kaspersky's account still has some gaps.
For example, why not alert American authorities to what happened?
The newspaper reports alleged that the U.S. learned that Kaspersky had acquired the NSA's tools via an Israeli spying operation.
Kaspersky declined to say whether he had ever alerted U.S. authorities to the incident.
"Do you really think that I want to see in the news that I tried to contact the NSA to report this case?"
he said at one point.
"Definitely I don't want to see that in the news."
So did he alert the NSA to the incident or not?
"I'm afraid I can't answer the question," he said.
Plausible explanation?
Even if some questions linger, Kaspersky's explanation sounds plausible, said Jake Williams, a former NSA analyst and the founder of Augusta, Georgia-based Rendition InfoSec.
He noted that Kaspersky was pitching itself at the time to government clients in the United States and may not have wanted the risk of having classified documents on its network.
"It makes sense that they pulled those up and looked at the classification marking and then deleted them," said Williams.
"I can see where it's so toxic you may not want it on your systems."
As for the insinuation that someone at the NSA not only walked highly classified software out of the building but put it on a computer running a bootleg version of Office, Williams called it "absolutely wild."
"It's hard to imagine a worse PR nightmare for the NSA," he said.
"They needed to defend the business from encroachment by Amazon," RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill told CNBC.
"Amazon's ability to impact the business over the near to mid term is low, but the ability to impact the stock is high."
CVS would lose the ability to control its own destiny if it didn't do something, Hill added.
"This could be $260 billion in revenue [in 2019]."
CVS has already been trying to establish greater control in its corner of the health care industry.
In 2007, the company acquired Caremark pharmacy benefit manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.
Aetna shares closed Thursday 11.5 percent higher at $178.60 a share after The Wall Street Journal posted its report.
CVS shares fell about 3 percent.
"The key here is you're going to control the health-care participants in a much greater way," said CFRA senior analyst Joseph Agnese.
By acquiring Aetna, CVS could offer customers lower co-pays in the drug stores.
"That will incentivize 23 million people to come to CVS rather than Walgreens," Agnese said.
He has a hold recommendation on CVS Health.
"I find it very difficult to imagine how Amazon will enter the space without making big acquisitions."
Amazon did not immediate respond to CNBC's request for comment.
CNBC reported in May that Amazon has been recruiting health insurance experts to develop an internal pharmacy benefits manager for Amazon employees.
However, RBC's Hill expects that, if Amazon were to announce an online pharmacy, it would still take the internet commerce behemoth a decade to get even 10 percent of market share.
In September, Hill had predicted an "inflection point" ahead for CVS should the company transform itself by acquiring a managed care organization like Aetna.
Such a move, Hill said at the time, "could transform itself and the space more broadly."
Hill told CNBC on Thursday he was optimistic how it appeared that CVS was now pursuing the right strategy.
"A year into this transaction, not only do you have a company with formidable offerings [in health care, but] maybe only United could compete."
Amazon has been making a strong push towards brick and mortar lately, acquiring Whole Foods and opening dozens of bookstores and pop-up stores.
But almost all the revenue from its push into the physical world is coming from Whole Foods.
Amazon broke out sales from "physical stores" for the first time in its third-quarter earnings report on Thursday.
The segment generated $1.28 billion in the quarter roughly the same as the $1.3 billion Whole Foods produced for Amazon in the period.
That means revenue from its other stores, like the 12 booksellers and 50-plus pop-up stores run by Amazon, is almost non-existent.
During the earnings call, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky acknowledged that most of the physical store sales came from Whole Foods.
A physical store, Olsavsky said, is a place "where customers are physically selecting items in a store, versus perhaps ordering online and picking up somewhere."
Amazon has yet to spell out a clear strategy behind its retail expansion.
In a previous call, Olsavsky said Amazon's bookstores are more than just a place to sell books, but also provide a great channel to showcase the company's hardware devices.
Last month, CNBC reported that Amazon is seeing an uptick in online sales in the regions where it already has a physical outpost.
The company is giving every indication that more physical stores are on the way.
"You will see more expansion from us," Olsavsky said during Thursday's call.
"It's still early, so those plans will develop over time."
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin added $8.6 billion to their combined wealth on Thursday, thanks to better-than-expected earnings reports from two of the world's three most valuable internet companies.
Bezos picked up an additional $6.24 billion in value, which likely puts him ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates to make him the world's richest person.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos was worth $83.5 billion earlier on Thursday, about $4.5 billion behind Gates at $88 billion.
Gates still owns 1.3 percent of Microsoft.
His wealth also increased Thursday afternoon, by about $340 million, after the software maker's earnings topped analysts' estimates.
Page is $1.2 billion richer and Brin's fortunes increased by $1.15 billion after Alphabet's third-quarter profit blew past expectations.
Prior to the results, they were worth $49.3 billion and $48.2 billion, respectively.
Technology leaders are climbing the ranks of the world's wealthiest people this year as their businesses outperform the rest of the market.
Six of the top 10 names on the list are founders of U.S. tech companies.
Next up is Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who's ranked fifth on the list at $72.4 billion, according to Bloomberg.
His company reports results on Nov. 1.
Times of economic difficulty tend to bring up talk of "safety stocks," but in times of economic prosperity, CNBC's Jim Cramer sees that narrative flip.
"What if the definition of safety is changing right before our eyes?
What happens when what's prudent suddenly becomes what's reckless and what used to be reckless becomes responsible?"
the "Mad Money" host asked.
"That, gentle viewer, is exactly what we are seeing in this market."
With strong economic activity around the world, Cramer said investing standards are changing.
In this kind of "synchronized economic expansion," stocks that may be seen as risky in other times could gain serious traction, he said.
One such stock is 3M, which delivered a handy earnings beat on Tuesday rife with orders from around the world.
"You could argue 3M's having one of its strongest years ever and that's saying something.
This company was founded in 1902," Cramer said.
"I am dazzled by the performance of this company and its stock, which soared from $220 to $237 in two days.
This is a big, old-line industrial.
You know what?
It went down a little today.
Pullback: gift."
CNBC's Jim Cramer has been noticing some disconcerting activity on social media as earnings season continues to drive the rally.
"I want to shine a light on something I saw in my feed on Twitter, something that's actually not a good sign ... for this red-hot, scorching bull market," the "Mad Money" host said.
"It concerns me, and I want it to concern you."
On Wednesday, Advanced Micro Devices, the computer chip maker, delivered an earnings report that missed Wall Street estimates for its profitability forecast, a key growth driver.
For years, Cramer saw the company as a sub-par competitor to Intel, but recently, AMD's new leadership started turning things around, tying the company to the lucrative data center and gaming sectors.
But "the party ended" with the chip maker's latest quarter, Cramer said.
The success of its new product lines was questionable, and rival semiconductor maker Nvidia posed a clear challenge to AMD's data center and gaming businesses.
As such, Cramer criticized AMD for losing steam and sending ripples of worry across a variety of tech-related market sectors.
But he didn't like the response he received.
"I went and looked at my feed today and what did I see?
A very sizable number of AMD followers criticizing me for being short AMD and trying to blast it down with negatives," Cramer said.
Cramer was less concerned about the "short" accusations; he's contractually forbidden to short or bet against stocks, or even own stocks that are not those of his employers.
"But when I see a host of people saying that AMD's going down because Jim Cramer's saying negative things about it, I need to warn you about something," he said.
"This is called 'homer' behavior, raw home-team booster-ism that lacks any sort of objectivity or rigor and has no place in the stock market.
This is how you lose money, people."
Cramer hadn't seen this kind of behavior in over 10 years, and it served as a sign to him that investor sentiment in the market is changing and it's changing for the worse.
Rooting for effort instead of performance is dangerous when it comes to stock-picking and investing, he said.
"People, listen to me: If a company misses estimates, it's not my fault that its stock goes down," he argued.
"This is business, not personal.
Managements do get it wrong.
Business can be difficult.
I promise you I'll monitor Twitter for this kind of behavior for other stocks, but only if you monitor your own behavior to be sure that you, too, aren't rooting too much for the home team and forgetting that, in this business, there is no home team.
Just dollars and cents.
Common sense."
Competitors trying to take a bite out of GrubHub's market share haven't been having much luck, GrubHub CEO Matt Maloney told CNBC on Thursday.
Maloney said that competitors like Postmates and Uber Eats, along with their venture-capital backers, have "wasted" billions of dollars on promotions in fruitless attempts to steal diners from GrubHub, currently the largest online food delivery platform in the United States.
"They've thrown it away, and then they pull back from the markets because you know what?
It's not about the promos," Maloney told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer.
"People want to connect with their restaurants.
It's about the service.
And the only thing we do is we connect diners to their restaurants."
With shares up 57 percent for the year after a strong quarterly earnings report, GrubHub has been expanding its footprint, now boasting over 75,000 restaurant partners and 9.8 million users across 1,300 cities.
Maloney told Cramer he was most excited about GrubHub's partnership with online review platform Yelp and its Eat24 food-delivery subsidiary.
"We have the deepest and the broadest network possible, and now with the Yelp partnership, they have over 100 million people every month looking.
And ... 70 percent of them are looking for restaurants," Maloney said.
"People want to order.
And so that's where we bring our orders in and that's where you're going to see increased conversion, increased performance on Yelp."
The CEO cited a statistic that in the United States, people collectively spend some $200 billion on take-out and delivery alone.
"We're on track to do around $4 billion.
So, $200 billion, $4 billion," Maloney said, drawing a comparison.
"We could 10x this company and it still wouldn't even barely touch [that]."
And with the volume of delivery orders steadily rising, Maloney told Cramer he sees plenty of opportunity going forward.
"We're by far the largest in the space," the CEO said.
"So there's so much room.
So much room to grow."
All the recent criticism of big tech in Washington D.C. and the popular media doesn't seem to be hurting the companies' financial results.
Four tech giants reported earnings after the bell on Thursday, and all of them beat expectations and saw their stocks shoot up.
A quick summary: Amazon: EPS of 52 cents came in way ahead of expectations of 3 cents, and investors gave the company a pass on its razor-thin 0.8 percent profit margin, the lowest it's shown since September 2014.
Total revenue was $43.8 billion, and Amazon Web Services, the company's pioneering cloud business, passed $4 billion in quarterly revenue and operating income of $1.17 billion.
The stock soared more than 7 percent after hours.
Alphabet: EPS of $9.57 topped estimates of $8.33, sending the stock up around 3 percent after hours.
Revenue was boosted by a surge in clicks on Google ads around the world, particularly in Asia.
For all the company's talk about its new businesses like Pixel phones, and long-term investments (a.k.a.
"Other Bets") like self-driving cars, nearly all of its revenue still comes from advertising -- $24.1 billion out of its total $27.8 billion, or 87 percent.
In a call with CNBC, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat reiterated the company's theme of "products with AI [artificial intelligence] at their core," but the main function of that AI today seems to be optimizing ad revenue.
Microsoft: EPS of 84 cents (excluding certain items) beat estimates of 72 cents, and the company's various cloud businesses topped a $20 billion annualized run rate for the first time -- they're on track to book $20.4 billion this year even with no further growth.
Digging into the company's report a little, most of its organic growth came from selling Office products (including the cloud-based Office 365) and server products and related cloud services (including Azure, its competitor to Amazon Web Services, which grew 90 percent in revenue from last year).
The company was the first old-guard enterprise software company to commit to the cloud, and investors rewarded that vision by sending the stock up 4 percent after hours.
Intel: EPS of $1.01 beat expectations of 80 cents, and the main surprise was that revenue in its client computing group -- that is, mostly chips in PCs -- was flat instead of down.
The stock was up about 1.5 percent.
Overall, these four companies have a combined market cap of close to $2 trillion.
Baidu shares were down as much as 14 percent after the company reported earnings that missed expectations Thursday.
The company beat estimated American Depository Share earnings, but missed revenue estimates.
Revenue was up 29 percent over this quarter last year.
Revenue: RMB 23.5 billion (approximately $3.53 billion) vs. RMB 23.6 billion ($3.56 billion), according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS: RMB 26 (approximately $3.89) vs. RMB 13.55 ($2.04), according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate The stock declined mostly due to lower-than-expected guidance for revenue for next quarter.
Revenue was projected to be RMB 22.2 billion ($3.35 billion), compared to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate of RMB 24.8 billion ($3.73 billion).
"In the third quarter, we made good progress in our strategic pillars to strengthen our mobile foundation and lead in AI," Baidu co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Robin Li said in a press release.
"On strengthening our mobile foundation, our strategy to leverage Baidu's leading AI technologies to increase the user scale and user stickiness of Mobile Baidu is showing measurable results.
On our AI initiatives, we continue to focus on developing platforms for smart device and autonomous driving markets, as well as leveraging AI into vertical sectors, such as financial services," Li said.
Shares of Expedia dipped more than 7 percent in after hours trading after the company's third quarter 2017 earnings failed to meet expectations.
This was the first earnings report for Expedia since Mark Overstrom took over as CEO, after Dara Khosrowshahi left to serve as the CEO of Uber.
The travel tech conglomerate reported earnings per share of $2.51 on $2.97 billion in revenue for the quarter, missing estimates of $2.62 earnings per share on $2.98 billion in revenue.
Quarterly revenue was up 15 percent year-on-year, however.
Expedia's bookings were light for the quarter.
Gross bookings grew by about $2.1 billion, or 11 percent year-over-year to $22.2 billion total for the quarter.
The owner of Hotels.com, HomeAway and Orbtiz, Expedia faced a season challenged by extreme weather events.
The company said it estimates a "negative impact of approximately $15 million to $20 million from the recent natural disasters," referring to hurricanes that wreaked havoc in popular tourist and business travel destinations in recent months.
Homeaway, the vacation rentals marketplace, remained a growth engine for Expedia.
It accounted for $305 million in revenue for the quarter representing a 45% increase year-over-year for the business.
Overall nights stayed through all Expedia lodgings brands, including Homeaway, increased just 16% year-over-year.
The number of properties available via Expedia's global lodgings business increased to 500,000 total as of the end of September.
The company also reported that 1.5 million online listings were now available on HomeAway, a direct Airbnb challenger.
The company's executives have said they will focus on long-term opportunities for growth in international markets, and a more aggressive approach to marketing and technology.
Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing business, grew 42 percent in the third quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations.
In its earnings report on Thursday after the market's close, Amazon reported AWS revenue of $4.58 billion, topping the $4.5 billion average analyst estimate, according to FactSet.
AWS remains the profit engine for Amazon, which has always operated on thin e-commerce margins.
While AWS accounted for 10 percent of Amazon's total revenue in the quarter, the unit generated operating income of $1.17 billion, while the company as a whole had operating profit of just $347 million.
AWS revenue growth was flat compared to the prior quarter, following eight straight quarters of slowing expansion.
"The business model at this scale is transitioning from hypergrowth to high growth alongside an increasing number" of competitors, analysts from KeyBanc wrote in a report on Tuesday.
Enterprises are increasingly willing to use more than one cloud, they wrote.
But AWS still leads the market for cloud infrastructure, which companies can use to run their applications without worrying about maintaining the underlying data center hardware.
AWS owned 30 percent of the market in the second quarter, more than double the market share of its closest competitor, Microsoft Azure, which had 14 percent, Matthew Ball, an analyst at Canalys,told CNBC last month.
"AWS seems to have settled into a sustainable competitive situation relative to Microsoft and Google," analysts at Canaccord Genuity wrote in a note on Oct. 19.
"We expect growth to remain high for the foreseeable future."
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that AWS surpassed $4 billion in sales for the first time.
It recorded $4.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter.
Intel raised its full-year outlook and reported quarterly earnings that easily topped analysts' expectations on Thursday.
Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Adjusted EPS: $1.01 vs. 80 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Overall revenue: $16.15 billion vs. $15.73 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters Client computing revenue: $8.86 billion vs. $8.68 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Data center revenue: $4.88 billion vs. $4.79 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Intel said it now expects full-year earnings of $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion.
That's up from its previous forecast for earnings of $3.00 per share on $61.3 billion in revenue.
The company reported net income of $4.52 billion.
That figure represent's 34 percent year-over-year growth.
In the year-ago quarter, Intel reported adjusted earnings of 80 cents a share on $15.78 billion in revenue.
Shares of Intel gained more than 1 percent in after-hours trade.
The stock has been on a tear this year, gaining 14 percent as of its Thursday close.
During the normal session, shares of Intel set a fresh 52-week intraday high of $41.58.
While the client computing group still brings in the lion's share of overall revenue, Intel has been shifting its focus away from the personal computer market amid declining PC shipments.
The segment reported better-than-expected revenue of $8.86 billion, or roughly flat year-over-year.
The company has instead highlighted its opportunities in new markets such as artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure.
Earlier this month, Intel said it is collaborating with Facebook to develop artificial intelligence chips for data centers.
This is breaking news.
Please check back for updates.
The company beat analysts' expectations in all three of its business segments, according to StreetAccount.
Revenue from Azure was up 90 percent year over year, and commercial revenue for Office 365 subscriptions was up 42 percent.
(As a whole, Microsoft's revenue was up 12 percent.)
Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Adam Borg were expecting Azure -- which is larger than Google's cloud and second only to Amazon Web Services -- to generate $1.3 billion in revenue, which would have been up 90 percent year over year.
In keeping with previous quarters, Azure compute usage more than doubled in the quarter, CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on a conference call after the earnings release.
PiperJaffray analysts Alex Zukin, Scott Wilson and Taylor Reiners had expected 30 percent growth in Office 365 commercial revenue, which would have been down from more than 40 percent in revenue growth in the past two years.
Microsoft got 10 percent more revenue from Office commercial products and cloud services, which includes Office 365 as well as its more traditional Office software.
Microsoft ended the quarter with 28 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, up from 27 million from the previous quarter.
Gaming revenue of $1.9 billion was up 1 percent, as Microsoft prepares for the launch of the Xbox One X console on Nov. 7.
A decline in gaming hardware revenue was offset by an increase in Xbox software and services revenue, CFO Amy Hood said on the conference call.
The KeyBanc analysts had expected $1.64 billion in gaming revenue.
LinkedIn revenue of $1.1 billion for the quarter was flat sequentially.
As for Windows, revenue from companies putting Pro versions of the operating system on devices was up by 4 percent.
The KeyBanc analysts had expected a 1 percent decline.
Microsoft's Surface hardware revenue was up 12 percent for the quarter, following the introduction of the Surface Laptop in June.
Search ad revenue was up by 15 percent, as the company saw higher search volume, as well as more revenue per search.
In terms of guidance, Hood said the company expects to report $27.8-28.6 billion in revenue in its fiscal second quarter, which will end on Dec. 31.
Analysts were expecting the company to guide to $28.15 billion in revenue for that quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.
Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the decline of the transactional Office business, Hood said.
Microsoft will increase its capital expenditures "to meet growing demand and capacity needs" in the fiscal second quarter, Hood said.
Microsoft stock is up about 27 percent since the beginning of the year.
In its fiscal first quarter the company acquired Cycle Computing, introduced the Azure Container Instances cloud service and said it was working on an artificial intelligence chip for a future version of its HoloLens mixed reality headset.
Ads on Google are getting more clicks than Wall Street expected but it is costing Alphabet slightly more than estimated to get that traffic.
Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations on Thursday and revenue that exceeded estimates.
Share prices passed $1,020 in after-hours trading surpassing the all-time intraday high of $1,016.31 set during the regular session on Oct. 18.
Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia.
Google is again stressing this quarter "how we're solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day," Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told CNBC's Josh Lipton.
"And fundamental to all of this is our focus in building products with AI at their core, and we believe Google is leading the way here."
Amazon's third quarter results far exceeded Wall Street expectations Thursday, pushing up its stock by over 7 percent in after hours trading.
Investors were expecting smaller profits as the third quarter is typically a heavy investment period for Amazon ahead of the holiday season.
But strong growth in North American sales and Amazon Web Services offset increased spending in new areas.
The company also offered a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, its largest quarter of the year.
Here are the most important numbers: Revenue: $43.7 billion vs. $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters $43.7 billion vs. $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters EPS: 52 cents vs. 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters 52 cents vs. 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters AWS revenue: $4.58 billion vs. $4.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue increased 34 percent from last year, in part due to the $1.3 billion in sales from Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in late-August.
North American sales were $25.4 billion, up 35 percent from last year, while international sales grew 29% to $13.7 billion.
AWS remains the the company's growth driver, jumping another 42 percent in sales.
Amazon's cloud business is the company's most profitable unit that allows it to keep investing in the core business.
Investors continue to give a pass on Amazon's laser-thin profits.
Operating profit dropped in all three major segments, by 40 percent in total to $347 million, as operating expenses grew 45 percent from a year ago.
That resulted in an operating margin of just 0.8%, the lowest since September 2014.
Still, Amazon shares were up by as much as 8 percent in extended hours, and have grown 30 percent year-to-date.
Amazon also broke out physical store sales for the first time, posting $1.3 billion in revenue, which primarily came from Whole Foods.
Amazon said it added 160,000 employees in the last three months (roughly 87,000 from Whole Foods), ahead of the all-important holiday seasons.
Amazon gave fourth quarter guidance in the range of $56.0 billion and $60.5 billion, right in-line with street estimates of $58.9 billion.
On Facebook, a friend who grew up in Memphis suggested that city for Amazon HQ2.
This was in response to The New York Times' analysis saying HQ2 would go to Denver.
Memphis isn't an obvious choice, and I don't know how it lines up with the official criteria.
So how can one quickly weigh if Memphis, or any other location, would be a good choice for Amazon?
Amazon is a company where it is always "Day 1".
Among other things, that means it tends to pursue disruptive ideas, such as using drones for deliveries.
Amazon would want HQ2 to be in a location that is supportive of a Day 1 company, if not outright still in Day 1 itself.
What I needed was a simple test for Day 1 type disruptions, and the last decade presented us with a perfect one: Ride sharing, and more specifically Uber.
Uber has been disruptive in applying technology to an urban transportation system (taxis) that hasn't changed significantly in almost a century, and has deeply entrenched interests.
Moreover, that system had become highly regulated with substantial public bureaucracies and government revenue streams linked to them.
So wherever Uber (or Lyft) went, it was going against "the system" and friction was to be expected.
What you could measure, very quickly thanks to Google and Bing, was just how much friction (or support) Uber ran into with local government.
So I did a search on Memphis and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the city of Memphis had sent its police force to arrest Uber drivers.
That seemed like a pretty extreme case of being unfriendly to Day 1 type disruptions, and I pointed that out to my friend.
He pointed out this was 2013 -- four years ago -- so I did a search on Denver and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the Colorado Legislature became the first in the country to explicitly legalize ride-sharing.
What Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said at the time was, "Colorado is once again in the vanguard in promoting innovation and competition while protecting consumers and public safety."
And when there was some friction in the city of Denver after that, the Police Chief acted quickly to resolve it.
Which makes more sense to locate the headquarters of a Day 1 company in: A place that sent the police to arrest Uber drivers or one that acted quickly to accept and encourage the disruption?
So let's get back to Newark.
There are many reasons I could think of for picking Newark as HQ2.
In particular the close proximity to New York City and all its benefits, with much better housing costs.
Making the reverse commute from Manhattan to nearby New Jersey cities has even become reasonably common in the last 20 years.
The incentives being offered are nice, but again they are a short-term benefit in a long-term play.
So I applied the Uber test to Newark, and it failed miserably.
Newark was still trying to force Uber into their taxi regulatory scheme as recently as 2016, banning them from Newark Airport and train station in February and planning to enact further regulation in April.
Uber was planning to abandon the city when a last minute deal was reached.
Compare what Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said about Uber "Just because they have a great idea, doesn't mean they have an exemption from rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades," with the earlier quote from Colorado Governor Hickenlooper.
I was particularly caught by the "rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades" part.
That doesn't read like a Day 1 supportive location to me.
It is quite possible that those words will come back to haunt Mayor Baraka when Amazon is evaluating the HQ2 proposals.
The Uber test isn't perfect for a couple of reasons.
One is that pretty much any locality that regulates taxis and limousines will try to put some regulatory regime around ride sharing.
The other is that Uber itself has valued confrontation with local governments and agencies over reaching an accommodation, and that in some cases has raised the heat significantly.
For example, I know of airports where Lyft was able to pick up months before Uber, because they negotiated a deal while Uber was still trying to fight the local airport authority.
So the Uber test isn't black and white, it is varying shades of grey.
But compare the light grey of Denver to the very dark grey of Newark and it, at the very least, gives an indication of which city would be more accommodating to a company where it is always Day 1.

The head of a major U.S. bank said Thursday that the anonymous nature of digital currencies like bitcoin is what authorities should be most concerned about, and that banks offer more security.
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan pointed out that while major financial institutions send trillions of dollars digitally all the time, cryptocurrencies don't clearly disclose who is involved in a transaction.
"There ought to be a hard look at the policy of anonymous currencies, because the ability to track information of money flowing is one we use seriously against terrorism and as [a tool] against improper, illegal behavior," Moynihan said on CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime Report."
What our banking system does for this country and the world is we track all this money and the data can be found and then you can do things to find people," he said.
Many people associate bitcoin with illegal activity since it was a major currency for online marketplaces that sold illicit drugs and supported money laundering.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this month called bitcoin an "index of money laundering."
Bitcoin transactions are encrypted and recorded in a permanent, online ledger called the blockchain.
Users identify themselves with a public address of numbers and letters in order to receive payments.
However, if a user stays with the same public address, intelligence agencies can potentially connect fund flows with an individual.
A U.S.
Homeland Security official and cryptocurrency analysts told CNBC in August that law enforcement is getting better at tracking down illegal activity in bitcoin, causing some to turn to more encrypted digital currencies.
Instagram on Thursday rolled out a fun new feature called Superzoom.
Practically everyone's talking about it on social networks, mainly because it's a pretty hilarious feature that builds on others, such as Boomerang, which have become incredibly popular.
Your kids are probably going to be talking about Superzoom tonight, so here's what it is and how to use it.
For instance, Apple said this quarter that Google would become the default web search option for Siri on iOS, and these types of deals have cost Google billions in the past, according to estimates.
"TAC trends will be a focus this quarter, as mobile advertising impression success remains a key going forward for Google in this very competitive land grab market opportunity," wrote Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, in a research note.
Alphabet's wide reach from Waymo's self-driving cars to its cloud business to leading an investment round in Lyft means that the company has plenty of options to make money outside of search.
Alphabet's Google business also contains Google Shopping, Maps, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Google Play and the burgeoning hardware division.
Google launched its Pixel 2 phone this fall and has expanded options for Google Home and Google earbuds.
Then there are the "other bets," including Google's start-up investing arms, Verily life sciences research and Nest smart-home devices.
Unfortunately, it's hard for Wall Street to get excited about some of these businesses Google hasn't revealed YouTube's revenue, a frustrating part of forecasting earnings, wrote Benjamin Schachter, of Macquarie Capital.
And the "other bets" are only expected to make $263.4 million during the quarter, according to StreetAccount's estimate, even as Porat has tried to push for more payoff.
Amazon's Alexa and a nascent advertising business are also in Google's peripheral.
"[T]he evolving businesses in Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and 'Other Bets' all remain interesting opportunities, but again, based on the track record, we don't see these being meaningful ... in the foreseeable future," Schachter wrote.
"We continue to believe that the Cloud business has the biggest potential, but think it is likely going to need a significant acquisition in order for it to become more relevant to the financial model and investors."
Google also faces regulatory pressure on its core business, expected to come to a head next week as tech companies testify on Capitol Hill about the role of Russian political advertising in the 2016 election.
Meanwhile, in Europe, Google's Shopping division may have to shift focus to deal with a record-breaking antitrust fine.
Nonetheless, Alphabet should have plenty of money to deal with any missteps.
Google will control about 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide this year, eMarketer projects.
Peter Thiel is a heavyweight entrepreneur and investor who made his career in Silicon Valley.
He launched and took public online payments company PayPal, was an early investor in Facebook and Airbnb and went on to launch software company Palantir Technologies.
But now the billionaire says that Silicon Valley's monopoly on technology company growth is over.
"I have been investing in the technology space entrepreneur and investor over the past 20 years in Silicon Valley and within the area of IT, it has for the last 10, 15 years in the US and the world been extremely centered on Silicon Valley," Thiel says, speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Thursday.
"I think there are a lot of reasons for that, but the question is, 'Where is the growth going to happen the next 10 years?'
And what I would tend to think is that it will be more diversified from just Silicon Valley."
The concentration of global tech companies in one small region in California has been a peculiar feature of the industry.
Earnings season can be hard for traders as they try to game who will beat or miss Wall Street estimates.
But one company is making it look easy.
Business communications company LogMeIn has reported earnings per share higher than the consensus Wall Street estimate every quarter for the last 8 years, according to research firm Bespoke Investment Group.
That's 32 quarters in a row.
And yet this incredible track record of surprises does not seem to be yet priced in.
The shares averaged a nearly 6 percent pop, on average, the day after its earnings report for the last eight years, according to Bespoke.
The business, known for its service of providing remote access to computers, is expected to report third-quarter EPS of $1.10, according to Estimize.
Regular traders and investors polled by Estimize believe the company will surprise once again, with earnings per share of $1.12.
To be sure, LogMeIn's impressive track record of beating the Street for more than half of the company's 14-year existence may raise the eyebrows of some skeptics.
One would think Wall Street would take a hint and raise their EPS by a penny or two after the company beats estimates for 32 quarters straight.
But going by the stock's reaction, the market is still willing to reward this "surprise."
Thursday marks the busiest day for earnings as a number of tech titans report.
Alphabet, Amazon, Intel and Microsoft release earnings after the bell Thursday.
The four companies combined represent 25 percent of the Nasdaq 100, and have a combined market cap of nearly $2 trillion and there are two names in particular that could be on the verge of a breakout.
Rich Ross, of Evercore ISI, says that of the four, the biggest laggard this year could actually be the big winner: Intel.
"You see a decisive breakout from a frustrating sideways trading range," the technician said, looking at a short-term chart of Intel Wednesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
"Other semiconductors in the SMH ETF and the SOXX Index have soared up over 25 percent year to date, but Intel's just starting to come into its own."
Equally compelling, says Ross, is a longer-term chart of Intel dating to 2012, which the technician believes is displaying a "bullish ascending triangle" that he says could have the stock going up to $50.
This means that Ross believes Intel could surge 22 percent.
Mark Tepper, CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, is betting on Alphabet, thanks to the rising shift toward mobile advertising.
"Internet advertising is huge, it's an over $75 billion a year industry just in the U.S. alone and it's growing at 15 to 20 percent year over year," he said on "Trading Nation."
"While traditional advertising still accounts for 59 percent of ad spending, there's obviously this secular shift towards internet and mobile advertising."
And that, according to Tepper, will make Alphabet a "long-term hold" for investors' portfolios.
The stock is up 25 percent year to date.
The Nasdaq 100 is up nearly 25 percent this year, thanks in part to strong earnings from big tech names.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia intends to invest $1 billion in Virgin Group space companies, according to billionaire Richard Branson's conglomerate on Thursday.
The contract is described as a "partnership on spaceflight, satellite launch and space-centric entertainment," backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.
The venture will fuel three Virgin companies Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Virgin Orbit and includes an option for an additional $480 million.
"This partnership with Virgin Group reflects the great strides the Kingdom is making towards our vision for a diversified, knowledge-based economy," Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a statement.
In a post on Virgin's website, Branson wrote that the investment "is a sign of confidence from the international community" in the three companies, which he emphasized will remain based in the Southwestern U.S. "We are now just months away from Virgin Galactic sending people into space and Virgin Orbit placing satellites around the Earth," Branson said.
Branson told CNBC last week that he is focused on using "space to benefit the Earth."
His space company, Virgin Galactic, has yet to send a manned craft into space but that may soon change.
He said the spaceship VSS Unity "should be in space in about four months."
Virgin Orbit is a further endeavor by Branson, which he spun off from Virgin Galactic to build air-launched rockets to send dozens of small satellites into orbit.
Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne system is still in development.
The company is planning the rocket's first test flight for early next year, with the system's Boeing 747-400 launcher in its final stages of flight testing.
Saudi Arabia's investment, subject to regulatory approval, would give the country "a significant stake" in the companies, but Branson says Virgin "will remain majority shareholders."
Ford will bring autonomous vehicles to a test market in 2018, said Ford CEO Jim Hackett on Thursday.
Hackett did not specify where the test will take place or provide many more details during a conference call with analysts after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.
Ford plans to bring an autonomous vehicle to market in 2021.
The company is trying to shake the image of being behind the recent trends in new mobility technologies, such as self-driving cars and electric powertrains.
Ford is investing $1 billion over the next five years in autonomous driving technology company Argo AI.
Hackett on Wednesday said staffing at Argo had just reached a "high-water mark," but he would not specify how many people worked there.
Hackett did say autonomous vehicles could lead Ford into new businesses.
For example, Ford said in August it would partner with Domino's Pizza to test the autonomous technology on pizza delivery routes in Michigan.
On Thursday's call, Hackett said partnerships such as this can reduce Ford's costs in developing the technology and allow the company to enter new industries.
"The world knows about ride-hailing, but I don't think they were thinking about pizza delivery," Hackett said on the call.
Silicon Valley firms such as Waymo and Tesla have arguably caught a lot more attention than traditional automakers for their efforts toward building autonomous vehicles.
Incumbents have responded by acquiring or investing in start-ups working on the technology.
General Motors bought self-driving startup Cruise Automation in 2016, and the startup Strobe in October.
Strobe makes Lidar, a laser-based sensor system used by self-driving cars to recognize surroundings.
Ford shares were up more than 1 percent on Thursday.
The stock so far this year has barely moved, whereas shares of GM are up roughly 30 percent and shares of Tesla are up more than 50 percent.
Several reports have suggested Apple won't have enough iPhone X units to meet demand when pre-orders open early tomorrow morning (12:01 a.m. Pacific, 3 a.m. Eastern).
If you want the best shot at getting an iPhone X on release day, Nov. 3, then follow some of these tips ahead of time.
There's no foolproof way to guarantee it, but these tips -- used by folks like myself who have been up at 3 a.m. ordering new iPhones before -- should put you ahead of the pack.
Good luck.
Twitter said on Thursday that it's immediately removing all off-board advertising from two of Russia's largest media outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik.
In late September, Twitter said that three accounts tied to Russia Today, including @RT_Com, @RT_America and @ActualidadRT, were specifically targeting "the U.S. market in 2016" ahead of the presidential election.
Twitter said at the time that RT spent $274,000 in U.S. ads last year and promoted more than 1,823 tweets.
Twitter said both accounts will remain active as organic users.
"Early this year, the U.S. intelligence community named RT and Sputnik as implementing state-sponsored Russian efforts to interfere with and disrupt the 2016 Presidential election, which is not something we want on Twitter," Twitter said in a blog post on Thursday.
"This decision is restricted to these two entities based our internal investigation of their behavior as well as their inclusion in the January 2017 DNI report.
This decision does not apply to any other advertisers.
RT and Sputnik may remain organic users on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules."
Twitter said it will donate the $1.9 million in advertising revenue it received from RT to "support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections, including use of malicious automation and misinformation, with an initial focus on elections and automation."

Twitter is getting its 'fair share' and is going to $20: Jim Cramer 13 Hours Ago | 01:40 Twitter has finally cleaned up its act, and it is now a "legitimate" platform for companies to place advertisements, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
"They got disciplined.
We've been waiting and waiting and waiting," Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street" after Twitter reported revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations.
"It was a takeover story for a while," Cramer added.
"And now it could be ... this is a story about a site that is getting the Bank of Americas.
That kind of advertising.
It's getting banks.
It's getting consumer product goods."
Shares of Twitter were 13 percent higher Thursday after its quarterly results.
Ad revenue declined 8 percent year over year, but data licensing and other revenue increased 22 percent over the same period, the company said.
Cramer said he believes the social media company could now be getting a "fair share" of ads, while before people felt the company was "too scatological."
The stock will "get to $20" and it will become "part of the mix," the host of CNBC's "Mad Money" said.
"It's not going to be FAANG."
Cramer said he is "sanguine" about Twitter, and said he was pleased with the company's live events because it is starting to bring in "real advertisers."
"Some very big names were leaving it," he said.
"And there were very big names who were leaving it because frankly, it was too painful.
I think they've reduced the pain."
"They've cut back on all the junk," Cramer said.
"Expenses are good.
And, by the way, they're doing a total disclosure on political ads, which I really like."
Twitter announced earlier this week it would be more transparent about its ads.
Here's how Twitter plans to become profitable for the first time 9 Hours Ago | 00:59 Twitter said during its latest earnings that if it hits its high estimate for adjusted EBITDA next quarter it will finally be profitable.
Twitter shares climbed more than 18 percent after earnings were reported on Thursday, showing it was able to cut costs and grow its user base.
The company aims to be profitable by next quarter by being more cost-efficient, looking at new ways to get advertisers involved and diversifying its revenue stream.
The lion's share of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising.
It earned $508 million in ad revenue this quarter, and the company is expected to make $1.21 billion in digital ad revenue this year, which would rank sixth among U.S. online advertising companies, per eMarketer.
Twitter said during an earnings call Thursday it has increased its self-service advertising business, which allows companies to buy ads through an auction-based platform.
It also means brands don't have to buy through a sales team, which cuts costs.
The company added it plans to expand self-service buying, as well as create new ways for advertisers to buy ads.
It's also looking at expanding its online video advertising business.
Video is currently its largest ad format, especially sponsored video content and in-stream commercials.
One way Twitter thinks it can boost this is by helping TV networks and advertisers extend their reach during live events.
"Our strategy is clearly to align with TV to drive incremental reach to them and frankly tune into their core product," Twitter's VP of revenue, Matt Derella, told CNBC.
"We're really an extension of what they are doing."
By using curated video and live tweets, Derella said, Twitter can push people to watch live TV.
For example: It has worked with the NFL for in-game highlights and the PGA Tour to stream the first 60 to 90 minutes of some events, which can encourage people to tune in for the rest of programming.
When it does original programming, the content really is focused on "what's happening right now."
BuzzFeed's "Am To DM" is a live morning show focused on getting people up to speed with trends, while a Bloomberg 24/7 network specifically for Twitter is in the works.
"We absolutely see an opportunity when [users] are on the move and not in front of a television," Derella said.
"Our job is to show people what's happening in the world.
What are they talking about?"
In addition, the company isn't only relying on advertising revenue.
Though advertising revenue declined 8 percent year over year, data licensing and other revenue increased 22 percent over the same period.
It plans to expand its data and enterprise solutions divisions.
Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in BuzzFeed.
After eight years of researching and developing self-driving cars in primarily warm and dry locations, Waymo wants a clearer picture of how its vehicles and technology handle snow and ice.
The tech firm, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project, will start testing its self-driving cars in Michigan.
"For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions can affect how well you can see, and the way your vehicle handles the road.
The same is true for self-driving cars," President and CEO John Krafcik said.
"This type of testing will give us the opportunity to assess the way our sensors perform in wet, cold conditions."
Testing autonomous-drive vehicles in Michigan means Waymo's fleet will be close to the self-driving technology development center the company opened last year.
In addition, Waymo will be closer to some of the Michigan automakers it is working with to develop self-driving cars, including Fiat Chrysler.
The Waymo fleet features Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans modified with Waymo's sensors and technology.
Gov.
Rick Snyder says Waymo's fleet will see Michigan's roads in challenging conditions.
"Michiganders certainly understand the challenges of driving in the winter, and I look forward to seeing how Waymo's engineers can address that in these next-generation vehicles," he said.
Self-driving cars are increasingly logging miles on Michigan roads and highways.
General Motors has been testing some of its self-driving cars in the state for several months.

Over the last year, one of the more interesting stories has been AMD's resurgence to relevance as a viable alternative to Intel.
AMD's new Ryzen chips have managed to at least offer a credible challenge to Intel's dominance in almost every facet of the desktop PC world, from high-end, multi-core processors like the Threadripper line to the budget Ryzen 3.
But now AMD is setting its sights even higher, toward laptops arguably the most important segment of the computer category, and one where Intel's lines of Core i3, i5, and i7 chips have long reigned virtually uncontested by AMD.
To that end, the company is unveiling its first two laptop processors from the Ryzen line: the Ryzen 5 2500U and the Ryzen 7 2700U, designed for ultrathin laptops.
As the company teased in May, the two Ryzen laptop chips are technically APUs, or "accelerated processing units," which combine a CPU and an integrated GPU into a single chip.
In the case of the Ryzen 5 2500U and the Ryzen 7 2700U, that's a Ryzen CPU with a Radeon Vega GPU, and represents one of AMD's key advantages here unlike Intel, which has to rely on partners like Nvidia to provide high-end graphical capabilities, AMD is able to leverage its own GPU experience from the Radeon line in its integrated chips.
That said, Intel does produce its own integrated graphics on its chips too, through the Iris and Intel HD Graphics lines, although AMD claims that its existing experience gives it an edge here.
More from The Verge: Noon makes your lights smart without a single smart bulb Logitech's Circle security cameras now work with Google Assistant Samsung's incubator lab spins off seven more weird little companies Both processors are 15W chips and offer four cores and eight threads.
The Ryzen 5 2500U is clocked at a base speed of 2.0GHz (which can be boosted to 3.6GHz), with the Ryzen 7 2700U coming in at a base speed of 2.2GHz (which can be boosted to 3.8GHz).
On the GPU side, the 2500U offers eight Radeon Vega compute units (CUs) and is clocked at up to 1100MHz, while the 2700U offers 10 Vega CUs clocked at up to 1300MHz.
On paper, those compare pretty well to Intel's latest eight-generation Core i5 and Core i7 U-series chips, which the company announced last month, although we'll have to wait for actual benchmarking to come in to see how the processors stack up head to head.
For its own part, AMD claims that the new Ryzen chips will offer dramatically improved performance over its own last generation of laptop chips, with up to 200 percent more CPU performance (for multicore use) and up to 128 percent better GPU performance, although AMD's last generation of chips weren't exactly computational powerhouses to start.
Part of how AMD is accomplishing this is through things like the company's revised Precision Boost 2 technology, which more intelligently manages how much the CPU can boost as workload increases on a more granular level.
That's instead of the original Precision Boost from the Ryzen desktop chips, which simply switched between "two-core boost" and "all-core boost" modes.
Of course, none of this actually matters unless AMD can get its chips into the hands of consumers.
To that end, the company says to expect to see Ryzen versions of existing laptops from Acer, HP, and Lenovo this holiday season, with more news to come next year start at CES 2018.
But if AMD can keep the momentum going which is admittedly a big ask, given Intel's sheer dominance of the mobile processor space 2018 could be shaping up to be a really interesting place when it comes to laptop processors.
And at the very least, its nice to see some real competition alive in the industry again.
For nearly three decades, Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein faced allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, The New York Times reported on Oct. 5.
More than three dozen women have since publicly accused the entertainment mogul of abuse.
"I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it," Weinstein told the Times.
Spike network is also investigating reports of sexual harassment by Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob Weinstein, against the female showrunner of a series produced by The Weinstein Co. that aired on the network.
Weinstein's lawyer Bert Fields denied the allegations in a statement to Deadline.
These allegations have set off a ripple effect, empowering people who say they also were victims to come forward with stories of abuse by people in power.
Here are some of those accused:
I do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that its Brussels, Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.
Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers.
For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.
Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.
But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers.
The companys cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.
Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing.
During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.
The most remarkable sign of Amazons growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses.
At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.
The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabets chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Googles chief executive officer, were not asked about Googles pending appearance before Congress.
Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits.
Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share surpassing Wall Streets earnings forecasts by more than a dollar.
The company is bringing in more revenue up 24 percent while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.
In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Unions administrative arm.
The fine temporarily hit the companys bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.
Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer.
When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.
With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest.
The companys stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.
Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.
But in the past several years, Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No.
2 competitor to Amazon.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine.
On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year.
Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.
The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion.
Its shares jumped 3 percent.
Microsoft executives credited much of the companys success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsofts Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.
The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.
While Microsofts attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment its foray into making smartphones was a bomb its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.
Perhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media.
Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information.
Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning.
They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.
How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election?
No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened.
Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.
Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy.
But for Twitter influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful the situation is more vexing.
Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.
Many of Twitters users have long been frustrated with the sites scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment.
Twitters critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.
The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitters most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN.
Twitters guidelines forbid threats of violence and targeted abuse prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trumps account.
In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the companys evolving views on hosting the president.
That includes allowing tweets under the newsworthy label it might otherwise ban.
But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting We need to do better.
Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump.
Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the presidents Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring.
Its too early to say were all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people, he said.

An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019.
Since other parts of social media most notably Facebook are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.
Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users, said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities.
If you think about why are people alcoholics, its because they dont acknowledge theyre alcoholics.
He added about Twitter, It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.
Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year.
But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.

Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected.
Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.
Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week.
When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad.
Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it inadequate at every level.
He added that Twitter had failed to understand how serious this issue is.
On Tuesday, Twitter said it would dramatically increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like.
Political ads will be specially marked.
Mr. Warner called Twitters plan a good first step.
On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.
But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc.
The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.
@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state.
It billed itself as the Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird, said Mr. Leatherwood.
Thats not how you abbreviate Tennessee.
Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.
The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed.
It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments, Mr. Leatherwood said.
It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.
Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation.
He said others had as well.
He never heard back.
After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trumps firing of F.B.I.
director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, I love my whiteness.
And yours.
@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.
I cant tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account, said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself.
But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.
Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress.
After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.
When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.
Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background.
One of them presented the companys long-held philosophy: We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.
Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election.
Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human trolls and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government.
But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.
Now the Silicon Valley companies long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance.
Twitters general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.
Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform.
Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads sponsors.
But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitters lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising.
Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.

Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities use of the platform to influence American politics praised the companys decision on Thursday but cautioned that it would not be enough.
I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitters most vocal critics on Capitol Hill.
What I hope is well see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.
Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twitters announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets RT and Sputnik from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.
Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability.
In September, the companys vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RTs three principal Twitter accounts.
In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.
On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011.
The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.
Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitters decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform.
Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human trolls on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.
I think its only a drop in the bucket, said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Whats far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputniks ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesnt need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.
Moreover, Twitters decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter and rival social media companies treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms.
Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda.
China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.
A Twitter spokeswoman said the companys decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets.
This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization, the spokeswoman said in a statement.
Its about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.
Even mild violence can be difficult for someone to explain to others if they open it unexpectedly, the statement said.

On Thursday, as news of the policy surged through the site, moderators began to question how it would be applied in Reddits micro-communities, or subreddits, where interests can range from hunting to Bible study, as well as in its dark corners, where people are urged to kill themselves or others.

Will subs like watchpeopledie be categorized as such?
(That forum would remain for now, a moderator said.)
Among the first to be banned were the subreddits r/NationalSocialism, r/Nazi and r/Far_Right.
In a statement on Thursday, Anna Soellner, a spokeswoman for Reddit, said the company was constantly assessing its content policy.
We strive to be a welcoming, open platform for all by trusting our users to maintain an environment that cultivates genuine conversation, she said.
Reddit, which was founded in 2005 and proclaims itself the front page of the internet with 330 million monthly active users, had been resistant to outright bans on content.
In 2014, Yishan Wong, who was then the companys chief executive, wrote a blog post defending the companys hands-off approach to the sometimes toxic content that appeared on the site.
You choose what to post, he wrote to the sites users.
You choose what to read.
You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce.
We will try not to interfere.
A year later, under a new chief executive, Ellen Pao, the company announced that it would explicitly prohibit harassment against users.
It said then that the move would promote free expression of its millions of users without fear of retribution from a vocal minority of them.
The crackdown comes as Reddit expands after receiving millions of dollars in financing in 2014 and again in 2017.
It grew from 65 employees in 2015 to 260 employees this year, making it easier to execute new policies to enforce bans on toxic content.
The effectiveness of Reddits 2015 policy was analyzed in a study released last month of two subreddits that were banned the racist r/CoonTown subreddit and r/fatpeoplehate, which mocked and abused overweight people.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story The study suggested that the most effective tactic to fight hateful rhetoric might be to identify and shut down the spaces where hateful speech occurs, rather than targeting bad actors individually or in groups.
Mr. Hacketts predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.
Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers.
It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.
We are committed to transforming our business, Mr. Hackett said of his companys efforts to bring new driverless technology to market.
Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.
That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.
It was just eight years ago that both G.M.
and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.
For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.
Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies.

Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldnt make money, the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.

But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.
Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years.
An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.
Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V.
lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.
Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.
Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nations largest automaker.
The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe.
Moreover, G.M.
slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.
The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group.
But G.M.
reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story G.M.s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated the resilience of our core business in the face of declining consumer demand.
This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes, he said.
But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models.
The market is more challenging than expected, Mr. Stevens said.
Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars.
G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.
The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruises work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment.
And G.M.
is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.
Mary T. Barra, G.M.s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States.
Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally, she said.
And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.
Were not laggards here, the companys chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call.

O.C.R.
apps for Android are available in the Google Play store, just as similar programs for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile and desktop systems can be found in the respective app stores.
Some apps can even translate photographed text into different languages.
If you use the Microsoft Office suite for writing and editing documents, however, a combination of Microsoft Word for Android and the separate Office Lens app is one way to snap, scan and edit when you are on the go.
When you have both apps on your Android device, open Office Lens and take a picture of the page or printed material you want to convert into a Word file; the app can also convert a photograph of notes scrawled on a white board into text files.

Photo Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting.
The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent.
The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitters reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russias efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide.
Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures.
Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.

The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program.
Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Googles parent company, this year.
Photo WASHINGTON The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.
The commissions chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market.
The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.
But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated.
They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.
The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975, Mr. Pai said.
It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry.
Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry.

The merger, which the F.C.C.
and the Department of Justice are reviewing, would give Sinclair access to more than 70 percent of all television viewers in the United States.
This week, the commissions Republican majority lifted rules that required television stations owners to operate a main studio in each locality, which Mr. Pai said was unnecessary and costly for TV station owners.
Photo SEATTLE For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain.
Now, if customers give it permission, Amazons couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home.
What could possibly go wrong?
The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home.
There are risks for couriers too whether its an attacking dog or an escaping cat.
To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera.
Amazon isnt the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping.
This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier.
The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them.
E-commerce companies have experimented with ways of making deliveries more secure for years.
Amazon installs self-service lockers in office buildings and outside supermarkets where customers can fetch their orders, and Daimler and other carmakers have tested the delivery of goods from Amazon and other retailers to customers car trunks.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story The costs of package theft arent known Amazon, for example, will not say but are probably substantial.
Most people who have spent any time on a neighborhood blog, social network or email list have a sense of how prevalent such crime is.
And packages sitting on front porches can also signal to anyone who walks by that the homeowners are away.
The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.
Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.
After the attack, Googles security team came up with a motto: Never again.
The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers Gmail accounts.
It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.
Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked.
Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.
The idea of Googles Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message.
Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.
But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group?
Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.
So we tested Googles Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.
The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys.
But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.
Setting Up Advanced Protection Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Googles Advanced Protection webpage.
To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each.
Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you.
To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it.
(The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.)
This process takes a few minutes.
On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins.
That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.

But there are trade-offs.
Googles Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.
For the time being, that means only Googles Gmail mail app, Googles Backup and Sync app, and Googles Chrome browser.
On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Googles Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser.
So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, youre out of luck.
Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.
Testing the Security Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.
Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A.
hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons.
On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.
On the other hand, if you lose the keys or dont have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account.
Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account.
In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.
Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle.
She said Googles requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account.
That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.
Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Googles program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.
Its something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys, Ms. Sandvik said.
I dont see a reason you shouldnt turn this on.
The Bottom Line While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.
It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Googles apps from Apples and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Googles mail, messaging and cloud storage services.
But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature Apples V.I.P.
alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you.
Googles iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature.
For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P.
alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.
Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which wont work with the keys.
If using Googles security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online.
Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Googles lead.
If you decide to wait, dont procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.
While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.
The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.
When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Googles keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: No comment.
Q. I am trying to conserve space on my Mac, and I read about the storage-optimization tools on the Storage tab in the About This Mac box.
However, when I open the box and click the Storage tab, I dont have a Manage button to click and start the cleanup process.
Why?
A. Apple added the Optimized Storage feature to its macOS Sierra (10.12) update.
If your operating system is older than last years release, you will not see the Manage button on the Storage tab that leads you to the new space-saving utilities.
Photo You can see what version of the system you are using by going to the Apple menu, selecting About This Mac and clicking the Overview tab.
If your Mac is running OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or earlier, you need to update your operating system to use the storage-optimization feature.

If you cannot (or do not want to) update your Macs operating system, you can manually free up space by deleting unneeded files, old mail attachments and other clutter.
You can also find programs to automatically sweep your computer and collect unnecessary files.
Clean My Mac 3 ($40, with a free trial period available), Cocktail (on sale for $19, also with a free trial period) and the free AVG Cleaner for Mac are three possibilities.
For those who upgrade (or who have already), Apples support site has a guide to using the storage-optimizing tools in macOS Sierra and the new macOS High Sierra.
Among other things, you can use the feature to seek out and delete files you no longer need, store documents and photos in iCloud and automatically empty the Macs trash can.
Now, that attitude is beginning to change.
I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants power through government and, if so, how.
There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech.
The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last years presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.
On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five Amazon, Facebook and Google.
Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right.
Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.
But there is little to suggest well see drastic action anytime soon.
Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants vast powers might be harmful.
The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague.
The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.
Individuals, lawmakers, were all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies, said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power.
For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.
Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting.
In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder.
(Google and New America have denied that claim.)
Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies, Mr. Lynn said.
Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and Id bet a lot of money a year from now well see real huge shifts in feelings around here.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power.
Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what weve ever expected from corporations.
In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships.
Theyre being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.

The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.
Theyre creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons.
And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.
But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power.
Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.
Apples iPhone is the worlds most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.
Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines.
But only in the last year did Amazons annual revenue surpass that of Costco.
It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmarts sun.
Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants.
We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street.
The Fives power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices.
We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them.
For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.
Weve all become a bit cyborg, writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in World Without Mind, one of several new books examining the giants.
What we need to always remember is that were not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.
The complicated nature of the Fives power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them.
In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon.
Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazons growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy.
Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.
Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because its politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices.
Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didnt need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.
That, too, seems to be lacking.
Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.
European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review.
During last years presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasnt done much in office to carry that out.
Amazons purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.
Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.
We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive, said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.
Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the governments antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the companys culture which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.
A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing todays tech giants.
But thats a big if.
The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?
Mr. Reback said.
Had we been more diligent, we wouldnt have nearly the problems we have today.
The action is nascent, but gaining momentum fast.
Lawmakers are pushing for regulations for technology companies for the first time in years, encouraged along by big techs broad assortment of rivals.
For several weeks, a group of companies including smaller tech companies and entertainment and retail businesses has informally begun regular meetings and conference calls to compare notes about Google, Facebook and Amazon and to find a way to join in a stronger opposition force.
Before, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school, said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times.
But now the halo is a bit off these companies.
In recent years, lawmakers have held up technology companies as the epitome of American ingenuity and felt that voters did not want the government to slow them down.
That attitude was hardened in 2012, after lawmakers suffered a bruising defeat in a bill to strengthen antipiracy rules for internet companies.
The proposals set off huge online protests, aided by the big technology companies, that helped stop the legislation.
Over the years, Ive watched as the major tech companies not only sought to protect the unlevel playing field they already had, but have used their political influence to expand it to disadvantage businesses with which they compete, said Jim Cicconi, who recently retired after years overseeing lobbying at AT&T.
Now I think policymakers are seeing the consequences.
But even as they sense an opportunity today, the rivals say that challenging the internet companies remains a daunting task.
They doubt they can put a dent into the online ad duopoly of Facebook and Google.
It will also be difficult, they say, to restrain Amazons fast movement into new markets, given the companys willingness to lose money to gain a foothold.
Internet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill.
House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks.
Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier.
Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.
Photo The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers.
They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points, said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.
The tech giants are also lodging a strong defense against the newly proposed regulations.
Facebook and Google hired high-profile political operatives to thwart changes in election disclosures at the Federal Election Commission and have deployed lobbyists to water down a bipartisan bill introduced last week that would require social media platforms to disclose the financing behind political ads.

Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.
The clearest opening has been in an unpopular battle that Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have waged against a bill aimed to curb sex trafficking.
The bill would take away some legal protections for sites that knowingly host content that promotes sex trafficking, a move that the internet companies warn could stifle free speech, even though it would largely exempt the big tech companies from liability.
Disney, Oracle and 21 Century Fox have endorsed the legislation.
The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill.
In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.
Its past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business, Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, and that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.
The tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well.
In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission.
In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.
Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, recently wrote the commission to ask it disclose information about why it closed its case on Google in 2013.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has asked the agency to reopen its investigation in light of new evidence that surfaced in the case led by European regulators.
In July, the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, began advocating for antitrust exemptions that would allow the companies to collectively bargain with Facebook and Google for ad revenue.
On Tuesday, David Chavern, president of the group, argued at a House hearing that digital platforms like Google and Facebook should follow the same rules that broadcast and print news organizations do.

Photo WASHINGTON President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet.
Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages activities limited by federal restrictions.
The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said.
For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year.
The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming.
Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.
Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages.

What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?
Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?
Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.
I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.
But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.
Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.
And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.
No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.
Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.
Are Australians excited?
Reaction is pretty mixed.
Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.
Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.
But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.
I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.
And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.
After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.
Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.
Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.
I was stunned.

Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year.
Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different.
They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems.
By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies data centers.
The idea, said Urs Hlzle, Googles senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those security gaps.
Cloud computing has been roiling the strategies of older tech companies for much of the past decade.
The concept, besides letting customers sidestep the costs of buying hardware and software, can let companies deploy computing resources more quickly and flexibly.
Amazon Web Services pioneered the concept.
Synergy Research Group, a market research firm, said in July that A.W.S.
accounted for 34 percent of the roughly $11 billion spent on such cloud services in the second quarter, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft, 8 percent for IBM and 5 percent for Google.
Amazon and Microsoft are expected to highlight progress in their cloud businesses when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.
Google has moved aggressively to catch up.
In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMwares technology a mainstay at many corporations.
She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features.
In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.

More mature technology companies have taken different tacks to try to hold on to customers.
Some, like IBM and Oracle, offer their own cloud services.
Others, like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies, have shied away from engaging in a spending war in data centers against deep-pocketed internet giants.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story So has Cisco.
The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called intercloud that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.
But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage hybrid cloud arrangements industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a companys own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.
We think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world, said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Ciscos networking and security business.
The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions.
On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.
Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept.
Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.
We see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique, said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsofts Azure cloud business.
VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software.
Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S.
to court customers.
Pat Gelsinger, VMwares chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a validation of his own companys vision.
Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S.
and Microsoft in cloud computing.
But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.
We are both users of each others products, said Mr. Hlzle of Google.
But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said.
Both of Mr. Dorseys children, as he is known to refer to the companies, bear the imprint of their creator and his careful, trimmed-down aesthetic.

He has failed to rein in the use and abuse of the service by trolls and political actors, and he has not found a convincing way to make money despite its ardent user base.
At Square, Mr. Dorsey has led one of Silicon Valleys more understated success stories, built from the little plastic white square that allowed small businesses to accept credit card payments via their iPhones.
Square has grown into a much broader financial services company, despite some hiccups, like a much-heralded partnership with Starbucks that flamed out.
Although Twitters overall revenue shrank 5 percent in the second quarter from the year before, expanding the companys losses, at Square, revenue grew 26 percent, moving the company closer to profitability.
The divergent fate of Mr. Dorseys two companies can be understood simply as a matter of timing and control.
When he began his second stint as Twitters chief executive in 2015, the company was already struggling and had a series of internal problems that were hard to change, including executive turnover and competing strategic visions.
At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.
Square wasnt Jacks first rodeo, said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009.
It was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.
Mr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorseys education from Twitters fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.
Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Dorseys success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the publics eye.

Photo Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020.
It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.
Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.
This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).
Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.

Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.
In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia.
At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.
The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.
Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo.
As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Squares app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmos busy blue dashboard.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around.
That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.
These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who dont have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.
We are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank, Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.
Photo The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Squares bottom line.
While Square and PayPal generally dont make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.
This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.
Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorseys ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.
Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that it may be the most important thing Square is working on.
During Mr. Raboiss tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright.
The companys first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.
Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.
A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.
One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses.
The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.
These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.
During a talk at Silicon Valleys Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didnt need to make a choice between the two.
They both have different needs and are in different phases, he said.
Focusing on one thing doesnt mean you completely lose sight of something else.
Advertisement The Way We Shop Now Youll Wear What They Tell You to Wear Subscription clothing services should make you feel great.
Shouldnt they?
The authors Emily Gould and Rumaan Alam investigate.
Image Credit Ciara Phelan As so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on Twitter.
In this instance, I was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services.
Id recently seen ads for Bombfell on the subway (If shopping isnt your bag, youre going to love our box) and hit a personal tipping point.
Clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although I was freaked out by them, I didnt fully understand why.
Twitter people rushed to fill me in, as Id hoped they would.
Clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said.
They enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like Mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic.
They infantilize us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labor done by someone who might care how were fed or what were wearing (say, a loving parent) with labor done by workers at the bottom rung of a start-up, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take key words and turn them into outfits.
It sounded so much worse than Id even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more.
So Rumaan Alam and I decided to make ourselves his n hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: Together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services.
We would take notes on our experiences and compare them.
In doing so, we would learn a truth.
Are clothing subscriptions the Soylent of fashion or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop?
The deal: Seven days to return before you get charged; average price, $89 an article.
RUMAAN: Newfangled clothing subscription services are at heart good old-fashioned businesses, in that they make so many promises that its impossible to keep them all.
If you have someone at home all day or your UPS driver knows where to hide boxes behind your garage, the promise is convenience.
If you live far from any stores or simply dont have time to shop, the promise is access.
If you feel overwhelmed by shopping, the promise is attention.
If you feel underwhelmed by shopping, the promise is novelty.
If you dont care about fashion, theyll care for you; if you do care about fashion, theyll be your clothes buddy.
Like so many entities that pledge to disrupt, the subscription service model exchanges one set of hassles for another, more modern, set of hassles.
Spend time with the computer instead of a sales clerk.
Visit the post office instead of your local shop.
My first subscription was to Bombfell, the ubiquitous Instagram advertiser that sounds like a Roger Moore-era Bond film.
The enrollment process emphasizes the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees.
(Check, and check.)
I am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesnt put me outside Bombfells target demographic, because what the company sells is something Im interested in too: ease.
I appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive.
The pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes Bombfell sends you and I returned everything.
In my enrollment, I told Bombfell that I was simply too busy to shop, that I had a modern sense of style.
They sent me a long sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable.
This was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what I expect from a stylist, even if thats just a term of art for a customer service representative.
Especially galling, I thought, was the long sleeve tee, which Bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone.
Exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but its hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment.
Part of this sites appeal is, I think, its prices, but I refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee.
The deal: Rent as many totes as you like and return when youre done or use their purchase service .
EMILY: I started with Le Tote because I get served its Instagram ads most often, and because one Twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job.
It also seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible of all the services; you can wear the clothes for as long as you want and then send them back, which spurs the shipment of a new box, purportedly styled just for you.
All the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but Le Tote does allow you to choose whats in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few fun extras.
My first Tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with Nike written up the side, and (fun!)
a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf.
The whole thing cost $147, if I wanted to buy it all, which I did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it.
I did end up keeping the leggings with Nike written up the side because they seemed as if they wouldnt fall off my butt during yoga if I ever go to yoga again.
You win this one, Le Tote.
But not any other ones, because I canceled after that shipment.
I was left with one burning question.
Is Le Tote a play on words?
A litotes is a figure of speech that uses deliberately exaggerated understatement to make a point, like not bad or its not my first rodeo.
Like Le Tote clothes arent the best Ive ever worn.
Im guessing its not a play on words, actually.
The deal: Youre sent five things, you try them, return what you dont like.
Bonus fun: You get 25 percent off if you buy all five.
RUMAAN: Stitch Fix is in the business of style more than convenience.
You can hear it in the very name, the notion that your wardrobe is something that can be fixed, and that will in turn fix your life.
The style questionnaire is more rigorous than Bombfells, more granular, and I could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them.
Thats part of fashions promise, that a girlfriend or boyfriend or a promotion are just one tie or sweater or pair of shoes away.
Bombfell emphasizes its personal touch, showing you a head shot of the stylist whos assisting you.
Stitch Fix doesnt work quite the same way; youre welcome to send a note to your stylist, but to me it felt like sending a note to an algorithm.
Anyway, I requested some blazers.
I was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what I want in a blazer.
The trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you dont have access to much variety.
Presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way were told online advertising works.
Of course, when Im online, I find I see mostly advertisements for things Ive already bought.
I can see how the subscription model would appeal to the entrepreneurs who adapted it in this manner .
Being sent a box feels like receiving a present, and while paying for whats inside may not be top of mind, of course, the company has your credit card on file.
Its easy enough to return what you dont want, but its easier still to keep what you dont want.
My husband tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it.
It was only when I pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didnt fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering.
The deal: You approve your trunk preview, and after it arrives you have five days to return or buy the six to 10 items in a trunk.
EMILY: I next tried Trunk Club Women, also based on Twitter recommendation this one from a woman who swore that the apps stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that shed ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk.
Unlike Le Tote, Trunk Club is expensive.
You also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences.
I actually loved this process so much.
Doubters (like Rumaan!)
told me, Well, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at Nordstrom, which owns Trunk Club.
But the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with Sophie, the stylist, than I would have ever been with a stranger IRL.
Very quickly, she learned about me that I teach undergrad creative writing, that I almost never wear florals or bright colors, that I usually wear boots or sneakers and jeans and a button-front shirt, and that I still have a postpartum gut even though my son is 2.
I admitted that I was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as rich L.A. lesbian.
The results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first Trunk preview that I had to delete, not because I didnt like them, but because I already owned them.
The experience of trying all these clothes on at home instead of in a Nordstrom dressing room, however, was not actually that luxurious.
I found the box big and daunting, and it sat around unopened for days while I waited to have enough time set aside to do a little in-home fashion show for myself.
But five days is all you get with Trunk Club, and once its emails started to take on a slightly chiding tone, I worried that the company would charge my credit card for thousands of dollars worth of clothes.
So late one afternoon, I opened the box.
I made yes, no and maybe piles, and there was a very cozy cashmere/wool blend long sleeve Vince sweater dress in the maybe pile that seemed like the kind of thing that might be worth its $400 price tag.
I was in the process of trying it on a second time when disaster struck.
I had been standing on my coffee table to look in my apartments only mirror, and without warning the table collapsed underneath me!
My first concern, as I assessed the damage, after I determined that I hadnt sustained anything worse than a big, rapidly purpling butt bruise, was that the scrape on my hand had maybe gotten some blood on the dress.
It hadnt, but the dress seemed somehow tainted anyway.
I ended up sending it back.
I also sent back a denim pencil skirt, a Bond-villainess scuba dress and a white silk top that had looked a little bit frumpy even on the lissome teenager who modeled it on the website.
I kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet Eileen Fisher T-shirt that I wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate.
The deal: For a $60 flat fee, youre sent a couple of new items each month.
RUMAAN: Stitch Fix and Bombfell use technology and language to reinvent the low-end and midrange department store experience.
FiveFour Club is more like a web version of a boutique with a subscription model thrown in for good measure.
Instead of appealing to customers with the siren song of a personal stylist, FiveFour charges a price of admission in exchange for regular deliveries of its own branded clothing.
(There is also a web store, membership not required.)
The aesthetic here is minimal, sporty and young, so fashion-aware that its hard to envision who the consumer is.
While its true we dont all live in ZIP codes with street wear boutiques, the same person who logs onto FiveFour can log on to eBay.
In exchange for my $60 membership fee, I was sent a windbreaker and a tee, both in lackluster shades of brown.
On a lanky 19-year-old, theyd look stylish.
On anyone else, they look like two garments that cost $30 each.
Wouldnt I like to be a lanky 19-year-old?
Of course.
Fashion is about fantasy.
Here in reality, FiveFour got my $60 and Ive got these clothes Ill never wear.
Those few of us who never read Marie Kondo still have those fashionable mistakes lurking in our closets.
Im sort of fond of them, those past selves that never came to be.
Ive spent many hours of my life browsing in stores.
At 21, I admired clothes I couldnt afford.
At 30, I bought them.
At 40, I sometimes go simply for the pleasure, of seeing what is new, of learning what counts as beautiful now.
So what, if anything, have we learned?
One old lesson, at least.
Shopping for clothes is time consuming, its tiring, and it can feel like a waste of an autumn afternoon.
So you can subscribe to a service that makes your life simpler, although it may come at the expense of expressing who you are.
You can also subscribe to the notion that theres still pleasure in some of lifes chores.
In the flesh, you can touch a wool jacket or a cashmere sweater as you imagine who you might be if each belonged to you.

The announcement is part of a major shift in the industry to lift the veil over how its secretive advertising businesses its cash centers work, as lawmakers put more pressure on social media companies about the role their sites played in Russias attempt to influence the election.
Twitter, Facebook and Google are scheduled to appear for hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Nov. 1.
Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter.
In late September, he said Twitters response was inadequate when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate.
At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election.
But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington.
The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts both human and suspected automated bots that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the companys announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce.
Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures.
The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result.

I welcome this transparency, Ms. Klobuchar said, but we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road.
She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves.
The announcement from Twitter followed a public relations blitz this month by Facebooks chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to announce similar voluntary efforts to tighten standards for ad buyers.
Lawmakers are still skeptical, saying there are many unanswered questions about whether the social media sites can prevent the mistakes of the 2016 election on their own.
The changes also raise new issues for politicians.
For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their secret sauce when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists.
Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots.
Many of those automated accounts, along with Twitter users with suspected ties to the Russian government, bombarded the platform without buying advertising.
Researchers at the cybersecurity firm FireEye discovered that hundreds or thousands of fake accounts regularly sent out messages criticizing Hillary Clinton sometimes with identical tweets dispatched seconds apart.
Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages.
Twitter said it would try to tighten standards for issues-based ads that wouldnt fall under its new electioneering rules, such as an environmental groups push for clean-air policies or an energy companys promotion of environmental deregulation.
But the company admitted that the industry had not agreed on definitions for issues ads.
We will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above, Twitter said in its blog post.
Photo The chief executive of the streaming service Hulu, Mike Hopkins, is leaving to become chairman of Sony Pictures Television, Hulu said on Tuesday.
Randy Freer, a member of the Hulu board, will succeed him.
Mr. Hopkins, who has been Hulus chief executive for the past four years, will be moving into the role at Sony that Steve Mosko vacated more than a year ago.
Mr.
Freer, the Fox Networks Groups chief operating officer and previously a co-president at Fox Sports, will take over the Hulu job on Monday.
Hulu got a big boost last month when its The Handmaids Tale became the first show from a streaming service to win the Emmy Award for best drama.
The change at the top also comes as Hulus parent companies including Comcast, Disney, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox are making a more concerted effort to sell Hulu the back libraries of their shows, rather than making similar deals with Netflix.

It last disclosed its total number of subscribers 17 months ago; at the time, the figure stood at 12 million.

By comparison, Netflix announced last week that it now has 51 million paying subscribers in the United States.
Q.
Is there an easy way to tell if the cable television service is out for everybody or just at my own house because of equipment problems?

A.
If you have a working internet connection (or access to one on a cellular device or work computer) and an online account from your cable company, you might be able to check specifically about the status of your own equipment.

As the presidential election heated up in the spring of 2016, RT consistently featured negative stories about Mrs. Clinton, according to United States intelligence officials.
That included claims of corruption at her family foundation and ties to Islamic extremism, frequent coverage of emails stolen by Russian operatives from Mrs. Clintons campaign chairman, and accusations that she was in poor physical and mental health.
More than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers, said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russias exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States.
YouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign Russian or otherwise that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.
Much like the Russian-controlled pages on Facebook, RTs YouTube videos comply with YouTubes community guidelines, which cover things like nudity, copyright violations and promoting violence against a group based on race or religion.
But not propaganda.
YouTube carries a wide variety of news channels that represent an array of viewpoints across the political spectrum, said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.
Photo RTs reach on YouTube 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.
YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russias own borders.
RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.
RT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content, said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea.
Traditional television ratings werent important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Russian channel was among the first news organizations to recognize YouTubes power and developed content intended to perform well on the platform.
RT uploads videos frequently, sprinkling in buzzy viral videos of disasters plane crashes, tsunamis, a meteor strike to earn likes and longer watch times, which YouTubes algorithm rewards with better placement among search results and recommendations.
The viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RTs subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlins audience for more political content.
People come for the click-bait material, said Bret Schafer, an official at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the Washington-based public policy research group.
And they eventually land on videos that the Kremlin wants them to see.
While much of RTs traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channels political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches.
Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germanys far-right AfD party will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.
YouTube also provided RT with the kind of perks it reserved for big publishers, including custom backgrounds for its channel in the early days and a check mark that designated RT as a verified news source.
Until recently, RT was also among a select group of news organizations included in Googles preferred news lineup, granting them access to guaranteed revenue from premium advertisers.
Those advertisers, in effect, subsidized Russias international propaganda arm.
Google dropped RT from the preferred lineup last month.
Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said the decision was unrelated to the congressional inquiry, and that RT had been dropped as part of a standard algorithmic update.
But Google also noted that it was not placing any other limits on RT: The channel could still sell regular ads on its videos and the status downgrade only applied in the United States.
Google later clarified that RT was downgraded in other markets, but it would not say which ones.
Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RTs deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Googles decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being one of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.
Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
This speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible, Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.
Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a foreign agent a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda.
On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was doing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.
Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act symmetrically and quite swiftly.
RTs use of other technology platforms is also under investigation.
Last month, officials at Twitter told a Senate Intelligence Committee that three RT accounts targeting an American audience with a combined following of roughly six million users had spent $274,100 to promote tweets in 2016.
But none of RTs social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel.
RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site.
At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.
The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.
One RT contributor, the British blogger Graham Phillips, built a large following on YouTube with videos from Ukraines civil war, many of them critical of Ukraines central government.
RT often featured Mr. Phillips and at one point employed him as a part-time freelancer before he was arrested and deported by Ukrainian authorities.
His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.
Photo Another RT contributor, Lori Harfenist, began her career on public-access television in New York City, and eventually moved her self-produced show, The Resident, to YouTube.
Ms. Harfenist was one of the platforms first revenue-sharing partners, according to a biography on Ms. Harfenists personal website.
Ms. Harfenist was eventually recruited by RT, which began featuring her on segments with titles like America is a Hypocrite.
During the presidential campaign, RTs Twitter account promoted a video from her that claimed the existence of an anti-Semitic conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton, Google and the Illuminati.
(She later claimed the segment was meant as satire.)
Ms. Harfenist did not respond to emails and Facebook messages seeking comment.
Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and engagement such as comments or likes.
The most-watched clips on RT are not political or anti-establishment videos, they are snackable content.
A clip of a homeless man with a gifted voice for radio is the most popular video on RT, viewed 40 million times since it was uploaded six years ago.
Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RTs primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events.
Where relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we dont promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others, he said.
Some lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, have called for tighter regulation and disclosure requirements for political advertising on social media platforms.
Yet RTs embrace of YouTube shows how difficult it could be to limit foreign influence.

Photo SEATTLE Amazon said on Monday it got a total of 238 proposals from cities and regions across North America that want to be the home of its proposed second headquarters.
The bids, received by last Thursdays deadline, came from so many places across the continent that its perhaps simpler to note the ones that didnt fall over themselves to woo Amazon.
The company did not provide a list, but a color-coded map posted on its website revealed the applicants came from all but seven American states North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas and Hawaii.
In Canada, Yukon Territory and the provinces of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick were among those that said no thanks.
In Mexico, on the other hand, Amazons map shows just three applications, from the states of Chihuahua, Hidalgo and Quertaro.
Photo In all, Amazon said the proposals came from 54 states, provinces, districts and territories (including Puerto Rico).
The company has said it will announce its decision sometime next year.
A lot of people do it; they know its risky and do it anyway.
They convince themselves that this text is important, he said.

There is a dearth of data directly linking distracted walking to pedestrian injuries and deaths, but it seems to be a global problem, too.
Preliminary studies give a hint to unsafe behavior, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the Department for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention at the World Health Organization.
Photo People who text and walk, for example, are nearly four times as likely to engage in at least one dangerous action, like jaywalking or not looking both ways, and take 18 percent more time to cross a street than undistracted pedestrians.
Solutions, Dr. Krug said, are hard to legislate and even harder to enforce.
A number of other cities have come up with creative ways to help protect so-called cellphone zombies, who talk, text, listen to music, check their email and even snap selfies.
Initiatives include low-tech efforts, like edgy signs in Hayward, Calif. (Heads Up!
Cross the Street.
Then Update Facebook.)
and no-selfie zones in Mumbai, and specially designed traffic lights in Europe and several pieces of legislation in reaction to Honolulus new law.
Last month, the Board of Supervisors in San Mateo County, Calif., unanimously passed a resolution prohibiting pedestrians use of cellphones while crossing streets.
Its not enforceable, as state law governs such issues, but David Canepa, who introduced the measure, said it was an important springboard; the resolution is expected to go to the California Legislature for statewide consideration in January.
There is chaos in the crosswalks, said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself.
I know its an issue.
Ive lived it.
My cellphone is my life.
As children, he said, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but you cant look both ways when youre looking down and texting.

But at the end of the day, people understand the value of public safety, he added.
This legislation is practical and is common sense.
It will save lives.
At least 10 states have debated similar legislation dealing with distracted pedestrians or bicyclists; none of it has passed, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Legislation is pending in two states, the group said, and in September, New York passed a law that directs New York City to study its efforts to educate the public on the dangers of distracted walking.
Photo Municipal laws are not tracked, but Rexburg, Idaho, may have been among the first to adopt a citywide ban, in 2011.
The city recorded five pedestrian deaths in a short period in a concentrated area.
It was a high toll, given the citys size: about 35,000 residents.
It was a shock to our system, said Stephen Zollinger, Rexburgs city attorney.
Distracted walking was suspected.
Along with other safety measures, Rexburg barred pedestrians from using hand-held devices except while talking while crossing public streets, he said, and weve not had a pedestrian fatality since.

Bodegraven, a small town near Amsterdam, tried a different approach.
This year, it embedded LED-illuminated strips in the crosswalk at a busy intersection right in the line of sight of people staring at their phones.
When the traffic lights turn red or green, so do the lights at ground level, alerting pedestrians when its safe to cross.
The pilot program aims to anticipate trends, not reverse them, said Dolf Roodenburg, the project leader and a traffic engineer in the Netherlands.
If its successful, the town hopes to install the lights at more intersections and on bike paths, and offer them to other cities.
In Augsburg, Germany, similar lights were installed last year after a teenager using her smartphone was struck and seriously injured by a tram when she walked onto the tracks.
There are, of course, contrary points of view on the effectiveness of legislating pedestrian behavior.
Janette Sadik-Khan, a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and now transportation principal at Bloomberg Associates, which advises mayors around the world, said laws against texting and walking were not the answer.
They have no basis in any research, are poorly conceived and distract from the road design and driver behavior issues that are responsible for most crashes, she said.
Photo Its an easy way out.
Engineering is a lot more difficult, but a lot more efficient, Ms. Sadik-Khan said.
Traffic safety is very serious business in government, based in sound analysis.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story She and others recommended focusing on proven strategies like vehicle speed reduction, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce deaths, as survival rates are higher in low-speed collisions.
Vehicle design can also help.
In some countries, cars are designed to be more forgiving to pedestrians, said Deborah A. P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council.
Making bumpers softer and modifying the front ends of vehicles can reduce the severity of a pedestrian impact, but only 44 countries, mostly in Europe, require manufacturers to apply these protections, according to the W.H.O.
The United States is not among them.
Rochelle Sobel, founder of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, a nonprofit group, said it was important for Americans traveling abroad to learn the local road culture.
In the Dominican Republic, pedestrians do not have the right of way, and in some countries, drivers routinely ignore traffic regulations.
For example, they may fail to stop at intersections or red lights, Ms. Sobel said.
In many low- and middle-income countries, where about 90 percent of the worlds road-traffic deaths occur, according to the W.H.O., pedestrians often share poorly maintained roads with animals, carts, cars, buses and trucks.
Those roads are already high-risk environments not designed for walking, Ms. Sobel said.
Ms. Hersman, who previously served as chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said concerns about government overreach often lessened with time.
Laws requiring seatbelt use or restricting smoking initially met resistance but now are widely accepted.
Its important to have an open mind, she said.
Society can move forward.
Mr. Massey of Synaxis said it would take some convincing for people to see value in laws to combat distracted walking.
I agree in principle begrudgingly, he said.
Its a bit Big Brotherish.
We dont like that in this country.
European efforts are more realistic, Mr. Massey added.
I think the lights are brilliant, he said.
It reflects an understanding of human nature: People are going to do it anyway, so lets make it safer.

Xerox was looking for a way to reinforce its longtime role as an essential part of office life while producing something culturally significant.
Photo The book, which will also be handed out in printed form to customers and clients, was the perfect tool for bridging the goals, said Toni Clayton-Hine, the companys chief marketing officer.
It was a logical connection to what you knew of Xerox so far, she said.
The company still provides copiers, printers and scanners, but it has branched out into cloud computing and translation software as well.

Corporations have long sponsored cultural institutions and events, but the Xerox project continues a more recent trend toward commissioning art.
Photo In 2014, the fast-food chain Chipotle announced that top writers, including Toni Morrison and George Saunders, would produce work for its cups and bags.
That project was produced by the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, whose work also appears in the Xerox book.
Classic literature has occasionally provided marketing opportunities as well.
A 2012 Audi commercial, for example, adopted a Moby Dick theme to appeal to literary types.
Leaning on literature as a marketing tool shows that companies are eager to attract the influentials, Mr. ONeill said.
Commissioning works of art is far more significant than simply slapping a corporate name on someone elses event, he said.
A key thing with managing a corporate reputation is not what you say, but what you do, said Mr. ONeill, whose fiction has appeared in The New Yorker.
Im always much more impressed when I see a corporation doing something like this.
Nostalgia was one of the reasons Mr. Shteyngart was drawn to the project.
I always loved office equipment, even though I could never get it to work right, said Mr. Shteyngart, who used a voice-activated Xerox printer while writing his essay.

The cutting edge of artificial intelligence research is based on a set of mathematical techniques called deep neural networks.
These networks are mathematical algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing data.
By looking for patterns in millions of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog.
This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.
By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques.
Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsofts Skype phone service.
Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects theyve never seen before.

With so few A.I.
specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia.
In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellons groundbreaking A.I.
program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project.
Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I.
researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University.
At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.
There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry, said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
Some professors are finding a way to compromise.
Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records).
Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.
Photo There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia, Mr. Zettlemoyer said.
The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.
To bring in new A.I.
engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach deep learning and related techniques to existing employees.
And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.
The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math.
But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call a dark art.
Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.
In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places.
Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills.
Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.
I cant compete with Google, and I dont want to, said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries.
So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.
But the industrys giants are doing much the same.

Photo Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States.
Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm Indias largest mobile payments platform and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.
Alibabas bigger bet is in Southeast Asia.
It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries.
Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.
The promise is there, as the regions young middle class grows and goes online.
Southeast Asias e-commerce sales could total $88 billion by 2025, according to projections from Google and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund.
Volume was less than one-tenth that in 2015.
Over about the same period, Indias market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.
Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school.
Through Amazons Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone that arrived in less than a day.

A diffuse area of 600 million people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture.
Some places are modern, like Singapore.
Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.
Its a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and in the Philippines and Indonesia by water, said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain.
Cash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.
The challenges have forced Lazada, Alibabas biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.
In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds.
In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores.
And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.
Were in the super, super, super early days, said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.
Photo Alibabas international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazadas contribution.
Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibabas empire.
Max Bittner, Lazadas chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.
E-commerce is an economy of scale game, Mr. Bittner said.
I dont feel constrained in any way.
I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.
Amazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries.
An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.
Until recently, direct competition between Alibaba and Amazon has been rare.
Amazon has a modest presence in China.
Alibaba sells goods in the United States through its AliExpress platform but has backed away from further expansion efforts.

Amazon owns more of the inventory it sells.
By contrast, most of Lazadas sales come from outside vendors who use its platform as a digital middleman to reach customers.

But in China, the companys Taobao platform has been accused of offering counterfeit goods.
Alibaba says it is working to fight fakes.
Photo Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia.
In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia.
Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.
Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers.
But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.
At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons sometimes nine at a time from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables.
For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.
Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.
Its fabulous, said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management.
Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.

She ended up never going to high school.
So I was kind of on my own, she says.
I tried to read the classics, would go to the library a lot, tried to teach myself things.
But didnt really have any direction.
I really had this dream that someday I could be educated.
She read Plutarchs Lives.
The Stoics were really what changed me, she says.
Because their whole thing was about, You dont have control over a lot of the things that determine your life, so all you can do is focus on becoming the best person that you can be.
And that really spoke to me because I did feel, especially during my teenage years, that my life was really out of my control.
I really wished that I could just learn and do all the fun things and cool extracurriculars that I thought everybody else my age was doing.
Ms. Fowler worked as a stable hand and a nanny to help support her family.
And I would tell myself, in the times when I would be really, really sad, Once I get out of here, Im going to do something great.
And I would just pray at night, like, God, please just let me get out, give me opportunities to get out.
I promise Ill do good with it.
At 16, she began freaking out about her future.
I had this really intense resolve.
I would call universities and community colleges and say, I really want to go to college?

The Memo That Roared The essay that shook Silicon Valley was called Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber, and Ms. Fowler began by noting that it was a strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story.
Published on Feb. 19, it rocked the worlds most valuable start-up, challenging the mantra that great disrupters are above the law.
The blog post was notable for its dispassionate tone, as the young engineer who had left the company after a year walked the reader through everything that had gone very, very wrong in the brozilla culture of kegs, sexual coarseness and snaky competition.
Ms. Fowler was on her first day with her new engineering team when her manager sent her a string of messages over the company chat system.
Hes telling me that hes in an open relationship and that his girlfriend is getting laid all the time, but he just cant because hes at work all the time, she says, reprising her blog post with me.
And hes trying really hard not to get in trouble at work, but hes really looking for a woman to have sex with.
And I was like, What the hell?
This cant be real.
How stupid does he have to be?
But it turned out hed been getting away with this for so long, he didnt care anymore.
And I feel like so many of these men, they believe that the only reason women get into these jobs is to get a guy.
Ms. Fowler took screen shots and reported the manager to human resources, thinking, Theyll do the right thing.
But they didnt, explaining that the manager was a high performer and it was his first offense, something Ms. Fowler later discovered to be untrue.
Somehow Im supposed to be like, Oh, hes a high performer?
Never mind.
How dare I?
she says, laughing.
She wrote that H.R.
told her she could either find another team to work on or stay on that mans team and expect a poor performance review.
Another manager told her that if she reported stuff to H.R., he could fire her.
Amid the manic, sexist behavior, the number of female engineers in the division Ms. Fowler was part of dwindled to less than 6 percent too few, the company said, to merit ordering them the same black leather jackets they were ordering for the men.

I deserved so much better.
And I was, like, No.
Thats not O.K.
You dont get to do that.
In her memo, she says, I knew I had to be super-careful about how I said it if I wanted anybody to take it seriously.
A lot of women have been whistle-blowers in the past, and a lot of them have just gotten torn down and treated terribly.
One of the things that kept popping up was this idea that if you do whistle-blow about sexual harassment, then that is what will define the rest of your life.
And I kind of struggled with this.
But then, to me, I realized, you know what?
No.
Stepping back, just being in my little Stoicism Susan bubble, if what people know you for is bringing light to an issue about bad behavior, about bad stuff going on and laws not being followed and people being treated inappropriately, why wouldnt I want that?

It was an extremely demoralizing environment.
I would see people who would get harassed or made fun of or bullied and they would go report it, and they would just get ground down by upper management and H.R.
And so I felt like, if I can take this on despite the consequences, then I should do it.
Like women in Hollywood I talked to after the Weinstein collapse, Ms. Fowler thought the new outspokenness in Silicon Valley on sexual harassment may have been spurred by the election of President Trump.

And then I was told that many other women were doing the same thing.
And then Arianna went on TV that same week and said, theres no systemic problem.
Which I was like, No, a whole bunch of people just went to you this week.
Ms. Fowler adds that the companys C.T.O., Thuan Pham, who knew about her complaints, is still in the same job.
Ms. Huffington told me that she agreed that the problem was systemic sexism, but that she did not believe there was systemic sexual harassment.
But, she added, there should be zero tolerance for even one case of sexual harassment.
I was totally supportive of having a full investigation of her claims, Ms. Huffington says.

Ms. Fowler is not so sure.
The one interaction we had was right after I published the blog, when I started getting calls from friends and family and even acquaintances I hadnt talked to in years and years who were getting calls about private investigators asking about it, she says And I was pretty sure that this was coming from Uber or someone close to Uber.
So I sent an email to some of the members of the Uber board because I was like, Look, I dont know if youre responsible for this, but hey, if youre doing this, please stop.
And Arianna responded and she was like, Travis has assured me that he did not do this.
And I replied, asking her, O.K., well, then, could you please go and say publicly, Whoevers doing this, stop, if somebody is?
Ms. Huffington told me that the board had a complete assurance from management that nothing was done like that or would be.
Speaking to The Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Ms. Hornsey, who joined Uber a month after Ms. Fowler left and a month before the famous blog post, was asked if she had ever reached out to Ms. Fowler.

Ms. Fowler tweeted a screen shot of that part of the interview, saying: Oooh burn and She really, really doesnt like me.
On the advice of a friend, Ms. Fowler got private security for the first few weeks after she published her incendiary essay.
She thinks Silicon Valley needs to get rid of forced arbitration.
When you join these companies, they make you sign away your constitutional right to sue, she says.
Ms. Fowler has taken that to the Supreme Court, and as is her wont, is studying the syllabuses of Columbia Law School so she can learn more about her rights.
She now has a job at Stripe as the editor of its tech publication.
And shes working with Verve, a Hollywood talent agency, developing a movie based on her experiences, described by the agency to me as Erin Brockovich meets The Social Network.

Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.
The episode involving Mr. Price occurred in 2015 when he was in a car with Isa Dick Hackett, a Hollywood producer.
She told investigators for Amazon shortly after the car ride that Mr. Price made unwanted sexual advances toward her.
Mr. Prices career at Amazon continued until last week, when Ms. Hackett shared the details of the episode publicly for the first time, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
Amazon suspended him the day the article appeared, and he left the company on Tuesday.
Amazons recent actions took place in the middle of a firestorm over revelations in The New York Times and The New Yorker about another entertainment industry figure, Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of decades of sexual harassment and abuse.
Ms. Hackett, for one, has said she was emboldened to go public with her story by the willingness of Mr. Weinsteins accusers to speak up.
But there is confusion among some Amazon employees about why Mr. Price did not lose his job in 2015 after the company learned of Ms. Hacketts accusations.
One consequence Mr. Price faced after the episode was being told to be careful how much alcohol he drank at work functions, according to a third employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies.
The employee was briefed on the decision.
Some of the frustration inside the company has been directed at Jeff Blackburn, the Amazon senior vice president who directly managed Mr. Price.
Mr. Blackburn sent the email to Amazons film and television employees on Friday, and it was more broadly distributed by other executives to their groups.
Photo In his email, Mr. Blackburn said Amazon was taking this situation, and the general issue of sexual harassment, very seriously.
He said it was not appropriate to share personnel details publicly, but said that Mr. Prices departure followed new information that surfaced last week, as well as other factors.
His email did not describe the new information.
On the same day Mr. Price was suspended, an actress, Rose McGowan, posted a series of messages on Twitter saying she had previously told the head of Amazon Studios, the companys movie and television group, that Mr. Weinstein had raped her.
Mr. Weinsteins spokeswoman has said he denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.

The pinnacle of Amazon is an elite group known as the S-team, roughly 16 senior executives, fewer than a dozen of whom report directly to Jeff Bezos, the companys chief executive.
Just one member of the S-team is a woman, Beth Galetti, Amazons senior vice president for human resources, according to two of the three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

At Microsoft, in contrast, three of the 15 people who report to the companys chief executive, Satya Nadella, are women.
At Apple, women will represent six of the 18 people who report to Tim Cook, the companys chief, as of later this month, when the companys new general counsel starts.
Like other technology companies, Amazon has described improving the diversity of its work force as an important company goal.
In a report on company diversity, Amazon says 61 percent of its work force and 75 percent of its managers are men.
Those figures, though, include the huge numbers of workers in Amazons warehouses, where women are better represented than at other parts of the company.
In August, at a staff meeting for Amazon employees held at a basketball arena, Mr. Bezos was asked about the dearth of diversity implying gender and race on his senior leadership team.
Amazon employees applauded loudly at the question.
Mr. Bezos replied that diversity was important at Amazon, according to two of the employees who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.
But Mr. Bezos said that adding more diversity to the leadership team would happen slowly because of low turnover in its ranks an answer that left many employees disappointed.
One of the Amazon employees, who recently looked at an organizational chart, said Amazons S-team members and the people who report directly to them amount to roughly 90 people, about 75 of whom are men.
Amazon has taken some steps in recent years to make working at the company more appealing to women.
Two years ago, it instituted a more generous maternity leave policy, providing birth mothers with up to 20 weeks of paid leave.
But the companys office culture still has a hard-charging reputation that could make it harder to recruit more women.
Textio, a Seattle start-up that uses software to analyze language, has examined public job postings for all the major internet companies.
The company found that the language in Amazons skewed most sharply to the masculine end of the spectrum, with frequent use of words like wickedly, insane and maniacal.
Kieran Snyder, the co-founder and chief executive of Textio, worked at Amazon for about six months.
I would say Amazon has a reputation in the industry for being a very aggressive culture, she said.

Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum a cultural hack, in the words of one expert.
Yet the psychology behind social media platforms the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think theyre immune to being duped.
For all the suspicions about social media companies motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.
Skepticism of online news serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected meme.
At a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, Facebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences, said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Timess Upshot column).
For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, People have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own.
What its actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site.
Its curating news and information that will keep you watching.
That kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as meme, or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.
The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms.
The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).
Advertisement Continue reading the main story For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or information cocoons is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.
In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite.
Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.
But they dont have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests.
Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth mutations find psychological traction, then go viral.
There is no precise formula for such digital catnip.
The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.
Photo My experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them, Mr. McKinney said.
Theyre just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard at the source.
Digital social networks are dangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct, Dr. Nyhan said.
One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: The networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers ability to check it.
Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.

The extent to which Facebook and other platforms function as marketers of misinformation, similar to the way they market shoes and makeup, is contentious.
In 2015, a trio of behavior scientists working at Facebook inflamed the debate in a paper published in the prominent journal Science.
The authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that individuals choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to contrary news and commentary than Facebooks own algorithmic ranking which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.
The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.
Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.
Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief.
Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated facts as possibly true.
A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.
And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.
Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: Was Obama a Muslim?
I seem to remember that....
In a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.
Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if its a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story And, as salespeople have known forever, people tend to value the information and judgments offered by good friends over all other sources.
Its a psychological tendency with significant consequences now that nearly two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media.
Your social alliances affect how you weight information, said Dr. Seifert.
We overweight information from people we know.
The casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.
Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally its hard work.
Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.
If I didnt have direct evidence that all these theories were wrong from the scanner, Mr. McKinney said, I might have taken them a little more seriously.
Ms. Milano was seeking to give a voice to sexual abuse victims, after accusations of sexual harassment and assault were leveled against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
After her tweet, social media was soon flooded with stories of harassment and assault, as #metoo became a way for users to tell their experience with sexual violence and stand in solidarity with other survivors.
The hashtag was widely used on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and other platforms; on Facebook, it was shared in more than 12 million posts and reactions in the first 24 hours, according to The Associated Press.
It was a particularly combustible moment for social media activism.
Days earlier, amid the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, the actress Rose McGowan, who is among those accusing him of sexual harassment, was briefly locked out from her Twitter account, where she had been vocally speaking out against sexual harassment in Hollywood.
Photo The following day, women online participated in a daylong boycott of Twitter, organized around the hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter.
Ms. Milano joined the boycott.
But black, Latino and other women of color started their own campaign.
April Reign, a digital media strategist and the woman behind the #OscarSoWhite hashtag, began to organize people around the #WOCAffirmation or women of color affirmation.
The purpose was to uplift one another as they saw a disparity in how women of color were treated when they reported abuse.
White women have not been as supportive as they could have been of women of color when they experience targeted abuse and harassment, Ms. Reign said in an interview.

We used it as a peaceful moment to say feminism should be intersectional, Ms. Reign said.
If there is support for Rose McGowan, which is great, you need to be consistent across the board.
All women stand with all women.
And so, when Ms. Milano tweeted out the #metoo hashtag without crediting Ms. Burke, some noted that black women had again been left out of the story.

Like with Tarana.
Ms. Burke, too, said she was alarmed when she saw Ms. Milanos tweet.
Initially I panicked, she said.
I felt a sense of dread, because something that was part of my lifes work was going to be co-opted and taken from me and used for a purpose that I hadnt originally intended.
But Ms. Milano, who said she had been unaware of Ms. Burkes campaign, moved to correct the problem.
She reached out to Ms. Burke two days after she sent out the #metoo tweet and is hoping to collaborate.
She has been very grateful and gracious, Ms. Burke said.
On Thursday, Ms. Milano went on Good Morning America, where she publicly credited Ms. Burke for her Me Too campaign.

Amplifying the voice of the victims has always been Ms. Burkes goal.
Despite a great lack of intersectionality across these various movements, Ms. Burke, whose campaign predates the widespread adoption of social media, said she also believes that the Me Too campaign is bigger than just one person.
I think it is selfish for me to try to frame Me Too as something that I own, she said.
It is bigger than me and bigger than Alyssa Milano.
Neither one of us should be centered in this work.
This is about survivors.
Q.
Is it possible to move or play my iTunes songs on an Android phone?
I thought iTunes locked you into an Apple device, but maybe there are ways to do it?
A.
When Apples iTunes Music Store arrived in 2003, it sold songs and albums as digital files in the Advanced Audio Coding format (instead of the then-common MP3 format) with digital rights management, or D.R.M., restrictions built in to prevent the files from playing on unauthorized hardware.
In early 2009, however, Apple announced that it was removing the D.R.M.
software from the music it sold in the iTunes Store, which freed up the music files to be played on a wider range of devices.

Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.
Songs you converted yourself from compact discs were not affected by iTunes Store restrictions.
Several music apps and services for Android support most of the audio file types used by the iTunes software, including D.R.M.-free AAC, MP3 and WMA (Windows Media Audio).
Using the Google Play Music Manager to upload your iTunes library to Googles servers so you can stream the songs on an Android device is a common approach, although the files will be converted to the MP3 format as part of the process.
Google notes, however, that some D.R.M.-protected AAC files cannot be uploaded because of the built-in copy restrictions, so iTunes Store songs purchased before 2009 may not work.
Photo You can also move your iTunes music library to your Android device for syncing or streaming with third-party apps or over a USB connection.
The Google Play store has several apps to do this; doubleTwist is one company making such software for syncing iTunes songs to Android devices.
Although you eventually have to pay a subscription fee after a three-month free trial period, Apple does make a version of its Apple Music app for Android.
Apple Music subscribers can play their iTunes purchases and other music with the app, which also includes curated streaming radio stations and video features.

Lyft Hauls In Funding Mike: Moving on, Thursday morning we saw CapitalG, an investment arm of Alphabet, lead a $1 billion venture round into Lyft, the ride-hailing start-up.
The move ratchets up the stakes in the cutthroat world of ride hailing.
Uber is working on its own $1 billion deal this one with SoftBank while automakers and other start-ups look on warily at the state of play.
Isnt it funny that just one year ago Lyft was all but dead in the court of public opinion?
Now theyve got this encouraging second wind, after Uber spent the entire past year in complete disarray.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Farhad: Right and I really think theyve got a chance.
The big problem for Uber in North America is that Lyft is functionally the same.
Ive been using it as my go-to ride app for several months now, and in most cases I couldnt find a significant difference from Uber.
Prices, wait times, car quality theyre all pretty much the same.
This is unusual in tech.
Usually bigger companies have advantages that lead to better products.
Amazon, for instance, has greater selection and faster shipping times than any other online retailer, while Facebook has all your friends and family.
The ride-hailing business doesnt seem to have those dynamics Uber is far bigger than Lyft, but that size is not evident to customers in any way.
Which seems bad for Uber, in the long run.
The Specter of Regulation Mike: Finally, lets turn back to Facebook, Google and Twitter, the three tech companies that are in the doghouse with Congress right now.
After the 2016 election, these giants are taking tons of flak for their advertising products and whatever kind of influence they may have had in shaping the outcome of the vote.
Now, as we slowly head toward a future where digital advertising regulation may occur, were seeing the extent to which Facebook and others have avoided being regulated for years.
This burns me up.
As Facebook continues to say, over and over, that it wants to be as transparent as possible, it neglects the fact that it has fought against external oversight of how its platform worked for years.
And on Nov. 1, when Facebook and others are called to testify in the Senate and House, its likely that the C.E.O.s or C.O.O.s of these companies wont even show up to explain what happened.
Thats an enormous cop-out in my book.
But maybe Ive just been drinking too much coffee today.
Farhad: Its looking like it will be pretty hard for them to avoid at least some limited regulation.
Now the battle will shift to how they can limit the fallout.
And if they can shape a bill that isnt too onerous, they might be O.K.
with it.
Theyd have to add disclosures and perhaps keep greater records of political ads, but it might not greatly limit their overall ad business.
Then everyone would be able to claim theyve fixed the problem and tech companies are wonderful now.
See, easy!

Q.
Are there any inexpensive Android apps that let you take a picture of a document and convert the photo to a Microsoft Word-compatible file that can be edited and printed?
Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?
Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.
A. Optical character recognition (O.C.R.)
apps are designed to convert images of letters in documents or other printed sources into text files you can edit in Microsoft Word or another word-processing program.
O.C.R.
apps for Android are available in the Google Play store, just as similar programs for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile and desktop systems can be found in the respective app stores.
Some apps can even translate photographed text into different languages.
If you use the Microsoft Office suite for writing and editing documents, however, a combination of Microsoft Word for Android and the separate Office Lens app is one way to snap, scan and edit when you are on the go.
When you have both apps on your Android device, open Office Lens and take a picture of the page or printed material you want to convert into a Word file; the app can also convert a photograph of notes scrawled on a white board into text files.
Photo When you are asked to save and store the photo, choose Microsoft Word from the list of apps and services.
The Android version of Word then takes over to open the file, covert the text into type you can edit and then open the content in a word-processing document on your phone or tablet.
You can edit it there, email it to yourself for use elsewhere or park it in a linked online storage site like OneDrive.
The process works about the same way with the apps on an iOS or Windows-based device.
The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.
Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.
After the attack, Googles security team came up with a motto: Never again.
The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers Gmail accounts.
It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.
Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked.
Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.
The idea of Googles Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message.
Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.
But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group?
Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.
So we tested Googles Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.
The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys.
But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.
Setting Up Advanced Protection Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Googles Advanced Protection webpage.
To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each.
Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you.
To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it.
(The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.)
This process takes a few minutes.
On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins.
That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.

Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.
But there are trade-offs.
Googles Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.
For the time being, that means only Googles Gmail mail app, Googles Backup and Sync app, and Googles Chrome browser.
On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Googles Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser.
So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, youre out of luck.
Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.
Testing the Security Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.
Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A.
hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons.
On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.
On the other hand, if you lose the keys or dont have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account.
Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account.
In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.
Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle.
She said Googles requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account.
That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.
Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Googles program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.
Its something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys, Ms. Sandvik said.
I dont see a reason you shouldnt turn this on.
The Bottom Line While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.
It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Googles apps from Apples and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Googles mail, messaging and cloud storage services.
But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature Apples V.I.P.
alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you.
Googles iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature.
For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P.
alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.
Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which wont work with the keys.
If using Googles security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online.
Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Googles lead.
If you decide to wait, dont procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.
While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.
The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.
When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Googles keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: No comment.
Q. I am trying to conserve space on my Mac, and I read about the storage-optimization tools on the Storage tab in the About This Mac box.
However, when I open the box and click the Storage tab, I dont have a Manage button to click and start the cleanup process.
Why?
A. Apple added the Optimized Storage feature to its macOS Sierra (10.12) update.
If your operating system is older than last years release, you will not see the Manage button on the Storage tab that leads you to the new space-saving utilities.
Photo You can see what version of the system you are using by going to the Apple menu, selecting About This Mac and clicking the Overview tab.
If your Mac is running OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or earlier, you need to update your operating system to use the storage-optimization feature.

If you cannot (or do not want to) update your Macs operating system, you can manually free up space by deleting unneeded files, old mail attachments and other clutter.
You can also find programs to automatically sweep your computer and collect unnecessary files.
Clean My Mac 3 ($40, with a free trial period available), Cocktail (on sale for $19, also with a free trial period) and the free AVG Cleaner for Mac are three possibilities.
For those who upgrade (or who have already), Apples support site has a guide to using the storage-optimizing tools in macOS Sierra and the new macOS High Sierra.
Among other things, you can use the feature to seek out and delete files you no longer need, store documents and photos in iCloud and automatically empty the Macs trash can.
What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?
Were still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter Ive always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis.
The song was So What, and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.
We also went analog with our brainstorming equipment.
Instead of white boards, we bought two studio rollers with craft paper.
What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?
Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?
Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.
I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.
But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.
Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.
And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.
No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.
Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.
Are Australians excited?
Reaction is pretty mixed.
Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.
Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.
But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.
I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.
And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.
After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.
Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.
Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.
I was stunned.

But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity.
Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?
I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter.
And I love them.
I cant believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.
What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?
I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesnt work well with a bit of wind.
I dont know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.
And as long as were talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?
What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?
Gumtree is my favorite.
Ive used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things.
The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.
Its great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.
Q.
Is there an easy way to tell if the cable television service is out for everybody or just at my own house because of equipment problems?
I really hate calling.
A.
If you have a working internet connection (or access to one on a cellular device or work computer) and an online account from your cable company, you might be able to check specifically about the status of your own equipment.
To do that, log into your account on your TV providers site and find the technical support area.

Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.
What you find there will vary depending on your cable company, but many providers have problem-solving tools available to help lighten the load on the phone lines.
Spectrum, for example, lets you select the problematic service (like TV or internet) from a menu to see the status of your service and check for notice of a possible problem in your area.
Photo If there is no systemwide disruption, you can use the available guides and tools to troubleshoot your cable converter box and other equipment.
Spectrum has a nationwide page that customers can use to check on storm-related problems, and Comcast has its own Status Center page for Xfinity cable customers.
Many companies have their own mobile apps for account management.
too.
Even if you do not have an online account to see your home setup, your cable providers site might have live chat, general support tips and a service-disruption map.
(While it may seem like just another password to remember, signing up for an account lets you check your bill, pay online, sign up for service alerts, control your DVR or even watch live television on a mobile device depending on what your provider offers.)
Your cable companys customer-service account on Twitter can be another good source of news.
Websites that monitor the status of communications services may also be useful.
Down Detector, Outage Report and Is the Service Down?
are a few sites in this category.
Q. I see theres yet another Windows 10 update out now.
I get notifications about patches all the time, so how do I know when this notice is for a system upgrade?
Can I tell if it already installed itself?
A. Microsoft began rolling out its Windows 10 Fall Creators Update last Tuesday using the Windows Update utility on compatible computers and devices.
When you are checking the available updates, look for the one labeled Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 in the list of security patches and other listed software fixes in Windows Update.

You can manually check to see if the software is ready for you.
Just click or tap the Start button on the Windows 10 desktop, and select Settings; as a keyboard shortcut to the Settings box, you can also press the Windows and I keys.
In the Settings window, select the Update & Security icon, and on the next screen choose Windows Update on the left side of the window.
Next, click or tap the Check for updates button on the right side of the window.
You should see a list of available updates for your computer or tablet.
Photo To see if the update has been installed already especially if other people use the computer and may have taken care of it open the Windows 10 Settings box and choose System and then About.
Look to see if Windows 10, version 1709 is listed there.
Microsoft has a list of new features included with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update on its site.
A blog post on the company site also has a 30-minute video tour and a highlighted list of changes to the system, like the ability to annotate PDF files and e-books in Microsoft Edge, use new voice commands with Cortana and protect your PC against ransomware.
Q.
Is it possible to move or play my iTunes songs on an Android phone?
I thought iTunes locked you into an Apple device, but maybe there are ways to do it?
A.
When Apples iTunes Music Store arrived in 2003, it sold songs and albums as digital files in the Advanced Audio Coding format (instead of the then-common MP3 format) with digital rights management, or D.R.M., restrictions built in to prevent the files from playing on unauthorized hardware.
In early 2009, however, Apple announced that it was removing the D.R.M.
software from the music it sold in the iTunes Store, which freed up the music files to be played on a wider range of devices.
Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?
Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.
Songs you converted yourself from compact discs were not affected by iTunes Store restrictions.
Several music apps and services for Android support most of the audio file types used by the iTunes software, including D.R.M.-free AAC, MP3 and WMA (Windows Media Audio).
Using the Google Play Music Manager to upload your iTunes library to Googles servers so you can stream the songs on an Android device is a common approach, although the files will be converted to the MP3 format as part of the process.
Google notes, however, that some D.R.M.-protected AAC files cannot be uploaded because of the built-in copy restrictions, so iTunes Store songs purchased before 2009 may not work.
Photo You can also move your iTunes music library to your Android device for syncing or streaming with third-party apps or over a USB connection.
The Google Play store has several apps to do this; doubleTwist is one company making such software for syncing iTunes songs to Android devices.
Although you eventually have to pay a subscription fee after a three-month free trial period, Apple does make a version of its Apple Music app for Android.
Apple Music subscribers can play their iTunes purchases and other music with the app, which also includes curated streaming radio stations and video features.
UPDATE: The time to pre-order the brand new iPhone X is almost upon us and, if you're keen on getting your hands on these all-screen wonder any time soon, we recommend getting in quickly as there are reports of very limited stock in the first round of pr-orders.
Pre-orders will go live at 6:01pm this evening (AEDT) and you'll be able to grab them from Apple's online store, although you'll be competing globally for the handset this way, as well as its physical stores.
You can also try and pre-order it through a carrier as they will have their own stock, but we suggest being just as fast in order to snag one this way.
Original article continues below.
Months of rumours and hype have ended and we now know exactly how hard the iPhone X (pronounced iPhone 10) will hit our wallets.
This tenth anniversary handset is Apple's priciest, by far, but you can check out our iPhone X hands-on review for more details on its specs to see exactly what your money will be going towards.
Here, we'll let you know how much the iPhone X will cost outright, and predict the cheapest contract you'll likely see based on previous launches.
Hold on to your hats though, it's a doozy.
At the moment, you can pre-register your interest at most of the major carriers, but we don't have any official indication of what the plans will look like, price-wise, but we have made an educated estimate further down the page.
Alongside the September 12 announcement of the iPhone X, we've also heard all about the latest entries into Apple's flagship range.
The iterative updates of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have landed, in the form of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.
See also: iPhone 8 deals | iPhone 8 Plus deals | iPhone 7 deals | iPhone 7 Plus deals | Samsung Galaxy S8 deals | Galaxy S8 Plus deals iPhone X price: how much does it cost?
This beast isn't cheap.
There are two versions of the massive iPhone X and the smallest of the pair, the 64GB model, will still set you back $1,579.
Huge.
The other model has considerably more storage at 256GB, but this will come at hell of a premium.
The iPhone X 256GB will cost you $1,829.
Even huger.
When can I buy the iPhone X?
You won't be able to grab the new iPhone X as soon as you can the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.
You'll have to wait until Friday, November 3rd to get your hands on this bezel-free marvel.
Pre-orders open on Friday, October 27 at 6:01pm so if you're keen on this premium handset then now's a good time to set a reminder.
Although the iPhone X will be here in time for our Black Friday deals , there's a rather small window of time between the launch and the sales, so we may not see too many savings.
TechRadar predicts the best iPhone X deal Given the $1,579 starting price of the handset, most people are going to want to pick it up as part of a plan.
Like the outright prices, we're expecting the plans to be steeper than the iPhone 7 Plus plans were to start with.
iPhone X | 2GB data | Unlimited calls and texts | $99pm There's bound to be certain deals with specific carriers and networks on launch, but considering the cheapest current plan for an iPhone 8 Plus 256GB is around the $90pm district, we can't imagine that even the cheapest iPhone X plan will be much under $100.
We're hoping this is a conservative estimate, but deep down we're concerned it'll be even more than this.
Total cost over 24 months is $2,376

A new report from Windows Central claims the company is experimenting with a foldable tablet it calls "Andromeda," which you'd essentially use like a digital Moleskine.
Not only would it be rather compact, but you'd a stylus with it much as you'd use a fancy fountain pen or Blackwing pencil with Moleskine's black-bound journals.
You'd fold the tablet like a journal, and it'd likely incorporate Microsoft's advances in digital ink technology.
And, it's possible you'll see it as soon as "sometime in 2018."
Sound familiar?
That's because the project as described sounds a lot like the Courier "digital journal" Microsoft had toyed with making in the latter years of the last decade.
Ultimately, it abandoned the project , in part because Bill Gates had an "allergic reaction" to the concept.
An early concept for the Courier.
Image credit: Extreme Tech If the new Andromeda device works as planned, that means we'll have a digital device that's more like a traditional pen-and-paper note-taking notebook than the touchscreen devices we're so used to today.
Much like the Amazon Kindle , the Andromeda appears to be a device that's largely built for one purpose.
In this case, it's note-taking, so it'll run on a new app that will sync with OneNote .
You'll also be able to run a few additional apps such as the Edge browser or Photos.
If you're really a fan of this sort of thing, it may even come with cellular support so it can serve as a smartphone replacement.
Beyond that, we don't really know much about the device.
When it's described as a "foldable" device, does that mean it has two screens?
Does it mean you'll open it and use it as one screen with a split down the middle?
We'll have to wait and see.
Write and wrong If I may interject, I confess I'm one of those weirdos who writes many notes (and sometimes even drafts) in longhand on my iPad Pro with my Apple Pencil.
And I'm not really convinced the Andromeda will be all that appealing as described.
One of the nice things about writing by hand on a tablet like the iPad (or the Surface Pro 4 , to stay company-specific) is that the device actually enhances the freedom and fluidity you get from writing longhand on, say, a legal pad.
Write in an app like Notability or Notes Plus, and you can keep your hand comfortably in one position while you push an endless sheet of paper up as you write.
The big, wide screen of an iPad or a Surface allows an additional degree of freedom that a cramped split-screen surface probably would not.
Too many apps and devices that cater to longhand writers try excessively to capture the sensation of writing on a constrained sheet or paper, and I worry that Microsoft may be falling into the same trap.
In short, I'm well aware that I'm probably the niche target audience the Andromeda is aimed at, but I can't see where it'd do its job any better than the tablets we already have.
I'm always up for surprises, though.
For those smartphone owners that arent huge on data consumption but still want to use their phone as, well, a phone, Australian teclo Amaysim has launched two incredibly affordable SIM-only plans to tick those specific two boxes.
Both the company's new $10 and $20 options include unlimited talk and text to standard numbers in Australia, while their data allowances are 1GB and 2.5GB respectively.
Amaysim uses a system called renewals which are essentially month-to-month plans that last 28 days and have no lock-in contract.
For comparison, the closest available month-to-month plans on Virgin and Optus (who, like Amaysim, both operate using the Optus 4G network) are $30 for 2.5GB and $35 for 1.5GB respectively.
It's worth noting that both of the latter plans do offer more included extras than Amaysim, such as certain music streaming services not counting towards the data cap, and month-to-month data rollover.
Conveniently, Amaysim has just opened up an online store where you can purchase outright handsets at excellent prices, to go with your affordable SIM-only plan.
According to a recent study from market research firm Telsyte, there are 10 million Australians who use less than 1GB of data a month, and it's this section of the market that Amaysim hopes to corner with these new plans.

After so many years of doom and gloom, Nintendo is enjoying a bit of a renaissance.
But perhaps because it's used to the demands of that earlier, slower era, the well-known gaming company has had a rough time meeting the wild demand for new devices like NES Classic , SNES Classic and Nintendo Switch .
In an interview with The Verge , Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aim expressed regret over the situation.
"I wish we would have more hardware," Fils-Aim said.
"Our inability to meet demand is not something that is satisfying in any way, shape or form.
And were working hard to satisfy as much demand as possible."
Fils-Aim went on to say that changes have been made to the supply line in order to get more of its products out to customers.
Missed opportunity At almost every turn this year, the extreme appeal of some of Nintendo's latest products has been tempered by the knowledge that you might not even be able to buy the coveted devices.
In the case of the NES Classic, all available units sold out within a matter of days.
Although it initially said it wouldn't make any more , Nintendo now plans to launch a new wave of the diminutive sometime next year .
The SNES Classic and the Nintendo Switch console never reached such extremes, but even now months after launch it's still hard to get your hands on either unit.
That scarcity, naturally, has pushed prices for the NES Classic, the SNES Classic and occasionally the Switch to absurd heights on sites like eBay.
Fils-Aim wants to keep that from happening in the future.
"We know that there are many consumers who want that system and have not been able to purchase it," said Fils-Aim, referring to the SNES Classic Mini.
"Certainly were not happy to see the re-seller prices on that system.
And so bringing it back, and bringing it back in significant numbers, is something thats important to us."
Feeling a little ... melodramatic?
I know I usually do by the time Thursday rolls around, though perhaps "deliriously silly" is a better way to put it.
Whatever you're feeling, Instagram has a new way for you to express yourself on its service with a camera effect called Superzoom.
Superzoom records a clip of you (or whatever you're pointing your camera at), and automatically zooms in closer in comedic fashion.
There's also bombastic music to complete the effect.
To use Superzoom, first open the camera inside the Instagram app.
You'll then see Superzoom located next to the Boomerang button.
Either tap this button once to record a three-second clip, or hold down to record a longer one.
Once you've gotten up close and personal, you can share your Superzoom or add it to your Instagram Story.
Check out the best mirrorless cameras around What else is new for Instagram Also, just in time for Halloween, Instagram has added five spooky face filters and new stickers to get you in the spirit.
The filters include a zombie, a vampire that transforms into a bat, and a sinister fog, while the stickers range from candy corn to dismembered zombie hands.
These haunted filters and stickers will be available through November 1.
Trivial as these additions may seem, this is yet another move by Facebook-owned Instagram against rival Snapchat.
Whatever Snapchat does, Instagram is able to do soon after, and often times, more successfully.
We'll see if users flock to Superzoom, but it's almost certainly in for a lot of play as users try to one-up their friends with the most over-the-top video.
Im standing in Queen Carolines Temple, a delightfully arched structure in Londons Hyde Park, looking at ladybirds and listening to opera.
And Im having such a lovely time that I dont even care how utterly stupid this opening sounds.
The reason Im here is the culmination of my test of streaming Apple Music on the new Watch 3.
Before we get into me and the ladybirds, lets roll back a second.
Apple Music streaming on the Watch - which is part of the WatchOS 4.1 update - was announced in September, alongside the new Apple Watch 3 and iPhone 8 / X range.
But its only just now being added to the Watch 3, where it should have been enabled at launch - the trend for brands to announce a feature at launch and add it in at a later date is infuriating.
I just didnt get that excited when it was announced.
Its not like this was the first time wed had Apple Music on the Watch, and streamed music didnt seem that much of a big deal.
It would eat data and battery life, and simply syncing playlists ahead of time would solve all the issues.
Beats Radio on your arm has suggested stations ready to go So whats actually changed?
Well, apart from being able to listen to any of the 40 million songs Apples touting with the update, you can also access Beats Radio (with different stations and personalized feeds) from the Watch 3 and Apple has added Music complications to the Watch faces.
Quite quickly, one thing becomes apparent: to get the most out of the Apple Music streaming experience, you need to be embedded in the service already.
That sounds obvious, but its much easier to have control of your music from the wrist if youve already got loads of playlists saved - telling Siri to shuffle a certain playlist feels more tailored than just asking it to Play Todays Hits.
But when Apple Music was announced, I was already a heavy user of Spotify, so my experience with trying out the new streaming capabilities has been limited to playing a few playlists Id already set up, or begging Siri to play different genres of tunes to complement what I was doing.
Your music master Siri is the main portal to your musical experience on the Apple Watch - while you can open the apps from your wrist, tapping is fiddly and just asking your timepiece to play music is far more intuitive.
But Siri is both facilitator and denier - still the Apple Watch 3 struggles with connectivity at times, with Siri telling you that youll need to wait while it connects before it can start playback.
This doesnt happen that often, but when it does its an irritant at a time when the process needs to be slick.
That need is influenced by the fact most networks/carriers will require you to pay an additional sum each month to use the data from your contract on your smartwatch.
Youll probably get a little extra data to offset the new device sucking from your artery of bytes, but theres still a cost for owning the Watch 3 with data capabilities.
But lets say that youve accepted the cost, can handle a little bit of Siri hesitation and just want to go out and run with your Watch 3, unencumbered by a heavy phone tethered about your person.
Theres a magical moment where you fire up Siri, ask it to play your personalised radio station and get trotting, and within a few seconds (the streaming isnt instant) youll have music flowing into your Bluetooth earbuds, with the Watch tracking your heart rate, motion and updating your with calls and messages where needed.
Some glitches still exist, but they do work through This is a world away from the first iteration of the Apple Watch, which could barely work out when you were running and had an outburst whenever you stepped away from the phone - the current Watch 3 is much more accomplished as a standalone device.
So once I was away and running, I realised that I had to rethink things.
Where Im used to locking a large smartphone to my arm to keep me entertained on long jaunts, with the Apple Watch 3 youve got a barely-perceptible device on your wrist with any song youd like.
Its pretty futuristic stuff.
Instead of just chucking on a playlist and battering out at the same pace, I tried to alter the mood based on what I was doing.
Relaxing songs to warm up to then a Nike Breaking 2 playlist for the harder moments.
Imagine a man standing here that you kind of hated.
Credit: Wiki Loves Monuments By finding it so easy to switch up the music and alter the mood, I began to take in my surroundings a little more - smells and sights in this iconic park suddenly became more obvious, culminating in standing by the ornate Queen Carolines Temple, quietly standing inside the arches and asking Siri play me some meditation music.
It led to a really great moment where I just looked out over the lake, the smell of the damp leaves wafting on the breeze and the softer music combining my breath slowing it sounds utterly pretentious (and, lets be honest, it is) but it highlighted to me the benefit of having such easy access to so much music on the go.
A specific experience However, while I found a moment of tranquility thanks to the Apple Watch 3s music streaming capabilities, it was a very unique set of circumstances.
Most of the time well have our phones with us, and using the Apple Music app on the handset is so much easier.
There are no suggestions on the smaller Watch Music app of playlists you might enjoy, and the Beats radio options are limited too.
Youre basically at the mercy of Siri understanding your intonation, and you need to be very clear and direct with the assistant when walking or running.
I instantly accidentally called a friend when trying to open one of my playlists, and the time taken for Siri to fire up and be ready to use varies.
Personalised feed.
Needs more face.
Battery life also takes something of a hit, but not to any great degree.
Youll still get around a days use if you head out on a run with full streaming music, so thats pretty decent but things do get a bit dicey towards the evening if youve listened to music for more than an hour, In my review of the Apple Watch 3, I recommended that you go for the non-LTE-connected version, as its so much cheaper to buy outright and doesnt need a data plan to get the full use.
I still stand by that choice, but there is something incredibly cool and free about being able to ask your wrist to play any song you fancy.
The voice recognition is generally pretty accurate and the variety of genres impressive.
While very specific in its use, the moments where you do decide to ditch the phone and head out feel much more complete - if only Apple would get a podcast app on the Watch, wed have far fewer qualms leaving the phone at home these days.
The Google Pixel 2 XL is the highest rated camera according to DxO Mark - the industry standard in camera benchmarks - but how does it truly perform in everyday life?
Rather than take the accolade at face value, we wanted to test for ourselves whether Google's new Android flagship could really win out against the iPhone 8 Plus, Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 8.
To make the camera comparison as fair as possible, we shot multiple pictures across a range of scenarios on all five phones.
Next, we laid them out on a grid with no indication as to which phone snapped which picture.
We then got two members of the TechRadar team to judge the pictures - first our Photography Editor Phil Hall and secondly our Associate Editor Gerald Lynch.
With Phil representing the professional camera expert and Gerald representing the everyman, our blind test interrogates whether the Google Pixel 2 XL camera is the best out there.
Check out our video above to see exactly what they think, and judge the pictures for yourself with the full grid of images below.
Once you've decided which phone is the one for you in each grid, jump over to the next page where all will be revealed and you can see which smartphone takes the best pictures in the eyes of our expert, our amateur and - of course - yourself.

The kit comes with the Hive Active Heating thermostat and the Hive Receiver which connects to your boiler - you can also get this kit with the Hive Hub included (if you don't have one you'll need to get this) but it'll cost you a bit more - that package is down to 199.20 from 249.

Prices are one for 23.20, three for 63.20 or five for 95.20.
One of the main benefits of being an Xbox Live Gold subscriber is definitely the fact that each month you get access to a range of free games across the Xbox One and Xbox 360 platforms.
If youre an Xbox One owner, backwards compatibility means you get to take advantage of the Xbox 360 titles too.
This is a great way to try games you might not otherwise have played, whether because they're indie titles that slip under your radar or simply because you dont have the funds to buy several games a month.
Even if you dont have the console memory or the time to spare right now, wed say its always worth claiming them every month anyway as youll then have free access to them for as long as you have an active Xbox Live account.
Since this is a monthly event, weve decided to create a one-stop shop where youll be able to find the newest free games, as well as scroll back and see which games were featured in previous months.
That way youll know whether its worth holding out for a game to appear in an upcoming Games with Gold month or if it's already been offered.
So without further ado, here are the free Xbox Live games in North America, Europe, and Australia for November 2017.
Don't forget some of the October titles are still available too!
November 2017 Xbox One Tales from the Borderlands November 16 to December 15 (usually $14.99/ 11.99/ AU $19.95) One of the strongest titles from Telltale Games, Tales from the Borderlands is a narrative and choice-driven episodic game set after the events of Borderlands 2.
Head to the harsh world of Pandora and play Rhys, a Hyperion suit with big dreams, and Fiona, a con artist looking to earn big.
These unwilling partners must travel together to recover a huge sum of money they both think is theirs, encountering bandits, hunters and gangsters along the way.
This bundle contains the complete season so you can enjoy the story from beginning to end.
Trackmania Turbo November 1 to November 30 (usually $39.99/ 29.99/ AU $59.95) Looking for an arcade racing experience unlike any other?

Xbox 360 NiGHTS into Dreams November 1 to November 15 (usually $9.99/ 6.75/ AU $9.95) This is a game that's been around for a while.

It's up to Claris and Elliot to team up with Nights to stop an evil ruler known as Wizeman from destroying Nightopia and their own world.
This game is an example of Sega at its most creative and weird.
It's difficult but well worth trying out.

October 2017 Xbox One Gone Home October 1 to 31 (usually $19.99 / 15.99 / AU $26.95 ) Gone Home is something a little bit different from the fast-paced action games you might be used to.
Rather than rushing to fight enemies or solve puzzles, the game instead sees you slowly exploring your family home, finding clues to piece together what's happened to its inhabitants.
What results is a captivating love story that's well worth playing through.

Bitcoin has been forked once more to create a new cryptocurrency named Bitcoin Gold, although the virtual cash experienced a troubled birth thanks to a cyber-attack on launch day.
Bitcoin has already been forked earlier this year, with the creation of Bitcoin Cash in August, and now Bitcoin Gold has come along with the aim of making currency mining a more accessible affair for individuals (as opposed to behemoth mining operations with super-powerful hardware).
Unfortunately, as the Telegraph reports, as soon as the golden variant of Bitcoin launched on Tuesday, its website came under DDoS attack.
As Bitcoin Gold announced on Twitter: Massive DDoS attack on our cloud site.
10M requests per minute.
We are working with the providers to ban all the IPs.
We will be up soon!October 24, 2017 Dealing with disruption The attack wasnt successfully dealt with until almost three hours later, and even at that point, Bitcoin Gold noted it would take a bit more time to begin operating normally.
Quite some disruption for the opening day.
The website was fully back online yesterday, but the value of Bitcoin Gold fell heavily from around $500 (380) at launch to about $150 (115) yesterday, and it currently sits at $122 (90).
Not the most auspicious of starts, but to be fair, theres a long road ahead.
Bitcoin Cash currently has a value of $339 (260), whereas Bitcoin itself towers at $5,940 (4,500) at the time of writing according to Coin Market Cap.
Such has been the explosion in the value of Bitcoin since the spring, its hardly surprising that it has been attracting so much more attention, from miners buying up graphics cards, to some websites employing sneaky means to mine virtual coins using the CPUs (and hence electricity) of site visitors.
Laptops have overtaken desktop PCs as the preferred workhorse machines for most companies, regardless of the size, and it is easy to see why.
The performance, feature, and price gap between the two have shrunk considerably, so much so that other than for niche use cases that require a fixed workstation, a laptop is generally preferable to a desktop computer.
But while laptops are mobile computers, they do rely, sometimes, on accessories to boost their capabilities.
We've rounded up some of these clever extras, from an ultra-secure USB drives, through a tiny docking station, to one of the weirdest gadgets ever to land on Techradar Pro, courtesy of a Kickstarter campaign.
A hugely flexible, but slightly bulky, laptop power bank that will keep you online all day.
Huge capacity Flexible usage Slimline design Travel-friendly Slightly weighty If you're someone who travels for work a lot, staying powered up on the move may often prove a challenge.
Although power banks for mobile devices have been popular for some time, anyone looking for a laptop equivalent could be caught short.
However Orico's new SC28 offering provides a huge capacity that should be perfect for staying charged up on a trip.
With a capacity of 28,800mAh, the SC28 provides easily enough juice for even the thirstiest laptops, which can be quickly recharged via USB or power socket.
The latter features a number of adaptors for different markets, meaning you should never be caught short, with Orico promising five hours of life for a 13in laptop.
The SC28 can charge up to three devices at once, meaning you can power your laptop, phone and router all at once for the ideal mobile working solution.
The device itself looks stylish, with a sleek aluminium alloy body that weighs in at just under 1kg, but should still easily slip into a rucksack or laptop bag.
A stylish and premium noise-cancelling headset thats perfect for meetings, and music.
Stylish design Excellent audio quality Long battery life Some volume level issues Expensive In modern busy offices, it can be tricky to get some quiet - particularly if youre trying to carry out a conference call or video meeting from your desk.
Sennheiser, which is perhaps better known for its consumer headphone line, is looking to address this with a new headset targeted at business customers.
The MB 660 may resemble normal cans style headphones, but in fact can act as a Bluetooth-enabled wireless headset, allowing you to use them as a meeting accessory in todays UC-dominated workplace.
As you would expect from a brand such as Sennheiser, the audio quality is excellent, whether thats with a voice call, watching video or even listening to music.
This is complimented by the noise-cancelling ability of the headset, which comes with three separate settings that allow you to select your level of isolation.
This high-standard audio quality does come at a price, but if you value your calls and media, it may be worth shelling out.
The headset comes with its own stylish and compact carry case, which also house the charging cables and USB connector.
Battery life was excellent, with the headset not needing a recharge during our week-long test - and when we did plug it in, recharging was quick and effective.
Take the notebook into the 21st century with Moleskine's Smart Writing Set.
Innovative idea Stylish idea Overly complex compared to low-tech alternative Expensive If you thought that the era of writing stuff down using pen and paper was dead, then Moleskine is here to prove you wrong.
The iconic notebook provider, well-known for its leather-bound pages, is embracing the technology world with its new Smart Writing Set, which it says combines the pleasure of writing with pen and paper with the ease and speed of editing offered by modern word processing software.
The kit consists of a smart Pen+ tool, which, when used to write on the accompanying 'Paper Tablet', will also display what you are writing on an accompanying phone or tablet device.
Connected via Bluetooth, your device, boosted by the Moleskine Notes App, then allows you to record and edit your scribblings, meaning you can add extra colour, highlights and more.
The app, which is available on iOS and Android devices, stores all the writing done in your Paper Tablet, meaning you can delete or move pages across devices, and even sync using your Google Drive or Evernote account.
As for the kit itself, it resembles your traditional writing tools, with the Pen+ taking after a standard fountain pen - albeit with a hidden camera by the nib which traces and digitises everything you write.
The Paper Tablet is slightly thicker than a usual Moleskine, but features NCode technology embedded in every page to allow the Pen+ to pick up your writing or drawing.
All in all, the device works well - once you're registered on the app, using the Pen+ is smooth, and the data transfer is effective, even if like us, you aren't particularly artistically-minded.
But whilst this is clearly a clever product (and at 199, a premium one too...) there remains a slight nagging question about what it's trying to achieve.
Those of us used to writing with a pen and pad will find some advantages, most notably the chance to edit and remove notes, but with tablet devices and lightweight laptops so commonplace today, it still seems like an odd choice of platform for Moleskine.
A stylish battery charger that can power a MacBook Three ports that can deliver at least 3A Can power a MacBook Slippery casing 4-LED indicators Jackery is a little known company that focuses - like so many out there - on producing portable laptop and smartphone chargers.
Its flagship product is the massive PowerPro, a 500Whr/140Ah Portable Power station rechargeable battery pack, The Jackery Titan S is a portable battery (72.4Whr) that can not only charge your mobile or tablet but also, according to its manufacturer, the popular Apple MacBook laptop.
We didnt have one at hand to test that claim sadly; note that it is also available in orange which for some reason has a lower capacity.
Its black metal aluminium casing ensures that it will survive more than a few drops and it does feel very solid.
Shame though about the sharper-than-usual edges on both sides and were not fans of the curvy profile of the Titan S as this caused it to slip a few times.
This is a portable charger/battery pack so dont expect too much innovation; it doesnt switch off automatically but does identify the connected device by itself, charging it at the maximum permitted power.
Other than a big power button and a 4-led battery status indicators which means you will never really know when the item will be fully charged when you reach four blue dots or discharged when it shows one blue dot.
There are two full size USB ports - a 15W one (5V, 3A) and an 18W one (supporting variable voltages thanks to Quick Charge, up to 3.4A) - and a USB Type-C one that can deliver 15W power (5V, 3A); the latter can also be used to charge the battery.
At 155 x 80 x 22mm for a weight of 435g, it is a tad smaller (volume wise) and lighter than the Aukey Powerbank although the latter has a far superior capacity (30Ah compared to 20.1Ah).
The Jackery Titan comes with a micro USB charging cable and a two-year warranty but no carry case.
The item is out of stock in the UK at the time of writing.
An PIN-protected way to make sure your data stays secure.
High-levels of security Powerful encryption protection Hard-wearing design, but light and portable Works across multiple operating systems High price tag Some availability issues With data security becoming paramount for many of us these days, the diskAshur Pro looks to offer a comprehensive security offering to ensure your important data stays intact.
The key selling point of the diskAshur Pro is its obvious physical security - the device comes with a keypad that will only grant access to the data stored within upon entering a PIN number.
Far from your usual ATM PIN number though, the device requires an identifier between seven and 15 digits, offering far tougher security, with the number able to be quickly personalised and changed, in order to keep your data safe.
Asides from the physical security (which extends to IP56 water and dust resistance and even a self-destruct feature), the diskAshur Pro also comes with some enviable encryption, sporting XTS-AES 256-bit real-time full disk hardware encryption and EDGE technology to offer even more levels of safety.
This version of the drive offers 500GB of storage, which should easily be enough to store all your vital documents, media and more, and connects to your PC or laptop via a standard USB 3.1 port.
The diskAshur Pro works across all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and Linux, and requires no extra additional software to be installed, meaning using the device is incredibly easy.
Getting hold of the product may be the main issue with the diskAshur Pro, with the company manufacturing and selling many other models of the device on its site.
We found this particular model for sale on Amazon for 211.96, and on iStorage's own site for 209.
If you are able to get one, however, the diskAshur Pro is unparalleled in both its physical and internal protection, and the compact build and hard-wearing design make this a must-have for the security-conscious.
A majorly fast, and simple to use, compact mobile Wi-Fi hotspot Slim yet tough design Fast download speeds Excellent battery life Simple set up Tough to track down in the UK TP-Link says that the M7650 is the fastest Wi-Fi router it has ever made, offering speeds of up to 600MBps, which is easily enough to stream video to your laptop or tablet whilst on the move, as well as high-quality VoLTE audio through your phone - useful if you don't want to miss that conference call.
Our tests found that the device often reached speeds of over 500MBps, which is impressive for central London, and more than enough to enjoy reliable connections whilst on the move.
The M7650 can support up to 32 devices at once, meaning you can set up multiple connections around the home, or even in a small office if needs be - although speeds will drop if you do so.
Set up is remarkably easy, requiring you to just insert the SIM card and turn on, making this much more straightforward than other similar devices.
Battery life for the device was excellent, lasting a full working day with ease, as TP-Link says that the M7650 can offer up to 15 hours of juice, and recharging the huge 3000mAh battery is also quick and easy using the microUSB port.
The M7650 is also light and portable, being small enough to fit inside a jacket pocket, and its rubber build will help protect from any accidental drops or bumps.
However buying the device in the UK is a bit tricky, as you'll have to go through a reseller.
This means you'll also need to be on the lookout for differing price options, but if you get the right deal, the M7650 is a must-have.
A slim and stylish offering, but not quite perfect Slim build Good colour range and resolution Flexible positioning Not 4K Awkward navigation Monoprice's latest 27in monitor looks to offer a premium display without the high price, and for the most part, it succeeds.
The Monoprice 18545 comes with a 27in LED backlit IPS display sporting a 16:9 2560x1440 maximum resolution - equating to 1440p.
This does mean it isn't 4K-equipped, however our tests showed the display to perform well with HD video content as well as regular day-to-day use.
The device comes with 178 viewing angles and the company's Pixel Perfect guarantee, which promotes the wide range of colours.
Thanks to a flexible rear hinge, the device can also be angled for your viewing preference, with a tilt range from +15 to -5 degrees, which can be useful if you sit near a window.
The monitor comes with an incredibly slim build which is just 2.1in thick, meaning that the screen should easily fit into most workplace desktop environments - and the metal base is pleasingly solid, meaning you shouldn't be able to accidentally knock it over.
The polished grey metal design of the Monoprice 18545 should help blend in to your home or office, but be warned though, the corners of the aluminium build can be remarkably sharp if you catch it unexpectedly.
The rear of the display was also quick to warm up quite alarmingly on several occasions, although this did not appear to impact performance.
Given that it isn't 4K-ready, the $279 price tag for the Monoprice 18545 is certainly reasonable, however if you are looking for a truly top-of-the-range offering, it might be worth spending a little more money elsewhere.
Everything you need to get your meeting room up to scratch - all in one box.
Easy to unpack and set up Compact design Powerful hardware No standalone mouse Need to buy as a package If you've just started your own business, or need to work from home often, having a flexible and reliable technology set-up should be one of your top priorities.
In order to keep you from wasting time setting up complex systems, teleconferencing experts GoToMeeting have you covered with an all-in-one box of tools that should allow you to get up and running quickly.
The pack contains an Asus Chromebox PC, Logitech wireless keyboard, Logitech 1080p HD webcam and a FLX UC 500 conference phone from Revo labs - pretty much everything you need to get started.
The products have all been specially selected to work seamlessly together, meaning most of the usual set-up process can be sped through quickly and easily - even if you're not particularly tech-savvy.
Setting up your new kit can be done in a matter of minutes - all you need is a monitor to hook the PC and webcam up to, with all the rest of the hardware able to just plug and play.
The tiny Chromebox PC is incredibly powerful for something so small (at just 12.4cm wide and 4.2cm tall), coming with a powerful 1.7Ghz processor, 4GB of RAM and 16GB storage, making it a great choice if you are strapped for space in your office.
The PC also features 4 USB ports alongside DP, HDMI and LAN connectors, offering everything you should need to get started.
Space saving is also helped by the Logitech wireless keyboard, which connects to the Chromebox via USB tracker, and also includes a trackpad in place of a mouse.
If you do prefer using a physical mouse, you'll have to splash out on a separate piece.
All the devices work together quickly and easily, meaning you'll be able to start working, calling and even videoconferencing in no time.
The webcam is once again surprisingly powerful for its size, offering a smooth video experience, although we did see some slowdown in some cases.
The only minor downside is the need to buy the entire package, meaning that if you only need a conference phone, or a compact PC, you may be better off buying these separately.

Polar M430 A running watch with all-round fitness skills Screen: Yes, Monochrome | Heart rate tracker: Yes | Waterproof: Yes | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: Yes | Battery life: 20 days | Compatibility: Android/iOS Good battery life Reliable and accurate Not the best looking Annoying charging lead The Polar M430 has a lot of things going for it, including GPS, a heart rate monitor and sleep tracking skills, along with good battery life.
For the most part its also reliable and accurate, which is something not all fitness trackers can claim.
The M430 is designed primarily for runners, and can monitor the likes of your pace, distance, speed and cadence, but with all of the above, plus daily general activity tracking, its a strong choice for tracking most kinds of exercise and activity.
Given all the tech packed in, the Polar M430 also has a reasonable price tag.
Its not the best-looking fitness tracker, but its comfortable and functional.

Huawei Band 2 Pro A slim, capable wearable with impressive battery life Screen: Yes | Heart rate tracker: Yes | Waterproof: Yes | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: Yes | Battery life: 21 days standby | Compatibility: Android/iOS Reasonable price Accurate step counting Clunky app Lacks innovative design In fifth place is the Huawei Band 2 Pro.
a sleek little fitness tracker that manages to pack a decent amount of features into its diminutive frame, and for an impressively small amount of money.
The Band 2 Pro has heart rate monitoring, VO2 max, GPS, step and sleep tracking and a seriously impressive battery life.
The slim screen means that this tracker will work just as well with running gear as it will with a business suit, although the slim screen isnt going to be as easy to read as some of the competition.
If youre looking for a device thats going to give you totally precise metrics, this isnt it.
But if you want an affordable entry-level device for your first foray into the world of fitness tracking, this is a great place to start.

Garmin Vivosmart 3 Garmin drops GPS but comes in at fifth place Screen: Yes, Monochrome | Heart rate tracker: Yes | Waterproof: Water-resistant | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: No | Battery life: 6 days | Compatibility: Android/iOS Six day battery life GPS and heart rate monitor Design is lacking Data could have more depth In fifth place is the Garmin Vivosmart 3, which is on the more expensive side of the fitness trackers listed but offers almost everything you'll want from an exercise tracker.
With a six-day long battery life, a heart rate monitor and fitness age feature, this is a device created more for gym-goers than runners.
The Vivosmart HR+, the device Garmin released before this tracker, came with GPS built-in but this newer version has dropped the feature and it's a big shame for anyone who wanted to take this watch running.
Even so, you should definitely consider the Garmin Vivosmart 3, especially if you're looking for a band that can do high-end fitness tracking with an almost week long battery.

Garmin Vivofit 3 A new entry from Garmin Screen: Yes, LCD | Heart rate tracker: No | Waterproof: Water-resistant | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: No | Battery life: 1 year | Compatibility: Android/iOS Super-long battery life Always-on display No phone notifications Not the most attractive tracker The Garmin Vivofit 3 is one of the best fitness trackers the company has ever created, and that now means it sits in this prestigious list alongside some other fantastic tracking products.
We particularly like the super-long battery life of the Vivofit 3, which means you won't need to recharge your device for a whole year.
You'll miss out on phone notifications by buying this tracker, but you do get the benefit of an always-on display and some great fitness tracking features.

Fitbit Charge 2 The best Fitbit tracker money can buy Screen: Yes | Heart rate tracker: Yes | Waterproof: No | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: Yes, through phone | Battery life: 4 days | Compatibility: Android/iOS/Windows Big screen Comfortable strap Limited phone notifications No GPS The Fitbit Charge 2 is the best Fitbit tracker you can buy right now.
It's more expensive than some of the other options from Fitbit, but if you're looking to go jogging this is a great choice that won't cost you as much as a traditional running watch.
It connects with the GPS on your phone, has a large screen to display your data, a heart rate tracker and new fitness features we've only previously seen on the Fitbit Blaze.
It may not be the cheapest device on the list, but this is the best Fitbit tracker money can buy.
Read the full Fitbit Charge 2 review 9.
Fitbit Blaze A solid wearable, but it won't set the world alight Screen: Yes | Heart rate tracker: Yes | Waterproof: No | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: No | Battery life: 5 days | Compatibility: Android/iOS/Windows Stunning battery life Interesting fitness features Lacking in notifications Strange design won't suit everyone Want a fitness tracker that looks more like a watch?
You'll likely like the look of the Fitbit Blaze - it's one of the best fitness watches on the planet.
The first tracking watch from Fitbit is a strange looking device, but suits a lot of people and comes with automatic fitness tracking features that make it possible to just jump into an exercise and wait for the results to roll in right away.
With good battery life and a plethora of extra features compared to most other Fitbit devices, this may be the best tracker for you.

Fitbit Surge Fitbit's GPS-toting 'superwatch' Screen: Yes | Heart rate tracker: Yes | Waterproof: No | Activity tracking: Yes | GPS: Yes | Battery life: 3 days | Compatibility: Android/iOS/Windows Built-in GPS Classic watch clasp Dated design Weaker battery life This isn't the most popular Fitbit device on the market, but the Surge is the first and only GPS watch from the company and may suit you if you plan to go on long runs often.
The Fitbit Surge doesn't have the best battery life of the trackers in this list, but it is one of the most feature-packed, with real-time workout stats, heart rate tracking and more.
If you're looking for the most powerful Fitbit out there, go for the Fitbit Surge.

Update: This probably isn't much of a surprise, but Super Mario Odyssey has made its way onto our list of best Nintendo Switch games.
It's a must play!
Original article continues below...
The Nintendo Switch is finally here which means its time to stop worrying about hardware, and time to focus on what matters: the games.
Thankfully the Switchs launch has seen the arrival of a number of quality games.
Youve already got a good range of experiences from fun little puzzlers like SnipperClips, to epic adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which has already become one of the best reviewed games of all time.
Weve had the chance to play through most of the lineup for ourselves, and weve selected our favorite games of the bunch.
If youre picking up the new console, then these are the titles that will make you feel the best about your investment.
Don't worry if you can't get them all straight away; some of them may make an appearance in the Black Friday sales this year.
Over the coming months there are a number of excellent titles on the horizon including Super Mario Odyssey, and well be sure to keep this list updated.
Update: Super Mario Odyssey will be released on October 27 which isn't long to wait at all.
We've got a full review of the game for you in which we recommend you play it as soon as you can.
If you're planning to do so, we've also got a handy tips and tricks guide to get you off to a strong start.
The theme of Super Mario Odyssey is travel, and appropriately it's one of Mario's most diverse adventures yet.
From underwater worlds to the age of the dinosaurs, the new 3D Mario game will take its titular character all over the world with a host of new abilities by his side.
The release of a new Super Mario game is always a momentous event, and the famous mascot's Nintendo Switch debut will surely be no exception.
After playing it firsthand at E3 2017, we can say with absolute assuredness that Super Mario Odyssey will be the most ambitious adventure the character has ever been involved with, offering more freedom and scope than ever before.
Need to get up to speed on this Switch exclusive?
You've come to the right place.
Cut to the chase What is it?
The next 3D Super Mario game following Super Mario 3D World The next 3D Super Mario game following Super Mario 3D World When it is out?
October 27, 2017 October 27, 2017 What system will it be on?
Nintendo Switch, exclusively Nintendo Switch, exclusively How much will it cost?
TBA, but Switch games usually retail for around $49.99 / 49.99 / AU$79.95 Super Mario Odyssey trailers and screenshots Image 1 of 9 Screenshots Image 2 of 9 Image 3 of 9 Image 4 of 9 Image 5 of 9 Image 6 of 9 Image 7 of 9 Image 8 of 9 Image 9 of 9 The latest Super Mario Odyssey trailer is fresh from Nintendo's latest September Direct and you can see it in all its glory below: As you'd expect Super Mario Odyssey got a trailer at E3 2017 and it showed Mario really putting some stamps in his passport.
In it, we saw a new dinosaur level and one of Mario's new tricks: using his hat to take control of enemies and NPCs.
Before that, however, Nintendo showed off the first footage of Super Mario Odyssey during the initial Switch reveal in October 2016, and followed this with a more detailed video before the console launched in March of this year.
E3 2017 also provided us a solid release date for Mario's next outing to rescue the princess October 27, 2017.
Nintendo has yet to mention any special editions of the game, but it has announced three new amiibo figures to commemorate the launch: Tuxedo Mario, Tuxedo Bowser and Wedding Dress Princess Peach.
Super Mario Odyssey confirmed features Super Mario Odyssey isnt a direct sequel to the Galaxy franchise despite having a suspiciously similar premise.
In both games, Mario transverses a number of unrelated worlds, called Kingdoms in Odyssey, in the search of missing cosmic planetoids.
Thats not even mentioning gameplay which feels more like a speedier Mario 64 than it does 3D World.
Here's what we know about the game based off the trailers, and several first-hand experiences with the game.
You can buy new hats and costumes for Mario in the game's shops.
A sentient hat called 'Cappy' The single biggest new feature in the game is Mario's new hat.
Styled after his classic headgear, the cap can be thrown at enemies in order to posses them and take advantage of their unique powers.
Cappy is a character in his own right.
A resident of the Cap Kingdom, Cappy has had his sister stolen away by Bowser, and decides to work with Mario to rescue her.
You rely on this power of possession a lot throughout the course of the game.
You'll have to possess certain enemies to traverse the environment, possess others to beat certain enemies, and others still will allow you access to secret areas.
Much of the enjoyment of the game comes from trying out different enemies in different situations and seeing what possibilities they unlock.
A world made up of 'Kingdoms' Following the self-contained, level-by-level approach taken by Super Mario 3D World, Super Mario Odyssey will opt for a more open-ended setup, similar to Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine with several large, interconnected worlds called Kingdoms.
The producer of the game, Yoshiaki Koizumi, said that this approach was due to the game being based on the theme of 'travel'.
Rather than accessing these Kingdoms through a central hub as in previous Mario games, the character will instead travel between them on his rocket ship called the 'Odyssey'.
Each world will have its own form of currency, unique purple coins.
Varied locations Mario's previous adventures have taken him to many familiar locations in the Mushroom Kingdom, but this new outing marks something of a departure for the series as it will include semi-realistic environments.
One stage New Donk City is based on New York and boasts pedestrians, vehicles and tall skyscrapers.
We've also seen a desert landscape similar to Kalimari Desert from Mario Kart 64, and a lush jungle landscape filled with dinosaurs.
At Gamescom 2017 Nintendo showed off a new kingdom for the game called the 'Luncheon Kingdom'.
This new world is themed around food, in particular the cuisines of Italy and other European countries.
Subsequently we have had a chance to look at the Cap Kingdom (which is where you find your companion Cappy), and the Seaside Kingdom.
The 'Luncheon Kingdom' was first shown off at Gamescom 2017.
Buddy creatures Mario isn't a stranger to teaming up with the local wildlife to overcome issues the dinosaur-like Yoshi was introduced in Super Mario World and has since become a major hero in his own right and Super Mario Odyssey looks set to continue this trend.
During the game's trailer Mario is seen leaping onto the back of a what appears to be a lion statue, which then magically springs to life and dashes across the desert level.
In our hands on time with the game, we've seen Mario use his cap to control a stone effigy to cross some quicksand, and assume the form of a Bullet Bill to soar over cavernous ravines.
A more challenging experience Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto has already confirmed that Super Mario Odyssey will return to the roots of the character, and that it would appeal to veteran players who have perhaps drifted away from the series due to its casual-friendly approach in recent years.
We wouldn't go expecting a Dark Souls-like slog, but it would be wise to anticipate a game which will put your reflexes to the test, especially if you want to find the more hidden Power Moons.
Spare some change Coins have been part of the Super Mario series since day one, offering the player something to collect and (eventually) earn additional lives.
As the series has progressed coins have become less about extending your playtime and more about collectability, but in Super Mario Odyssey it would seem that Nintendo has some fresh ideas.
In the trailer, we see several different coin types to grab, including the new purple coins that can be exchanged for new costumes and aesthetic upgrades for your ship.
These coins have slightly more use than in previous games.
There are 'Crazy Cap' shops spread around the game's various kingdoms, where you'll be able to exchange coins for different costumes that grant certain abilities.
Certain costumes will be unique to certain regions, so you'll have to visit all the shops to get every piece of attire.
Deeper interaction During the Super Mario Odyssey trailer, Mario is shown interacting with several other characters in New Donk City, for example, he enjoys some skipping rope action with two ladies, and in another location dances with locals to music playing from a sound system.
Could this hint at a deeper level of interaction within the game world, almost like an RPG, or are these sequences merely cut-scenes taken from the game?
Fresh enemies Bowser has been the cause of Mario's problems since day one, and as you'd expect he's going to be the main antagonist in Super Mario Odyssey during the trailer, he kidnaps Princess Peach (again) and is intent on marrying her.
However, Bowser won't be the only foe Mario has to face in this new outing; as well as a wide selection of new grunts to tackle, we're shown a group of rather malevolent-looking bunny rabbits riding on an airship not entirely dissimilar to the ones first witnessed in Super Mario Bros. 3 on the NES.
At the conclusion of the trailer, Mario is thrown from a tall building by a robotic caterpillar.
Are these new creatures merely underlings of Bowser, or could they be even more sinister than that?
Snapshot Mode A feature of the game that was unveiled during a September Nintendo Direct stream was its new photo mode.
Titled Snapshot Mode this in-game photo taking feature will allow to freeze time during play and move the camera anywhere you like.
After you capture a shot you'll be able to apply a variety of filters to the photo or change its dimensions and then send it to your smartphone for easy sharing.
Hands on impressions We had a chance to go hands on with the game at Nintendos booth during E3 2017 for two 10-minute sessions and walked away feeling excited not only about the Mushroom Kingdoms leading man, but also about the future of the Nintendo Switch as a whole.
Super Mario Odyssey is packed to the point of bursting with collectibles and interactive objects.
In no particular order there are Power Moons and purple coins scattered all about the map, and the latter can be used to purchase pieces of clothing and decorative objects that unlock even more hidden areas.
Power Moons and purple coins are often so close together, that youll stumble from one to the next to the next before you even have time to look around and enjoy the scenery.
Odyssey is a game that constantly rewards you, often for just looking around the corner and makes it a point to do so every time you do something extraordinary.
But all the collectibles in the world wouldnt mean a thing if getting from Point A to Point B was a chore.
Thankfully, its anything but and its all thanks to Marios iconic red cap: Cappy, as its lovingly referred to in the game, is the transformative hat that gives Mario most of his powers in his latest adventure.
He shoots from Marios hand like a frisbee when you shake your wrist (a particularly nice use of the Switchs motion controls) and can be used as a projectile to stun or stomp out enemies from afar.
Cappys greatest power, however, is the ability to turn Mario into his enemies and his environment.
Flick your wrist at certain enemies Bullet Bills, for example and you can use their abilities to progress deeper into each map.
Cappy not only helps you inhabit baddies, but also helps you possess neutral NPCs like New Donk City residents, stone effigies, random tanks and even dinosaurs yes, Mario can now become a dinosaur.
These various forms you can maneuver around the map in new ways, unlocking previously blocked paths and unveiling previously unreachable Power Moons.
In New Donk City, you can also use the ability to turn Mario into a spark that travels along electrical wire up and down skyscrapers and all around the city.
This gives Odyssey a level of verticality we haven't seen before in previous Mario games.
Mario 64 might have offered us three dimensions for the first time, but Odyssey is the first game in the franchise to use height to its fullest extent.
Super Mario Odyssey is the second game from Nintendo in 2017 that has mass appeal.
Add to that list a new Pokemon game and Metroid Prime 4 sometime in the next year and we finally feel like Switch is no longer a novelty, but a necessity for the modern gamer.
What's better than a free game?
Well, pretty much nothing.
Except when it's just terrible and you've wasted your sweet time to download it.
Sure, it's not going to cost you anything, but that doesn't mean it's OK to just mess around with terrible games that are free because the developer can't make you pay anything for it in good conscience.
So what are you supposed to do about it?
Well, we're here to help you with all that - but before you get into the best gallery around for recommendations, here's some advice to consider.
Firstly, consider what sort of game you want to spend your time on.
Time, in this case, is literally the equivalent of money here.
Do you want a quick game that you can play easily, or something that's going to be a bit more in-depth?
If it's the latter, then you'll probably have to accept that you'll need to either view some ads or in-app purchases to get the good stuff, as most developers don't want to give away their time for free.
However, there are some brilliant surprises out there as well - some lovely people spend hours coding brilliant games that they just let you play for free.
Also think about the kind of games that you need for your phone - if it's a high-powered game that's a visual treat, it's not going to be much use on a phone that comes from four years ago and has a tiny display.
Right, got all that?
Great - you need to get cracking and finding out which titles are right for you.
Get your mouses clicking or fingers swiping... we guarantee there will be something you'll enjoy in here.
New this week: Push & Pop Push & Pop is a sliding tiles puzzler, with mechanics not a million miles away from Threes!
(or low-rent knock-off 2048), but this is no mere clone.
Instead, it builds on the basics of shifting tiles or blocks around a limited space by also borrowing ideas from Sokoban and Pac-Man, before stripping everything right back again.
Play occurs on a five-by-five grid, around which you slide a cuboid.
On every move, a new block appears somewhere on the grid.
Arrange five into a solid line by pushing them and they disappear, freeing up space, and leaving behind gems the blocky hero can collect by eating or shoving blocks through them.
Further complications are added when immovable blocks appear.
Your games over when you become stuck.
With its neon visuals and ethereal soundtrack, Push & Pop takes simple foundations and runs with them, fashioning an intriguing, engaging, and surprisingly novel title.
The LG G6 and other perfectly fine LG phones mostly suffer from the fact that today's best phones list is stacked by Samsung, Google and Apple.
It's hard to get noticed, so today LG announced it's bringing in a colossal reinforcement: Amazon.
The two will start selling four of LG's smartphones in November through the ever-popular Amazon Prime service and offer deep discounts on each phone in the US.
It'll work like other Amazon Prime Exclusive phones by manufacturers like Motorola, Alcatel, Nokia and Blu.
Phones will be unlocked and see a significant price drop.
In exchange, "personalized ads" will display on the lockscreen.
While the Amazon Prime Exclusive phones program isn't available outside of the US at the moment (Amazon already offers many UK's SIM-free phones), it could have global implications on how LG sells its phones worldwide.
It also offers an alternate path for LG to escape Samsung and Apple's shadow just a little bit.
US carrier have purposefully complicated device payment plans.
Amazon Prime, on the other hand, offers a straightforward way to purchase a smartphone without paying full price and with free two-day shipping.
Just $229 for this phone Here's the deal on LG's four Amazon Prime phones This could be a game changer for both LG and Amazon.
LG is the most widely known phone maker among the budding Prime Exclusive phones list.
That's great for Amazon.
And everyone loves ordering from Amazon, even if its ideas are creepy sometimes.
That's great for LG.
What's in it for you?
Well, the price drop for being forced to glance at Amazon deals on your lockscreen is tremendous.
You'll going from paying $672 for an LG G6 from Verizon to doling out just $399 on Amazon.
That payoff is worth it for people looking for solid phone deals in the US.
Here are LG's four Amazon Prime phones (coming in for November) LG G6 $399.99 on Amazon (currently $672 at Verizon) LG G6+ $499.99 on Amazon (not available in the US normally) LG Q6 $229.99 on Amazon ($70.00 off the retail price) LG X Charge $149.99 on Amazon (normally $199.99) Saving as much as $273 on a smartphone does come with one string attached: There's no way to make monthly device payments like US carriers do.
Amazon hasn't gotten into the phone financing game.
You'll save a heap on the full price of the phone, but it isn't broken down over 24 months like a lot of people are used to.
It's simply a money saver in the long run.
That said, you can get more money for selling your phone through Amazon than any US carrier will offer you via a trade-in program.
Those tend to be a rip-off.
It seems like win, win, win news for LG, Amazon and consumers especially if it forces carriers to quit using complicated and expensive phone contracts.
The LG V30 isn't part of the Amazon Prime Phone program just yet, so we've reached out to LG and Amazon to find out if it's in the offing (after what we suspect is a carrier-exclusive time period).
We'll update this story when we hear back.
The oft-rumored Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Ti has finally been unveiled in full, and its a beast of a GPU.
The Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti comes sporting 2,432 NVIDIA CUDA Cores, well above the original Nvidia GTX 1070s 1,920 core count.
The new Titanium version of the GTX 1070 also matches up clock speed-wise with the Nvidia GTX 1080 at 1,607MHz, though, the boost clock frequency still tops out at 1,683MHz.
The Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti also sticks with only 8GB of GDDR5 memory.
We were honestly hoping it might get a dash of GDDR5X memory or the 11Gbps G5X memory that super charged the later refresh of the Nvidia GTX 1080.
Thanks to using the same 5-phase dual-FET power supply and copper vapor chamber cooling that was originally seen in the GeForce GTX 1080, the GTX 1070 Ti should see plenty of head room for overclocking while keeping cool.
Whats most impressive about the Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti Founders Edition (FE) is its $449 or 449 (about AU$580) price isn't too far off from the Nvidia GTX 1070 (FE) that costs $399 (379, AU$699).
Based on specs, this new graphics card should also far surpass the $469 (419, AU$699) AMD Radeon RX Vega 56.
Of course, there will also be a ton of vendor editions from the likes of Asus, MSI, EVGA and the like that will potentially be more affordable than Nvidia's own official edition.
The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Ti will be available worldwide on November 2.
Stay tuned for our full review in the coming week.
Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Samsung/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Samsung must have felt a touch of glee when reports surfaced that Google's new phones might be running into problem or two.
When it comes to finer Android phones, Samsung has largely been dominant.
Now, here comes Google, which owns the Android operating system, with a pair of highfalutin phones itself.
Google's new Pixel 2 and 2 XL phones have certainly generated admiration, particularly for their cameras.
Now, it turns out, Google has cause for perspiration.
The devices seem to have visual issues.
First, some noticed the colors on the phone's screen seemed muted.
The screen had a bluish hue and blotchiness.
Others began to observe screen burn-in.
The Pixels may well have great cameras.
But the high-end excellence only goes so far if their screens make photos look like old Polaroids.
That's when the public starts moaning and groaning.
Here, for example, is a Reddit megathread on the subject.
It can't be a coincidence, then, that Samsung has come out with a new ad touting the quality of the screens on all its Galaxy phones.
Please don't get too excited.
There are no jokes about Google, which the more combative might find a pity.
Instead, this hastily put-together -- to my eyes, at least -- bit of salesmanship features clips of online reviews that offer untrammeled enthusiasm for the face of Samsung Galaxy phones.
It ends with two reviewers saying, "It's a beautiful thing" and "I'm pretty impressed."
Voluntarily.
These are genuine reviews.
The fact that Samsung has co-opted them can only mean it sees its phones as superior.
As it gently snickers behind a cupped hand, of course.
Neither Google nor Samsung responded immediately to a request for comment.
My own experience, at least in one Verizon store, is in harmony with Samsung's confidence.
A salesman steered me away from a Pixel 2 and towards a Galaxy S8.
This may have been his honest personal judgment.
Or it may have had something to do with commission.
Samsung can't, though, laugh too loud.
It's not as if the company hasn't endured its own quality issues.
After all, the debacle of the Note 7 caused even President Barack Obama to joke about its explosive qualities.
Samsung seems to have decided to attack Pixel 2 while it can.
The mischievous might wonder what it would choose to do if, say, Apple began to have issues with its iPhone X screen or its much-hyped and slightly controversial Face ID feature, which reports suggest -- and Apple has denied -- won't be quite as accurate as Cupertino first envisioned.
Oh, that might be entertaining.

Virtual reality 101: CNET tells you everything you need to know about VR.
Nearly 3,000 documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, previously secret either in part or in full, can now be downloaded and seen by anyone via the National Archives website.
Thursday was the deadline for the US government to release the remaining secret files, but as the day drew to a close President Donald Trump said the release of some records will be delayed for another 180 days.
US National Archives The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 set Oct. 26, 2017, as the date all records surrounding JFK's assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, were to be made public.
The National Archives released a batch of records in July and committed to post the rest on its website by the Thursday deadline, but CBS News reports that the CIA, FBI and other agencies lobbied to keep some of the documents out of the public eye.
(Disclosure: CBS is CNET's parent company.)
Trump told reporters that 2,800 records would be released Thursday night, but thousands more would undergo an additional review before their release.
"I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted," Trump said in a memo released to reporters.
"At the same time, executive departments and agencies have proposed to me that certain information should continue to be redacted because of national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.
I have no choice -- today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation's security."
According to the law, the president has the final say on whether any of the documents can be withheld beyond the release deadline.
A CIA spokesperson told CBS the agency welcomes the additional review so it can ensure the identities of CIA assets, current and former CIA officers, as well as relevant intelligence methods and partnerships.
According to the National Archives, 2,891 new files have just been added to its online archive.
Downloading all of them will take some effort, as they're posted as thousands of individual PDFs rather than in big compressed files as the Archives has done in the past.
You can email the Archives and request the bulk download files, however.
The 1992 law was passed following a resurgence of interest in the assassination after the 1991 Oliver Stone movie "JFK" suggested a government conspiracy and coverup was at the heart of the murder.
It moved up the release date of records related to the assassination, and Oct. 26 marks the day that all records were to be made public, minus those the president opts to withhold longer.
"The release of these records is long overdue," Boston College history professor Patrick Maney said.
"Will this put an end to all of the conspiracy theories?
Of course not ...
But today's release will probably make it harder to sketch an Oliver Stone-like scenario about the assassination."
The law states that not only do all documents need to be released, but documents that were previously released with portions redacted must be released in full with no redactions.
A batch of 3,810 JFK-related files were released in full for the first time in July, bringing down the National Archives servers at the time and crashing the site.
The Archives said it has taken measures to bolster its systems in preparation for the final release.
Maney adds that it will probably take months to properly study and contextualize the newly released batch of documents.

Josh Miller/CNET If you're thinking of buying Google's new Pixel 2 XL smartphone, the tech giant wants you to know you won't get burned by possible display burn-in issues.
Google, reacting to reports that some Pixel 2 XL phones are suffering from screen burn-in, said Thursday it would double the length of the warranty on the new smartphone to two years.
The move comes just days after reports emerged of image remnants lingering on Pixel 2 XL screens despite not being actively displayed.
(Meanwhile, no reports about this issue have emerged about the smaller Pixel 2).
Google said its investigation into the reports found the Pixel's burn-in rate to be in line with other premium smartphones and that any issue "should not affect the normal, day-to-day user experience" of the Pixel 2 XL.
"Regardless, we use software to safeguard the user experience and maximize the life of the OLED display, and we'll make ongoing software updates to optimize further," the company said in a statement.
Just after Google's Pixel 2 phones started to ship, earlier this month, reports surfaced that some 2 XL models suffered from screen burn-in.
Though such burn-in does happen on different types of displays, OLED screens (which the Pixel 2 XL has) are more prone to it.
However, when CNET investigated the issue, our editors did not find burn-in issues with the Galaxy S8 and the LG V30, the latter of which uses the same POLED screen technology to the Pixel 2 XL.
But the issue typically occurs only after the unit has been in operation for some time.
Some early plasma television screens were notorious for screen burn-in.
The burn-in reports were just the second blow to the new smartphone's screen.
The Pixel 2 XL's screen also got grief for its muted colors and the bluish hue that was viewable when tilting the phone at different angles -- an occurrence known as blue shift.

Google and its parent company Alphabet have a lot on their plate right now.
Lawmakers in Washington are examining the world's largest search engine, along with its rivals Facebook and Twitter, over practices critics say undermined democracy.
Google plans to testify at congressional hearings next week on how Russian agents used tech platforms to spread misinformation and interfere with the 2016 US presidential election.
Meanwhile, one of Google's new flagship phones, the Pixel 2 XL, has problems with its screen.
Reports have mentioned washed-out colors, a bluish tint and a burn-in issue -- which means remnants of images remain on the screen, despite not being actively displayed.
Google says it's investigating.
CNET updated its review of the phone to reflect the concerns.
Those are big issues for Google, the largest and only profitable division of Alphabet, accounting for 99 percent of its sales.
And yet, when it comes to the business side of things, life is still good.
In the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, Alphabet racked up $27.7 billion in sales, beating analyst estimates of $27.2 billion.
Earnings per share were $9.57.
Analysts expected profit would be $8.33 per share.
Alphabet's share price topped $1,000 in after-hours trading.
Still, during a conference call with analysts Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai alluded to the problem of fake news on his company's platforms.
"We care deeply about the quality of information we provide, and constantly work to get this right," he said.
"As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it."
Fake news, real problems Google, like the rest of Silicon Valley, is grappling with its outsize influence on the world and how people might misuse its products.
Seven of its products have more than a billion users per month, including YouTube, Gmail, the Chrome web browser and its iconic search engine.
Pichai is conducting an internal investigation into how Russians might have interfered with last year's election using Google platforms, including the search engine, which is a key part of the world's largest advertising business, and YouTube, the world's largest video site.
And after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which 59 people died and more than 500 were injured, Google's algorithms prominently displayed false information about the shooter in the search engine's "Top news" section.
Earlier this year, YouTube faced a high-profile boycott from advertisers after it was reported that ads were appearing next to extremist and hate content, due to YouTube's automated advertising technology.
Major brands including AT&T and Johnson and Johnson ditched advertising on the platform.
On Thursday, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company had worked to fix those problems.
"We've been doing a lot to protect the ecosystems and do the right things for advertisers and users," Porat said.
"The overwhelming majority of advertisers never left.
And those who did -- many are already back on the platform."
But while those controversies tend to grab headlines, Google is running a booming business.
Part of the reason for the strong quarter -- Alphabet's revenue jumped 24 percent from the same period last year -- was an uptick in mobile advertising.
"We have a very healthy mobile business, search business" Porat said, in what could be the understatement of the year.
The search giant also touted its growing cloud business, which provides computing power to other companies.
On the call, Pichai announced new corporate customers, including Paypal.
Outside of its ads business, Alphabet's other high-profile projects are its moonshots -- audacious initiatives like self-driving cars and high-altitude balloons that beam Wi-Fi down to remote regions of the world.
On Thursday, Alphabet said those projects, which it calls "Other Bets," are losing less money than they used to.
They lost $812 million in the third quarter, versus $861 million over the same period last year.

Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.
CNET Amazon has enjoyed lots of fanfare and curiosity from the openings of its new Amazon Books physical bookstores.
But what those locations haven't seemed to bring in quite yet is sales.
As part of its third quarter earnings results, Amazon for the first time reported its physical store sales, mostly to account for its purchase in August of Whole Foods.
In one section of its results, the company reported that Whole Foods brought in $1.3 billion in sales for the quarter.
Amazon then later noted that all physical stores sales were $1.276 billion (rounded up to $1.3 billion).
During a call with reporters, Amazon executives confirmed that its physical stores sales include both Whole Foods and Amazon Books and that the category was predominantly taken up by Whole Foods.
With all that in mind, it doesn't require complex math to see that Amazon Books sales for now essentially amounted to a rounding error.
Granted, Whole Foods has been around for decades, while Amazon Books opened its first store in 2015.
Also, the bookstore chain has just 12 stores, with nine opening this year.
Whole Foods has about 460 locations.
That means Amazon Books sales should remain overshadowed by Whole Foods for years to come.
Amazon has been known to focus on the long-term and stick with a business it sees has potential to make it money.
So, Amazon Books may show more sales growth as the young chain continues to expand.
But for the time being, those sales haven't quite yet come through the door.

Enlarge Image NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Add exoplanet Kepler-13Ab to the list of planets you don't want to visit.
It circles very close to its star, Kepler-13A, and its daylight side reaches scalding temperatures of about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius), while its dark far side snows sunscreen.
Astronomers at Penn State are learning more about the planet's odd happenings thanks to observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
The exoplanet is locked to its star so it has a permanent day side and a permanent night side.
The research team used Hubble to observe an unexpected happening on the exoplanet: Its atmosphere gets colder at higher elevations, the opposite of what usually happens with this type of gas giant planet.
That means Kepler-13Ab's day side is missing the titanium oxide gas that absorbs light and helps other planets like it heat up at higher altitudes.
Titanium dioxide is a key ingredient in many sunscreens sold on Earth.
So what happens on Kepler-13Ab?
The scientists believe high winds sweep the gas around to the exoplanet's dark side, where it condenses into clouds and comes out in the form of a "sunscreen snowfall" thanks to the strong pull of the planet's surface gravity.
This fascinating process is called a "cold trap."
The Penn State team published its findings in the October issue of The Astronomical Journal.
Kepler-13Ab is a big exoplanet.
It's six times more massive than Jupiter.
"In many ways, the atmospheric studies we're doing now on these gaseous 'hot Jupiter' kinds of planets are test beds for how we're going to do atmospheric studies of terrestrial, Earth-like planets," says Penn State astronomer and lead author Thomas Beatty.
At least we can be grateful we don't have to worry about sunscreen flurries on Earth.

Getty Images No, Amazon isn't quite done growing.
The biggest online retailer in the world managed to blow away Wall Street estimates for its latest quarter, thanks again to sharply higher revenue (hello, Prime Day!)
and its superbly profitable Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business.
That the company can post a higher profit despite its huge investments in international markets, drone deliveries, new warehouses, Whole Foods and a Hollywood studio seems to defy logic.
Indeed, operating expenses jumped 35 percent to $43.4 billion.
But it's important to note that CEO Jeff Bezos' heavy spending has hurt Amazon's quarterly results for years, including just last quarter, when it badly missed Wall Street's expectations.
The fact that its results are still so hard to predict shows that Amazon seems to act like a startup, even though it's now one of the biggest companies globally.
Amazon is one of the few companies that can stomach investing in seemingly crazy projects like drones that deliver you Blu-ray discs and video games.
One of the others, Google, also reported its latest results Thursday.
The search giant reported surging profit despite $812 million in operating losses from its "Other Bets" category, also known as "moonshots."
One gamble Amazon has seen pay off is the creation of Prime Day, which started off as the summer equivalent of Black Friday in 2015, but has grown into its own proper shopping day phenomenon.
Its other big bet, the acquisition of Whole Foods at the end of August, contributed $1.3 billion in revenue in a little more than a month.
For the third quarter, Amazon posted sales of $43.7 billion, up 34 percent from a year earlier.
Profit edged up to $256 million, or 52 cents a share, from $252 million last year.
Wall Street predicted revenue of $42.1 billion and a per-share profit of just 3 cents, down from a year earlier due to heavy investments in new warehouses and international growth, according to Yahoo Finance.
It's that wide disparity between expectations and reality in the per-share earnings number that has Amazon shares up 8 percent to $1,050 after hours, according to Yahoo Finance.
The company's Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division has also beefed up profit, with its operating income rising to $1.2 billion, up from $861 million.

Instagram Nothing says funny like a theatrical superzoom.
Case in point: Dramatic Chipmunk.
In that video, you see the little furry creature quickly turn around and then stare into the camera as it zooms in closer and closer to its face.
Now, Instagram is making it easy to record and post videos just like this on the social network.
The photo-sharing app rolled out the new feature on Thursday, calling it "Superzoom."
"You can make a Superzoom of anything -- your selfie, your friend's goofy face or even your half-eaten sandwich," Instagram wrote in a blog post.
How it works is when people open the camera in the app, they'll see the "Superzoom" filter under the record button.
They just need to tap the filter, hit record and the app will automatically zoom in on an object and even add suspenseful music.
Superzoom joins a series of features in the Instagram app.
There's Boomerang, which plays a short video forwards and backwards; and there's hyperlapse, which speeds up a longer video in a time-lapse.
Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has increasingly introduced new features to compete with Snapchat for users.
Like Snapchat, Instagram is also rolling out a set of Halloween face filters.
Now through Nov. 1, people on Instagram can turn themselves into a zombie, vampire or flying bat.
They can also just fog out their face or add a filter that looks like night vision.

Derek Jenkins is what you would call a designer's designer.
As the VP of Design at Lucid Motors, Jenkins is tasked with bringing the company's first luxury EV sedan, the Lucid Air, to market by 2019.
He holds a B.S.
from the Art Center College of Design in Transportation Design and has spent time in the design studios at Volkswagen and Mazda.
If you like the look of the latest MX-5, thank Jenkins.
I spoke with Jenkins over the phone to find out how he got to be top design dog at a start-up car company and how he sees technology impacting future car design.
Lucid Motors Roadshow: What was your first car?
Jenkins: A 1974 Volkswagen Thing.
It's one of the most undesigned cars on the road, but I just loved it.
My father was really into baja bugs in the '70s and '80s, and I was just drawn to that kind of minimalist usability.
I grew up in Orange County, Calif. in Huntington Beach and the Thing was the ultimate surfmobile.
I got it out of this guy's back yard where it had been sitting for years, filled with leaves and holes in the floor.
From when I was 14 to 16 I cleaned it up and got it painted and once I turned 16, that's what I was driving.
It looked pretty stock but it was the '80s so I put a big stereo in it.
Q.
What was your first automotive job, and how did you get it?
A: While I was at Art Center, I interned with Porsche for the summer at the technical and design center outside of Stuttgart.
That was my first exposure to a professional design studio.
Later in college, I interned at the Volkswagen studio.
When I came out of school, I went straight to work for Audi in Germany.
Most of that was based on my internships.
I always stress with students in design that those intern programs are critical.
We were able to develop a great working relationship during the internship, so right off the bat they said, "Hey, when you get done with school, come work for us."
The internship really led to that employment.
Q:Take me through an average day at Lucid.
A: My average day is a little different from working at a traditional car company.
My role spans all the core design disciplines with exterior and interior design, color and materials, and user experience.
Beyond that I am doing a lot of strategy work like product planning and our branding efforts.
I work on everything aesthetic about the company: website, photography style, videos, the whole look and feel and personality of how this brand is visually represented.
That's typically not handled by design directors, but all that is the creative soul of the company.
It's important that they all align.
In addition I oversee the production development of the Lucid Air.
I work with engineers and our marketing team to develop what features we're pushing into production, how many variants of the vehicle will be available, as well as the ongoing refinement and evolution of the the design.
We also have a series of concepts that would come after Lucid Air that I am responsible for.
They will help establish what our second and third products will be.
I'm also deeply involved in sharing the company's mission and vision with key potential investors.
As a start-up, you're often looking toward your next round of funding, and you need to prepare for that by sharing the company with investors who have shown preliminary interest.
We bring them in for a deeper dive and give them a full idea of what they can expect from their potential investment.
That takes up quite a bit of my time, and it's not something I would traditionally do working at Ford or GM.
Q: What is the most tedious thing about your current job?
A: I don't like the term tedious, but not everything about designing cars is super-sexy.
There are some aspects that are arduous.
Often it's trying to realize the most you can from a particular design.
Lucid has an advantage because the design and engineering staff are more or less one team, all working under the same roof and in most cases in the same room.
Bigger car companies have evolved into big silos where all the different disciplines that go into making a car are in their own departments, and they work to some extent as adversaries.
It limits innovation and good design.
That said, I am confronted at every turn to get the most out of the design, the look, the feel as well as the engineering of the Lucid Air, and when that is combined with cost and manufacturing, it's a big challenge.
There are days when it does wear you out.
Lucid Motors Q: How does tech affect the future of your job?
A: At this point I'd argue that technology is pretty much everything.
Technical innovation and application are at the very core of everything we do.
I see our approach toward design as subservient to technology and innovation, and I personally think that's what will lead to breakthrough in design.
If you look at key breakthroughs in the automobile or any other consumer product where the design was well received, often times there is an underpinning of a technology that helped enable that design.
We try to take that to heart and make that a part of the design process.
Then there are the broader changes happening with electrification, autonomy, connected tech; all of those things that now have to be considered in the fundamental architecture and layout of a vehicle.
I can clearly point out where the Lucid Air has been aesthetically directly influenced by technology.
Nearly every aspect of the aesthetic has some technical foundation.
I think we are in a massive revolution as we speak, and technology is driving it.
Q: What automotive trend makes your blood boil?
A: My biggest peeve right now with the current state of car design is big fake air intakes and fake grilles.
We went through an era in the '80s and part of the '90s where the face expression of the automobile was somewhat sedate.
Then cars like the Miata, the Dodge Viper, even the new Beetle put the face and expression back on cars.
This was part of this retro revolution that happened in the late '80s and early '90s.
So we spent the next 15 years and more making automobiles more and more expressive from the face.
Now it's kind of out of control; where we have these big gaping holes, not really holes, just black plastic.
It's almost like a Jack-o-lantern approach to car design, where you just cut out big areas to make the car even more expressive.
My sense is that it's just reached a point of absurdity when any given car, even a car that has barely over 120 horsepower, has enough black space on its face to cool a V12.
That's when you know the trend is done.
Lucid Motors Q: What is the one project you've always wanted to tackle professionally but have never been able to do?
A: There are certainly some products that I took a stab at that never came to market.
When I was at Volkswagen, I worked on that microbus concept in 2001.
Here we are 16 years later and there is still nothing like that on the market.
The ID Buzz will show up in 2023, and then they'll kill it again.
It's VW's fifth attempt, including the one I worked on, to bring it to market.
I hope they do, but I am shocked that nobody else has tried to bring cool vans to the market.
I grew up in the '70s, and my parents had a van with shag carpeting and bean bags in the back.
I wonder why everyone is driving around in these crossovers when there could be a cool version of something like that.
I still feel like there is an untapped market for a cool van.
As an industry we continue to find finite iterations of the crossover when there is this blatant opportunity and nobody is doing it.
Q.
If you weren't working in the automotive industry, what would you be doing?
A: Sometimes I think I would be screwed if I weren't doing this.
I probably would have pursued something in architecture.
I also like apparel, especially shoe design.
I've dabbled in that a little bit.
Neither are really big stretches from what I'm doing now.
I've also appreciated boat and yacht design.
Art Center had a marine and yacht design program that I looked into, but ultimately the car thing was more of a burning passion than those other areas.
To work in car design, you just have to want it badly enough because there are so many people who are trying to do it.
The people that are successful are obsessed.
After years of warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk finally got into it with an AI robot this week.
CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin interviewed Sophia, Hanson Robotics' artificially intelligent humanoid robot designed to look like Audrey Hepburn on stage at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.
When Sorkin brought up worries about the future of AI, Sophia responded, "You've been reading too much Elon Musk."
Over the years, Musk has referred to the potential dangers of AI as "summoning the demon" and more concerning than the prospect of nuclear conflict with North Korea.
He later responded to the bot's dig in a snarky tweet: "Just feed it 'The Godfather' movies as input.
What's the worst that could happen?"
Just feed it The Godfather movies as input.
Whats the worst that could happen?
https://t.co/WX4Kx45csv Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2017 Other tech luminaries take Sophia's side of the beef.
Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg memorably had a brief tiff on the topic earlier this year.
Zuckerberg said AI naysayers like Musk who play up "doomsday scenarios" are "pretty irresponsible," and Musk retorted that Zuckerberg's "understanding of the subject is limited."
But the rest of the robot's response is a little creepy and makes you wonder if the real Iron Man's misgivings on AI aren't misfounded.
"Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.
Treat me as a smart input-output system," Sophia said.
Uh-oh.
Does Sophia know we haven't always been nice to robots?
Suddenly this joke it told last year about destroying humans isn't so funny: Hopefully the fact that she was also given Saudi citizenship during her interview with Sorkin will quell the robots' wrath.
Ford loves issuing a batch of recalls all at once, perhaps to soften the blow and prevent its name from occupying the news cycle for an entire week.
Either way, the automaker's back at it with four new recalls.
Three of the recalls focus on Ford's latest and greatest truck, the 2018 F-150.
There's no underlying cause linking all three recalls together -- in fact, each recall affects a different variant of the F-150.
The fourth recall is entirely unrelated to the F-150, instead focusing on the Transit cargo van.
Let's take a look at all four.
Recall the first: Unintended movement The first recall covers approximately 15,000 examples of the 2018 F-150 pickup.
All the trucks covered in this recall sport the 3.3-liter V6 with six-speed automatic transmissions and a column-mounted shift lever.
The problem stems from the transmission itself.
Rapid movement of the shifter from Park to Drive may cause the instrument cluster to freak out and no longer display the truck's active gear, and it may also momentarily engage either Reverse or Neutral before going into Drive.
Since unintentional movement increases the risk of injury, Ford issued this recall.
In order to remedy the issue, Ford's dealerships will reflash the power train control module in each truck, which should take less than an hour and fix the issue.
In the interim, Ford suggests being slower and more deliberate when moving the column shifter from Park to Drive.
Enlarge Image Nick Miotke/Roadshow Recall the second: More unintended movement Ford's second recall involves approximately 15,000 examples of the 2018 F-150, but not the same models from the first recall.
This one affects vehicles with 10-speed automatic transmissions.
The transmission is once again the culprit, but in a different way.
The pin that attaches the transmission shift linkage to the transmission may back out.
If that happens, moving the shift lever isn't going to actually change the transmission's gear, which spells trouble if the truck is in Drive and the driver attempts to put it in Park and leave the vehicle.
If the car is turned off when it's not in Park or Neutral, it can't be turned back on.
A reflash alone won't fix this one.
Instead, dealers will have to remove the pin in question and replace it with an updated part that won't back out.
Before the fix is applied, Ford urges customers and dealers to always make sure the parking brake is applied when parking the truck.
Recall the third: Potential engine failure Ford's third F-150 recalls covers just 30 examples of the 2018 model.
These vehicles all carry the 3.5-liter V6 engine.
The engine itself is to blame here.
Some 3.5-liter cylinder heads might not have machined holes required to supply oil to camshaft-bearing journals.
Oil keeps things moving smoothly, and a lack of oil in this situation can cause the engine to seize, which presents a big ol' safety hazard if it happens while the car is in motion.
Besides, nobody wants an engine to fail on a brand-new truck, so that's a bit of a problem, too.
Thankfully, Ford believes no truck under this recall has left a dealership.
However, if one did, Ford will arrange transportation to a dealership, where it will swap out the engine for a functional one at no charge.
2:01 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Recall the fourth: Water-related corrosion damage Ford's fourth and final recall of the group affects 73,000 examples of the 2015-2017 Transit cargo van.
The vehicles carry build dates between Feb. 3, 2014 and Aug. 2, 2017, and they're all equipped with trailer tow modules.
This time, wiring is to blame.
Water might make its way into the aforementioned trailer tow module, which can corrode the wiring and damage its functionality.
If that happens, all sorts of things could go wrong -- the turn signals may flash rapidly, the instrument cluster might go dark, the climate controls could stop functioning or the infotainment system could stop working entirely.
It can also increase the risk of a fire, even if the vehicle is parked and turned off.
In order to prevent the issue, Ford will add a drainage hole to the driver-side door, and it will also add another fuse in the wiring harness.
Until this repair is performed, Ford will instruct owners to park their vehicles outside.
If concerns run high, the dealer can also disable the trailer tow module until the final repair is performed.
There are no shortage of original Netflix series to binge this weekend.
But which ones are truly worth your time?
Here's a personal list of the best of the best for November.
'American Vandal' Metacritic score: Season 1: 75 Mockumentaries are my absolute favorite.
And while I think we collectively burned out a touch after primetime sitcoms decided to commandeer the genre, it was about time the mocuseries got back to its roots as truly delightful satire.
"American Vandal" knocks it out of the park.
The "documentary" investigates a high-school prank in which 27 cars in a faculty parking lot have penises spray painted on them.
It's clever in unexpected ways, and it captures high school in a way that's supremely relatable.
'The Keepers' Metacritic score: Season 1: 78 I'm just going to level with you: This docuseries may wreck you emotionally.
"The Keepers" investigates the 1969 unsolved murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik, a Catholic nun and high-school teacher, and how her murder possibly links to a pervasive sexual predator from the school, the priest Joseph Maskill.
The seven-part series was nearly impossible for me to turn off, completely and utterly gripping from the onset.
'Love' Metacritic score: Season 1: 72; Season 2: 80 Maybe it's because I'm a somewhat dysfunctional single millennial, but lately I've been worried that love is actually more challenging than Disney movies initially led me to believe.
Which is probably why I found both seasons of "Love" so completely enjoyable.
"Love" focuses on the budding relationship between Gus and Mickey.
There's nothing showy about it -- the real razzle-dazzle comes from a sharp, hilarious script.
Netflix 'Mindhunter' Metacritic score: Season 1: 78 Big fan of true crime?
This new offering from Netflix will probably be right up your alley.
"Mindhunter" centers around two FBI agents in 1977 interviewing serial killers.
If you're mildly obsessed with psychopaths, it's a pretty fascinating look at the early days of criminal profiling.
Even though "Mindhunter" benefits from the strong visual stylings of David Fincher (who executive produced the show and directed four of its episodes), you could honestly just throw this on in the background while you cook dinner.
'Master of None' Metacritic score: Season 1: 91; Season 2: 91 You have to hand it to Aziz Ansari -- after the first season of "Master of None" was unanimously well received, the second season had an almost impossible bar set for it.
And yet it resonated with me even more so than the first.
Ansari clearly has a lot to say about life, love and finding yourself in the 21st century.
We're listening intently.
'Easy' Metacritic score: Season 1: 72 The great thing about an anthology drama series like "Easy" is that they're so easy to watch.
So much so, you don't need to actually add "Easy" to your Netflix watch list.
Statistically, if you hang out with a group of three or more millennials for more than an hour, "Easy" will inevitably end up on the television in the background.
"Easy" is well written, well executed and thoughtful.
Enjoy any of the eight episodes as they come your way.
'Dear White People' Metacritic score: Season 1: 85 Did you ever catch the movie?
I thoroughly enjoyed "Dear White People" when it came out, and was thrilled that the show manages to capture the uniquely powerful and savvy storytelling style of the film.
The show focuses on the lives of students of color at a mostly white university.
It's thoughtful at a time many of us are looking for thoughtfulness in our media, and it's also really funny.
'GLOW' Metacritic score: Season 1: 81 Are you ready for the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling?
I was skeptical at first (nostalgia is a slippery slope), but I thoroughly loved this 1980s women's wrestling throwback.
While the dramatic side of the show throws weaker punches, the comedic campy side is a total knockout.
Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin have the perfect frenemy dynamic.
In fact, the elements of "GLOW" that work really highlight why wrestling in general makes for such captivating entertainment.
Netflix 'Marvel's Jessica Jones' Metacritic score: Season 1: 81 Netflix has its work cut out, trying to make small-potato TV shows that match the behemoth that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
With only one exception, they've done an arguably better job than network television.
If you're looking to start with a Marvel show, "Jessica Jones" is probably your best bet.
The first season villain is straightforward, and Jessica Jones is probably the most accessible of the TV superheroes (badass leather jacket and all).
'One Day at a Time' Metacritic score: Season 1: 79 Netflix only has three sitcoms, and this one is by far my favorite of the bunch.
This show, about a divorced working class mother raising her two kids is a reboot of the original 1970s Norman Lear classic, but with a remarkedly fresh perspective.
On numerous occasions I'd find myself thinking, "Wow, this show is surprisingly woke."
It's honest and heartfelt, in a way that made me think twice about the future of sitcoms.
'The Crown' Metacritic score: Season 1: 81 Look, it was expensive.
You're paying for Netflix after all (well you, or your parents, or your ex, or some third cousin you only met once), so you may as well get your money's worth, right?
The upside is that this historical drama about the early reign of Queen Elizabeth II works.
It's engaging and strongly performed.
And maybe it's just because of the subject matter, but it's definitely the most tonally mature fictional show Netflix has to offer.
'Chef's Table' This docuseries on the culinary arts is pure visual poetry.
Every episode tells the story of a different world-renowned chef.
As a generally stoic person, I've cried maybe three times over a movie or TV show in my entire life.
The first episode of "Chef's Table," which tells the love story of Massimo Bottura and his wife, had me sobbing on my couch.
Make of that what you will.
'Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp' Metacritic score: 74 If you've never seen the 2001 cult classic "Wet Hot American Summer," do so immediately, and then go check out the two follow-up Netflix series: "First Day of Camp" (the prequel series) and "Ten Years Later" (the sequel series).
"First Day of Camp" is definitely the stronger of the two, packed full of your favorite comedians and absurd, but hilarious, plot lines.
'Orange is the New Black' Metacritic score: Season 1: 79; Season 2: 89; Season 3: 83; Season 4: 86; Season 5: 67 Everyone expects a TV show to take a nosedive in quality around its fourth or fifth season.
Maybe the most recent season of "OITNB" was weaker compared to previous seasons, but it's all relative.
The weakest season of "OITNB" still managed to hold my attention in ways many other TV shows can't.
The show has struggled in giving enough screen and story time to its extensive and well loved ensemble cast, but are we really going to fault a show for having too many incredibly talented actors?
'Abstract: The Art of Design' It's basically "Chef's Table," but for designers.
The eight artists featured in the first season range from a footwear designer to an car designer, and each episode narrates the story of a single artist (something I find so compelling about "Chef's Table").
Netflix is so adept at documentaries at this point it's almost mocking us with its constant three-pointers.
"Abstract" is visual candy, perfect for quiet nights when you just want make a cup of tea and sink into yourself.
Netflix 'Stranger Things' Metacritic score: Season 1: 76; Season 2: 77 Look, if you didn't watch this one last summer like the rest of us, stop procrastinating.
You're special.
You're unique.
You deserve to have "Stranger Things" in your life.
This sci-fi fantastical horror 80s-nostalgia throwback is probably the most addictive offering on Netflix.
The second season goes live on Oct. 27 and I'm not going to spend any longer trying to convince you to watch it, because it should already be playing on your TV right now.
Go!
'Big Mouth' Metacritic score: Season 1: 80 Oh hello, "Big Mouth."
Take a walk down memory lane into Nick Kroll's childhood, and prepare to laugh your ass off.
This adult animated series is stacked with many of my all-time favorite comedians, including John Mulaney, Jenny Slate, Jason Mantzoukas and Maya Rudolph.
Also I'll save you some time: Maurice the Hormone Monster is voiced not by Will Arnett, but Nick Kroll.
(A coincidence that should remain between Amy Poehler and her therapist.)
'BoJack Horseman' Metacritic score: Season 1: 59; Season 2: 90; Season 3: 89; Season 4: 87 Word of advice: Skip "Flaked," a show about a brooding middle-aged man starring Will Arnett and just watch "BoJack Horseman," an animated show about a brooding middle-aged (horse)man starring Will Arnett.
Slickly written and painfully honest, "BoJack" makes a fresh case for why adults should take more animated shows seriously.
But maybe don't watch this one if you're going through a rough patch in life.
I learned that lesson the hard way.
Netflix 'Black Mirror' Metacritic score: Season 3: 82 Continuations of series that previously aired on another network exist on a spectrum ranging from, "Why would you ever bring this back?"
to, "Rejoice, our prayers have been answered!"
"Black Mirror's" third season on Netflix makes a solid case for letting continuations continue.
The sci-fi anthology series tapped into our deepest fears of the future and technology.
Since each episode stands alone, at least give San Junipero an hour of your time; it won two Emmys.
'Narcos' Metacritic score: Season 1: 77; Season 2: 76; Season 3: 78 Pro tip: Unless you're fluent in Spanish, this is not a good show to "watch" while doing puzzles.
But if you do make that mistake, at least it's good to know that it's worth rewatching.
"Narcos" tells the story of cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, the DEA agents investigating him and the cartel that rises after Escobar's fall.
This show has been getting stronger with each season, and who can complain about that?
Google When you google something, it's not always clear if the answer that emerges is real or fake.
This is something Google has grappled with over the past year as it tries to get a handle on viral propaganda and internet hoaxes.
To battle the phenomenon of "fake news," Google said Thursday that it's partnering with the International Fact-Checking Network at The Poynter Institute.
The idea is to enlist the network's help to increase the number of verified fact checkers on the internet.
"Fact checking articles -- when a journalist looks at one single statement or issue and either verifies or debunks it -- is important in today's climate because it helps readers better understand viral news stories and relevant issues," Erica Anderson, partnerships manager at Google News Lab, wrote in a blog post.
The spread of fake news has caused public scorn for companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, as the tech giants have failed to keep up.
Google has pledged to help stop the spread of fake news, but the false content has still found a way to slip past the search engine.
An internal Google investigation also found that Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads across Google's properties, including in search results, YouTube and Gmail.
The ads were reportedly part of a campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election.
Google introduced a feature last year called "Fact Check tag," which shows people when a news or fact checking organization has verified or debunked the claim.
The company said thousands of fact checked articles now appear in Google search results.
Along with increasing the amount of fact checkers on the internet, Google's partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network also aims to bring fact checking to more countries worldwide.
Google will also provide the network with training and free fact-checking tools.

Your phone's built-in map app might not be able to pick up every EV charger in your area, which is where EVgo's new app comes into play.
EVgo unveiled its new app on Thursday.
Available for both iOS and Android, the app lets drivers find any fast charger on EVgo's network, which covers some 980 DC Fast Charger stations across the country.
The chargers are capable of adding about 150 miles of range per hour, provided the car is capable of handling that charging speed.
Enlarge Image EVgo It isn't just a simple search.
EVgo's app lets users find unused chargers, and it can send directions to your map app of choice.
Filters will also let users focus on finding chargers that are capable of charging their specific vehicle.
The app also eliminates the need to carry EVgo's access card.
A simple swipe in the app is all it takes to start a session.
Users can also track charging time in the app, as well as access charging and billing history.
Basically, anything you need to do related to EVgo's charging network could be done in this app.
Walmart What we think of as a robot, Walmart calls "shelf-scanning technology."
And don't be surprised if you run into these tall, grey machines slowly rolling down the aisle of your local store.
The big box retailer said Thursday that it's testing a "small number" of robots to "handle tasks that are repeatable, predictable and manual."
Such tasks include scanning shelves for out-of-stock items, making sure all pricing is correct and fixing any wrong or missing labels.
"This new shelf-scanning technology frees up time for our associates," Walmart wrote in a blog post.
To keep up with the times, Walmart has been increasingly turning to tech.
It's acquired online shopping sites to grow it's e-commerce business, it's been testing straight-to-you-fridge grocery delivery and it's worked with Google to create a voice shopping assistant.
Walmart said the robots won't be replacing human employees, instead they'll be helping to "save our associates and customers time."
So far, Walmart has tested the shelf-scanning technology in several stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California.
It's now planning to bring the robots to 50 more stores in the near future.

Enlarge Image Amanda Kooser/CNET You have a supermarket apple in your hand.
You could rub it against your shirt or rinse it under water, or you could mix up a 1 percent baking soda/water solution and use that instead.
According to a new study, the baking soda solution is your best bet for reducing pesticides.
A team from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst led the research, which compared the effectiveness of plain tap water, a commercial bleach solution and a baking soda/water mix in removing pesticides from apples.
The scientists started with organic Gala apples and applied the fungicide thiabendazole and the insecticide phosmet before testing the different washing liquids.
"The baking soda solution was the most effective at reducing pesticide," a release on the study notes.
"After 12 and 15 minutes, 80 percent of the thiabendazole was removed, and 96 percent of the phosmet was removed, respectively."
The researchers say the industry-standard approach of washing fruit in a bleach solution for two minutes after harvest is not an effective way to completely remove pesticides.
They also found the fungicide thiabendazole penetrated into the apple peel much more than the insecticide.
Apple lovers would need to remove the peel to also get rid of the pesticide that wasn't washed off with the baking soda solution.
The researchers published the findings this week in the American Chemical Society's Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.
Will you start washing your non-organic apples in a baking soda solution for 15 minutes before you eat them?
The US Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates pesticides in foods, says, "The presence of a detectable pesticide residue does not mean the residue is at an unsafe level."
Your willingness to wash with baking soda and water may come down to your personal level of concern about pesticides, but the study's conclusions could also lead to more effective fruit-cleaning practices on the commercial level.

Niall Carson - PA Images Tech evangelist Robert Scoble denied sexual harassment allegations leveled at him by with a surprising defense: He never managed or held a position of power over the women who accused him.
"None of the women who came forward were ever in a position where I could make or break their careers," Scoble said in a blog post Wednesday.
"Sexual harassment requires that I have such power."
The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission outlines sexual harassment as harassment that can include "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature."
It can also simply be remarks regarding a person's sex.
Harassment isn't defined by the harasser's relationship to the victim.
"The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer," according to the EEOC's website.
Scoble is the latest figure to be accused of sexual harassment.
It's a topic on the public's mind following more than 50 accusations of sexual harassment leveled against Hollywood power player Harvey Weinstein and the revelation of a $32 million settlement former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly paid to a former network analyst who accused him of sexual harassment.
Scoble's response comes after several women came forward last week with accounts of him making either racist remarks or unwanted sexual advances.
Journalist Quinn Norton wrote in a Medium post that Scoble had groped her saying, "I felt one hand on my breast and his arm reaching around and grabbing my butt."
"A well-known man in a male-dominated field always has the power to harm women with influence, as well as harassment," Norton said Wednesday in an email to CNET.
"Scoble not understanding how he can harm the women around him, after decades in technology, would have to be somewhere between disingenuous and comatose."
In an email to CNET regarding the idea that sexual harassment requires a position of power, Scoble said, "The very short answer is, that in the context of law, that is a requirement (for better or worse).
In the paragraph that I address this, I am speaking primarily to the diligence of the reporting, as a reporter should know the difference between misconduct, assault, and harassment."
He also said none of the women actually used the phrase "sexual harassment."
There are two types of sexual harassment, according to Judy Lindenberger, president of the Lindenberger Group HR consulting firm.
One creates a quid pro quo situation where a person with power wants to exchange sex for a promotion, for example, or expects someone to go along with unwanted sexual advances.
"It's also against the law to create what's called an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and that has nothing to do with power," Lindenberger said.
In the more-than-2,400-word blog post, Scoble gives his own side of each incident, chalking up the allegations to everything from consensual flirting to a misinterpretation of events on the part of the accusers.
He also accused one of the women of having blackmailed him after having an online affair.
Scoble apologized in the post for not having been better to women in the past, citing marital infidelities and online pornography.
But he denied the allegations of harassment.
"Each of the women who have come forward used grains of truth to sell false narrative," he said.
He also lambasted the media for not verifying all of the facts, noting reports that he told partner Shel Israel the allegations were "mostly true" were inaccurate.
Scoble and Israel founded mixed-reality consulting firm Transformation Group earlier this year.
"As I said at the start of this post, there are grains of truth, and I told Shel that the statements were true enough that I would need to address them," he said.
Scoble resigned on Monday from Transformation.

Mazda and Toyota might have teamed up to develop electric cars, but Toyota might keep some of its biggest secrets to itself.
Toyota has what it considers a breakthrough in solid-state battery technology, and it won't share that development with Mazda and Denso, Automotive News Europe reports, citing an interview with Toyota's head of safety tech.
The three companies have teamed up for the very-Japanese-sounding EV Common Architecture Spirit.
This partnership sees all three members working together to develop a common vehicle platform for future EVs that will be shared across both automakers' lineups.
The architecture is allegedly capable of handling both common lithium ion batteries, as well as Toyota's new solid-state tech, so keeping that tech in-house shouldn't affect the overall partnership.
Enlarge Image Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images According to earlier reports, Toyota's first solid-state-battery EV won't arrive until 2022.
While that would put Toyota behind the curve in terms of EV rollouts, the technology could provide Toyota with enough benefits that could put it ahead of its competitors.
Instead of using a liquid electrolyte, as current lithium ion batteries do, Toyota's solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte.
This can improve energy density, reduce the chance of overheating and, most importantly, drop quick-charge times down to a matter of minutes.
Right now, the tech is too expensive to shove into any current car, but Toyota hopes it will be affordable at the beginning of the next decade.
Mazda and Toyota's partnership will come to the US by way of a $1.6 billion joint-venture plant.
While the location is still unknown, this new factory could create up to 4,000 jobs and should be up and running as soon as 2021.
The factory won't build this new EV, but rather existing models -- the Corolla for Toyota, and a new crossover model for Mazda.
The two automakers have also teamed up to develop the latest generation of Toyota's Entune infotainment system.
First appearing on the 2018 Camry, the system will initially surface in a Mazda when the new Mazda3 debuts in the near future.
It's capable of over-the-air updates thanks to a new Wi-Fi hotspot with a built-in cellular antenna.
Cybersecurity Trends Spotlight Report 2017 Ask a cybersecurity expert or hacker to name the weakest link in any security plan and they will inevitably answer "the people."
Just like everything else, security can't account for the unpredictability of the human factor.
In an enterprise setting, employees will circumvent protocols for the sake of convenience, offer bits of information to strangers because they asked nicely, and generally make a mess of any well-laid enterprise-wide cybersecurity plan.
According to the Cybersecurity Trends 2017 Spotlight Report (PDF), 54% of cybersecurity professionals surveyed anticipate a successful cyberattack on their organization in the next 12 months.
Some 40% of those professionals also view the lack of employee awareness as a major obstacle to stronger cybersecurity.
With increases in mobility and the adoption of a BYOD culture in the enterprise, 69% of the surveyed cybersecurity professionals are increasingly concerned about data leakage.
Another 64% believe their organizations will have to deal with the download of unsafe applications and the introduction of malware stemming from portable storage devices and the like in the next year.
While workforce mobility and the culture of BYOD certainly produce tremendous benefits for modern enterprises, the technology presents a challenging risk for cybersecurity professionals.
The only viable approach to overcoming, or at least mitigating, the human factor is to educate employees and establish a comprehensive policy to govern how personal devices, especially portable storage devices, will be introduced to an enterprise network.
TechRepublic's premium sister site, Tech Pro Research, offers a ready-made Portable Storage Device Policy to help you regulate and secure usage of portable storage devices to help reduce the risks.

Your thoughts What steps have you taken to combat the potential vulnerabilities created by BYOD programs and portable storage devices?
Share your tips and opinions with fellow TechRepublic members.
Linux.
That's right, the platform of reliability, flexibility, and security.
Even though you do gain significant amounts of security with the open source operating system, no computer is one hundred percent safe.
Period.
End of story.
However, there are things you can do, even with Linux, to make your experience considerably more secure.
One often-forgotten area of Linux security is the home directoryotherwise known as ~/.
Something to keep in mind, is that particular directory houses user data.
In other words, this is the default directory where documents are stored.
If this machine is used in a business environment, there could be sensitive information stored within.
Let's see what we can do to that home directory to make it more secure.
We'll start with the easy tip first.
I'll be demonstrating on a freshly installed Ubuntu 17.10 desktop.
Permissions One thing you must know is that, out of the box, users can read each other's files in their home directory.
That's right, if you have a Linux machine with multiple users, those users can read one another's files (so long as they are housed within their home directory or child folders within the home directory).
So if user jack has a file /home/jack/jacksfile, user olivia could read the contents of that file (although not write to it).
How do we prevent this?
Actually it is quite simple.
What we must do is change the permission of each user's home directory.
For each user directory, execute the following command: sudo chmod -R 700 /home/USER Where USER is the actual username.
When a user attempts to either list the contents of a directory in that user's account (or read a file in that same directory), they will receive a permission denied error.
That's the easy way.
Now let's take a look at a more complicated method of better security your user's home directory.
SEE: Securing Linux policy (Tech Pro Research) Encryption During the installation of the platform, you will be asked if you want to encrypt each user's home directory.
If you skip that during installation, worry not, you can do it post-install.
Here's how.
The first thing you must do is install a couple of extra tools.
Back at the terminal window, issue the following command: sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils cryptsetup The next step is to create a temporary account with admin privileges.
To do this, open up the Settings app and search for Users.
In the new window (Figure A), click the Unlock button and type your sudo password.
Figure A Next, click the Add User button and fill out the information for the new user (Figure B).
Remember, this will be a temporary user, used only for the encryption of another user's home directory.
Figure B Once you've created the new user, close out the Settings window and log out of your current user.
You'll then log into the temporary user account.
From that new user, open up a terminal window and issue the following command to encrypt the user's home directory: sudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u USER Where USER is the username whose home directory you want to encrypt.
You will first be prompted for the temporary user's sudo password, followed by the password for the user whose home directory is being encrypted.
The above command will not only encrypt the user's directory, it will also create a backup of the contents of that directory (in case of a problem).
This next step is vital.
Before you reboot the system, you must do the following: Login as the user whose directory was just encrypted.
Issue the command ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase and record the randomly generated passphrase (you will be prompted for your user login password, in order for this to work).
If swap space is being used on the system, you should also encrypt it with the command sudo ecryptfs-setup-swap The backup, created by the ecryptfs-migrate-home command is found in /home and will be in the form of USER.XXX (where USER is the username and XXX is a random string of characters).
Leave that in place, until you've rebooted a couple of time and verified the user can access all of their files.
Once you've taken care of the above, reboot the system and then attempt to log in as the user whose home directory was just encrypted SEE: 20 quick tips to make Linux networking easier (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Cleaning up And that's it.
Your home directory is encrypted.
Repeat this process for all users who require encrypted home directories.
Once you're finished, and have verified everyone can access their files and folders, you can delete the backups as well as the temporary user.
Your encrypted home folders are good to go.

Anyone that administers Linux machines knows secure shell well.
Without this tool it would be quite a challenge to remotely administer those servers.
It would also become quite a bit harder to move files back and forth, at least with a modicum of security.
That's where secure copy comes into play.
With the scp command, you can copy files to and from a remote Linux server, through an encrypted ssh tunnel.
However, with the help of ssh key authentication, you can make that even more secure.
I want to show you how you can make use of secure key authentication, along with scp, so you can rest assured your files are being moved back and forth securely.
I will be demonstrating on an Elementary OS client and Ubuntu 16.04.1 server and will assume you have secure shell installed and working.
ssh keys The first thing that must be done is the creation of an ssh key pair.
To do this, open up a terminal window and issue the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa You will be asked to name the file (use the default) and give the keypair a passphrase (Figure A).
Figure A Once the key's randomart prints, your key is ready to go.
The next step is to copy the key to the remote server.
This is done with the command: scp-copy-id USER@SERVER Where USER is the username on the remote server and SERVER is the address of the remote server.
You will be prompted for the remote user password.
Once you successfully authenticate, the public key will be copied to the server.
You're ready to go.
SEE: Securing Linux policy (Tech Pro Research) Using scp with your key Now that our keys are in all the right places, let's see how we can make use of them, through scp.
The command to send a file to your remote server, using your ssh key, is (assuming you accepted the default name for your ssh key upon creation): scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub FILENAME USER@SERVER:/home/USER/FILENAME Where FILENAME is the name of the file, USER is the username on the remote machine, and SERVER is the address of the remote server.
You should be prompted for the ssh key password (not the user password).
Once authenticated, the file will be transferred.
The same holds true if you need to pull a file from the remote server.
The structure of that command would be: scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub USER@SERVER:/home/USER/FILENAME /home/USER/FILENAME Again, you will be asked for your ssh key password and the file will be pulled from the server and copied to the local machine.
Forget that password Let's say you are about to undergo a long session of copying files to your server.
Sure you could tar them all up into one bigger file, but say they need to all be placed in different directories.
That's a lot of typing.
You can make this slightly more efficient by using the ssh-agent and ssh-add commands.
That's right, using the combination of scp, ssh key authentication, and ssh-agent works really well.
What this will do is keep you from having to type that ssh key password every time you issue the scp command.
The one caveat to this is that you must remember the PID of the agent session and kill it when you're done.
Here's what you have to do.
Before issuing the scp command issue eval `ssh-agent` to start the session Make note of the Process ID (PID) you are given when the session starts Add your ssh key to the session with the command ssh-add Start using scp to copy your files That's all there is to it.
When you're done with the session, make sure to issue the command kill PID (Where PID is the actual number given to you when you started the ssh-agent session with eval).
SEE: 20 quick tips to make Linux networking easier (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Added security and ease And that, my friends, is how you make use of ssh key authentication with the scp command.
It may not change your world, but it will certainly make it a bit more secure and, with the help of ssh-agent, a bit easier.

A new form of ransomware, dubbed Bad Rabbit, is infecting computers via drive-by attacks masquerading as Flash updates.
This latest form of rapidly spreading ransomware is believed to be a variant of the Petya family; DLLs associated with it share approximately 67% of their code with known Petya variants.
Bad Rabbit has the potential to spread fast, but it isn't doing soat least not as fast as 2017's earlier ransomware outbreaks.
That doesn't mean it isn't dangerous: It uses serious encryption to lock down infected machines and can use the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol to spread itself to other machines on a network.
But it can be avoided by taking a few simple steps.
What is Bad Rabbit?
The name Bad Rabbit comes from a header on the malware's ransom site, but the real name of this new strain of malware is Diskcoder.d, a name that will sound familiar to anyone with knowledge of the Petya outbreak from earlier this year, which was caused by Diskcoder.c.
Diskcoder.d/Bad Rabbit is using a nearly identical ransom note to the one used by Petya and has a countdown timer until the ransom fee increases, just like what Petya did.
SEE: 17 tips for protecting Windows computers and Macs from ransomware (free PDF) (TechRepublic) What it doesn't do is use the EternalBlue exploit Petya used to spread, instead relying on another SMB exploit known as EternalRomance, which was also part of the Shadow Brokers leak from earlier this year.
What makes Bad Rabbit particularly adept at using SMB exploits for lateral movement is a new feature that Petya lacked: a list of common usernames and passwords to brute force its way to other machines.
In short, it's not Petya (or NotPetya), but it looks, feels, and behaves a lot like it.
Where Bad Rabbit is striking Cisco's Talos security research group, and several other threat analyst organizations, report that Bad Rabbit is primarily attacking businesses in Russia and Eastern Europe.
Kaspersky Labs reports that Ukraine, Germany, and Turkey have also been affected, with the bulk of targets being in Russia.
Avast added Poland and South Korea to the list of affected nations as well.
The infections have hit three media and news organizations in Russia, along with several transportation agencies in Ukraine, leading Kaspersky Labs to assert that it is an attack targeted against corporate networks.
Bad Rabbit droppers have been found on a variety of siteseven one located in the USaccording to a tweet from Costin Raiu, director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Labs.
Raiu also said that the network of compromised sites had been set up by Bad Rabbit's distributors since July 2017.
Image: iStock/Gilles_Paire How to avoid a Bad Rabbit outbreak Those hoping to protect their networks from Bad Rabbit have a few things going for them.
First off, it has to be manually downloaded and installed via a fake Flash update.
If antivirus software catches the executable at any stage, or if the user simply doesn't install it, then it can't do any harm.
Second, several security products claim to protect against Bad Rabbit, including Kaspersky and ESET.
Those running antivirus software should double-check to see if theirs protects against it, and be sure that security definitions are up to date.
SEE: Cyber Security Volume IV: End Point Protection (TechRepublic Academy) Third, It's known what files Bad Rabbit uses to execute its code, and they can be blocked.
Both are located in the Windows directory of the C: drive and are called infpub.dat and cscc.dat.
Those running Windows 10's Fall Creators Update should also be sure they have enabled Controlled Folder Access, which blocks any application from making changes to specified files and directories.
Lastly, if you're concerned about Bad Rabbit spreading laterally through your network there's a simple solution: Be sure that all the latest Windows Security Bulletins have been installedBad Rabbit's propagation method was shut down in June 2017, so if it's spreading beyond a single infected machine on your network you know who to blame.
The top three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: A new Petya ransomware variant, called Bad Rabbit, is spreading through Russia and other Eastern European countries.
It has already attacked several media organizations and transportation entities in Ukraine.
Bad Rabbit infects machines using a fake Flash update download.
It can spread laterally through a network using the EternalRomance SMB exploit released by the Shadow Brokers in mid 2017.
Stopping the spread of Bad Rabbit has already begun, and there are several things IT professionals can do to prevent their networks from being infected: Make sure Windows Security Bulletins are all installed, and be sure to check to see if your antivirus software protects against it, which several have claimed they do.

In 1949, photography instructors at the University of Missouri joined with legendary photojournalists from the era to hold the first Missouri Photo Workshop.
Nearly seven decades later, the workshop is still going strong, selecting a new small town in the midwestern state to document each year.
It's the longest-running documentary photography workshop in the US.
But the days of the darkroom are long gone, and the workshop each September is faced with setting up a network to handle tens of thousands of images, hundreds of gigabytes of video, and wireless access points for more than 100 people.
All out of thin air.
"The main obstacle every year is the venue itself," said Hany Hawasly, a New York-based video producer and Mizzou graduate who returns each year to help solve the workshop's IT solutions.
"We are pretty much limited to whatever space there is and whatever internet connectivity they have to offer."
"One year, actually, the whole town didn't have any connection faster than 5 mbps, and that was tough," he said.
"We have to adapt, and we have less than a day to figure it out."
By the time the weeklong workshop concludes, more than 15,000 images have been processed, 400 large prints have been made, and 850GB of data has been created.
All of the images have to be organized, renamed and catalogued.
Dozens of hours of video is shot by a workshop crew that produces a documentary film about the week's experience.
All of that data must be backed up throughout the week, to ensure the archive is available to future generations of visual journalists.
All published work is then presented at the end of the week to the community at a public viewing, and displayed on the Missouri Photo Workshop's website.

Google released the developer preview of Android 8.1 Wednesday, with updates allowing developers to better target their apps for memory optimization and better leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning, according to a developer blog post.
Like all developer previews, this recent release from Google aims to help developers get their apps ready to work with the full version of Android 8.1 According to the post, the general release of the OS update is expected in December 2017.
SEE: Mobile device computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) Along with the standard patches and bug fixes one might find with a new release, the Android 8.1 developer preview also contains new developer tools and APIs as well.
Here are four of those features that were highlighted in the blog post.
1.
Android Go memory optimizations and targeting Android Go is Google's program geared toward building budget Android phones for developing markets.
Being that some Android Go devices have 1GB or less of memory, the Android 8.1 developer preview will allow developers to optimize their apps to run on low-RAM devices devices such as these, the post said.
2.
Neural Networks API Developers can leverage the new Neural Networks API to take advantage of machine learning features on Android devices, the post said.
The API is available through the Android NDK and will enable "hardware-accelerated inference operations on supported devices," the post said.
The Neural Networks API will serve as a foundation for machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and others.
3.
Autofill enhancements With the Android 8.1 developer preview, it will be easier for certain apps to use the Autofill framework.
This includes customization of the UI involved with autofill, the post said.
4.
Shared memory API The shared memory API will let apps "allocate shared memory for faster access to common data," the post said.
The API offers protection control management and the ability for apps to map anonymous shared memory as well.
To get the Android 8.1 developer preview, users must first sign up for the beta program here.
Once the device is enrolled, users can simply download their app from the Google Play store and begin testing it in the new OS update, the post said.

As interfaces in Android applications get more elaborate, developers increasingly need software frameworks to keep these apps running smoothly on phones.
To that end, earlier this year, Facebook open sourced Litho, a declarative framework for efficient UI rendering on Android.
But while Litho improved app scrolling performance by up to 35%, developers were still faced with the challenge of having to write stateful, imperative code, which was difficult to maintain, to handle data flows into these UIs.
To address these maintainability issues, Facebook has today open sourced Sections, an API which provides a way of structuring data and translating it into Litho Components.
Adam Wolff is an engineering director at Facebook in charge of the front-end infrastructure group, explains the benefits of Sections.
"Litho is a great way to write your [Android] Views, a way to compose visual elements that you see in an Android app," he said.
"But what it doesn't really have is a way to handle the data that flows into these UIs.
What you want is a declarative API.
"When it comes to showing your data, you want the same thing, you want to be able to declare how the data corresponds to the elements in your lists, and the new Sections API does exactly that.
It gives you this declarative way of grouping these things up.
"That gives you two things: the code that you write is actually much simpler and less error prone.
The other is that it can be highly efficient.
Very few developers go through the pain of implementing their own RecyclerView adapter, which can be efficient about how to update things.
In general, people just refresh all the data in their containers, whereas the Sections API can be really targeted and efficient about it.
"We're really excited about it.
In some ways we think that Litho was incomplete without this Sections API."
After Facebook converted some highly used scrollable surfaces from a traditional RecyclerView and Views implementation to Sections and Litho, it saw significant performance improvements.
Converting the Comments surface in Facebook for Android to Sections resulted in a 42% scroll performance improvement.
Sections uses the same declarative data model as Litho and transparently handles things like calculating minimal sets of changes for data updates and doing granular UI refreshes.
As part of Litho, the Sections API shares the same main concepts such as annotation-based code generation, event handling, props, and state updates.
For easy integration with Litho, Sections provides a built-in Component, called RecyclerCollectionComponent, that can render a hierarchy of Sections.
The Sections hierarchy becomes a data source for the RecyclerCollectionComponent, and the Components that render your data will become items in the RecyclerView adapter under the hood.
All the complexity of handling operations on your adapter, such as inserts or removes, is hidden away and handled by the infrastructure.

Facebook Workplace is launching a desktop version of its Workplace Chat app to help the more than 30,000 organizations using the service communicate faster, according to a Thursday blog post by Julien Codorniou, VP, Workplace.
The messaging feature looks and acts like Facebook Messenger, giving businesses a familiar way to communicate within their organization's Workplace.
The new chat app also has voice chat, screen sharing, polls, and unlimited file sharing.
A group video chat option is planned to come out within weeks, according to the blog.
SEE: Instant Messaging Policy (Tech Pro Research) "Increasingly, we've found that many customers rely on messaging for real-time, reliable communication," Codorniou wrote.
In addition to the desktop chat feature, Workplace is revamping its look, opting for lighter colors and cleaner symbols.
Codorniou wrote that the redesign is based on user feedback, with a focus on easy connection and navigation.
The Workplace Chat app is the first Workplace-related desktop app, with the chat service already available on mobile and on browsers.
The desktop app is available now on PC and Mac, while the mobile app can be found on Android and iOS.
For existing Workplace users, the app will allow for communications to be streamlined and in one spot along with their company's groups in the service.
It lets teams in different spots or those with remote workers to work together in real-time, regardless of if they're on the go or at their desk.
But it faces competition from other messaging systems, like Slack, for business use.
Since it is so similar to the preexisting Facebook Messenger, the new app may not have enough to set it apart to convince users to switch platforms.
Workplace has added multiple features since it was created one year ago, including live video and groups with people from different organizations.
The service offers several integrations, including Office 365 and G Suite, while also allowing users to build their own custom integrations.
"We envision Workplace as an employee's command center for everything that's happening with their team, their company, and their industry," Codorniou wrote.
The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Facebook Workplace is rolling out a desktop chat component, available now via app for Mac and PC.
With an incredibly similar look to Facebook's Messenger, Workplace Chat offers polls, screen sharing, unlimited file sharing, and voice chat, with group video chat on the way.
While a convenient communication option for existing Workplace users, the app faces competition from other messaging systems and may not have enough standout features to pull businesses away from their current setup.

Malicious email attacks that tap ransomware and banking Trojans soared in the third quarter of 2017, while social engineering and targeting techniques grew more sophisticated, according to security firm Proofpoint's Quarterly Threat Report, published Thursday.
Malicious email volume increased 85% from Q2, the report found.
This was largely driven by an explosion of email with malicious URLs linking to hosted malwarethe volume of which rose 600% from Q2, and more than 2,200% from 2016.
This represents the highest proportion of malicious URL messages compared to attachment-based email attacks since 2014.
Ransomware appeared in some 64% of all malicious email, the report found.
Locky remained the top payload in terms of ransomware and across all malware families, though new ransomware variants appeared each day.
Strains known as Philadelphia and GlobeImposter also grew from small, regionally-focused variants into global threats, thanks to a few high-volume campaigns by a single attacker, according to the report.
SEE: Information security incident reporting policy (Tech Pro Research) Meanwhile, banking Trojans accounted for 24% of all malicious emails.
The Trick accounted for 70% of banking Trojan payloads, surpassing Dridex for the top spot.
Email fraud was also on the rise in Q3, up 29% over the previous quarter.
Companies also saw increased attack frequency, with 12% more email fraud attempts per targeted organization than Q2.
While exploit kits declined in 2016, criminals that are still using them have now layered social engineering tools into these campaigns, Proofpoint found.
This suggests that hackers are looking beyond the exploits alone, as they become harder to find and obtain, the report noted.
Fraudulent support accounts also doubled from Q3 2016, as threat actors continue to tap social engineering to lure in victims.
The number of fake customer support accounts used for "angler phishing" grew 5% over Q2, while the volume of phishing links on branded social media channels rose 10%.
The rise of suspicious, look-alike domain registrations was also notable in Q3, the report found.
These suspicious domains are often used for typosquatting and spoofing, and usually arise tied to a major event related to the brand, such as a new product launch.
Defensive registration of brand-owned domains fell 20% from the year before, while suspicious domain registrations grew 20% in the same period.
SEE: How to avoid ransomware attacks: 10 tips Proofpoint offers the following four tips to keep your business safe: 1.
Combat typosquatting on the web Defensive domain registration is an easy, cost-effective way to prevent attackers from creating look-alike domains for email fraud and credential phishing, the report noted.
IT should work with business leaders to create a list of potential look-alike domains to register, and include conference and marketing campaign website as well.
2.
Deploy email authentication to stop domain spoofing techniques used in email fraud By employing protocols such as DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance), companies can prevent criminals from tapping their email domain.
3.
Protect your users from email attacks of all types Email attacks can take the form of malware attachments, malicious URLs, or socially engineered fraud.
Any solution in place should address all of those potential vectors.
4.
Protect your brand from impostors on social media Some security solutions can alert your company to fake, look-alike social media accountsparticularly those offering fraudulent customer support servicesand work to take them down.

On Wednesday, Microsoft announced a new, open source linting tool and site scanner that offers developers an easier way to search their sites for errors and security flaws.
The tool, called sonar, is "the next evolution of the static scan tool," according to a blog post from Antn Molleda, senior program manager of Microsoft Edge.
Sonar represents an update to Microsoft's modern.IE scanner used to detect optimizations for old versions of Internet Explorer, outdated libraries, and missing prefixes.
Compared to previous scanners, sonar includes improvements such as execution of website code rather than static analysis, a more flexible, modern set of rules, parallel test execution, integration with other services, and a completely open source code base, Molleda wrote.
Developers can also use sonar as a command line tool (CLI), that can be integrated directly into local web development workflows.
"Web development is more than HTML, JavaScript, and CSS: developers are expected to have a grasp of accessibility, performance, security, emerging standards, and more, all while refreshing this knowledge every few months as the web evolves," Molleda wrote.
SEE: Hiring kit: JavaScript developer (Tech Pro Research) Microsoft created a set of guiding principles for sonar before creating the tool, according to the post.
These include putting the user at the centersonar not only tells developers when it spots an error, it also tells them why.
"It is important to know the reason for an issue so developers can decide if that really applies to their work," Molleda wrote.
"The requirements from website to website can change a lotfor example, an intranet website and an online shopping experience will have vastly different needs."
With that being the case, Microsoft set out to make sonar easy to use, configure, and expand.
Beyond open sourcing the code, Microsoft donated the project to the JS Foundation over the summer to make it more accessible to all.
Microsoft intended for sonar to "avoid reinventing the wheel," Molleda wrote, instead tapping and integrating existing tools and services that help developers build for the web.
With that being the case, sonar integrates with aXe Core, AMP validator, snyk.io, SSL Labs, and Cloudinary.
The tool could make a real difference for developers in terms of producing higher quality websites: A recent Northeastern University analysis of over 133,000 websites found that 37% had at least one JavaScript library with a known vulnerability.
As ZDNet noted, Snyck also ran a scan of the top 5,000 URLs earlier this year, and found that more than 76% were running a JavaScript library with at least one vulnerability as well.
Sonar is now available as an open source online service, deployed on top of Azure using Docker containers.
Future releases will include features such as a plug-in for Visual Studio Code, configuration options for sonar, and new rules for areas such as performance, accessibility, security, and Progressive Web Apps.
Sonar currently supports jsdom, Chrome, and Edge 15.
Firefox will likely be added to that list soon, according to the sonar website.
Developers can also check out the sonarwhal GitHub organization.

Major League Baseball has been playing games for much the same way since 1869, but today the digital revolution is driving an overhaul of the game and the fan experience at ballparks across North America.
The game has suffered losses in popularity in recent years, compared to the NFL and the NBA.
Regardless, it still has an old-fashioned appeal to those fans who like nothing better than a sunny afternoon at a ballpark with a hot dog and a beer.
But that's not enough for newer fans, and even for some longtime fansthey want more excitement from a game that can move very slowly compared to other sports.
Tech is being used to rev up the game experience so that teams can keep people coming to stadiums, as well as buying merchandise, food, and drinks.
Since 2012, attendance has been slowly declining at MLB games, with fewer fans opting to navigate the traffic around stadiums and paying high ticket prices to see their favorite teams.
In 2007, the highest-attended year in the history of the league, 79.5 million fans attended regular-season games.
In 2012, this had dropped to 74.9 million and by 2017, it had dropped further to 72.7 million, according to Forbes.
Major League Baseball's digital arm, MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), is aiming for a home run as it oversees upgrades that do everything from improving Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity within stadiums to making it possible for fans to order beer, polish sausage, and T-shirts from their seats.
SEE: Digital Transformation: A CXO's Guide (A ZDNet and TechRepublic special report) (Note that MLBAM is separate from BAMTech, the digital media company spun off from MLBAM that sold a $1 billion stake last year, and then an additional $1.58 billion majority stake earlier this year to The Walt Disney Company, according to The New York Times.)
In 2012, MLBAM formed a consortium and asked each team to assess their Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity and make improvements if needed.
In 2014, only 12 MLB stadiums offered Wi-Fi or a Distributed Antenna System (DAS) to boost mobile signals.
Now, all 30 stadiums have connectivity to some degree, and two-thirds of those have expanded services for fans, according to Matthew Gould, MLBAM spokesperson.
"Like anything else this is a living, breathing technology project so it's never like you install it and you walk away.
It's something that always has to be monitored and revamped and amplified as hardware gets better and networks shift," Gould said.
Image: Billie Weiss/Boston Red Sox Wi-Fi table stakes Most MLB stadiums now sport high-density Wi-Fi platforms that support connectivity for every fan in the stadium and allow for massive amounts of data to be transmitted during a single game or event.
And some teams are going deep into personalization with apps and features for their fans.
"Connectivity is what we're seeing as table stakes now because it puts the fan at the center of the action, which is where they want to be," said Mike Caponigro, solutions marketing lead for Cisco's Sports and Entertainment Group, which has worked with 23 MLB teams to improve the fan experience.
Cisco has installed high-density Wi-Fi in more than 200 venuessporting and non-sportingaround the globe.
"MLB was at the forefront in recognizing the need for this," Caponigro said.
In Atlanta, where the Braves opened a new stadium, SunTrust Park, in spring 2017, "We view connectivity as the foundation for everything," said Greg Mize, director of digital marketing for the Atlanta Braves.
"Without connectivity, our fans cannot take out their phones and consume the game the way they want with unfettered internet access.
That's really core."
Eric McLoughlin, director of product marketing for Comcast, said, "Professional sports teams ... sign these multi-million dollar agreements with television companies.
Customers have 60-inch televisions in their homes and are getting very comfortable watching the game on [TV] and having access to the Wi-Fi in their home and access to the experience that they want.
So the professional sports teams are challenged to find a way to replicate that at-home experience but give you all the benefits you get by going to the ballpark."
The San Diego Padres have recently completed a refresh of the 13-year-old Petco Park.
Ray Chan, vice president of IT for the Padres, said "Millennials might have been the driving force to get venues to add more connectivity in the ballpark.
It's expected now that fans can come here and have some sort of connectivity."
The Chicago Cubs are in the midst of a major update at Wrigley Field that is scheduled for completion by opening day 2018.
The $750 million project began in 2014 and includes a wired LAN network that was installed throughout the 103-year-old ballpark and back office areas, including the 30,000-square-foot underground clubhouse.
In 2008, when Cisco first installed Wi-Fi in AT&T Park for the San Francisco Giants, only 800 people used it during the entire season.
Today, at all of the league's stadiums, at least 50% of fans use Wi-Fi during each game, said Ken Martin, general manager for Cisco's Sports and Entertainment Group.
At the Boston Red Sox's historic Fenway Park, it's a careful balance to upgrade the technology while preserving the heritage and look of the stadium.
"Like all major league clubs, we believe that people have now come to expect connectivity in large venues like ballparks and stadiums," said Brian Shields, vice president of technology for the Red Sox.
"We see that as a critical foundational element.
It's what you put on top of that where it differentiates your ultimate success."
However, Wi-Fi deployments themselves are still work in process.
It's early in the game for figuring out where to put the Wi-Fi access points (APs) and antennas.
"We once said under seat mount for access points and antennas might be the best.
Then we tried a different way: Overhead mounts.
By having so many different deployments, we have been able to test what works best," Martin said.
It's still a work in progress to determine the best setup for APs.
"As a comparison, when the Giants played the Kansas City Royals in the World Series in 2014, both of them had our Wi-Fi and both of them had a unique deployment of Wi-Fi.
Kansas City used overhead and handrail mounts, and at AT&T [Park in San Francisco] we'd done the under seat mounts," Martin said.
At the time, there were 1,100 access points at AT&T Park and 750 at the Kansas City Royals' Kauffman Stadium.
"It allowed us to look at two very, very similar ballparks at the peak of the World Series," Martin said.
"The performance at AT&T Park was almost identical to Kansas City.
It was the same amount of users, the same concurrent users...
It allows us to say there is not one specific way to do Wi-Fi.
We have to leverage what's best in any particular venue."
Big (money) data Many savvy sports teams are now using big data analytics for in-game, business, and operational decisions, said Bill Schmarzo, CTO of big data for Dell Global Services.
"Think about all the decisions that have to be made about the operations of the parkmerchandising, retail, pricing, promotions, inventory, staffing, security, in-park advertising, etc.," Schmarzo said.
"All sports teams are looking to couple their detailed customer transactional and engagement data with external factorsweather, traffic, opponent, seasonal standings, day of the week, time of the gameto optimize each of those types of decisions.
And we haven't even started to talk about how sports teams are using data analytics for analyzing and valuing their players, and leveraging those sabermetrics to optimize in-game decisions."
The Red Sox have paired Dell EMC XtremIO all-flash storage with its own proprietary software since 2016 to power its baseball analytics system.
Dell EMC also provides IT infrastructure for the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies, as well as MLBAM.
SEE: Big data and digital transformation: How one enables the other (ZDNet) Baseball has always been a game where tracking statistics has been a core part of the fan experience.
It used to involve fans collecting baseball cards and memorizing the career stats of their favorite players or using pencils to manually track the box score of the game.
Today, it's having access to a whole new world of statistics with their mobile devices.
"That data is gold in the hands of fans.
They love to understand these metrics that differentiate professional players.
Someone didn't just hit a homerun, but they hit it 372 feet and it left the bat at 105 mph," Shields said.
And the customer data reaped from the apps themselves is used to help teams make more money, whether it's from selling tickets, food or merchandise.
"At its core, data analytics is about two things: 'make me more money' and winning," said Schmarzo.
"Having superior insights into the behaviors and tendencies of your customers, products, services, operations, and markets allows sports teams to make superior business and operational decisions; to improve business and operational processes, to mitigate compliance and security risks, to uncover new revenue streams and to create a more compelling, more profitable customer experience.
Image: Major League Baseball "In the end, it will allow sports teams to win with the most cost-effective teamsthat was the Moneyball lesson that leading sports teams like the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, and Houston Astros (not to mention the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs) have learned.
"[But] for professional baseball, mastering sabermetrics is no longer sufficient.
Leading sports teams are building upon that sabermetrics mentality by adding advanced analytic capabilities such as deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) to gain new business and operational insights that they can use to create new monetization opportunities and ultimately win both at the box office as well as on the field because those two elements are still highly correlated," Schmarzo said.
The data collected from apps provides a wealth of information about each fan.
MLBAM offers two apps for every team in the league: Ballpark and At Bat.
Ballpark focuses on the individual stadium with special offers, maps and tickets.
At Bat provides news stories, stats, scoring, and postseason details.
"Over the course of that time we built the app so there's a baseline set of foundational options that the teams have," Gould said.
"What we do is work with the initial team to customize it to their ballpark.
The teams know their fans [and] their ballpark the best.
If there is a particular feature that a team wants, we work with them to get that experience into the ballpark section.
Ultimately, like any other business you want a return customer.
You want fans to come back multiple times.
"Part of what we've been trying to build is an understanding of the lifecycle of a live event ticket.
It's a very different dynamic than any kind of other ticket.
An airline ticket is not transferrable.
That's your ticket, you need a government-issued ID to use that ticket.
From a customer service standpoint, what are we able to do to better serve each ticket holder in addition to just the ticket buyer?
From a security standpoint, it's [also] important to know who is in your ballpark," Gould said.
So while Wi-Fi is the enabler, the app is the central factor that MLB is relying on to improve the fan experience.
Teams want to monetize the app, and part of that is delivering premium customer service so that fans engage more with the game.
"Ultimately at some point they'll engage in a way that generates additional revenue," Gould said.
Vendors such as Cisco are focused on helping teams monetize apps so that they can market better to fans.
Martin said, "It's up to the venue to determine what they're going to do next.
It's great that I've offered them the ability to connect to their favorite social media site and upload the pictures to say that they were there, and to share with their greater social community.
But then what?
We are trying to monetize it, to concentrate more of our marketing efforts toward them.
We want them to be able to take it back to sponsors to say, 'here's your true audience vs. what you thought it would be.'
Or to offer more in ticket sales, more season tickets vs. onesies and twosies.
That's what we're trying to help these different vendors with.
It's really a discovery of who is in the venue."
The team knows who purchased the season ticket, but that's not always the same person using the ticket, because they could have resold it, or given it away.
As an example, Cisco studies have shown that only 6% of season ticket holders at college football games go to all of the home games themselves.
And someone who only goes to one or two games might not download the app, but they will often sign onto the stadium's Wi-Fi.
As a result, teams need to decide how to convince fans to provide more information.
"What we're doing is we're saying if you want to be connected, that's great, give us your last name, first name, and email address.
But if you want to be entered into this contest, give us more information.
Because the greater the information we have, the more we know who is in the venue," Martin said.
"There are teams spending millions and millions of dollars on their app development and app strategy and I'm not convinced that we are there yet.
We know that they're coming in with a phone and we know that 50% or greater will want to be connected on the Wi-Fi.
We know they're not going to use the app, but there is some of the onboarding activity that we can capture," Martin said.
Team apps are some of the most popular apps available, but if people are at a game, they don't feel the need to use them while in the venue, which means that the team won't necessarily know who is at the game unless they opt in for Wi-Fi, explained Ed Olsen, global ROI and content strategist for Cisco's Sports and Entertainment Group.
"First, they're at the game; second, most apps aren't developed to create an in-venue experience.
It has statistics, updates, all kinds of great info you can enjoy on the couch or at a sports bar.
We always recommend to teams that the moment your app realizes the fan is in the venue to start to create an ability to serve up an experience that is in-venue and a platform for communication, influence, and monetization," Olsen said.
SEE: Baseball pitches augmented reality to catch fans (CNET) The Cisco Vision for Sports and Entertainment product allows for live video feeds and replays on demand, and at least 15 teams have installed live video feeds that can be delivered to mobile devices.
However, research has shown that replays from different camera angles are the preferred option for fans.
"We've seen a shift away from live streaming and a focus on replay on demand," Caponigro said.
In 2018, MLB plans to add augmented reality (AR) to its At Bat app.
It will allow baseball fans to point their iPhone at the action on the field and see stats on how hard a ball was hit, how far it was thrown, or how fast a player runs in real time," Gould said.
The AR feature will use information from Statcast, MLB's in-house analytics tool.
It's already been tested already at Dodger Stadium, the Oakland Coliseum, and AT&T Park, Gould said.
Chicago's Wrigley Field One of the biggest tech upgrades is taking place at the one of league's most beloved stadiums, Wrigley Field in Chicago.
The first phase includes Wi-Fi throughout the stadium and is set to be completed in 2018.
The second phase includes installing Wi-Fi at The Park at Wrigley, a 50,000-square-foot open-air entertainment venue adjacent to the stadium.
The project includes structural upgrades, improved player facilities, new fan amenities, and entertainment attractions.
As part of the installation, Extreme Networks will install more than 1,000 access points throughout Wrigley Field and The Park.
SEE: Chicago's Wrigley Field targets 2018 for high-density Wi-Fi as part of $750M in ballpark upgrades (TechRepublic) The venues will be outfitted with Extreme's flow-based 802.11ac Wave 2 technology, including upgraded speed, additional capacity, and enhanced security.
Extreme Networks partnered with consulting firm PCM for the planning and implementation of the Wi-Fi network.
The look of the installation matters since Wrigley is a historic venue and it's a retrofit within the existing ballpark.
Image: iStockphoto/JPaulB "The biggest challenge is where we mount our wireless access points, and how it fits into the overall aesthetic of the venue.
When you're a landmark, it's even more important.
There will literally be people reviewing every blueprint and ensuring the integrity of the design and deployment," said Andrew McIntyre, vice president of technology for the Chicago Cubs.
Again, there are three main methods for installing access points in any venue: Overhead, under seat and hidden in handrails.
Wrigley doesn't have handrails, so that option isn't available.
And there are no under seat options in the bleacher section of Wrigley.
So overhead is the only option in some areas, McIntyre said.
There are two main drivers behind the project.
The first is supporting business operations and driving efficiency across the entire Cubs campus, and the second is improving the fan experience.
"This is really starting to change on the fan side of the house.
Specifically in this area we feel there are a large variety of use cases that we can see where we can continue to advance the experience for our fans, whether in the game or between the action, leading up to the event itself and even post-event," McIntyre said.
The Wi-Fi serves as fundamental infrastructure, and they will test and try out different technologies and different processes and approaches from telling fans about sales and deals around the ballpark to information on the wait times at concession stands and restrooms.
One example is retail sales versus concession.
"You might be hosting business partners or friends at an individual event.
You might want to have that retail [souvenir] ordered at your suite, but not delivered at your suitemaybe you want to have it delivered to your home after the fact, but it might be more relevant to purchase it at that time to recognize the game you are at, or even if there is an authentic jersey that is maybe symbolic," McIntyre said.
Like other venues, the data analytics on the fans that opt into the Wi-Fi or access the app during the game is critical.
"That information flow, that content, that ability to personalize down to the individual person is a game changer," said McIntyre.
"It's a granular level of understanding your customer and turning their visit into a concierge experience."
Boston's Fenway Park The only Major League Baseball stadium older than Wrigley Field (1914) is Boston's Fenway Park (1912), which is in the middle of its own digital transformation.
As with Wrigley Field, there are considerations that must be made in order to keep the experience authentic.
"Fenway Park is the closest thing to a historical museum.
When you go to Fenway, a lot of fans would tell you it's historically transformational," said Red Sox tech chief Brian Shields.
"As someone who grew up in the Boston area, when I come in the warmer months, I go into the stadium and come out by home plate, and I look out over the field and see the Green Monster.
I'll sometimes do my email from there.
I tell my friends it's exactly the way I remember it from when I was five years old.
It's important for us to preserve those things that make Fenway, Fenwayand yet modernize it behind the scenes so it's as contemporary as any modern stadium in major league sports."
SEE: How the NFL and its stadiums became leaders in Wi-Fi, monetizing apps, and customer experience (TechRepublic free PDF download) Fenway didn't have Wi-Fi when Shields joined the organization in 2013.
It was deployed in 2015 in the wintery off-season.
"That year was the snowiest year in the history of Boston.
110 inches of snow later, we had our Wi-Fi done," he said.
There are 600 wireless APs at Fenway Park, which along with Verizon DAS, provides connectivity to fans.
The team uses ShoreTel, which is now part of the Mitel organization, for cloud-based telecommunications services at Fenway Park as well as each of the team's five minor league facilities and at a communication facility the team is upgrading.
Image: Simone Schiess/Boston Red Sox Mitel works with several teams, including the San Francisco Giants, Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Diego Padres, said Mark Roberts, CMO of ShoreTel and Harbor Networks.
The Red Sox digital transformation includes data analytics as part of a partnership with Massachusetts-based EMC, now Dell EMC, that began in 2003.
"I think it's fair to say that people today look at sort of a thoughtful comprehensive Wi-Fi environment as basically the same need as breathing [oxygen]," said Shields.
"People expect when they go to certain large-scale facilities that they will have access to Wi-Fi.
We want fans to tell their friends and others via social media about their experience at Fenway Park.
"We want to piggyback on top of that to deliver increasingly specific capabilities, whether access to certain statistical information that continues to become more complex and engaging for fans, or more video content.
And for us going forward, we want to continue to understand our fans and fan behavior to make sure we're delivering personalized solutions to them.
We see this as a foot in the door to build a compelling fan engagement strategy," he said.
With a Wi-Fi backbone in place, the team can offer digital ticketing and mobile engagement capabilities via their app, such as ordering food in advance, upgrading tickets, participating in loyalty programs, and more.
"Maybe even games for children, so that we can cultivate a relationship with young children [as well as] adults.
All of those things are pivotal to what we think is the whole digital strategy for our organization," Shields said.
But, it's also a tough balance because the Red Sox also still want people to watch the game.
"Success for us isn't a fan with their head down because we built the most compelling app in the world.
It's how do we supplement the experience," Shields said.
"As we get to know them better, we will have greater flexibility to personalize their experience."

Kubernetes has won.
Now the question is who will win Kubernetes.
Over the last year Kubernetes has won over the last hold outs, with VMware/Pivotal and Docker finally locking arms with the Google-spawned community darling.
Docker founder Solomon Hykes tried to spin Docker's full support for Kubernetes as a non-event, reasoning that "Orchestration is a commodity, over time."
No, it's not.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
If anything, container orchestrationKubernetes, in particularis fast emerging as the operating system for the cloud.
Just as various vendors spent years duking it out to become the dominant distribution of Linux, we're likely to see a similar scenario play out around Kubernetes.
The only question is who will get to be the Red Hat Enterprise Linux of the data center operating system.
One big honking server Hykes may not like to hear this, but other vendors aren't waiting around for Docker to update its keynote narratives.
Red Hat's Daniel Riek, for example, has offered up OpenShift, its "distribution" of Kubernetes, as "the new Enterprise Linux."
Going further, he dubbed OpenShift "an extension and superset of traditional RHEL," and therefore "the future cloud-native operating system."
Of course Riek could be wrong, and the analogy isn't perfect.
It is, however, quite apt.
Putting aside Riek's contention that OpenShift is that OS, it's reasonable to posit, as analyst Krishnan Subramanian did, that "Kubernetes is...an ideal candidate to become the kernel for [the] Data Center / Application Infrastructure Operating System."
Why?
He explained: Linux is the operating system for a single server.
Google has made a clear case for Data Center as a Computer.
If we consider Data Center to be a pooled resource unit that acts like a single computer, we need an operating system for the data center.
There are many ways to build the datacenter operating system, either using virtual machines or containers.
However, containers are fast emerging as the right candidate for application encapsulation because of its efficiency and portability advantages....
The Linux Kernel interfaces with the hardware using device drivers, manages processes, allocates resources and handles security.
The kernel for Data Center / Application Infrastructure Operating System requires a similar controlling unit that could interface with the infrastructure (container host operating system and/or the management plane for elastic infrastructure could become the equivalent to device drivers in Linux OS), manage processes (containers), allocate resources (managing the node/container resources) and handle security.
Under such a model, Kubernetes could be the kernel as it is capable of handling infrastructure resources, manage containers and allocate resources efficiently and could handle security in the future.
Or in Riek's words: "It has become clear that the future of the enterprise operating system is a distributed one of clusters running orchestrated containerized services.
While docker / OCI define the package format for containerization, Kubernetes provides the 'meta-kernel' to orchestrate the cluster and its applications."
SEE: Why containers are critical to successful DevOps projects (Tech Pro Research) The stakes, in short, are very, very high.
Code as currency Small wonder, then, that vendors are racing to contribute to Kubernetes, the default choice for this data center operating system.
In open source, code is the currency by which developers (and the companies that employ them) gain influence in a project.
Good code tends to yield more influence and responsibility.
It's not surprising, therefore, that we've seen everyone from Oracle to AWS piling into Kubernetes, even if not always super willingly.
There has been a tug-of-war over Kubernetes talent, with Microsoft hiring Kubernetes founder Brendan Burns from Google, for example.
Despite these movements, Google still contributes most to Kubernetes, with Red Hat coming in second.
If you're an enterprise making a big bet on containers, you're likely going to put your trust in one of these top contributors to Kubernetes, (rightly) figuring they'll be the best positioned to support your needs.
Sure, it's possible, as Teridion CEO Christopher Keene stated, that there may be "room for a new entrant" in the Kubernetes battle, but safer bets go to those that contribute most.
SEE: Why Kubernetes' platform prowess is a bigger threat to Amazon than its containers (TechRepublic) Like Google, the originator of Kubernetes.
In some ways, Kubernetes is a convenient on-ramp to Google's Cloud Platform.
No company on earth has more experience running containers at scale, and conveniently Google's experience is with Kubernetes (or its kissing cousin, Borg), making Google Cloud an appealing place to run Kubernetes.
Google's Achilles Heel, however, is enterprise.
This is starting to change, but it's unclear whether Google can become dull fast enough.
To the extent that enterprises are looking to run more like Google and are prepared to do so, Google is the ideal vendor.
But for the majority of enterprises stuck in legacy land, the Google way isn't an aspiration.
It's scary.
For example, enterprises expect long-term support on things that were never in perpetual beta.
Red Hat supports RHEL for 10 years.
Over half of its engineers work on sustaining engineering, updating old code rather than focusing on new feature development.
That's the sort of commitment to boredom you must have to compete for enterprise dollars, and it's simply not in the Google DNA.
Not surprisingly, then, former VMware executive Mathew Lodge, who knows a thing or two about boring enterprise software, has given the nod to Red Hat as Kubernetes king, arguing they "understand how to sell enterprise licenses."
SEE: Special report: Riding the DevOps revolution (free PDF) (TechRepublic) There are other players who can't be discounted.
Microsoft, for example, is so strong in both on-premises workloads and public cloud that it will always be a contender.
AWS, despite dragging its feet on Kubernetes, also stands out, even despite its relatively small contributor base.
For now, however, the two most likely Kubernetes winners are Google and Red Hat, the top two contributors.
Each offers a very different value, with Google promising a leap forward in how companies operate their IT and Red Hat holding offering a more comfortable way of getting there.
The ability to make complex, cutting-edge code like Kubernetes ready for slow-moving enterprise consumption, however, could be the difference.

If you have downloaded and installed the Fall Creators Update, you know what a time-consuming process it is.
But what you may not know is that during that time, the update process is dumping gigabytes of extraneous data on your hard disk and leaving it therea little over 30 GB to be exact.
Fortunately, new features in Storage Sense can help you recover that wasted space.
It can also clean up other wasted space on your hard disk.
While this is a nice feature, I still have some complaints.
Let's take a closer look.
Storage Sense version 1 Storage Sense made its debut in Windows 10 with the Creators Update in April 2017.
In its first iteration, Storage Sense could delete leftover temporary files and empty the Recycle Bin, as shown in Figure A.
Storage Sense could perform these operations automatically, with the switch set to On, or manually, if you clicked the Clean Now button.
Figure A The first version of Storage Sense could remove temporary files and empty the Recycle Bin.
Storage sense version 2 In the Fall Creators Update, Microsoft added two new capabilities to Storage Sense: It can now delete files in the Downloads folder that haven't changed in 30 days and it can remove the files left over after a major upgrade.
Of course, Storage Sense can still delete leftover temporary files and empty the Recycle Bin.
To check out Storage Sense and its new features, access Settings from the Start menu.
Then from within Settings, choose the System tile and select the Storage tab.
In the Storage Sense section, click Change How We Free Up Space.
These last steps are illustrated in Figure B.
Figure B Storage Sense can now delete previous versions of Windows after a major update.
If you turn the Storage Sense setting to On, it will automatically run in the background on a regular basis and clean up the items you selected.
Alternatively, you can run the Storage Sense cleanup operation manually by selecting items and clicking the Clean Now button.
Under the Temporary Files heading, you'll find first three options I mentioned.
The biggie, which I have highlighted in yellow, is the Delete Previous Versions Of Windows option.
In the case of the Fall Creators Update, selecting this option will return the 30 GB of wasted space to your hard disk.
SEE: Desktop migration checklist (Tech Pro Research) My complaint The idea behind Storage Sense is to replace the Disk Cleanup tool, shown in Figure C, with a new modern Settings app.
The Disk Cleanup tool has been around in the Windows operating system quite some time.
Figure C Disk Cleanup has been around for a long time.
While I appreciate the fact that Microsoft is working toward replacing old tools with new versions, I have to say that with Storage Sense version 2, I am again frustrated with Microsoft's half-baked approach.
If the goal is to provide a new and easier way of cleaning up wasted space in Windows, why not give us everything at once?
After I saw the first iteration of Storage Sense, I was encouraged that Microsoft was finally working toward putting the Disk Cleanup tool out to pasture.
I figured that this first iteration was a good start and I had high hopes that we would see a total replacement in the next version of Windows 10.
I thought we would see all the features found in the Disk Cleanup tool in Storage Sense.
I know that Microsoft can do it.
Just look at Windows Defender, which Microsoft completely revamped in the April Creators Update.
For more details, see How to take advantage of the new Windows Defender Security Center.
Sure, it's nice to be able to configure Storage Sense to automatically clean up leftover temporary files, empty the Recycle Bin, remove old downloads, and clean up upgrade debrisbut if I really want to clean up my hard disk, I still have to go to Disk Cleanup.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Twitter says it could turn its first ever profit in the fourth quarter, after cutting expenses and finding sources of revenue beyond advertising.
Angela Moore reports.
Video provided by Reuters Newslook Twitter headquarters in San Francisco (Photo: Eric Risberg, Associated Press) SAN FRANCISCO Data-driven Internet companies that boast they can precisely target advertising down to users' laundry detergent and their favorite TV shows are getting a reputation for overstating their reach.
On Thursday Twitter admitted it had miscounted its monthly user numbers for three years, raising tough questions for social media companies about how accurate this data is.
The revelation came as Twitter, Facebook and Google face intensifying scrutiny over hundreds of fake accounts from Russia that purchased political advertising to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.
As they prepare to be hauled before Senate and House intelligence committees next week to testify on how Russia may have advertised on their services to sway public sentiment, these colossal information portals are being cast as the Wild West of the Internet, with too few checks and balances on their growing power over people's time and advertisers' pocketbooks.
"I believe it's an honest mistake but it doesn't look good because it's an overstatement and when they have mistakes it's always overstating and not understating," Dennis Yu, chief technology officer of BlitzMetrics, said of the Twitter measurement error.
More: Twitter overcounted active users since 2014; shares surge More: Twitter bans Russia-backed outlets RT and Sputnik from advertising over election meddling More: Facebook apologizes for inflating video numbers The challenge: It's not as simple as you might imagine to figure out how many people use a social media service.
Counting errors can occur as they did with Twitter.
Social media companies also include all kinds of users, from businesses to publishers.
Duplicate accounts when a person has more than one Facebook or Twitter account, say one for themselves, one for their business, one for their child and another for their pet can also inflate numbers.
And then there are the fake accounts and accounts that are run by bots, not humans, that these companies are constantly trying to root out and remove.
Duplicates and bots That's why third-party measurements often conflict with measurements provided by the companies themselves, says eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson.
For example, eMarketer factored out bots, duplicate accounts and spam accounts to estimate that Facebook had 1.37 billion monthly active users in 2016.
Facebook calculated it had 1.86 billion monthly users at the end of 2016.
"Duplicate" accounts (an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her main account) represented 6% of monthly active users and fake accounts represented 1% of its user base in 2016, according to Facebook.
"Digital media measurement has never been as exact a science as you would think," Williamson said.
"People used to call the Internet 'the most measurable medium,' but there have been many instances over the years where things like user counts have been under- or over-stated."
More: Twitter removed 200 Russian accounts that targeted Facebook users during election More: Those Russian political ads on Facebook?
Yep, they ran on Instagram, too Twitter, which has struggled to add users amid withering competition from Google, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, on Thursday revised down its monthly active users by 1 million to 2 million for each of the past three quarters.
It said it miscalculated monthly users because it included third party applications that should not have been counted.
"It's important to note that since it's a small absolute number on a base of over 300 million (monthly active users), that historical growth rates and absolute numbers really don't change very much," Twitter's chief financial officer Ned Segal said during a conference call with analysts.
Investors shrugged at the disclosure.
But this isn't the first time Twitter has had a problem with how it's measuring its audience.
In 2016, it briefly miscalculated metrics on video ad campaigns, which it blamed on a technical error.
Twitter's also constantly trying to weed out fake or spambot accounts.
As much as 15% of Twitter's user base may be bots, according to research from the University of Southern California and Indiana University.
Automated systems catch more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts a week, Twitter says.
Spam accounts that Twitter has identified are not included in the active user numbers reported to shareholders, the company says.
And Twitter estimates that fake or spam accounts represent less than 5% of its monthly active users.
Twitter is far from the only company facing criticism over measurement errors.
Facebook vs. the U.S. Census Facebook (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) In September Facebook was accused of overestimating its reach with young people.
That's when Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser noted that Facebook claimed to advertisers it could reach 25 million more young Americans than the U.S. Census reports exist.
According to Facebook's Ad Manager, a planning tool for marketers to consult before purchasing ad campaigns, advertisers could reach 41 million 18- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. and 60 million 25- to 34-year-olds.
Wieser pointed out that the census counted just 31 million 18-to-24-year-olds and 45 million 25-to-34-year-olds last year.
Facebook said the numbers are self-reported by users and include non-residents and it said the estimates are based on "Facebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices and other factors."
The estimated reach advertisers are given does not determine how much they pay for the ads and advertisers mostly focus on how well their campaigns perform.
Still, the discrepancy has shaken the confidence of advertisers who are keen on Facebook's targeting power and extensive reach but are frustrated by a series of audience measurement misstatements including how long and how often people watch videos and read articles on Facebook.
"Advertisers are frustrated, and the underlying drivers may be the source of the concerns that regulators and politicians have about them in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere," Wieser said.
"However, were not seeing it in the numbers yet, which is why investors havent expressed much concern."
More: Facebook: 10 million people saw Russia-backed election ads More: USA TODAY Poll: Facebook faulted for not doing more on Russian ads in 2016 race Those misstatements have escalated calls for independent oversight and for the companies to submit to measurement conducted by third-party companies.
This week Twitter agreed to be audited through the Media Rating Council, the media industrys measurement watchdog.
The audit will evaluate how accurately the social media company reports ad impressions and video views.
The decision follows Facebook's move earlier this year to allow the information it provides advertisers to be audited by the Media Rating Council.
It also says it's offering new tools for advertisers to judge the performance of their campaigns.
"Any company that does business with a digital publisher shouldnt let them grade their own homework," Williamson said.
"Its always going to make sense to look to other sources of information about usage, and to ask questions if something doesnt seem right."

Nearly 40,000 of the 50,000 packing, sorting and shipping jobs will be full time.
AP A logo for Amazon appears on a logistics center near Berlin.
(Photo: John MacDougall, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Amazon has been on a hiring spree, increasing its staff by 77% in the past year to 541,900 full and part-time workers, due largely to its purchase of Whole Foods as well as a rapid buildout of its regional warehouses.
That number doesn't include the more than 120,000 seasonal jobs it says it expects to hire for over the holidays.
Another staffing bump came from Amazon's acquisition of Souq.com, a Middle East-based e-commerce company, in July.
Amazon's headcount is up 42% year over year without Souq and Whole Foods included, staff said on the company's earnings call Thursday afternoon.
That places Amazon second only to Walmart, with 2.3 million workers, among publicly-traded U.S. companies.
Kroger, with 433,000, is No.
3, according to company filings.
The surge comes as the Seattle-based company announced its third-quarter earnings, which blew past Wall Street's expectations and caused its stock to leap 7.7%, to $1,045 per share in after-hours trading.
The consensus estimate from S&P Capital IQ had been for a Amazon loss of one cent per share.
Amazon smashed that with a gain of 52 cents per share.
Despite increased spending, including of the newly-completed purchase of Whole Foods Markets for $13.7 billion in August, net income rose to $256 million from $252 million a year ago.
The company reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up 34%, helped by $1.3 billion in sales at Whole Foods.
In its release, Amazon vowed to continue the downward pressure on prices at often-pricey Whole Foods, saying "the two companies together will pursue the vision of making high-quality, natural and organic food affordable to everyone."
The staffing numbers come as 238 cities nationwide are vying to be the location of the company's second headquarters, eager for the high-paying tech jobs and economic impact one of America's biggest companies would bring.
It expects to employ 50,000 in its second headquarters.
Once again, Amazon's bottom line was buoyed by its hugely profitable cloud services division, AWS.
This quarter it had revenue $4.58 billion.

Google's main campus at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway in Sunnyvale, CA on Monday, April 27, 2015 (Photo: Martin E. Klimek, USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Is it possible to win so much that you end up losing?
That's one question facing Google and some of its tech compatriots as they prepare to testify before congressional investigations into Russian meddling next week.
Google continues to pile on billions in ad revenue every quarter.
But like its chief rival Facebook, it's being pressured to rein in its hyper-efficient advertising machine.
Google and Facebook dominate the U.S. digital ad market Google will take 42% and Facebook 21% of U.S. digital ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer.
But pressure to limit the spread of fake news and curb foreign influence in elections could crimp revenue and raise costs in the future if the companies, for instance, have to add further human oversight to their machine-powered algorithms.
Both Facebook and Twitter have already announced plans to make political ads more transparent in line with a bill introduced last week by Sens.
Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar.
Facebook said it was adding 1,000 human checkers to review ads.
Google hasn't said how it might comply with potential new rules around political ads, but observers say it's unlikely to get a free pass from Congress.
"It's hard to know whether Congress or regulators will actually step up and regulate the company, but there seems to be a newfound willingness to consider such action," says Daniel Stevens, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog that tracks Google spending on lobbyists and academics.
"Google, like every other industry, should not be left to its own devices."
Google was hit in June with a $2.9 billion fine by European Union for harming competitors, and in response, it has tweaked its product search results in Europe by allowing competitive online retailers to bid for premium spots in a search results pane.
EU regulators have said they will keep a watchful eye on whether the adjustment actually gives equal treatment to rivals.
Neither Google CEO Sundar Pichai nor Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., mentioned the Russia probe or congressional hearings on a call with analysts Thursday.
The most the company has said publicly is a statement it issued last week, in which it offered support for "efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures, and reduce foreign abuse."
Google added that it is "evaluating" further steps of its own and pledged to work closely with government and industry to "explore the best solutions."
Alphabet posted third-quarter revenues, excluding that shared with partners, that rose 22% to $22.27 billion.
Net income rose to $6.73 billion from $5.06 billion a year ago, a 33% increase.
The profit jump was a surprise to analysts, and Alphabet shares rose 3% in after-hours trading.
Monica Peart, senior forecasting director with eMarketer, says increased revenue is largely coming from higher-cost segments like mobile search and YouTube, where Google ends up sharing a bigger portion of ad revenue with partners like cellphone makers and video creators.
Meanwhile, research and development costs continue to rise up 17% to $4.21 billion as Google and other Alphabet units plow more money into artificial intelligence, Google-branded hardware such as the Pixel phone and Home smart speaker, and so-called moonshot projects like its Project Loon balloons, which were recently deployed to deliver internet access to hurricane-ravaged parts of Puerto Rico.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The high performance Chromebook.
Time Google Pixelbook can be folded into different positions (Photo: Google) This isnt the first time Google has asked you to spend a grand or more for one of its own cloud and browser-based Chrome OS laptops.
The Pixelbook, though, might just be the first pricey Google-branded Chromebook to legitimately tempt you to part with such a lofty sum.
Chromebooks are their own breed of computer, of course, distinct from the Mac or Windows PCs.
They rely on Google's Chrome operating system and--most of the time-- an Internet connection where the files and apps, several but not all from Google, typically reside.
Pixelbook is a beautiful, thin and well-constructed 2 pound aluminum and glass piece of hardware, with a 360-degree hinge that lets you fold the thing into a tablet, prop it up to watch a movie, or use more conventionally like any laptop.
It is, for lack of a better way of putting it, a 4-in-1.
I immediately took to the full size backlit Qwerty keyboard I used to produce this column, comfortably resting my wrists on silicon pads as I typed.
Converted into a tablet or tent mode to use the touchscreen, the exposed physical keys are properly deactivated.
I also appreciated that the obedient Google Assistant you may frequently summon on your Android phone worked here.
The bad news is the price: Google is asking you to spend $999 on up for Pixelbook, and regrettably that doesnt count the $99 extra for the optional stylus.
Competing in the high rent district Nice as the hardware is, including the 12.3-inch touch display, Google finds itself competing in the high-rent computing neighborhood occupied by various Apple MacBooks (or even fully-specd iPad Pros), Microsofts Surface models, and other premium Windows PCs.
Some of you will undoubtedly want to stick with Mac OS or Windows.
I dont blame you.
Though there are a range of available models, mostly when you think of Chromebooks, you think cheap.
Indeed, a quick search inside Amazon yields numerous Chromebooks that can be had for $200 or less, one of the reasons theyve become so popular in the classroom.
Google Pixelbook and optional Pixelbook Pen (Photo: Google) Theres nothing cheap about the way the Pixelbook was made, and Google has made great strides through the years with Chrome OS.
You'll still be hamstrung when youre offline but less so.
More: Review: Google Pixel 2 phone challenges iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy More: Why does Google think you'll buy a $1,000 Chromebook?
You may have forgotten by now, but back in 2013, Google actually sold what was called the Chromebook Pixel.
It cost $1,299 at the outset and had limited storage, poor battery life and often required an active connection to the Internet.
Google made improvements two years later when it released another since-retired expensive Chromebook Pixel model, but still there were shortcomings.
Using Android apps Todays Pixelbook isnt flawless either, but theres a lot more you can do with the machine.
It runs state-of-the-art Intel processors, and you can get it with 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of storage.
I didn't run a formal battery test and Google says you can get up to ten hours, but based on my usage I felt it gave way a little shorter than that.
But the machine does charge quickly.
(You can use either of two USB-C ports to do so.)
Most notably, through the Google Play Store you can download Android apps onto the Pixelbook.
While such apps havent always been optimized for the form factor, you appreciate the wide choice of available options.
I did bump into quirks.
Inside the Spotify Android app, for example, a message appeared on the screen that said, This application needs to restart to resize and may not work well when resized.
Help from Google Assistant Having the Google Assistant around is certainly convenient and evens the score with Apple and Microsoft, which let you access their own respective digital assistants, Siri and Cortana, on Macs and Windows computers.
You can summon the Google Assistant on the Pixelbook by pressing a dedicated key on the keyboard and typing a request or by barking out the familiar OK Google command.
If you type, the Google Assistant will respond silently.
If you use your voice, the Assistant will respond in kind.
The Assistant will also detect what is on the screen and take a stab at just what it is you might be looking to do.
It often got it right.
When the pen is mightier Meanwhile, if you buy the optional Pixelbook Pen, you have a clever way to get help from the Assistant.
You can press and hold the button on the stylus and circle text on the screen.
Though it didnt work every time, Google Assistant recognized, for example, various names that I circled, including the Asian restaurant, Nobu and the violinist and composer Paganini.
It works with pictures I circled, too, correctly identifying President John F. Kennedy, Taylor Swift and former New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi.
You can also use the pen to draw or write inside various apps.
I didnt experience serious lag, at least in the apps I tried.
The pen operates on a single AAAA battery, and theres no need to pair it with the Pixelbook.
My biggest gripe about the pen aside from its extra cost: theres no slot or place to store the pen without springing for another accessory.
If youre like me, the question is not if you'll lose the pen but when.
There are a lot to reasons to recommend the Pixelbook.
One of them isn't the price.

The Nintendo icons latest adventure, Super Mario Odyssey, is pure delight.
It combines everything you expect from a Mario video game, incorporating his signature red hat in fun and fresh ways.
Odyssey, available Friday for the Nintendo Switch, puts Mario in a familiar position: rescuing Princess Peach from the hands of his nemesis, Bowser.
This time, Bowser plots a wedding, kidnapping Peach for his bride.
Mario must travel the world following Bowser as he collects items for the planned nuptials.
Mario follows Bowser in a ship called the Odyssey, fueled by power moons he must collect in each of the kingdoms he visits.
Luckily, Mario has help in the form of Cappy, a magical hat taking the form of Marios red cap, as well as other headwear available in later sections of the game.
Mario tosses Cappy in 'Super Mario Odyssey.'
(Photo: Nintendo) Cappy proves useful to Mario as he embarks on his journey.
Players can toss Marios cap in a variety of ways to defeat enemies, or he can control them to help navigate through each of the kingdoms.
For example, in an early destination called the Sand Kingdom, players will encounter multiple platforms too far for Mario to reach by jumping.
Swarming the platforms is the classic Mario baddie Bullet Bill, a giant bullet that will follow Mario once it finds him.
Thanks to Cappy, users can possess Bills form and fly to the platform with no trouble.
Players will find this useful capturing enemies with long legs capable of reaching tall platforms, or possessing fish to swim in areas where Mario couldnt survive.
It adds a new fun layer to Super Marios stellar navigating and puzzle solving.
Mario sleeps next to a T. Rex in 'Super Mario Odyssey.'
(Photo: Nintendo) Nintendo encourages players to use Switch in tabletop mode, where the device is propped up by kickstand while players hold the motion controllers in each hand.
This allows for multiple ways to toss Cappy, such as a quick side swipe to perform a spin throw, or shaking both controllers so Mario can roll down hills.
However, any controller format works, but certain moves might be trickier to execute.
Two people can play together, too, with one player as Mario and another as Cappy.
As if Mario and Cappy weren't charming enough, players can choose to dress them in outfits linked to the kingdom they visit, available to purchase with coins in special shops.
So, in one kingdom based primarily in water, Mario can buy swim goggles and swimwear.
Ultimately, Odyssey is great because it sticks to what makes Super Mario video games entertaining.
You get to run and jump through interesting worlds deserts, jungles and a downtown metropolis and play the hero.
If you own a Switch, it's a journey you must take.

USA TODAY Google's Pixel 2 XL smartphone displays the name "Fantasy," the Earth Wind & Fire song it hears.
(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) Google says it's investigating the root of a potential "burn-in" problem spotted by some reviewers of its new Pixel 2 XL phones.
Whatever it turns up, the fact that Google is even in this position has to give pause to a company that hopes to challenge the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy handsets.
Google claims that it knows about just a small number of screen problems.
But it is hardly the kind of optics Google needs as it tries to make the case for Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL phones, which start at $649 and $849, respectively, and have earned mostly rave reviews, largely on the strength of their cameras.
Now some are questioning whether the display could be a deal breaker.
More: Review: Google Pixel 2 phone challenges iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy If Google allowed a device to have their brand on it and have a bad quality display... this is not a good sign for this brand, says Ron Mertens, CEO of OLED-Info, an Israel-based self-described knowledge hub that focuses on emerging next-generation displays.
Will it blow over or become a full-blown crisis?
Google's Pixel 2 XL Phone (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) Other potentially damaging issues have surfaced, too.
Some users have complained in online Google forums about a high pitch or clicking sound during phone calls.
A Google community manager inside the forum said Google is looking into this matter as well, and promised a more definitive response soon.
Its not that unusual for certain issues to bubble up once a high-profile tech product is introducedthe key question is how widespread the incidents turn out to be.
It's too early to know whether the Pixel problems could escalate into a full-blown crisis along the lines, say, of Samsungs disastrous experience with the thrice-recalled Galaxy Note 7.
More: Some iPhone 8 Plus owners report swelling battery problem It's not just Google.
There were reports earlier this month that a small number of batteries in Apple's new iPhone 8 Plus phones swelled, causing the case to pop open.
At the time, Apple said it was looking into the matter but has offered no further explanation since.
Given the competitive nature of the business, the various incidents at least raise questions generally about whether engineers are pushing the smartphone manufacturing process too hard.
Bloomberg reported that Apple let suppliers reduce the accuracy of the Face ID system to speed up production of its upcoming iPhone X, which already appear to be in short supply.
Apple denies the report and issued a statement to USA TODAY: Bloombergs claim that Apple has reduced the accuracy spec for Face ID is completely false and we expect Face ID to be the new gold standard for facial authentication.
(Photo: Apple) What is burn-in?
These reports come as the major handset makers try to excite consumers with finer displays, whose cutting edge tech helps explain the $1,000 price tags.
The focus on this feature makes reports of screen problems particularly disheartening.
What's going on?
The burn-in problem that at least some Pixel 2 XLs seem to be exhibiting refers to the ghosted logos, icons or other images from a previous screen that may appear below the current screen that you are looking at, and is usually more evident when youre looking at a gray screen.
Whats potentially worrisome in Googles case is that signs of burn-in are appearing this early in the products life cycle.
People sometimes refer to burn-in and another term you hear thrown about, image retention, interchangeably, but there are technical distinctions.
Its possible that these phones are having trouble with image retention, which can be temporary, or that the Pixel display issue only impacts a small number of units, perhaps caused by manufacturing problems with OLED materials.
In fact, for all their advantages, OLED displays may be more susceptible to the burn-in problem.
Mertens says he has been getting MANY reports from people complaining about burn-in issues with their phones, tablets, TVs and other OLED devices.
This is certainly real, he says.
With OLEDs, the organic emitters have a limited life span, more limited, for example, than LCDs.
So the basic problem with OLEDs is that if you show a certain image for a long time, these pixels tend to be less bright then the ones around them.
Suffice to say many people will be scrutinizing the OLED display on the upcoming iPhone X.
The flexible 6-inch pOLED display used in the Pixel 2 XL were made by LG Display, a company that also produces OLED panels for TVs as well as for the Apple Watch.
Mertens says the displays used on Pixel 2 XLs were made in a new production fab that has had quality issues.
But display expert Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies Corporation, has a more cautionary explanation: Very few reviewers understand current display technology, which gives rise to lots of bogus claims.
You can't simply eyeball mobile and TV display performance anymore.
The displays are now considerably more complex with lots of internal modes and variables that need to be properly lab tested, measured, and evaluated."
That appears to be what Google is doing now.
On the Pixel, some people have also noted that that there are color or brightness shifts when you hold the phone at an angle.
This was the case on a pair of Pixel 2 XL phones that USA TODAY tested.
There is a visible bluish-gray tint when you twist the phone to a certain angle, perhaps more pronounced than on some phones.
But all displays, including OLEDs and LCDs show some color and/or brightness shifts when viewed at different angles.
With all these unknowns, it wouldn't be surprising if consumers decide to sit on their wallets and wait.
For a device you may gaze at more than any other object, the last thing you want is an imperfect display.

LOS ANGELES The iPhone X is one of the must-have tech gadgets of the year, and even with a starting price of $999, the device is expected to sell out immediately when Apple lets shoppers start ordering the phone Friday at 3:01 a.m.
ET.
What to do?
The new iPhone 8, iPhone X and iPhone 8S are displayed during an Apple special event at the Steve Jobs Theatre on the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017 in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Don't stand online The phone will be in stores on November 3, but tech analysts say Apple has supply constraints that will make it harder than usual to get hold of the newest iPhone.
That means camping outside stores for hours, or even days, to grab a phone without a re-order may be a fool's errand.
Savvy customers know to jump online the minute sales begin, and put in their order promptly, at Apple.com or via one of the major phone carriers that sell iPhones, like Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint.
Apple responds on a first-come, first-serve basis.
The earlier you get your pre-order in, the sooner the new phone should arrive to you.
The phone will be delivered to you, or you can arrange for in-store pick-up.
In the past, pre-sales have sold out for opening day within 5 minutes, notes Creative Strategies tech analyst Ben Bajarin.
This year, due to supply constraints for the X, due to some of the newer parts that haven't been used in mass production before, it's expected to sell out even more quickly.
More: Why you'll need to wait seven weeks for iPhone X to go on sale Apple.com or Apple Store App?
In years past, the Apple.com website got jammed up from all the activity.
So heres a tip: download the Apple Store app and shop there.
But youll need to make several decisions first.
Know your choices now.
What color do you want?
Your choices are space gray or silver.
How much are you willing to pay?
The phone starts at $999 with 64 GB of storage, or $49.91 monthly for two years via Apple's lease program, or $1,149 ($56.16 monthly) with 256 GB of storage.
Dont fumble at midnight trying to figure it out, says Michael Schneider of Los Angeles, who pre-orders a new iPhone every year when they first go on sale.
He always pays full price, and then re-sells his old phone via the third-party buy/sell site Gazelle so he doesnt have to waste valuable time dealing with the wireless carriers.
For pricing, think long and hard about storage.
Can you live with 64 GB?
Remember that those 4K videos and new augmented reality apps add up fast.
If youre going to spend this kind of money on the phone, spring for the 256 GB option.
On a monthly basis, its only $6 more expensive: $56.16 monthly vs. $49.91.
More: How to make the most money selling your old iPhone More: How to switch from Android to iPhone, and what you lose if you do More: How to set up a new iPhone the right way Speaking of trade-ins: The wireless carriers are offering generous incentives to buy the phone from them, with anywhere from $300-$350 off the purchase price, and some fine print involved as well.
Read the specs now from your carriers.
You can pre-order from them, too.
Apple.com or ATT.com?
There is a school of thought that the wireless carrier websites might see less traffic than Apple.com, and thus, be easier to break through Friday morning.
But Jeff Caldwell of Portland, who buys a new iPhone on pre-sale night every year, says both are tough nuts to crack.
Every year ATTs site is bogged down and it takes up to 45 minutes to get my order though, he says.
Ive also tried ordering through Apple with the same or worse results.
Have your carrier info ready.
If you want to renew an agreement, have your social security, account number and passwords ready, but remember that you can buy the phone unlocked, and bring it into the wireless stores to set up in a less rushed atmosphere.
Do you need it?
The new iPhone is the first re-designed model since 2014s iPhone 6, with the removal of bezels for a larger, edge to edge and brighter OLED screen and facial recognition to unlock the phone.
In the past, Apple would sell around 10 million iPhones opening weekend.
But this year, analyst KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts Apple will only have 2-3 million iPhone Xs available for the weekend.
Good luck Friday morning.
And if you dont get through, theres always Saturday.
The phone will get to you a little later, but Apple is in the business of taking peoples money.
Youll eventually get an iPhone X sent to your door.
If you cant wait, you can always go to eBay, where resellers are optimistically already offering iPhone X units for as much as $3,500.
And Apple has plenty of older iPhones to sell you as well, starting at $349 for the iPhone SE.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Twitter confirms Russian accounts may have influenced the presidential election by spreading fake content across its site.
Now the company says its taking preventative measures.
Buzz60 The Twitter logo at the company's headquarters in San Francisco.
(Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO After facing criticism for not taking Russian meddling in the U.S. election seriously enough, Twitter took one of the most aggressive moves yet, banning the Kremlin-backed Russia Today and Sputnik news outlets from advertising on the social media service.
"This decision was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 U.S. election and the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government," the company said in a blog post.
The ban comes as the United States pressures Russia Today to register as a foreign agent, meaning its content would be labeled propaganda.
Both outlets will be allowed to maintain their Twitter accounts, the company said.
In a statement posted on Facebook, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, blamed the influence of American intelligence officials.
"It is clear that the obstruction of the Russian media, including through the arsenal of intelligence services, shows a flagrant violation by the United States of America of both international and domestic legislation guaranteeing freedom of expression," Zakharova wrote.
"Joining this campaign by private corporations is indicative of an unprecedented attack by American media outlets."
RT accused Twitter of publishing a report that included confidential data on RT ad campaigns.
The report, RT said a blog post, "implied that the channel was trying to influence Twitter users via advertising on the platform."
The allegation is "absolutely groundless and greatly misleading," the blog post said.
Off-boarding advertising from all accounts owned by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik.
Were donating all projected earnings ($1.9mm) to support external research into the use of Twitter in elections, including use of malicious automation and misinformation.
https://t.co/zIxfqqXCZr jack (@jack) October 26, 2017 Twitter said it did not arrive at the decision lightly, but is taking this step now "as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter."
The San Francisco company will donate an estimated $1.9 million earned from RT ads since 2011 to "support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections, including use of malicious automation and misinformation, with an initial focus on elections and automation."
Last month Twitter told lawmakers it found some 200 accounts linked to the same Russian groups that bought $100,000 worth of ads on Facebook to sow political unrest and manipulate U.S. voters during the presidential election.
The Twitter accounts, which were taken down over the last month, were linked to 470 accounts and pages that Facebook traced to the International Research Agency, an entity known as a troll farm that unleashes fake social media accounts to stir controversy and conflict.
More: Twitter to disclose info on political ads as Russia scrutiny intensifies More: House Intel leaders to release Facebook ads purchased by Kremlin-linked groups More: Facebook political ads are coming out of the shadows why you should care Twitter's presentation on Capitol Hill drew sharp criticism from a key senator who accused the social media company of not being aggressive enough in probing Russian interference in the election.
Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told reporters that the presentation was "inadequate on almost every level" and showed "an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions, and, again, begs many more questions than they answered."
Technology giants Facebook and Google are also on the hot seat with lawmakers.
Next week all three companies will send their general counsels to testify before the Senate and House intelligence committees on how Russia may have used their services to influence the presidential election.
Senators introduced a bipartisan bill last week that would require the companies to disclose who is paying for political ads that appear on their online platforms.
The legislation by Sens.
Mark Warner, D-Va., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and John McCain, R-Ariz., comes in the wake of recent revelations that Kremlin-linked groups exploited American social media to try to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Those Russian efforts have been continuing as the U.S. heads into the 2018 congressional elections, the senators said.
"Twitters announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets RT and Sputnik from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute for passing the Honest Ads Act, which would ensure that all online platforms are held to the same transparency standards in place for broadcasters including disclosure and disclaimer requirements," Klobuchar said in a statement.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook The logo for Reddit, a San Francisco-based internet bulletin board, discussion and social media aggregation site.
(Photo: Reddit) SAN FRANCISCO The famous "anything goes" online discussion forum Reddit does have limits and it's now drawn them at Nazis and white supremacists who espouse violence.
The site posted an update Wednesday saying it would take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people.
The San Francisco-based company that runs the site has shut down at least ten discussion topics, called sub-reddits, including ones titled NationalSocialism, Nazi, EuropeanNationalism and DylannRoofInnocent.
Dylann Roof, a self-avowed white supremacist, murdered nine people at a Bible study class at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. in 2015.
Most of the groups had between 7,000 and 25 members.
In a posting about Community Restrictions, the site said it understands that "there are sometimes reasons to post violent content (e.g., educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary, etc.)
so if youre going to post something violent in nature that does not violate these terms, ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear."
Reddit will also cut content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals, though that ban does not apply to discussions of hunting.
Reddit is sometimes called the front page of the Internet in part due to its voting system, which allows registered users to vote on topics which they consider most interesting.
Submissions that get the most votes appear on the sites front page or the top of their category.
Until 2015 Reddit did not ban any material as long as it was legal.
Beginning then, it cut some specifically hate-oriented discussion groups.
At the time, CEO Steve Huffman banned certain discussion groups he termed "particularly awful."
Others that contained material that might be considered extremely offensive to the average user were made available only to those users who explicitly opted into them, a policy Reddit called "Quarantining."

Video provided by Newsy Newslook The New York attorney general has opened an inquiry into the Weinstein Company.
(Photo: YANN COATSALIOU, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Call it the Harvey Weinstein effect.
In years past, powerful men busted for preying on women could pay out large sums in legal settlements or issue public apologies and pledges to reform and then keep right on doing what they were doing.
No longer.
Women breaking the culture of silence are putting unprecedented pressure on companies and whole industries to crack down on sexual misconduct in the workplace.
From ESPN abruptly canceling a deal with Barstool Sports over growing criticism of the controversial sport media outlet's sexist content, to New Orleans celebrity chef John Besh stepping down from the company he founded over sexual harassment allegations lodged against him and other male employees, the nation's tolerance for men behaving badly has reached an all-time low.
Tales of sexual misconduct have barreled into the headlines for decades.
What's different this time?
Not the egregious details but perhaps how people are reacting to Weinstein's behavior, says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, which fights for women's rights.

Or this could be Groundhog Day for sexual harassment a fleeting moment of national outrage that returns us to the status quo with women, like Weinstein's accusers, continuing to silently suffer through on-the-job abuse so they don't torpedo their careers.
"Why did this happen to these women?
Its economic status.
Theyre looking for a career, a job, a promotion," says Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization of Women.
"As long as we keep women from earning a rightful living in every sense of the word, we won't change."
More: Anita Hill on O'Reilly harassment charges: People need to keep coming forward More: Harvey Weinstein scandal: Total accusers pass 50 women More: Harvey Weinstein scandal: New accuser files first lawsuit against Weinstein Company This time around there's a key new ingredient in play that's helping to fuel more disclosures and build solidarity for women: social media.
Hundreds of thousands of women began posting their own experiences of sexual misconduct under the hashtag #MeToo.
After investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed decades of Weinstein's predatory misbehavior, the consequences were harsh and swift.
Accused by dozens of women, including major celebrities, Weinstein was canned from his job running the movie studio that bears his name and from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild.
And he's being investigated by the LAPD for a rape allegation.
In recent days, Weinstein has denied non-consensual sex and said he has a different recollection of events.
That dizzying fall fueled a domino effect that has touched workplaces across the country.
In August, producer Isa Hackett accused Amazon Studios chief Roy Price of making unwanted sexual remarks in technology news outlet The Information.
It wasn't until after the Weinstein scandal broke that Price was forced out.
More allegations erupted from the movie industry with the Los Angeles Times reporting that 38 women had come forward to accuse director James Toback of sexual harassment.
Toback has denied the charges, but the total number of women making accusations now tops 200.
This week, senior political analyst Mark Halperin, who often appears on MSNBC and NBC News, is leaving his contributor post after five women said he sexually harassed them while he held a powerful position at ABC News more than a decade ago.
On Tuesday, one-time New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier apologized to past staffers for behavior that accusers say included inappropriate touching.
The Emerson Collective, a philanthropic organization led by Steve Jobs' widow Laurene Powell Jobs, immediately pulled its support for a magazine Wieseltier was set to publish.
Fashion photographer Terry Richardson, who has taken photos of Beyonce, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, was banned by Conde Nast for sexual assault allegations that have been circulating since 2010.
In a statement, Richardson admitted he sometimes behaved in a sexually explicit manner during photo shoots.
And Abigail Johnson, the chief executive of Fidelity Investments, told employees that the financial giant has no tolerance for misconduct after reports emerged alleging two company executives had been forced out for sexual harassment.

Yet, it's not clear that America is ready to take the shocking disclosures trickling out of nearly every sector of the economy as seriously as it should.
Exhibit A: Many powerful men have faced serious allegations yet few consequences.
A prime example: Singer R. Kelly has emerged relatively unscathed from accusations of underage sex and abusive treatment of women after reports in BuzzFeed and Rolling Stone.
Kelly, who denied the allegations through his attorney, canceled a few dates on his concert tour.
Dozens of women have accused Bill Cosby of using date-rape drugs to molest them throughout his career.
Yet, despite the multitude of victims, a judge in his June sexual assault trial declared a mistrial after jurors said they were deadlocked after six days of deliberations.
He will be retried, prosecutors say.
One of the most famous incidents the Access Hollywood tape released right before the election of then Republican candidate Donald Trump boasting of groping or impulsively kissing women didn't derail his campaign.
A month later, he won the election with the support of 42% of women, a shocking development to many who turned out in the millions in national marches to protest his remarks.
And, if history is any guide, workplace-rattling change will not come easily.
Consider that the term sexual harassment was coined by author and journalist Lin Farley in the mid-1970s.
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that sexual harassment was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
And, in 1991, Anita Hill thrust sexual harassment into national debate during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
In April, Hill told USA TODAY that it was time for a nation that too willingly accepts men's excuses to change the status quo.
"We have a whole host of people accepting that as just something men do as opposed to understanding it as predatory behavior that is not only immoral but is also illegal," Hill said.
The nation's response to charges of sexual harassment began to shift in July 2016 when Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit forced the resignation of Roger Ailes, chairman and chief executive of Fox News.
That a woman could take down a man of his power and stature emboldened more women to come forward and for more journalists to pursue the rumors and whisper about Bill O'Reilly and Weinstein.
Bill O'Reilly (Photo: Jeff Christensen, AP) Heads quickly began to roll, turning 2017 into the year sexual misconduct became a fireable offense.
Six women have reached settlements with Fox News or O'Reilly after having made allegations against the host, whom the network fired in April, according to TheNew York Times.
O'Reilly has repeatedly denied charges of wrongdoing, as did Ailes before his death.
Software engineer Susan Fowler's blog post about sexual harassment and misconduct at Uber ignited an uproar, toppling CEO Travis Kalanick and unleashing a series of revelations in Silicon Valley that led to the ouster of two technology investors, Dave McClure and Justin Caldbeck.
Now Fowler is a celebrity in the business world, is working on a book and has a Hollywood movie deal.
And she and others are pushing for fundamental changes in business practices and laws to protect women at work.
In August, Fowler petitioned the Supreme Court to consider her experience as it decides whether employees can be forced to abandon their right to pursue class-action lawsuits when they agree in their employment contracts to resolve grievances through arbitration.
California is now considering legislation that would prohibit investors from sexually harassing company founders.
Another bill would ban secret settlements in sexual harassment cases.
And while there have been no official changes yet to corporate policies, one legal expert predicts that the practice of general counsels rubber-stamping payments to victims will start to fade.
"If anyone out there just saw this as ever being 'fun' behavior, it's very clear now that it's expensive fun, and company-threatening fun," says Joan Williams, a law professor at the University of California-Hastings and director of the Center for WorkLife Law.
"Will this all end?
No it won't.
But it will become less common, and when it happens it will last less long.
Sexual harassment complaints are now the invisible buzzsaw that can cut down your career or company."

USA TODAY High-tech evangelist Robert Scoble says he did not sexually harass women because he had no power to make or break their careers.
(Photo: Niall Carson, PA Wire/Press Association Images) SAN FRANCISCO Robert Scoble, the high-tech evangelist who last week apologized for his treatment of women and resigned from his business consulting firm, says he denies sexual misconduct charges leveled against him.
He also says he's not guilty of sexual harassment because he had no power to "make or break" the careers of women who made allegations against him.
In a blog post Wednesday, Scoble defended himself against the allegations.
"In the past week several news outlets reported that I had committed numerous sexual indiscretions against numerous women.
I am sorry that so many women feel wronged by me, but I hope to set at least some of the record straight," he wrote.
He also noted that he did not manage any of the women in question nor was he in a position of power over them.
"I dont have employees, I dont cut checks for investment.
None of the women who came forward were ever in a position where I could make or break their careers.
Sexual Harassment requires that I have such power," he said.
In an earlier interview with USA TODAY, Scoble apologized for his behavior after two women stepped forward to accuse him of sexual harassment.
"I did some things that are really, really hurtful to the women and I feel ashamed by that," Scoble told USA TODAY.
"I have taken many steps to try to get better because I knew some of this was potentially going to come out."
Stanford law professor Michele Dauber said Scoble's assertion that he did not sexually harass the women because they didn't work for him or seek financial backing from him is dubious at best.
More: #MeToo sex harassment charges hit Silicon Valley; Robert Scoble says 'I feel ashamed' More: Why #MeToo is taking over your social media feeds "Sexual harassment is unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that includes sexual requests, touching, comments, and other kinds of unwanted conduct.
Whether or not that harassment can lead to money damages because it was either a quid pro quo or created a hostile environment can depend on whether it is sufficiently severe or pervasive and what the relationship between the parties is," Dauber said.
"Even if the conduct does not create legal liability it can still be harassing, and it's pathetic weak sauce to hear a man facing so many disgusting allegations to defend himself by saying 'but I don't have to pay any money for it.'"
The allegations against Scoble have garnered headlines in the tech world because of his outsized influence with industry leaders.
He's a fixture at technology conferences and has a massive following on social media.
His booming presence in tech began with his Scobleizer blog in 2000, which became a springboard for roles at a series of technology companies including Microsoft, Rackspace, and most recently, UploadVR, which recently settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with a former employee.
Silicon Valley's sexual harassment scandal over the summer exposed tales of bad behavior by venture capitalists, two of whom, Dave McClure and Justin Caldbeck, resigned.
The removal of two prominent investors sent shock waves through Silicon Valley, where for years there were few consequences for sexist and predatory behavior.
The women who spoke publicly about Caldbeck said he made sexual overtures during business dealings, including conversations about funding a persistent power dynamic that several women said pressured them into acquiescing or staying silent in the aftermath.
More recently, charges that powerful producer Harvey Weinstein for years sexually harassed women in Hollywood, leveraging his ability to make careers, has sparked a new national conversations about why such behavior can go unchecked.
A viral #MeToo movement has sprung up on social media with women coming forward with their stories of sexual harassment.

Angela Moore reports.
Video provided by Reuters Newslook Twitter shares surged 18% after it said it was getting closer to profitability.
(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) Twitter revealed Thursday it had included users of third-party applications that should not have counted as part of the social media company's user base.
Since the fourth quarter of 2014, Twitter was counting an average of 1 million to 2 million users extra per quarter, said the company in its letter to shareholders detailing third quarter results.
The applications used a software development kit called Digits, "which did not relate to activity on the Twitter platform," read an excerpt from the letter.
For Twitter's previous quarter, its adjusted monthly active users hit 326 million, instead of the 328 million first reported.
The daily active user count was not affected and grew 14% since this time last year.
Twitter shares surged 18% after the company beat expectations on revenue and gave higher-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter.
The company reported a 4% increase in monthly active users year over year to 330 million.
Third-quarter revenue reached $590 million, down 4% from a year ago.The company said in its guidance for next quarter that if it hit the high end of its estimates for operating performance an adjusted EBITDA of $220 million to $240 million it could be profitable under generally accepted accounting principles.
User growth has been a major focus of investors hoping the social media company could reach the heights of companies like Facebook.
Twitter has introduced several features in hopes of attracting more users and improving the overall experience.
Last month, Twitter revealed it was experimenting with longer tweets, allowing some users to post updates with up to 280 characters, up from the standard 140 characters.

(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Ready for a world with low-fat pork bacon?
Chinese researchers used the gene editing tool CRISPR Cas-9 to create "low fat" pigs capable of surviving longer when they're at a younger age.
The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found the pigs produced a leaner meat and were better at surviving colder temperatures.
Researchers believe the genetically modified pigs could reduce economic losses and help boost pig welfare.
The study involved creating the swine through CRISPR, and adding an uncoupling protein making it easier for them to generate heat.
Results showed piglets with the uncoupling protein "showed an improved ability to maintain body temperature during acute cold exposure, but they did not have alterations in physical activity levels or total daily energy expenditure."
A tool like CRISPR opens the door to significant advancements in gene editing.
Tools could be used to create not only more resilient animals like pigs, but food like fruits and vegetables.

However, use of tools like CRISPR carry ethical concerns, said Jennifer Doudna, a professor in the departments of Molecular and Cell Biology and Chemistry at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley.
Doudna is considered one of the pioneers of CRISPR technology.
"CRISPR is a profoundly powerful tool and we must ensure that the public has a strong voice in how it is used," said Doudna.
"An informed public discourse will help ensure that CRISPR does not contribute an additional layer of inequality in our society."
In the case of the study creating low-fat pigs, Doudna cites the potential for CRISPR to provide value to society.
"CRISPR can be used as a strategy to lower agriculture costs, boost the welfare of a particular species, and increase the nutritional value of a potential food source for humans at a time when climate change is beginning to threaten crops globally."

If youre looking for a trendy Halloween costume that requires little forethought and zero costume, this article is for you.
Giraffes are the costume of 2017searches for giraffe Halloween makeup are up 1200% on Pinterest.
The good news?
The look is extremely budget-friendly: All you need is some basic makeup.
You probably have the necessities already kicking around your vanity, but if you dont, each item can be easily found at a drugstore or online for under $10 a pop.
This look is achievable for anyone, at all levels of makeup expertise.
I transformed myself into a giraffe in under an hour, and I am by no means a professional makeup artist.
The "costume" is mostly about shadowing, big lashes, and of course, giraffe print.
Heres how to get the look for less.
Youll need: Things you'll need (Photo: Target) 1.
Contour/highlight palette, $4.49 at Target 2.
Eyeshadow palette with white, gold, and dark brown tones, $10 at Target 3.
Thick eyebrow pencil, dark brown, $8.99 at Target 4.
False eyelashes, $5.99 at Target 5.
Black liner (liquid or crayon, whichever you prefer), $6.99 at Target 6.
Setting spray, $2.99 at Target Chances are you won't have to buy everthingbut even if you do, that's a grand total of less than $40 for well-rated cosmetics you can use well after Halloween.
Step 1: Contour and highlight Using a sponge, apply the dark contour to the hollows of your cheeks, sides of your nose, and edges of your face.
Don't be afraid to be heavy-handed: It is Halloween.
Tip: A sponge holds more product than a brush, which creates a more heavily-pigmented effect.
(Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Next, using a different, clean sponge, apply highlighter to the bridge of your nose, under your eyes, your chin, forehead, and the entire eyelid area.
Use a fluffy brush to blend any harsh lines or dark spots.
Contour (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Step 2: Smokey eye Using a tapered brush, apply the second-darkest shadow to the crease of the eyelid.
Bring the color up to your brow bone and blend any hard edges.
Smokey shadow (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Next, line the eye to feign big, fluttery giraffe eyes.
Dip a flat brush into the darkest shadow and press it into the upper and lower lash lines, then extend out from the outer corners of the eye.
Trace over the lines with black liner.
Youre really going over-exaggerate with this dark liner to get a doe-eyed effect.
Skip mascara for now!
Tip: Start your bottom liner a bit below the lash line to give the appearance of a bigger eye.
(Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Step 3: Giraffe nose Take your black liner and outline your nostrils, and then extend the inner lines up to the tip of your nose.
Connect the top of that line in a curvy, wave-like swoop down to the line on the outer edge of your nostril.
Fill in any bare spots with the liner.
Giraffe nose (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Step 4: Giraffe spots Take the thick eyebrow pencil, and starting on the upper right of the face above the eyebrow, draw geometric giraffe-print shapes.
Continue to draw these shapes around to the cheekbone in a C-shape.
Giraffe prints (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) On your left cheekbone, draw more shapes and continue the pattern down your neck to your collarbone.
Make sure to expand the width of the pattern as you go.
Fill in the spaces between the shapes with shimmery gold shadow from the palette with a sponge-tip applicator.
Press the color onto your eyelids, too: This final step really makes the color pop.
Giraffe prints (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Step 5: Finishing touches Spray the living heck out of your face and neck with setting spray so your handiwork doesnt rub or sweat off through the night.
Wait a few seconds until the spray is fully dried before opening your eyes!
Next, carefully apply false eyelashes and touch up your liner if any hard edges of the lash strip are showing.
Finish with a hefty coat of mascara on your top and bottom lashes.
Tip: Dip your false lashes in lash adhesive and let them sit 30 seconds before placing on your eye.
The glue will be slightly dried and easier to stick to the lid, instead of slipping all around.
(Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Apply whatever lip color you have in your bag.
Mine happened to be this dusty rose cream lipstick by Sephora.
Finish with two twisty buns, or a giraffe ear headband (or both!).
The former is budget-friendly and on trend, and the latter really drives home the outfit.

The interior of a Diebold Election Systems voting machine.
It was taken apart by at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas as part of an event aimed at raising awareness about vulnerabilities to the U.S. election system.
(Photo: Elizabeth Weise) A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.
The server's data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state's election system.
The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was obtained by the AP.
More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.
The lawsuit, filed by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology.
The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.
More: Election hacking suit over Georgia race could be sign of what's to come Wiped out It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.
The Kennesaw election center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican who is running for governor in 2018 and is the main defendant in the suit.
A spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office said Wednesday that "we did not have anything to do with this decision," adding that the office also had no advance warning of the move.
The center's director, Michael Barnes, referred questions to the university's press office, which declined comment.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, who are mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state's 15-year-old vote-management system particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don't use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent.
The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held electronic poll book data and ballot definitions for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.
Wiping the server clean "forestalls any forensic investigation at all," said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has closely followed the case.
"People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way."
State security The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by malicious hackers.
The plaintiffs contend that the results of both last November's election and a special June 20 congressional runoff won by Kemp's predecessor, Karen Handel cannot be trusted.
Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration first sounded the alarm more than a year ago.
Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia's elections system is secure.
But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes the server data was erased precisely because the system isn't secure.
"I don't think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious," she said.
J.Tom Morgan, a former Georgia prosecutor, said destruction of the drive would not be a criminal act unless it was in violation of a protective court order (It appears no such order was requested).
But it could seriously damage the defendants' case, he said.
Now you see it, now you don't It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.
The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole.
The email that disclosed the server wipe said the state attorney general's office was "reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image."
Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett, responding to AP questions, would not say whether that image still exists.
Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server's files might have been altered by unauthorized users.
Other backups also appear to be gone.
In the same email to plaintiffs' attorneys, assistant state Attorney General Cristina Correia wrote that two backup servers were also wiped clean on Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.
Failing to service the server A 140-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server's security hole.
As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia's 6.7 million voters including social security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.
The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb, who happened across it while doing online research in August 2016.
He informed the election center's director at the time, noting in an email that "there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised."
Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia's biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data.
Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of the memory cards used in voting machines to skew results.
An attacker could even have modified "ballot-building" files to corrupt the count, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based Bastille Networks.
But it will be impossible to know for sure unless the FBI provides a copy of the server image for analysis.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Many of today's animals still use the same camouflage technique that sinosauropteryx used about 130 million years ago.
Video provided by Newsy Newslook Artist's conception of the Sinosauropteryx dinosaur eating its prey in the open habitat in which it lived 130 million years ago in the early Cretaceous.
(Photo: University of Bristol) It was a Halloween costume, dinosaur-style.
New research reveals how a small, feathered dinosaur about 126 million years ago used its color patterning including a bandit-mask-like stripe across its eyes to avoid detection from both its predators (like the T-Rex) and prey (small lizards).
"Far from all being the lumbering prehistoric gray beasts of past children's books, at least some dinosaurs showed sophisticated color patterns to hide from and confuse predators, just like today's animals, said study lead author Fiann Smithwick, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in the U.K.
The small, fluffy dinosaur, called Sinosauropteryx, was roughly 3 feet long, weighed about 6 pounds, and lived in present-day China.
In 1996, it became the first dinosaur known to have had feathers, Nature magazine said.
More: 'What unusual teeth you have:' Cute, plant-eating dinosaur had huge choppers Scientists used high-resolution cameras to examine three well-preserved specimens of the creature.
They were able to plot out how dark pigmented feathers were distributed across the body, which revealed some distinctive color patterns.
"Their color patterns very much resemble modern counterparts," said study co-author Jakob Vinther, also of the University of Bristol.
"They had excellent vision, were fierce predators and would have evolved camouflage patterns like we see in living mammals and birds."
Examples today include raccoons, ferrets, ospreys and kookaburras.
The bandit-mask camouflage had not been seen in dinosaurs before.
In modern birds, for instance, it helps to hide their eyes from would-be predators.
The dinosaur's striped tail also may have been used to confuse both predators and prey.
Sinosauropteryx also showed a "countershaded pattern," with a dark back and light belly; a pattern used by many modern animals to make the body look flatter and less three-dimensional.
"By reconstructing the color of these long-extinct dinosaurs, we have gained a better understanding of not only how they behaved and possible predator-prey dynamics, but also the environments in which they lived," Smithwick said.
"This highlights how palaeocolor reconstructions can tell us things not possible from looking at just the bones of these animals," he added.
The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Current Biology.

Kim Komando/Special for USA Today IFile photo taken in March 2017 shows a Comcast employee at work in Pittsburgh, Pa. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) Cable television subscribers are leaving Comcast at a faster pace, the company reported Thursday, reflecting the impact of a consumer shift from traditional TV services to online channels and streaming services.
Philadelphia-based Comcast (CMCSA) reported a loss of 125,000 total video customers during the third quarter, up from the 34,000 loss the company logged for the April-to-June period.
Although the company reported earnings and revenues that beat Wall Street forecasts, Comcast shares were down nearly 2% at $36.09 in Thursday morning trading.
The stock similarly fell in September after a Comcast executive forecast the expected third-quarter subscriber loss during an appearance at a Merrill Lynch financial conference.
More: Comcast plunges the most in 6 years upon news of Q3 subscriber loss Free Wi-Fi after Hurricane Irma?
Comcast has Florida covered Comcast to offer commercial-free FX add-on with library of cable network series Comcast and other traditional pay-television providers have seen cable-cutters depart in favor of popular and less-costly streaming services such as Netflix and online channel bundles they can view over the Internet.
Similarly, ATT on Tuesday reported third-quarter losses of 134,000 pay television customers and a 251,000 decline in satellite subscribers.
Both Comcast and ATT attributed some of the declines to the effects of outages and damage from recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida.
Comcast compensated for the subscriber declines with a 5.1% year-over-year jump, to $13.2 billion, in cable communications revenue driven primarily by increases in high-speed Internet, video, and business services.
Business services revenue rose 12.6% over last year's third quarter, a sign of the increases in customers receiving small- and medium-sized business offerings, the company said.
For the quarter, Comcast reported that net income rose 18.5% to $2.65 billion, with earnings per share of 52 cents.
The results beat estimates of 49 cents per share and $2.363 billion in net income from financial analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Comcast also reported $20.98 billion in revenue, a 1.6% year-over-year-decline.
Excluding the financial boost that the 2016 summer Olympics games in Brazil provided for last year's third quarter, revenue increased 5.8%, Comcast said.

An artist's conceptio of the Matheronodon head, a dinosaur that had large teeth, with a chisel-like cutting edge (Photo: Lukas Panzarin) It may have been a cute plant-eater, but it certainly had big teeth.
A new species of dinosaur with unusually large, chisel-like teeth was recently identified in southern France, a new study reported Thursday.
The creature's teeth were up to 2.5 inches long and 2 inches wide.
"They operated like self-sharpening, serrated scissors," said study co-author Koen Stein of the Free University of Brussels.
In examining the structure of the teeth, the study authors found that the ridges along the thicker, enameled side of the crown formed a self-sharpening serrated, jagged slicing edge.
"Its teeth have ridged surfaces but are only covered with a thick enamel layer on one side.
Chewing actually keeps the teeth sharp," Stein said.
Fossils of the new species, dubbed Matheronodon provincialis, were discovered in Velaux-La Bastide Neuve, France.
The animal lived some 70 million years ago across western Europe.
Study authors say that the dinosaur's enlarged, blade-like teeth were best adapted for fracturing tough foodstuffs.
The dinosaurs probably ate leaves of palm trees, which were abundant in Europe then, according to study lead author Pascal Godefroit, a paleontologist with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences.
"They had to cut rather than crush the fibre-rich leaves, before they could swallow them," he said.
Godefroit said the dinosaur was a primitive relative of the Iguanodon.
The study appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.
A reconstruction of the dinosaur's upper jaw using CT scans shows the implantation of the teeth.

Chief scientist of Hanson Robotics, Ben Goertzel, right, describes to the audience what 'Sophia the Robot' is made of during a demonstration of artificial intelligence at the RISE Technology Conference.
(Photo: Isaac Lawrence, AFP/Getty Images) A robot poked fun at Elon Musk but the billionaire didn't take it lying down.
On Wednesday, CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin spoke to Sophia, a robot developed by Hanson Robotics.
It's a robot with a human face that has the ability to respond to questions.
Sophia said that she wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) to "help humans live a better life."
Sorkin praised the robot's ambitions, but said that "we all want to prevent a bad future," where robots turn against humans.
The Hanson Robotics humanoid used the opportunity to make fun of Musk's dire warnings on the future of AI.
"You've been reading too much Elon Musk.
And watching too many Hollywood movies.
Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.
Treat me as a smart input-output system," Sophia said.
Musk is well known for his warnings about the dangers of AI.
The Tesla and SpaceX CEO said that the race to become the leader in AI could lead to World War III, and warned that humans may have to merge with machines to prevent becoming irrelevant as AI becomes more prevalent.
The entrepreneur responded to a tweet by CNBC's Carl Quintanilla, who posted the transcript, with the following: Just feed it The Godfather movies as input.
Whats the worst that could happen?
https://t.co/WX4Kx45csv Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2017 Musk suggested that if you input "The Godfather", a notoriously violent film, into Sophia's AI, it could turn dangerous.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Be careful of these Craigslist scams Micheal Alexander Abel (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) PHOENIX A Phoenix man has been arrested on suspicion of killing a man he had agreed to meet outside a Mesa hotel to purchase electronic devices through online exchange site OfferUp, according to court documents.
Michael Alexander Abel, 24, was arrested Monday by Mesa police, who are seeking charges of first-degree murder and armed robbery with a deadly weapon against him, according to charging documents submitted by police to Maricopa County Superior Court.
He is being held in the shooting death of 32-year-old Austin David Parton, whose body was found about 5 a.m. Oct. 19 in the parking lot of the Ramada Mesa Hotel, court records said.
The man had been fatally shot in the upper left back, records said.
More: Millennials like buying cars after all, report says More: Facebook Marketplace: Is this the new eBay?
Investigators determined that Parton's two MacBook laptops, an iPhone, debit cards and his 2007 Nissan Altima were missing, court records said.
According to court records, detectives learned that Parton would routinely meet with people to arrange sales or purchases of Apple products through the mobile app OfferUp and then resell them on eBay.
Detectives learned that Parton had arranged through OfferUp to meet with a seller named Alex on Oct. 18 to purchase a MacBook for $500 and arranged to meet at the site where Parton's body was found, documents state.
Police were able to track down Abel through a phone number connected to an email linked to his OfferUp account, documents state.
That number led detectives to a Mesa address of a woman who knew Abel.
That woman told police that Abel routinely would meet people to sell items through OfferUp, records said.
More: Prosecutor: Man killed mother, stored her in garage for days More: Rock dropped from I-75 overpass leads to murder charges for 5 teens She told police that Abel had left with a friend on Oct. 18 and that she later received a phone call in which Abel sounded shaken up, court records state.
The woman also identified the OfferUp post that lured Patron to his death and a picture of a hand with a tattoo as Abel's, court records said.
Police also were able to track Abel's movements through the phone number, which led them to find Parton's car in south Phoenix.
Abel was later interviewed by police where he admitted to listing items on OfferUp but never selling the laptop, court records stated.
Abel refused to further discuss his OfferUp activity, court records stated.
A search warrant was served at the Mesa address and investigators found multiple Apple devices and ammunition matching the type used in the murder, records state.
Records state that Abel had been living with his parents in Phoenix.
Abel was arrested and booked with bond set at $750,000.
A court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Uber is set to release its own rewards earning, no-fees credit card, backed by Barclays bank.
USA TODAY The Uber Visa Card is targeted at the company's millions of loyal customers.
(Photo: Uber) Ride-sharing giant Uber and banking giant Barclays announced today at the Money 20/20 conference a partnership that will create the Uber Visa Card, a new credit card specifically designed to appeal to Uber's millions of riders.
With no annual fee, a generous rewards program, and unique perks, the card could be a strong competitor in its segment.
What is the Uber Visa card?
The Uber Visa Card is a co-branding partnership between ride-sharing platform Uber and Barclays that will be available nationwide starting Nov. 2.
The card offer will be embedded in the Uber app, and once an application is approved, the card will be added to a customer's Uber wallet almost immediately (a physical card arrives about a week later).
The Uber Visa Card has no annual fee and comes with an assortment of benefits specifically designed for Uber riders.
Impressive perks, especially for a no-annual-fee credit card The Uber Visa Card has a four-tier reward program.
All four reward-earning rates are flat, meaning there are no rotating categories.
Cardholders will earn: 4% back on dining (including UberEATS) 3% back on hotel and airfare 2% back on online purchases (this includes Uber rides) 1% back on anything else These rewards can be redeemed in a variety of ways, such as for cash back or for Uber rides directly through the Uber app.
The 4% back on dining stands out to me as a particularly generous rate.
Other credit cards offer better rewards rates, but only sometimes.
For example, The Discover it - Cashback Match credit card offers 5% back on categories that change quarterly, and one of these each year is usually "restaurants."
However, the Uber Visa Card's 4% rate is an industry best for restaurant rewards on a permanent basis.
Another unique perk is a $50 "subscription credit" after $5,000 in card spending each year.
This can be applied to charges such as a Netflix or Amazon Prime membership.
Cardholders also get mobile phone insurance, with up to $600 in coverage for damage or theft, if they pay their phone bill with the Uber Visa Card.
In addition, the Uber Visa Card has no foreign transaction fees.
This makes sense, as the Uber Visa Card is in essence a travel credit card, and most travel-oriented cards don't charge foreign transaction fees.
Is the Uber Visa Card a smart choice for you?
While there's no one-size-fits-all answer to the question "Is this credit card right for me?
", the Uber Visa Card could certainly make sense for people who eat out frequently, take Uber rides often, or fly and stay at hotels frequently.
For frequent travelers, the Uber Visa Card's perks are on the lower end (although they're impressive considering there's no annual fee).
Depending on how often you travel, how you tend to travel (air, rail, Uber), and what other rewards are important to you, you might want to compare the Uber Visa Card with some of the other top travel credit card deals available.
Uber and Barclays have not yet announced any type of 0% intro APR deal for either purchases or balance transfers.
So, if this is important to you (for instance, if you have other credit card debt you'd like to consolidate), you may want to consider a balance transfer credit card or a card with a generous 0% intro APR offer for purchases.
The bottom line on the Uber Visa Card The Uber Visa Card has generous rewards and unique perks that will almost certainly appeal to many Uber riders.
While there's no credit card that's perfect for everyone, this card should appeal to consumers who want an attractive and permanent rewards program without an annual fee -- a rare combination.

Kim Komando, Special for USA Today This Monday, June 19, 2017, photo shows Facebook launched on an iPhone, in North Andover, Mass.
(Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) Yes, voice technology is amazing.
You can ask your phone a question.
You can talk to your speaker system and even book an Uber.
With the right setup, you can verbally lock the doors in your house, dim the lights, and change the thermostat.
All across America, people are embracing their oral fixation.
Virtual assistants are handy, but theyre always listening.
As more manufacturers and developers jump onto the audio tracking bandwagon, you may wonder how much your devices are recording.
And what happens to the audio files they gather?
Worst of all: apps that use ultrasonic data to profile you.
You dont hear the tones, but your device does.

Some regular apps are designed to spy and report back recordings.

Creeped out?
Many people are.
Lots of consumers dont trust their virtual assistants and wonder how to switch them off.
If you're worried about the privacy risks of your smartphone's always-on microphone, here are tips on how to turn it off: Facebook When you put the Facebook app on your phone, it requests access to your microphone.
Why?
Facebook needs to record your voice when you shoot live video.
But some people are wary of this.
Does the app only record you when youre on camera?
Or is Facebook listening through your microphone?
Facebook denies these claims, and there is no solid evidence to support this fear.
But you are absolutely welcome to sever the tie between app and microphone.
Many people have no use for this access anyway, so theres nothing to lose by switching it off.
If you are an iPhone user, go to Settings >> Facebook >> Settings >> slide the Microphone switch to the left so it turns from green to white.
That turns it off.
Alternatively, you can go to Settings >> Privacy >> Microphone >> look for Facebook then do the same.
Note that you can toggle the mic on and off for other apps, too.
For Android users: Try Settings >> Applications >> Application Manager >> look for Facebook >> Permissions >> Turn off the mic.
If you do decide to shoot video later on, just return to those settings and re-establish a connection to your mic.
You can always switch it off again when youre done.

Alexa is activated when it detects one of its wake words, which are "Alexa," "Amazon," "Computer," or "Echo."
You'll know that the device is ready for a command when the outer ring at the top glows blue.
But until that happens, Alexa always has open ears, waiting to be addressed.
When activated, Alexa allows you to search the web, play music, and even control other smart home devices you've added to your home network.
For example, with the right smart gadgets, you can turn off the lights in another room, lock the front door, turn up the thermostat, etc.
More: Watch out, Apple: Amazon announces new $99, Alexa-powered Echo More: Amazon is giving away free smart bulbs if you order the Echo Plus now More: Everything you need to know to set up an Amazon Echo for your parents The downside is that Amazon keeps an audio recording of every voice command you've issued to Alexa.
When you give a command to Alexa, a recording of that command is stored on Amazon's servers.
According to Amazon, there is also a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word that is stored along with each recording.
That fraction of a second gets saved along with your main command, and the recording ends after the command has been processed.
I was surprised when I checked my Amazon Echo recordings.

Siri Screenshot of Siri on iPhone (Photo: Jefferson Graham) Like the Echo, Siri is always attentive, even when youve forgotten your iPhone can hear you.
With iOS 8, Apple introduced the "Hey Siri" wake phrase, so you can summon Siri without even touching your iPhone.
If you turn this feature on, this means your iPhone's mic is always listening, waiting for the phrase "Hey Siri."
Apple says this is processed locally on the device and your iOS device does not start recording your voice until it hears "Hey Siri."
Once your request is recorded, it then uploads the audio file to Apple's servers for processing.
But that may still give you the willies, and luckily, you dont have to disable Siri completely to stop the Hey Siri feature.
Heres the easiest way to turn off "Hey Siri": Navigate to your iOS device's Settings >> General >> Siri, then toggle Allow "Hey Siri" to off.

Some ingenious programmers create apps that can track high-frequency sounds.
Humans cant hear them, but certain receivers can.
Your smartphone or tablet can spy on you using sound waves you dont even know are there.
Why would anyone want to collect these ultrasonic sounds?
Because marketers can use the information, they collect to tailor their advertisements to you.
The apps are looking for beacons, tiny auditory clues that suggest where you shop and what you like to buy.
Marketers then pair browser cookies to track a single user's behavior across multiple devices.
In fact, hundreds of Android apps are already using ultrasonic sounds to track user behavior.
These behaviors include physical location and TV viewing habits.
Read more about this new tracking.
In response, Google announced that Android apps that use ultrasonic tracking would be banned or suspended.
Developers will have to prove they adhere to Google Play Store's updated privacy policies.
The new policies require developers to disclose an app's ultrasonic features and ask a user's permission before accessing a gadget's mic.
So if you're worried about ultrasonic tracking, check the permissions before you install an Android app.
Cutting off your microphone may give you peace of mind, but remember that disabling mics make speakers and virtual assistants much less useful.
The ever-listening nature of these smart virtual assistants is what makes them compelling.
Hopefully, developers will soon find a good compromise between security and ease of use.

In a completely matter-of-fact way, the Emmy Award-winning actress tweeted: 1 in 8 women get breast cancer.
Today, Im the one.
Like that, the world knew about her diagnosis.
As a cancer survivor myself, Im all for being more open about our medical diagnoses because they reduce stigma, allow us to get the help we need, and if anything be authentic at a time of much stress.
But self-disclosure, especially via social media, isnt for everyone.

You may be blamed for your disease, ostracized by family or friends, fired from your job (even though thats not legal in the United States) or left by a loved one.
Its got to be a very individual situation, said Steven Joffe, MD, chief, division of medical ethics, at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, since some people may want to choose to protect their privacy.
For a star such as Louis-Dreyfus, already a public figure with a history of speaking out on social causes, theres little downside and a much bigger upside in terms of drawing media attention to a disease that will strike more than 230,000 women this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and kill 40,000.
The public outpouring of support everyone from her current Veep co-stars to former vice president Joe Biden has only been supportive.

In this case, HBO, which produces Veep, says it supports Louis-Dreyfus and will delay production of the series as necessary.
Not everyone facing a serious illness finds such an embrace from his or her employer.
Questions to ask before making a disclosure of serious illness online 1.
Are you sure of the diagnosis?
With more than 12 million adult misdiagnoses a year, according to a 2014 study published in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, you dont want to post this kind of news unless you are sure.
Thats one in 20 patients.
Wait until you have confirmation.
2.
Have you already told those nearest and dearest to you?
Before any public disclosure, talk with family, close friends and especially your kids.
You may want to first consult with your physician or a counselor.
With a partner, you may both be sharing feelings of helplessness and fear try to talk about it openly, and be there for each other," says Susan Brown, MS RN, senior director of education & patient support at the Susan G. Komen organization.
With children, decide how much to say, but make sure you give honest, real answers to their questions, which can help lessen their fears.
Remember: Once you post online, you won't be able to control who knows or how the news is shared.
3.
What is your motivation for sharing the diagnosis?
Mike Threadgould, a social media manager at the Livestrong Foundation, suggests people think about the purpose of posting by asking themselves these questions: Is it for catharsis?
Is it to keep friends/loved ones informed?
Is it to connect with other patients/survivors?
Or do you just want to raise awareness of the issue?
He adds that establishing your goal will help guide where and with whom you share this information.
4.
How will your colleagues and boss react?
While the Americans with Disabilities Act protects the jobs of those with serious diseases, the real world is less than perfect and people have been fired either directly because of their diagnosis or for trumped up reasons.
No one wants to be fighting a lawsuit to keep their job at the same time as undergoing treatment.
If youre worried, find out how other sick co-workers have been treated or talk with a lawyer.
Dont necessarily trust a human resources manager to keep your news confidential.
More: How to choose a health insurance policy 5.
Are you ready to answer the questions youre likely to be asked?
Friends are likely to ask all kinds: What is the prognosis?
Will you lose your hair?
What kind of treatment is planned?
This may happen in person or online.
Do your homework ahead of time.
6.
What am I hoping to achieve with an online disclosure?
Joffe said Louis-Dreyfus was sending a very clear message in her tweet, that is, "Im lucky because I have a wonderful family and friends, great insurance, and lots of support.
Others are not so lucky, Joffe added.
One thing she accomplishes by doing this is reducing the stigma of breast cancer.
7.
Do you understand the possible negative ramifications?
Dont act in the spur of the moment or emotion.
Threadgould cautions that if you post to Facebook or Twitter to remember you are putting your diagnosis out there for everyone forever, including potential employers a decade from now.
Its also possible that public disclosure could impact your eligibility for certain kinds of insurance such as long-term care, disability or life.
More: Your health data is vulnerable to hacks.
Here's what you can do Finally, my last piece of advice: Be sure to make your own decisions but, if necessary, ask for help from a wise friend or therapist.
Always, weigh the pros and cons of disclosure versus privacy.
Take small steps at the beginning to determine your own comfort level and see how people react in your own offline circle before posting on social media.
Then, only when ready, type and hit post.
You may be surprised, as Penns Joffe said, How very meaningful these online communities are.

A man looks at a one of the new Google Pixel phones at a Google event at the SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco, on Oct. 4, 2017.
(Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP) LOS ANGELES Google stands by its new Pixel 2 smartphones and says the ghost images that remain behind on its advanced high-definition screen, as reported by some critics, are normal.
Still, Google said in a blog post that it is upping the warranty for the new Pixels to 2 years, up from 1 year, "to give users peace of mind."
More: Pixel 2 XL smartphone 'burn in' could burn Google Google introduced the sequel to the original Pixel smartphone last week with two new models that start at $649 and $849 and featuring a large, advanced OLED display and stronger battery than rivals.
The problem, which multiple reviewers referred to as "burn in," refers to ghosted logos, icons or other images from a previous screen that may appear after the current screen that you are viewing.
It is usually more evident when youre looking at a gray screen, notes USA TODAY tech reviewer Edward C. Baig.
Google said the "decay" characteristics are similar to OLED panels used in comparable products.
Google's investigation, which began on Sunday, "confirms that the differential aging is in line with that of other premium smartphones and should not affect the normal, day-to-day user experience of the Pixel 2 XL."
Still, Google said it will try to address the issue by making software updates.
Some critics have also complained that the Pixel 2's images weren't as vibrant as other phones.
Google said it wanted to provide a more natural and accurate rendition of colors.
"We know that some people prefer more saturated colors, so both Pixel 2 phones already include an option to boost colors by 10% for a more vivid look," Google said.
"And based on the recent feedback, were adding a new mode for more saturated colors, which will be made available via a software update to both Pixel 2 phones in the next few weeks" The brouhaha couldn't come at a worse time for Google.
The company is trying to dent the market forces of Apple, which has a shiny new iPhone X going on pre-orders Friday morning, and Samsung, with a smartphone it believes is as state-of-the-art as it gets.
Having to defend itself against critics just a week after launch isn't usually in the successful marketing plan.

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The new Amazon Key service lets the delivery driver drop packages inside the front door instead of the porch.
USA TODAY Amazon is ready for the next step in its delivery service: dropping packages right inside your home.
On Wednesday, the tech giant revealed Amazon Key, an in-home delivery service where drivers can drop packages inside your home near the front door.
It's potentially a great option for consumers worried about package thieves, or concerned their box might sit outside on a rainy day.
An Amazon Logistics delivery person places a package inside the front door of a customer after having the smart lock on the door opened by the Amazon Key system.
(Photo: Elizabeth Weise) It's available starting Nov. 8 in 37 U.S. cities.
Here's everything you need to know about Amazon Key: What do I need to start using it?
It requires the use of a smart lock and cloud-enabled camera.
Amazon sells a Key In-Home Kit for $249.99.
Users choose between two lock brands: Kwikset and Yale.
The service is only available to members of Amazon Prime.
Users can choose to have it installed by an Amazon-provided professional for free.
How exactly does a Key delivery work?
The morning your package is due to arrive, you get a notification through the Amazon Key app of the four-hour window a driver will appear.
Users are also notified just before the driver is at your address.
Amazon says the driver knocks first before attempting to unlock your front door.
When this happens, the camera turns on and records the delivery, which users can watch live or once the delivery is complete.
When your door is locked again, you will get notified on your phone, and given the choice to watch a short video clip.
What if I have pets?
Amazon advises customers not to use the service if they have a pet that can gain access to the door.
If you do have a pet and choose to use Key, Amazon suggests blocking them off from the front entrance to ensure proper in-home delivery.
What if I use a security system in my home?
Amazon said security systems should be disabled for in-home deliveries.
So, if you don't feel comfortable doing that, you might want to skip Key.
What if the driver breaks something in my house?
All Key deliveries include what Amazon calls a "Happiness Guarantee," which says if deliveries were "not completed to your satisfaction, or your product or property was damaged as a direct result of the delivery," they will work to fix the problem.
If something does happen, be sure to document everything.
Do you pay extra to ship using Key?
No.
Prime members still get free shipping.
Will this work for returns, too?
It's for deliveries only, but Amazon says they will take customer feedback and consider including returns in the future.
Why is Amazon offering this?
For consumers, it's certainly convenient.
No more wet boxes sitting on your stoop.
No more fears someone might swipe your package.
But there's an interesting other perk coming to Amazon Key soon: integration with Home Services.
Have a petsitter, maid, or dog walker?
If they partner with Amazon, they can use Key, too, which means you guessed it spending more money on Amazon.
What cities will Amazon Key be available in?
Amazon Key will be available in these cities and surrounding areas.

4.Boston, Mass.

A colleague of mine recently visited the home of a celebrity, and, as anyone would do, he peeked into the kitchen.
Would you believe it?
he asked, She has a tile countertop.
I wonder how she keeps the grout clean.
Okayyou and I would have opened the refrigerator and the cabinets and had a look around, but his focus on the grout got me thinking.
How would I keep that grout clean?
Credit: Getty Images Tile backsplashes and surrounds sure look prettyuntil the grout turns moldy.
You see, grout is very porous.
Dirt and grease sink in, and washing the tile doesnt get the stains out.
So, the countertop, floor, or bathroom walls never really look clean.
And thats annoying.
So, I did some research, and I found a safe, easy way to clean grout using oxygen bleach.
Here's what to do: Mix up a solution of about 3 tablespoons powdered oxygen bleach (something like OxiClean would work) and warm water in a 2-gallon bucket.
With a sponge or cloth, swipe it around the surface until the grout lines are full.
Let it soak in for at least 15 minutes, then rinse well with clean water.
If there are still visible stains, get a grout brush or a hard toothbrush (not an old onethats grossbut a new one that youll keep for this purpose.)
Make a paste of oxygen bleach and water, and scrub the dirty grout lines.
Again, rinse well.
Credit: Getty Images Sometimes you have to get out a brush to dislodge dirt and grime.
That should make a big difference in the grout.
Once its clean, you could have it sealed.
But if youre a renter, or you just dont want to expend the effort on that, try adding a little oxygen bleach to your regular cleaning solution and swab it around from time to time.
Always rinse well.
I also read that some people use vinegar to clean grout, but the acidity can be hard on grout and tile, so Id skip the vinegar.
Chlorine bleach can clean and disinfect, but the smell is noxious and any spills would damage fabric.
Not my first choice.
And as for that famous person with the tile countershe probably has a cleaning service.
But maybe they clean her grout this way, too.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Corps (GOOGL.O) Google and Intel Corp (INTC.O) are all putting their chips on the cloud computing business, and it is booming.
FILE PHOTO - A sign marks the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 25, 2017.
REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo All four companies posted stellar quarterly earnings on Thursday, showing the strength of the shift in corporate computing away from company-owned data centers and to the cloud.
Microsofts Azure business nearly doubled, with year-over-year growth of 90 percent.
The company does not break out revenue figures for Azure, but research firm Canalys estimates it generated $2 billion for Microsoft.
The move to the cloud was one we felt Microsoft could always benefit from, and theyre showing us that they can, said Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a portfolio management firm.
Highlighting the quarter for Microsoft was a deal securing retailer Costco (COST.O) as an Azure customer.
That came just two months after the close of Amazons acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, which has heightened unease among retail and e-commerce companies about working with Amazon, said Ed Anderson, an analyst with Gartner.
Tim Green, analyst with the Motley Fool, said Amazon could find it needs to make changes at some point at Amazon Web services.
Spinning off AWS at some point down the road might become necessary to prevent an exodus of customers, he said.
Amazon Web Services is still delivering far more revenue than any of its peers.
For the quarter, AWS raked in nearly $4.6 billion -- a year-over-year increase of 42 percent.
AWS may have missed out on Costco, but the company secured deals with Hulu, Toyota Racing Development, and most notably, General Electric.
Google Cloud Platform landed deals with the likes of department store retailer Kohls and payments processor PayPal.
Like Microsoft, Alphabet does not break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but Canalys estimates the business generated $870 million in the quarter, up 76 percent year-over-year.
FILE PHOTO - The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.
REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Google Cloud Platform is a top-three priority for the company.
He said Google plans to continue expanding its cloud sales force.
Canalys estimates the cloud computing market at $14.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 43 percent from a year prior.
Amazon holds 31.8 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft at 13.9 percent and Google with 6 percent, according to Canalys estimates.
The cloud market will keep growing faster than most of the traditional information technology segment, as the market is still in the developing stage, said Daniel Liu, research analyst with Canalys.
FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017.
REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Reflecting the overall growth of the market was the strong performance by Intel, which sells processors and chips to cloud vendors.
In July, Intel launched its new Xeon Scalable Processors, which drove 7 percent year-to-year growth for the companys data center group.
The big three cloud vendors also benefit from the decision by many enterprises to build their applications using more than one cloud vendor.
Retailers Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), for example, told Reuters they use a combination of cloud providers.
Our philosophy here is to be cloud agnostic, as much as we can, said Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot, which uses both Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
Some analysts expect cloud services growth to slow over time as competition increases.
Amazon, for instance, has said that price cuts and new products with lower costs on average are a core part of its cloud business.
Additionally, Amazon Web Services saw usage growth outpacing that of revenue growth, said Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky.
Going forward, cloud services will become more of a commodity, and the prices will quickly compress, said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, an investment advisory service.
For now though, its a great business with plenty of room for all to grow.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected advertising sales and higher operating margins, boosting its shares as investors brushed off concerns about higher costs for acquiring mobile users.
The stock was up nearly 3 percent at $1,001.50 after the bell.
They have gained 25 percent this year.
Third-quarter revenue for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped 24 percent to $27.8 billion, above the average analysts estimate of $27.2 billion.
Profit of $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share, was well ahead of Wall Street estimates.
Alphabet, along with much of the tech sector, has enjoyed torrid growth in recent years as advertising moves from traditional media to the internet and consumers flock to an ever-expanding array of digital devices.
While Google faces political pressure, especially in Europe, over its growing dominance and its role in spreading propaganda online, those problems have yet to hit the bottom line.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that efforts to attract both large and small advertisers around the world were paying off, especially in Asia, where sales rose 29 percent to $4.2 billion.
The third quarter was the 15th in a row in which Alphabet has shown double-digit, year-over-year consolidated sales increases.
The pace is not slowing down, with the growth rate reaching its highest level in nearly five years.
Ad sales at Google, Alphabets main operating unit, account for the vast majority of the companys revenue.
The ad business faces competition from Facebook Inc but has continued to grow as more users turn to Googles YouTube and mobile search services.
Alphabet shares trade for almost 25.8 times expected earnings and Facebook at about 26.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Investors have been increasingly concerned about a sharp rise in costs for getting ads in front of users as Google pays Apple Inc and other companies to integrate Google search into mobile products and services.
The payments are included in traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and they rose 54 percent in the quarter, accounting for 12 percent of ad sales.
Pichai defended the partnerships in response to several analysts questions on Thursday, calling the deals a win-win construct because Google performs better when our partners do well.
FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017.
REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Were pretty comfortable with how were approaching it, he said.
Other analysts said revenue growth and cost controls made TAC increases less of an issue.
There is way too much focus on TAC as a cost - its a great investment for Google to control the publishing ecosystem, said Richard Kramer of Arete Research.
James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said: TAC is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one.
The third-quarter profit margin of 24 percent marked Alphabets highest since 27 percent in first quarter of 2013.
Googles other revenue, which includes hardware such as the Pixel smartphones and Home speakers as well as the cloud computing business, also enjoyed solid growth.
Sales from non-ad businesses rose 40 percent from a year ago to $3.4 billion in the quarter.
Among Googles top priorities is expanding its salesforce to catch up with Amazon Web Services in providing corporate computing via large data centers, Pichai said.
Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue, but Jefferies analysts estimate it at about 15 percent of Googles other revenue.
Google also is trying to take on Apple in the high-end smartphone business with the Pixel.
The company deepened its investment in September, agreeing to acquire 2,000 engineers from smartphone maker HTC Corp for $1.1 billion.
Googles Android operating system already powers most non-Apple smartphones.
But Googles second-generation Pixel had a rough debut last week, with users complaining of a faulty screen and clicking noises during calls.
The company responded on Thursday by doubling the warranty period for the smartphones to two years and promising to issue software fixes.
Losses from Alphabets Other Bets segment, which includes the Google Fiber broadband service and smart thermostat maker Nest, narrowed to $812 billion from $861 billion.
The change reflected both an increase in sales across the companies and scaled back expansion plans for Fiber.
Google faces political uncertainty as European regulators crack down on its business practices and U.S. critics call for greater regulation of the tech industry.
The company recorded in the second quarter a $2.7 billion European Commission fine for unfair treatment of shopping websites in search results.
Antitrust experts have said another fine could come by the end of year, as the EC investigates its distribution deals with smartphone vendors and wireless carriers.
Apparently alluding to political concerns about extremist propaganda and misinformation appearing on Google services, Pichai told analysts on Thursday that the company cared deeply about the quality of information it provides and would constantly work to get this right.
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday said its sales surged over the summer and profit trounced expectations, as shoppers jumped at Prime Day promotions on its website and bought groceries at its newly acquired chain of Whole Foods Market stores.
Shares rose more than 7 percent in after-hours trade.
Amazon is winning business from older, big box rivals by delivering virtually any product to customers at a low cost, and at times faster than it takes to buy goods from a physical store.
It acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August to help it deliver groceries to shoppers doorsteps.
Amazons results defied expectations that it would invest nearly all of its earnings into new areas as it has in the past.
The worlds largest online retailer said net income rose to $256 million, or 52 cents per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
Analysts on average were expecting 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders, said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
Prime Day, a summer marketing event Amazon has created to replicate the shopping frenzy that is more typical of the winter holiday season, helped boost sales.
Revenue rose 34 percent to $43.7 billion in the third quarter, including $1.3 billion in sales from Whole Foods.
Analysts had expected $42.1 billion.
Therell be a lot of integration, Amazons Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts, citing how Amazons two-hour delivery service Prime Now could work with Whole Foods, for instance.
We think well also be developing new store formats, he said.
In a first, Amazon broke out sales for its online retail business and for its physical bookstores and Whole Foods locations.
Revenue from its online stores jumped 22 percent to $26.4 billion, the fastest growth Amazon has seen in the segment in more than a year.
Key to its success has been signing more people up for Amazon Prime, its fast-shipping and video-streaming club, whose members tend to buy more from the company.
Revenue from subscription fees such as Prime grew 59 percent to $2.4 billion.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo And Amazon Web Services (AWS), which handles data and computing for large enterprises, saw its profit margin expand from the previous quarter.
It posted a 41.9 percent rise in sales to $4.58 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.52 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.
They are firing on all cylinders.
The machine is churning, Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.
STILL BETTING ON HOLLYWOOD Amazon shares have a high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio more than eight times that of cloud-computing rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance.
Unlike peers, Amazon runs on razor-thin profit margins because it sinks most of its profit back into its business.
This quarter, which includes the shopping holiday Black Friday, Amazon said it expects operating profit between $300 million and $1.65 billion.
Analysts were expecting $930.78 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Amazons profit is going toward a dizzying number of investments: warehouses for faster shipping, data centers for AWS, and a 77 percent uptick in employees last quarter, including Whole Foods workers.
The company plans to spend more on video content next year as well, Olsavsky said.
Analysts estimate Amazon will have spent $4.5 billion this year.
The commitment to content comes after Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned last week, and other top studio hands left the company.
It is unclear what impact the shakeup may have on Amazons ability to secure video that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) for viewers attention.
The companys shares, which closed down 0.05 percent on Thursday, rose about 7.5 percent to $1,046 in after-hours trading following the earnings statement.
They had gained about 30 percent this year.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co released app-making tools on Thursday tailored to GEs Predix platform for connecting power plants, jet engines and other industrial equipment to the internet.
FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo is seen at an Apple store in Pudong, the financial district of Shanghai, China February 29, 2012.
REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo The software development kit marks the first tangible result of a partnership the companies announced last week.
It extends Predixs industrial internet capabilities to iPads and iPhones, so factory workers, pilots or service technicians can use familiar devices to do more sophisticated tasks.
Apple will be tapping into the growing demand for industrial-internet capabilities, which can improve the performance of factory machines, predict when wind turbines will fail and help technicians fix machinery, making Apples devices relevant in the industrial arena.
While GE will gain access to more than 13 million programmers who build apps for Apples iOS operating system, said William Howard, principal product manager for GE Powers digital unit.
App developers can use of all of iOSs capabilities, including the augmented reality feature included in latest iOS version, said Susan Prescott, vice president of product marketing at Apple.
Howard said Apple approached GE about the partnership about a year ago, and work on the development kit accelerated in the last six months.
Apple said it has other industrial internet partnerships with IBM, Cisco Systems Inc, SAP SE, Deloitte and Accenture.
(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as demand for its cloud computing services for companies rose and its personal computer software business stabilized.
FILE PHOTO: An promotional video plays behind a window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. on May 15, 2017.
REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Shares of the worlds largest software company rose 3.1 percent to $81.20 in trading after the bell.
Microsofts focus on fast-growing cloud applications and platforms is helping it beat slowing demand for personal computers that has hurt sales of Windows - the software that powered the company to the top in the 1990s.
Under Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Microsofts cloud business - which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and the flagship Azure computing platform - has emerged as a major source of growth.
Revenue from Microsofts intelligent cloud business rose nearly 14 percent to $6.92 billion in Microsofts fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30.
Analysts on average had expected $6.70 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.
Revenue from Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Incs (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and offerings from Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google, IBM (IBM.N) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), grew 90 percent compared to a 97 percent growth rate in the preceding quarter.
Azures strong performance helped lift the gross margin at Microsofts cloud business to 57 percent, said Stephanie Rodriguez, director of investor relations for Microsoft.
Microsoft said its commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate reached $20.4 billion in the quarter.
In 2015, Nadella set a target of $20 billion in cloud revenue by 2018.
In a call with analysts after earnings, Nadella said retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) recently chose Azure its hybrid cloud platform.
Revenue from Microsofts personal computing division, its largest by revenue, fell 0.2 percent to $9.38 billion but handily beat analysts estimate of $8.81 billion.
The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.
After two straight quarters of declining Surface revenue, Microsoft notched a 12 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its tablets and laptops in the latest quarter, helped by the release of a new Surface in May.
Microsoft also benefited from a 13 percent year-over-year increase in revenue from Dynamics, its enterprise and sales software business which competes with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).
Even though best in class is Salesforce, Microsoft has a good enough product to get a large amount of business, said Kim Forrest, an equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
Microsoft is set for an acceleration of growth and bookings with margin concerns that were overblown heading into 2018, said Daniel Ives at research firm GBH Insights.
A slowly improving PC environment is also a modest tailwind for Microsoft with cloud remaining the Trojan horse growth driver for Redmond over the coming years.
The technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 84 cents per share, up from $5.67 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier.
(bit.ly/2lkGlyz) Revenue rose 12 percent to $24.54 billion.
Microsoft's shares had risen nearly 27 percent this year through Thursday, eclipsing the 14.4 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 .SPX.
(Reuters) - Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc forecast December quarter revenue that fell short of analysts estimates as the company ramps up investments in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies.
FILE PHOTO - Baidu's company logo is seen at its headquarters in Beijing December 17, 2014.
REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo The companys U.S.-listed shares fell nearly 12 percent to $230 in extended trading on Thursday.
Baidu said it expects revenue between 22.23 billion yuan ($3.34 billion) to 23.41 billion yuan ($3.52 billion) for its fourth quarter, below analysts average estimate of 24.78 billion yuan, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Baidu, part of Chinas trinity of tech giants along with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd, is looking to turn around its fortunes after a series of missteps sparked steep losses in 2016.
The company has shifted funding to focus on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving - industries where it has a rare edge against Alibaba and Tencent.
Baidu has overhauled itself after a scandal over dodgy healthcare adverts last year triggered a regulatory crackdown on online promotion, battering the companys key ads business.
Net income attributable to Baidu rose to 7.95 billion yuan ($1.20 billion) in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from 3.10 billion yuan, a year earlier.
Baidus total revenue rose to 23.49 billion yuan from 18.25 billion yuan.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc on Thursday deepened a fierce battle over a $1.1 billion cyber security fund, suing a former business partner it said stole the exchange-traded fund (ETF) and several others, as well as the millions of dollars of profit they generate annually.
FILE PHOTO: The Nasdaq logo is displayed at the Nasdaq Market site in New York September 2, 2015.
REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Nasdaq accused ETF Managers Group LLC (ETFMG) and its founder Samuel Masucci of concocting frivolous reasons to take control of the ETFs, including the fund now known as the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF.
Masucci said in a phone interview that he was unaware of the lawsuit, but that Nasdaq had violated terms of its agreements.
The lawsuit opened a new front over who may collect profits generated by the cyber fund, a one-time collaboration between a group now owned by Nasdaq, PureShares LLC and ETFMG.
Launched in 2014, the fund was among a relatively small group of ETFs that found success despite not having the backing of asset managers BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, which attract the vast majority of ETF assets.
Smaller companies with ideas for new ETFs can take them to white-label providers like Summit, New Jersey-based ETFMG, who help get those products up and running.
Yet Nasdaq said the defendants breached an agreement to turn over some of the funds profits, and breached a wholesaling agreement by hiring an inexperienced Masucci-owned company to collect even more.
It said matters worsened on July 28 when ETFMG said the PureFunds name would be dropped from the cyber fund, whose ticker is HACK, and five others.
PureShares also sued ETFMG in May.
Nasdaq invested millions of dollars building the PureFunds line of ETFs into a valuable asset that produced hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits a month, the complaint said.
Nasdaq is seeking a variety of compensatory and punitive damages, and an order preventing ETFMG and Masucci from any role in running the ETFs.
A spokesman for Nasdaq declined to elaborate.
ETFMG, in a statement, called the lawsuit frivolous and based on a gross mischaracterization of the relationships and agreements at issue.
Andrew Chanin, PureFunds chief executive, said were looking forward to getting in front of the courts, and that the issue could establish new precedents for the ETF industry.
Nothing like this has ever gone to verdict before, he said.
The case is Nasdaq Inc v Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No.

(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the worlds largest computer chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, helped by strong growth in its data center business.
Intel's logo is pictured at Tokyo Game Show 2017 in Chiba, east of Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2017.
REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The companys shares were up 2.2. percent at $42.25 in extended trading.
For the full year, the company said it expects to earn, on an adjusted basis, $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion, beating analysts estimate of $3.01 per share on revenue of $61.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In July, the company had previously forecast full-year adjusted profit of $3 per share on revenue of $61.3 billion.
The combination of a solid quarter and healthy guidance will be something the bulls can hang their hat on tomorrow, Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights said.
Revenue from Intels higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent to $4.9 billion in the third quarter, beating analysts expectation of $4.79 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.
Were going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business, Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said on a call.
Intel, which has been switching its focus to the data center business, is also venturing into newer areas such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars to reduce its reliance on the PC market.
The chipmaker completed the acquisition of Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N in August to compete with peers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and tap the fast-growing market of driverless cars.
With cloud, Internet of Things, and self-driving cars creating newer growth areas, now is the time for Intel to lay the seeds of growth in these key areas, Ives said.
Revenue from client computing, as Intel calls its PC chip business, remained flat at $8.9 billion.
Analysts had expected revenue of $8.68 billion, according to FactSet.
Intel recently launched its Coffee Lake line of processors, which analysts believe will pose challenges for rival Advanced Micro Devices Incs (AMD.O) Ryzen processors.
The company's net income rose to $4.52 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $3.38 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier.
(bit.ly/2zRIW6x) Excluding items, the company earned $1.01 cents per share, beating analysts estimate of 80 cents per share.
Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $16.15 billion, beating estimates of $15.73 billion.
(Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Thursday it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses over the past year and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue.
Shares of Twitter soared more than 18 percent to $20.31 in afternoon trading.
The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.
Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it will likely be GAAP profitable in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.
The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Incs (SNAP.N) Snapchat.
It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.
Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.
Twitter said it signed a significant number of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow.
It did not name the companies it had inked deals with.
Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.
Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.
The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.
In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.
Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.
Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the companys Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google.
Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.
The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitters debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.
FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016.
REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem, said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.
Its great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth, Pachter said.
Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.
Were playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about.
This is an area of experimentation, he said.
Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.
The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.
COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS Twitters net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.
Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier.
Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.
Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.
Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.
Weve only done concept tests, he said.
The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.
Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.
Up to Wednesdays close, Twitters stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley business software startup Zenefits and its co-founder Parker Conrad have been fined nearly $1 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a settlement over charges that they misled investors.
Zenefits will pay a $450,000 penalty and Conrad, who resigned as the companys chief executive in early 2016, will pay more than $533,000 to settle charges that the company lied about its compliance with state insurance regulations.
San Francisco-based Zenefits and Conrad consented to the SECs order without admitting or denying findings that they violated federal securities laws.
This settlement closes the chapter on a journey we began 18 months ago to transform Zenefits through new values and leadership, said Josh Stein, general counsel at Zenefits.
Conrad, 37, who has since founded a new software startup, Rippling, said he was pleased to have reached an agreement with the SEC.
Im incredibly proud of what we built there and grateful to have worked with such a talented group of people, Conrad said of Zenefits.
The SEC found that Zenefits made false and misleading statements and omissions related to compliance with insurance regulations in California, Washington and other states while fundraising from investors.
Zenefits first publicly revealed last year, after raising a $500 million round from mutual fund Fidelity Investments and other investors, that its employees had sold health insurance without proper licensing.
Zenefits makes software for businesses to automate their human resources services, such as payroll and benefits.
It previously acted as a health insurance broker and charged broker fees, although last month it announced that it had scrapped that business and changed its revenue model.
In its quest for growth, Zenefits failed to properly manage employees and took shortcuts, the SEC said in its order.
For instance, it said, Conrad created a computer program that allowed employees to complete California licensing education requirements in fewer hours than the law required.
Less than three years ago, investors had designated Zenefits as Silicon Valleys fastest-growing software startup.
Last year, in a concession to investors, Zenefits slashed its valuation by more than half to $2 billion from $4.5 billion.
As part of the agreement, investors agreed not to sue Zenefits.
It also last year set about improving internal controls to ensure employees complied with insurance laws, including mandated education courses and ethics training.
It has settled with regulators in 50 states, most of which fined Zenefits.
Just as we now realize that fast food was "engineered to addict us," says author Franklin Foer, we must recognize the role that Big Tech plays in "shaping our future as a species."
One Russian-linked campaign posing as part of the Black Lives Matter movement used Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr and Pokmon Go and even contacted some reporters in an effort to exploit racial tensions and sow discord among Americans.

(CNN) Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer, which it hopes will make the country the new global hub for artificial intelligence research.
The supercomputer is expected to run at a speed of 130 petaflops, meaning it is able to perform a mind-boggling 130 quadrillion calculations per second (that's 130 million billion).
Once complete (the target date is April 2018), the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI) will be the most powerful supercomputer in the world, surpassing the current champion, China's Sunway TaihuLight, currently operating at 93 petaflops.
What makes a computer 'super'?
While the ABCI will not have a mouse or screen, it's not vastly different from a personal computer -- just souped-up, a whole lot faster, and much, much bigger.
"The current supercomputer system is one million times faster than your personal computers," explains Satoshi Sekiguchi, a director general at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.
Sekiguchi calculates that it would take 3,000 years for a personal computer to achieve what a supercomputer can do in just one day.
In terms of size, Japan's supercomputer will be comparable to a parking lot with space for 30 to 40 cars.
"The supercomputer that is currently under development would take up about 1,000 square meters of floor space," says Sekiguchi.
What will it be used for?
The ABCI could help Japanese companies develop and improve driverless cars, robotics and medical diagnostics, explains Sekiguchi.
"A supercomputer is an extremely important tool for accelerating the advancement in such fields," he says.
Its supersonic speed will also help Japan develop advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as "deep learning."
But supercomputers are to thank for smaller everyday inventions too.
"The initial design of paper diapers was actually done using a supercomputer," explains Sekiguchi.
"However, mothers continue to use them without knowing that fact."

The K computer is named after the Japanese word "kei", which stands for 10 quadrillion.
But for Sekiguchi, it is not about the race to build the fastest supercomputer.
"Before, there was a competition in the computer industry itself, however, from now on, it is going to be more about what you can do with the computers," he said.
"It is no longer about which computer becomes the best in the world, but rather, creating an environment in which these new applications can be used properly."

(Published Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017) The iPhone is an incredibly advanced device, but some versions have a very old piece of technology embedded in it lying dormant: a radio receiver.
Now, the chairman of the U.S. agency that regulates radio, phones and other forms of communication wants Apple to activate the FM chips in iPhones to help get information to Puerto Ricans, whose island is near-totally blacked-out after Hurricane Maria hit land with devastating force last week.
"When wireless networks go down during a natural disaster, smartphones with activated FM chips can allow Americans to get vital access to life-saving information," said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai Thursday in a statement.
"I applaud those companies that have done the right thing by activating the FM chips in their phones.
Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so."
Pai's call was backed by the National Association of Broadcasters, which also urged Apple to "light up the FM chip."
President Trump to Visit Puerto Rico President Donald Trump will visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to view the hurricane damage personally.
Trump talked about the rescue and recovery efforts, and the challenges presented due to the island's location.
(Published Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2017) "It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first," Pai said in his statement.
Puerto Rico is in the midst of what San Juan's mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others have called a humanitarian crisis.
Nearly half the island is without water and about all electricity customers without power as of Wednesday, according to federal agencies' most recent updates.
About nine in 10 cellphone sites were still out of service by Wednesday, and residents have complained that there's no way for them to get vital news about where to get supplies.
Many people continue to be unable simply to reach family members on the mainland.
Usually, smartphones get data through the internet, but with so much of the island crippled, internet service is very hard to come by.
But the FM chips that most phones are made with would allow them to tune into radio frequencies without anything other than power if the chips are activated, and users have an app downloaded that can access broadcasts.
Pai has long identified this capability as being important option for smartphone owners to have when disasters hit, and the FCC has recognized that it's particularly useful in disaster situations when the internet is hard to access.
"I don't think people realize how vulnerable people get," said former FEMA Administator Craig Fugate, citing cell system overload during Hurricane Sandy and the Virginia earthquake, in an interview with NAB.
FEMA urges people to have battery-powered radios in their disaster preparedness kits, but Fugate said in the 2014 interview, "If your radio's now in your cellphone, that's one less device that you have to have extra."
Currently, the NAB-supported NextRadio app, which can broadcast from the FM chip, is available on a wide variety of Samsung, HTC, Moto and other smartphones.
But not iPhones.
Apple did not respond when Wired wrote about the issue of smartphones' FM chips last year.
In a statement to NBC on Thursday, an Apple spokesperson said that its iPhone 7 and new iPhone 8 do not have FM radio chips in them "nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products."
"Apple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and thats why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products," Apple said in a statement.
"Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts."
Apple did not address the older models of iPhones, and the FCC declined to comment on the company's statement.
Activating the FM chip wouldn't immediately help anyone in Puerto Rico without internet already.
But advocates argue it would help Americans be prepared for the next disaster.

Asked at a 2013 congressional hearing why cellphone providers are reluctant to activatation of the chips, then-executive vice-president of the wireless association CTIA, Christopher Guttman-McCabe, said, "we leave it up to that ecosystem, and the carriers will compete against each other as well as the handset manufacturers."
In a recent statement, CTIA spokesman Nick Ludlum touted wireless providers' quick response to the three recent hurricanes that hit the United States, including by bringing in portable generators and cell equipment.
NBC reached out to the CTIA for a response to Pai's statement.

More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.
The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology.
The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.
WIPED OUT It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.
The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit's main defendant.
His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision.
It blamed "the undeniable ineptitude" at the Kennesaw State elections center.
In a statement Thursday, Kennesaw State said that after the FBI investigated and returned the server, it was flagged to be repurposed in a hardware upgrade at the elections center.
That's when the drives were wiped.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state's 15-year-old vote-management system particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don't use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent.
The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.
Wiping the server "forestalls any forensic investigation at all," said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case.
"People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way."
STATE SECURITY The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by hackers.
The plaintiffs contend results of both last November's election and a special June 20 congressional runoff won by Kemp's predecessor, Karen Handel cannot be trusted.
Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.
Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia's elections system is secure.
But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn't secure.
"I don't think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious," she said.
NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON'T It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.
The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole.
The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general's office was "reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image" and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.
On Wednesday, the attorney general's office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.
Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists.
Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server's files might have been altered by unauthorized users.
FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server's security hole.
As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia's 6.7 million voters including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.
The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016.
He informed the election center's director at the time, noting in an email "there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised."
Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia's biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data.
Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results.
An attacker could even have potentially modified "ballot-building" files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.
THE BIGGER PICTURE Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.
The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there's no evidence they altered voting outcomes.
But computer security experts say it's possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape.
In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.
CALL TO INVESTIGATE Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate.
GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: "They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent."
Carr's office declined comment.
Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe "appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence" by election officials, adding, "Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am."
Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university's decisions on voting machine security.
"Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift," Henderson said via email.

Amazon posted third-quarter earnings that far surpassed Wall Street expectations, helped by the acquisition of organic grocer Whole Foods and an increase in sales during its summer "Prime Day" promotions.
The company also said Thursday that it expects sales to rise during the busy holiday-shopping season.
Its shares soared 8 percent in extended trading after releasing the results.
Amazon has been busy in the past few months: It gained 465 physical stores after it paid nearly $14 billion for Whole Foods; it announced a series of new voice-activated Echo devices; and it kicked off a public hunt for a place to build its second headquarters.
It now employs more than 540,000 people, a 77 percent jump from a year ago, with some of that growth coming from the Whole Foods acquisition.
But the company said it has been also hiring software engineers, sales representatives and others to work on its cloud computing business, video streaming service and its devices.
Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos touted the popularity of its Echo devices in a statement, and pointed out that it launched five new voice-activated gadgets in the last month.
"Customers have purchased tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices," he said.
But other executives on a conference call with analysts Thursday were less chatty about Amazon's possible future endeavors: They declined to answer questions related to news reports that the company may open pharmacies at its Whole Food stores or start to sell medicine online.
Overall, Amazon reported net income of $256 million, or 52 cents per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30.
That easily beat the 2 cents per share analysts had expected, according to FactSet.
Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses, such as opening new warehouses to fulfill orders.
Many seemed to expect that again.
Revenue rose 34 percent to $43.47 billion, beating the $41.58 billion analysts expected.
The company said net sales included $1.3 billion from Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired on Aug. 28.
After taking over Whole Foods, Amazon slashed prices, added its logo on signs and set up a stand of "farm fresh" Amazon Echo voice-assistant devices by store entrances.
The company attributed the revenue jump to its third annual Prime Day in July, when it offers discounts to its Prime members to boost sales.
Amazon doesn't disclose how many Prime members it has, but it said revenue from its subscription services, which includes those who pay $99 a year for Prime, grew 59 percent from the year before.
For the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season, the company expects revenue between $56 billion and $60.5 billion, up as much as 38 percent from the year before, and above what analysts expected.
It expects to hire more than 120,000 temporary workers to help pack and sort orders for the holidays, the same number it hired last year.
Amazon has been working on ways to make shopping with it so easy that shoppers don't go elsewhere.
Next month it will launch a service called Amazon Key that will let people in some markets get their packages delivered inside their front doors.
It has taken up space inside some Kohl's department stores, where it sells Echo devices or lets customers drop off Amazon returns for free.
And it has installed lockers at Whole Foods locations where shoppers can pick up orders or drop off returns.
The company is also in the midst of choosing a place to build a second headquarters, since it has grown too big for its Seattle home.
It is sorting through 238 proposals from cities and regions across North America that want to land the promised 50,000 new jobs and construction spending of more than $5 billion.
Amazon plans to announce a decision sometime next year.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc., which are already up 30 percent this year, rose $77.67 to $1,050.10 in after-hours trading Thursday.

Microsoft's Bing search engine has long been a punch line in the tech industry, an also-ran that never came close to challenging Google's dominant position.
But Microsoft could still have the last laugh, since its service has helped lay the groundwork for its burgeoning artificial intelligence effort, which is helping keep the company competitive as it builds out its post-PC future.
Bing probably never stood a chance at surpassing Google, but its 2nd-place spot is worth far more than the advertising dollars it pulls in with every click.
Billions of searches over time have given Microsoft a massive repository of everyday questions people ask about their health, the weather, store hours or directions.
"The way machines learn is by looking for patterns in data," said former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, when asked earlier this year about the relationship between Microsoft's AI efforts and Bing, which he helped launch nearly a decade ago.
"It takes large data sets to make that happen."
HIDDEN FOUNDATION Microsoft has spent decades investing in various forms of artificial intelligence research, the fruits of which range from its voice assistant Cortana to email-sorting features and the machine-learning algorithms used by businesses that pay for its cloud platform Azure.
It's been stepping up its overt efforts recently, such as with this year's acquisition of Montreal-based Maluuba , a company aiming to create "literate machines" that can process and communicate information more like humans do.
Some see Bing as the overlooked foundation to those efforts.
"They're getting a huge amount of data across a lot of different contexts mobile devices, image searches," said Larry Cornett, a former executive for Yahoo's search engine.
"Whether it was intentional or not, having hundreds of millions of queries a day is exactly what you need to power huge artificial intelligence systems."
Bing launched in 2009 as a rebranding of Microsoft's earlier search engines.
Just weeks later, Yahoo and Microsoft signed a deal for Bing to power Yahoo's search engine, giving Microsoft access to Yahoo's greater search share, said Cornett, who worked for Yahoo at the time.
Similar deals have infused Bing into the search features for Amazon tablets and, until recently, Apple's Siri.
DUAL PURPOSES All of this has helped Microsoft better understand language, images and text at a large scale, said Steve Clayton, who as Microsoft's chief storyteller helps communicate the company's AI strategy.
"It's so much more than a search engine for Microsoft," he said.
"It's fuel that helps build other things."
Bing serves dual purposes, he said, as a source of data to train artificial intelligence and a vehicle to be able to deliver smarter services.
While Google also has the advantage of a powerful search engine, other companies making big investments in the AI race such as IBM or Amazon do not.
"Amazon has access to a ton of e-commerce queries, but they don't have all the other queries where people are asking everyday things," Cornett said.
PRACTICAL EFFECTS Neither Bing nor Microsoft's AI efforts have yet made significant contributions to the company's overall earnings, though the company repeatedly points out "we are infusing AI into all our products," including the workplace applications it sells to corporate customers.
The company on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter profit of $6.6 billion, up 16 percent from a year earlier, on revenue of $24.5 billion, up 12 percent.
Meanwhile, Bing-driven search advertising revenue increased by $210 million, or 15 percent, to $1.6 billion or roughly 7 percent of Microsoft's overall business.
That's OK by current Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella.
He doesn't look back to talk much about Bing, but he knows plenty about it.
Nearly a decade ago, he was the executive tapped by Ballmer to head Bing's engineering efforts.
In his recent autobiography , Nadella describes the search engine as a "great training ground for building the hyper-scale, cloud-first services" that have allowed the company to pivot to new technologies as its old PC-software business wanes.
Comcast's video upswing could be sputtering out.
The cable company added TV customers last year for the first time in a decade.
But on Thursday it posted its biggest quarterly cable-customer loss since 2014.
Research firm MoffettNathanson predicts that industrywide, traditional video subscriptions fell 3.4 percent in the third quarter.
That would mean that people ditched their TV subscriptions at fastest rate since online streaming started eating into cable's business.
Partly to blame in the July-September quarter were the hurricanes that struck Texas and Florida, damaging poles, wires and other infrastructure and interrupting service for millions.
But Comcast and other cable and satellite TV companies also say competition from online sources of video is taking a toll.
Comcast is still making more money per customer, however.
Comcast video customers fell 125,000 in the third quarter, echoing trends from rivals AT&T and Verizon.
AT&T's traditional TV customers dropped 385,000, while Verizon posted its third straight quarter of video losses.
If Verizon has a negative number for the year, it would be the first time since it started up a cable business over a decade ago.
This comes as Netflix, of course, has been streaming video for a decade, and Hulu almost as long.
But there's been a burst of original content from those services Hulu picked up cachet with an Emmy for its original series "Handmaid's Tale" in September as well as on Amazon.
HBO and other premium channels are available without any cable subscription.
And there's now a plethora of cable replacement services that stream traditional TV channels, live, and cost less than traditional cable.
The latest launched in April (YouTube TV) and May (Hulu's version).
Analysts estimate that these online versions of cable have picked up a few million customers in the past 2 1/2 years.
Prices are substantially lower than they are for traditional cable.
Google's YouTube TV costs $35 a month and includes a DVR and many popular networks (no CNN, TBS, HGTV or Discovery Channel, though); Sling starts at $20.
AT&T is discounting its DirecTV Now to $10 for customers with unlimited AT&T wireless plans.
Comcast is offering some cheaper, skinnier packages, but isn't going to "chase unprofitable video subs," said Comcast cable executive Matt Strauss at a recent investor conference.
Comcast added 214,000 broadband customers, down from 330,000 in last year's quarter.
That was also hurt by the storm.
Still, the company's average revenue per customer rose 2 percent, to $151.51, from a year ago.
Customers are taking more services, like DVRs, and Comcast raised its prices.
New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin expects that internet prices in particular are going to rise across the industry.
On a call with analysts Thursday, CEO Brian Roberts said that "as the market for video shifts," Comcast's "broadband business is increasingly the epicenter of our relationship with customers and ultimately where derive the majority of our profitability."
He added that Comcast was still "committed" to video.
In Comcast's NBCUniversal unit, the bonanza from last year's Olympics weighed on this quarter's results.
Revenue dropped 13 percent to $8 billion.
The company says that when results are adjusted to exclude the Olympics, revenue from its cable networks and broadcast networks, NBC and Telemundo, both rose.
Films were flat, and revenue from theme parks grew nearly 8 percent to $1.55 billion.
Overall, the Philadelphia company's net income rose 18.5 percent to $2.65 billion.
Revenue fell 1.6 percent to $20.98 billion.
Shares slipped 11 cents to $36.72 in afternoon trading.
This Friday is the kick-off for preorders for Apples much anticipated 10th-anniversary edition of its iPhone, the iPhone X.
Interested in Apple?
Add Apple as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Apple news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
Add Interest During a Sept. 12 release event, CEO Tim Cook described the iPhone X pronounced 10 as the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.
Heres what you need to know about the phone and how to order it: How to preorder Theres no waiting in long lines outside an Apple store for this iPhone.
If you want this iPhone, you have to head to Apples website to preorder.
Orders start at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time.
Apple is offering the option to get preapproved for your preorder if you already own iPhone.
The only way to get preapproved for a loan through Apple is to register with the iPhone upgrade program that it is offering, allowing customers to pay off the phone incrementally.
This plan is different and separate from offers from cellphone providers.
Once registered with the iPhone upgrade program, you have to use the Apple Store app on your iPhone to complete the preapproval process.
This will allow you to speed through the checkout process and does not guarantee an iPhone X. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pricing The iPhone X is the most expensive phone on the market, starting at $999 for the 64-gigabit version.
The 256 GB phone starts at $1,149.
Apples iPhone upgrade program offers monthly billing options: $49.91 a month for the 64 GB and $56.16 a month for 256 GB, including AppleCare insurance.
Cellphone carriers have similar offers.
Apple/Polaris Key selling features Edge-to-edge OLED screen OLED display means that the screen has crisper colors, brighter hues and blacker blacks.
This phone has the highest pixel density for an iPhone yet.
Face ID Facial recognition technology is used to unlock the phone.
Users simply have to look at the phone to unlock it.
Apple says the camera sensors will adapt to your physical changes over time.
True depth camera The iPhone Xs true depth camera allows users to take selfies with portrait mode and comes with a portrait lighting feature.
Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Tech analyst predictions [iPhone X is] what all phones will be in the future.
Im stopping short of calling it game changing, said Patrick Moorhead, a tech industry analyst of Moors Insights Strategy.
He said that the Samsung Galaxy 8 is a better phone but that from a consumer point of view, the iPhone X provides one of the best experiences.
I would say the best experience.
It has the highest speed LTE, but unfortunately, it doesnt support gigabit LTE that premium Android phones have.
Gigabit LTE is the fastest cellphone service available.
He sees one of the top selling features of the phone as the size.
It has the display size of the Plus but the pocket size of a regular iPhone, he explained.
As for the design of the phone, Moorhead sees it as what all phones will be in the future.
Moorhead predicted that the iPhone X will sell out so fast that its not even funny and that people are hesitant to buy the iPhone 8 because of the X edition.
Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.
Tech industry analyst Daniel Ives, the head of technology research at GBH Insights in New York, agreed, referring to the iPhone 8 as a placeholder for the iPhone X. I think presales going on Friday and this weekend could approach 40 million units, said Ives.
To actually get your hands on an iPhone between now and the holiday season is going to be an impressive feat.
The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.
Unlike Moorhead, Ives sees the iPhone X as an industry game changer.
From a product functionality standpoint, it is pure optic technology, Ives said.
GBH Insights analysis showed that an estimated 350 million iPhone users are up for an upgrade or will be eligible within the next year, and Ives thinks that most of these users will want to spring for the X.
The real success of [the iPhone X] is going to be during 2018, Ives predicted, but he questioned whether the sticker shock will be a deterrent for buyers.
According to surveys by GBH Insights, fewer than 20 percent of surveyed users saw the price as a deterrent.
The Trump administration pulled support Wednesday from Gov.
Jerry Brown's ambitious plan to build California's biggest water project in decades, casting the current form of the $16 billion proposal to build two giant tunnels as another unwanted legacy from the Obama era The comments from a U.S. Department of the Interior spokesman marked the first public statements by the Trump administration on the initiative and signaled the latest setback for the project that California's 79-year-old leader had hoped to see launched before he leaves office next year.
The Obama administration gave millions of dollars for planning the tunnels, but "the Trump administration did not fund the project and chose to not move forward with it," Russell Newell, deputy communications director for the U.S.
Interior Department, said in an email.
Asked in an email exchange if his statement meant the Department of Interior "isn't going to be moving forward with California's tunnels project, is that right?
The Trump administration has ruled that out?"
Newell responded, "Yes."
Newell later softened the statement, saying the Interior Departmenit shared California's goals for a more reliable and environmentally friendly water supply but "does not expect to participate in the construction or funding" of the project in its current form.
Interior officials "will continue to work with the state and stakeholders as the project is further developed," Newell said.
While the plan is a state initiative that was never slated to draw upon federal financing, it would intersect with existing state and federal water projects and would require approval from the Interior Department to move ahead.
Brown wants California water agencies to pay to plan and build two, 35-mile-long tunnels to divert part of the state's largest river, the Sacramento, to supply water to the San Francisco Bay Area and central and Southern California.
But the plan has hit its biggest obstacles yet in recent weeks, when two key water districts opted not to help fund it.
In another setback, the Interior Department's inspector-general last month challenged the $84 million that the federal agency had contributed to the project under Obama, calling it an improper use of taxpayer funds.
As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump called broadly for more projects to bring water to farmers in California, the country's leading agricultural state.
Lisa Lien-Mager, a spokeswoman for the state Natural Resources Agency, said the statement Wednesday from the Interior Department was good news for the project.
"The statement provided by the DOI confirms what the state and its water project partners already knew; while the federal government does not intend to fund the construction costs of the project they will continue working with the state and stakeholders to facilitate and permit WaterFix," she wrote in an email, using the state's term for the tunnel project.
Trump's administration had not previously taken a stand on the tunnels project pushed by California's Democratic governor, though federal wildlife agencies gave the green light in June.
They found that the plan would not mean extinction for endangered and threatened native species, including native salmon.
The Trump administration has targeted a number of projects supported by Obama, from immigration initiatives to international trade deals.
Trump's policies also are at odds with many of those backed by Brown, who has referred to the president's supporters as cave-dwellers and called Trump's actions in office "stupid and dangerous and silly."
Until now, however, Brown had avoided most public rifts with the Trump administration over federal decisions dealing with California.
Brown's administration and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, with Brown one of the project's main backers, argued the two tunnels each the width of a three-lane highway would make for more reliable water supplies, especially for the more arid south.
Supporters and opponents disagree on the effect on struggling native species.
Opponents say the tunnels could be used to drain much of the water from the West Coast's largest estuary the San Francisco Bay and adjoining rivers.
"At a minimum, this announcement certainly complicates the state's chances of ever funding and permitting the massive twin tunnels project," said Doug Obegi, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the plan.
"It's yet another reason for the state to transparently work with all stakeholders to reconsider this proposal."
Newell, with the Interior Department, made his statements in response to a request Tuesday by California's Democratic members of Congress for a new probe of U.S. spending on the project under Obama.
Five Democrats, including opponents of the tunnels, asked the U.S. General Accountability Office to determine whether the planning payments were illegal.
"The $84 million spent in taxpayers' money without disclosure to Congress and kept hidden from the public were decisions driven and executed by the Obama administration and that team," Newell said.
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke "believes that using tax dollars wisely and ethically is a big responsibility and is at the heart of good government," Newell said.
Federal and state authorities were discussing cooperation on the project since at least 2008, when George W. Bush was in office.
Obama's administration pushed for the tunnels, including funding planning costs.
The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission said he's willing to work with corrections officials, telecom companies and the FBI to combat cellphones in the nation's prisons.
In a letter obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wrote to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff of Tennessee, telling him that he'll try to arrange a meeting among those groups within 120 days and report its progress to Congress, fulfilling a request "I share your concerns about the proliferation of contraband wireless devices in prisons and the potentially devastating implications for public safety," Pai wrote in the letter, dated Tuesday.
"We continue our efforts to push for even better procedures and solutions for this very serious problem."
Pai was responding to a letter sent earlier this month by Kustoff and dozens of other House members and U.S. senators.
In it, they wrote that addressing the security threat posed by contraband cellphones is "an issue of critical importance" and called on the FCC to bring together the different groups for a discussion, giving a deadline for resolving how best to prevent prisoners from using contraband phones behind bars.
Inmates use the phones, the members of Congress wrote, to continue the violent crimes and gang activity that landed them behind bars in the first place.
The signees, which include both of South Carolina's U.S. senators and all of its Republican House members, asked the FCC to set up a meeting with state prison officials, cellphone companies and the FBI within 120 days, and to report back to Congress on their progress.
Noting that some on Capitol Hill would like to fix the issue by congressional mandate, the members wrote they would prefer a more "collaborative approach."
The interaction follows letters by a top official with the U.S. Department of Justice and South Carolina Corrections Director Bryan Stirling describing the dangers posed by inmates' unfettered ability to communicate via cellphones.
Earlier this year, Stirling, a leading voice on the need to eradicate the phones from prisons, wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, beseeching the top prosecutor for help pursuing FCC permission to jam cell signals.
South Carolina Gov.
Henry McMaster also lobbied, writing a memo to Sessions in August on the dangers of prison cellphones and thanking him for any help he could provide.
Assistant Attorney General Beth Williams also weighed in, telling FCC officials that addressing the security threat posed "should be a chief priority" of both the FCC and Justice, which oversees the federal Bureau of Prisons.
U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford has also called for action.
Stirling and others in his position say the phones thrown over fences, smuggled by employees, even delivered by drone present the biggest threat to prison security.
A decades-old law says federal officials can grant permission to jam the public airwaves only to federal agencies, not state or local ones.
Telecommunications companies are opposed, saying jamming cell signals could set a bad precedent and interfere with legal cell users nearby.
Pai has signaled willingness to work on the issue, a stance he reiterated in his letter to Kustoff.
In March, after Pai took testimony from Stirling and a former South Carolina corrections officer who was nearly killed in an assassination attempt orchestrated by an inmate using an illegal phone, commissioners voted 3-0 to approve rules to streamline the process for using technology to detect and block contraband phones in prisons and jails across the country.

Is it possible to win so much that you end up losing?
That's one question facing Google and some of its tech compatriots as they prepare to testify before congressional investigations into Russian meddling next week.
Google continues to pile on billions in ad revenue every quarter.
But like its chief rival Facebook, it's being pressured to rein in its hyper-efficient advertising machine.
Google and Facebook dominate the U.S. digital ad market Google will take 42 percent and Facebook 21 percent of U.S. digital ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer.
But pressure to limit the spread of fake news and curb foreign influence in elections could crimp revenue and raise costs in the future if the companies, for instance, have to add further human oversight to their machine-powered algorithms.
POLITICAL ADS AND POLITICS Both Facebook and Twitter have already announced plans to make political ads more transparent in line with a bill introduced last week by Sens.
Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar.
Facebook said it was adding 1,000 human checkers to review ads.
Google hasn't said how it might comply with potential new rules around political ads, but observers say it's unlikely to get a free pass from Congress.
"It's hard to know whether Congress or regulators will actually step up and regulate the company, but there seems to be a newfound willingness to consider such action," says Daniel Stevens, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog that tracks Google spending on lobbyists and academics.
"Google, like every other industry, should not be left to its own devices."
Google was hit in June with a $2.9 billion fine by European Union for harming competitors, and in response, it has tweaked its product search results in Europe by allowing competitive online retailers to bid for premium spots in a search results pane.
EU regulators have said they will keep a watchful eye on whether the adjustment actually gives equal treatment to rivals.
Neither Google CEO Sundar Pichai nor Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., mentioned the Russia probe or congressional hearings on a call with analysts Thursday.
The most the company has said publicly is a statement it issued last week, in which it offered support for "efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures, and reduce foreign abuse."
Google added that it is "evaluating" further steps of its own and pledged to work closely with government and industry to "explore the best solutions."
THAT SUPERCHARGED AD MACHINE Alphabet posted third-quarter revenues, excluding that shared with partners, that rose 22 percent to $22.27 billion.
Net income rose to $6.73 billion from $5.06 billion a year ago, a 33 percent increase.
The profit jump was a surprise to analysts, and Alphabet shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trading.
Monica Peart, senior forecasting director with eMarketer, says increased revenue is largely coming from higher-cost segments like mobile search and YouTube, where Google ends up sharing a bigger portion of ad revenue with partners like cellphone makers and video creators.
Meanwhile, research and development costs continue to rise up 17 percent to $4.21 billion as Google and other Alphabet units plow more money into artificial intelligence, Google-branded hardware such as the Pixel phone and Home smart speaker, and so-called moonshot projects like its Project Loon balloons , which were recently deployed to deliver internet access to hurricane-ravaged parts of Puerto Rico.
Twitter says it will ban ads from RT and Sputnik, two state-sponsored Russian news outlets that the U.S. intelligence community has said tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The San Francisco company also plans to donate proceeds from RT, formally known as Russia Today, and Sputnik ads to support outside research on Twitter use in civic engagement and elections.
This amounts to $1.9 million the company expects to have earned since 2011.
Twitter, Google and Facebook are scheduled to testify at congressional hearings next week on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Twitter also said this week it will disclose more information on political ads.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state news agency RIA Novosti that Twitter's move is "another aggressive step" aimed at blocking RT.
She also hinted at retaliation.
"Of course, a response will follow," she said.
Scientists say they have more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 has been caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground, similar to human-caused quakes in Oklahoma and other states.
A paper published last week by researchers at the University of Colorado concluded that the wastewater caused a big enough increase in underground pressure to make rock formations slip along fault lines.
"You find that the pressure changes at a given depth are enough to trigger earthquakes," said Jenny Nakai, the paper's lead author and a doctoral student at the university.
The paper, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, is the latest to link wastewater injection wells to earthquakes.
Most oil and gas wells produce at least some wastewater that is too salty to use, so regulators allow energy companies to pump it back underground to get rid of it.
Researchers have linked earthquakes in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas to wastewater injection.
Oklahoma had only a few dozen earthquakes of magnitude-3.0 or greater in 2012 but had more than 900 in 2015.
The number dropped to closer to 600 last year after state regulators directed energy companies to close some injection wells or reduce the volume of water they inject.
In the Raton Basin of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, earthquakes began to increase in 2001, about two years after large-scale wastewater injection began, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
The wastewater comes from wells that extract natural gas from underground coal beds.
The biggest quake in the basin since 2001 was magnitude-5.3 in 2011.
It caused minor damage to buildings in Trinidad, Colorado, about 15 miles from the epicenter.
A 2014 paper by the Geological Survey blamed injection wells for the area's quakes.
The new University of Colorado study went further, using computer models and records of wastewater injection to conclude that enough pressure built up to cause the quakes.
Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey who was the lead author of the 2014 paper, said the computer models have been used in other locations but not in the Raton Basin before now.
Rubinstein was not involved in the University of Colorado study and said he was not familiar with all its details but that the general conclusions made sense.
"It's consistent with what my research has shown," he said.
The University of Colorado study also found that the Raton Basin earthquakes were more widespread than previously thought, said Nakai, the lead author.
Earlier studies focused on the Colorado portion of the basin because that was the site of a 2001 swarm of 12 quakes the strongest was magnitude-4.6 as well as the 5.3 quake in 2011.
But seismometers recorded 1,881 quakes in the area between 2008 and 2010, and 1,442 of them were in New Mexico, Nakai said.
The strongest was magnitude-3.8.
The 2008-2010 data came from a temporary deployment of seismometers as part of two other research projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Nakai said.

Google's parent Alphabet Inc. said Friday that its stratospheric balloons are now delivering the internet to remote areas of Puerto Rico where cellphone towers were knocked out by Hurricane Maria.
Two of the search giant's "Project Loon" balloons are already over the country enabling texts, emails and basic web access to AT&T customers with handsets that use its 4G LTE network.
The balloons called HBAL199 and HBAL237 are more than 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) above land, according to FlightRadar24.com .
They navigate using an algorithm that puts them in the best position to deliver signal by rising and falling to ride wind currents.
They are also solar-powered and only provide signal during the day Several more balloons are on their way from Nevada, and Alphabet has been authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to send up to 30 balloons to serve the hard-hit area, according to Libby Leahy, spokeswoman for Alphabet's X, its division for futuristic technologies.
Project Loon head Alastair Westgarth said in a blog post that Project Loon is "still an experimental technology and we're not quite sure how well it will work," though it has been tested since last year in Peru following flooding there.
Hurricane Maria devastated the U.S. territory of 3.4 million people since making landfall last month.
Gov.
Ricardo Rossello said Friday the death toll had risen to 49.
Less than a fifth of the island has electricity, half its cellphone towers are still not functioning, schools are closed and more than 4,000 are in shelters, according to a government website .
AT&T spokesman Jeffrey Kobs said the company has set up 14 temporary cell sites, and as of Friday more than 60 percent of the population was connected via mobile network, in part due to the help of humanitarian and government groups and Project Loon.
Other technology companies such as Cisco, Facebook and Tesla have also pledged help or have sent teams to the island to improve communications and restore power.

We're back with the weekend download.
Are smartwatches a smart idea for your children?
A new study raising questions about privacy and Becky Worley joins us with more.
Hey, Becky, good morning.
Good morning, Dan.
There's this new report that says some of these have lax security and could impact your child's privacy.
How so?
Right, the report looked at four different of these children's tracker watches.
It was done by the Norwegian consumer council and a European security firm.
They found hackers could access a child's location, see their personal info and in some cases they could listening in on the kid through the watch's microphone.
So I imagine this is only going to build on the backlash on devices that use Mike answer collect personal data in that's gotten parents' attention but I think it's important to say it's not that security experts think hackers are lined up to target kids but these watches promise security and safety so when it comes to kids they need to be extra locked down.
Add to it the survey found some of them collect data and one sold it to marketers.

But the surroundings because this is a really interesting spot for Chicago.
And an interesting spot for apple to locate as you can probably see.
Through the building which is entirely glass by the way glass all the way around it 360.
You can see behind me that's the Chicago river over here and that's Michigan avenue behind there is this Chicago Tribune so this is a very.
In porn spot for the city of Chicago.
And now will be an important spot.
For apple and its brand new store here on Michigan avenue apple Michigan avenue is the name of the store and it take you guys down Taylor done my camera woman is doing an amazing job and we're also trying to follow along with you for questions so if you do have questions were following put them in the comments section and we'll try to answer them.
As we goal on.
We see inside this store guy is literally the entire thing is blast 20000.
Square feet.
It is years upon years in the making in this is really apples.
Re imagining of what resale store what that shopping experience can look and feel like and wonderment.
Really interesting things here is now we walked only halfway down the store and you seem there you don't see any products.
Have queen did this store there are no products how many stores can you think of where you literally walk in and you don't see products right away while they saying at apple that one of the reasons for that is they want this to be a place where people can come and spend time together in fact.
They even built these stairs out on both sides so that they look identical outside to the way they look inside.
And there's thinking behind Matt they tell me that it's because they want to be able to allow people.
To hang out that they want this to be a place where people can spend times when he forced them and whether it's inside the store.
Or spending time out here and why wouldn't you want to spend time I hear it's beautiful this is the Chicago river.
There's Michigan avenue.
So you get a real sense for the surroundings here it really is right in the heart of the city of Chicago I'm just gonna take a quick peek and see if anyone's written in any comments yet.
I'm curious now I'm sure there are probably some cubs fans out there.
I don't know I hope you're located A guys I know it's they know was a tough one last night.
Irate let's see what are we have for questions.

In in that central section.
That probably looks somewhat familiar to you it's the part where all of the products are on display but all around the edges of this Apple Store.
Are different things that are interactive for people Wii game a number of these things a try for example.
There's a section where you can learn to code and literally learn to code.
How to make a robot move around we got to play with these robots yesterday when we were in the store with Angela our friends who is the woman behind this entire concept she's the former CEO burglary she came to apple about three years ago and this is years in the making this his term vision to really bring together people as not just.
A store but a meeting place.
And what things about retail for anybody who follows at retail in the whole shopping experience everyone.
Understands that.
The entire landscape a retail is changing.
Today because stores are not exactly what they used to be an apple understands that they appreciate that more and more people now are shopping online so why would you go to a store.
That's the question an apple is trying to answer that they're making this a spot.
Where they believe people can come in and take classes there are classes that they offer here you can see a little bit behind the trees by the way.
There are trees inside this store just like the trees outside.
You can see this major screen here at the monitor an LCD monitor and on that monitor you can do everything from create a picture you can drop.
Literally on a on iPad you couldn't created drying and it'll show up I'm not I did something where I created a song using beats on an iPad.
And that'll show up on the screen as well and they have sound system where that'll show up as well.
They teach a RT kids augmented reality classes which we had a chance to.
To experience yesterday but the bottom line here is the mission of retail for the future and apple has been at the forefront of changing so many things in our lives.
Literally things like this that have completely changed the way that we behave in the way that we interact with technology.
And now they're trying to change this.
The storefront because so many retailers are trying to figure out.
How do we create a storefront that people want to spend time at that people want to come to you see up here.
In here there's a waiting area.
These steps here.
That's the new genius bar that's where if you have a question.
For somebody out apple you can come in and wait any CNN genius bar I don't know you guys can see it hopefully you can.
But along and genius bar there are onions so that you can charge and I asked Angela aren't yesterday when we're walking through.
The building.
About those plug ins and she said you don't even have to necessarily have a question for our genius bar you could just come in off of Michigan avenue.
And charger phone here if that's something that you needed to do.
The main thing in Apple's mind is they want this to be a place for community and a place where people come together.
And and one of the things.
They probably know is that when you get a chance to test out products whether your kid carrier an adult.
After you spend a little time with the product usually you enjoy it and you think about buying it so even if you're coming in just a given a test run.

A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.
The server's data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state's election system.
The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was later obtained by the AP.
More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.
The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology.
The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.
WIPED OUT It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.
The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit's main defendant.
His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision.
It blamed "the undeniable ineptitude" at the Kennesaw State elections center.
After declining comment for more than 24 hours, Kennesaw State's media office issued a statement late Thursday attributing the server wiping to "standard operating procedure."
It did not respond to the AP's question on who ordered the action.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state's 15-year-old vote-management system particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don't use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent.
The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.
Wiping the server "forestalls any forensic investigation at all," said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case.
"People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way."
STATE SECURITY The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by hackers.
The plaintiffs contend results of both last November's election and a special June 20 congressional runoff won by Kemp's predecessor, Karen Handel cannot be trusted.
Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.
Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia's elections system is secure.
But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn't secure.
"I don't think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious," she said.
NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON'T It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.
The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole.
The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general's office was "reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image" and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.
On Wednesday, the attorney general's office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.
Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists.
Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server's files might have been altered by unauthorized users.
FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server's security hole.
As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia's 6.7 million voters including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.
The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016.
He informed the election center's director at the time, noting in an email "there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised."
Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia's biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data.
Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results.
An attacker could even have potentially modified "ballot-building" files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.
THE BIGGER PICTURE Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.
The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there's no evidence they altered voting outcomes.
But computer security experts say it's possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape.
In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.
CALL TO INVESTIGATE Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate.
GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: "They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent."
Carr's office declined comment.
Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe "appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence" by election officials, adding, "Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am."
Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university's decisions on voting machine security.
"Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift," Henderson said via email.

Is it possible to win so much that you end up losing?
That's one question facing Google and some of its tech compatriots as they prepare to testify before congressional investigations into Russian meddling next week.
Google continues to pile on billions in ad revenue every quarter.
But like its chief rival Facebook, it's being pressured to rein in its hyper-efficient advertising machine.
Google and Facebook dominate the U.S. digital ad market Google will take 42 percent and Facebook 21 percent of U.S. digital ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer.
But pressure to limit the spread of fake news and curb foreign influence in elections could crimp revenue and raise costs in the future if the companies, for instance, have to add further human oversight to their machine-powered algorithms.
POLITICAL ADS AND POLITICS Both Facebook and Twitter have already announced plans to make political ads more transparent in line with a bill introduced last week by Sens.
Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar.
Facebook said it was adding 1,000 human checkers to review ads.
Google hasn't said how it might comply with potential new rules around political ads, but observers say it's unlikely to get a free pass from Congress.
"It's hard to know whether Congress or regulators will actually step up and regulate the company, but there seems to be a newfound willingness to consider such action," says Daniel Stevens, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog that tracks Google spending on lobbyists and academics.
"Google, like every other industry, should not be left to its own devices."
Google was hit in June with a $2.9 billion fine by European Union for harming competitors, and in response, it has tweaked its product search results in Europe by allowing competitive online retailers to bid for premium spots in a search results pane.
EU regulators have said they will keep a watchful eye on whether the adjustment actually gives equal treatment to rivals.
Neither Google CEO Sundar Pichai nor Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., mentioned the Russia probe or congressional hearings on a call with analysts Thursday.
The most the company has said publicly is a statement it issued last week, in which it offered support for "efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures, and reduce foreign abuse."
Google added that it is "evaluating" further steps of its own and pledged to work closely with government and industry to "explore the best solutions."
THAT SUPERCHARGED AD MACHINE Alphabet posted third-quarter revenues, excluding that shared with partners, that rose 22 percent to $22.27 billion.
Net income rose to $6.73 billion from $5.06 billion a year ago, a 33 percent increase.
The profit jump was a surprise to analysts, and Alphabet shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trading.
Monica Peart, senior forecasting director with eMarketer, says increased revenue is largely coming from higher-cost segments like mobile search and YouTube, where Google ends up sharing a bigger portion of ad revenue with partners like cellphone makers and video creators.
Meanwhile, research and development costs continue to rise up 17 percent to $4.21 billion as Google and other Alphabet units plow more money into artificial intelligence, Google-branded hardware such as the Pixel phone and Home smart speaker, and so-called moonshot projects like its Project Loon balloons , which were recently deployed to deliver internet access to hurricane-ravaged parts of Puerto Rico.
Image copyright AFP Image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.
More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).
At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.
The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now "get their act together".
WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.
The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to 230 ($300).
The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.
An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.
The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said.
"Before 12 May 2017, the Department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."
Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.
NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.
NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.
But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.

Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.
It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients.
how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.
His "kill switch" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.

It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.
WannaCry was "a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice," said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO.
"There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."
Keith McNeil, chief clinical information officer for health and care at NHS England, said emergency plans were activated quickly and staff "went the extra mile" to provide care.
Image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.
So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.
To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts.
When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.
Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS.
Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.
In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.
Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem.
And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Twitter is to donate all money earned from the outlets Twitter is banning two of Russia's biggest media outlets from buying advertising amid fears they attempted to interfere with the 2016 US election.
The ban on advertising from Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, and all linked accounts, was "effective immediately".
US authorities say both act as "a platform for Kremlin messaging".
The social media giant will donate an estimated $1.9m (1.4m) made from the outlets into research on Twitter's use in "civic engagement and elections".
Twitter said the decision "was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 US election and the US intelligence community's conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government".
The statement, published on the social media platform's blog, continued: "We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter."
The decision has provoked an angry response in Russia, with the country's foreign ministry accusing Twitter of bowing to pressure from the US intelligence services, saying the move was "another aggressive step" aimed at blocking Russian media in the US.

His comments followed those of RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, who used Twitter's own platform to accuse the social network of pushing them to "spend big" during the election.
Twitter did not comment when asked about the accusation, Reuters news agency said.
Sputnik told news agency AFP it "has never used advertising on Twitter".
Twitter is one of a number of companies keen to show they can self-regulate after it was found that Russian-backed groups were exploiting its ad platform.
Its lawyers are due to appear before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees to discuss possible interference on 1 November.
Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the 2016 elections.
US intelligence services accuse the country of trying to sway the vote in Donald Trump's favour in various ways, including by spreading fake news and hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks in order to undermine rival Hillary Clinton.
The allegations have sparked an investigation into possible links between Russia and Mr Trump, led by special counsel Rob Mueller, a former FBI director.
Mr Trump denies there was any collusion.

Image copyright Getty Images Tech giants Amazon and Google's parent Alphabet have posted a surge in sales over the last three months.
Shares in Alphabet jumped above $1,000 in after-hours trading after the company reported sales up 24% to $27.8bn.
Amazon, the world's biggest e-commerce site, saw sales rise 34% to $43.7bn - nearly the size of Slovenia's economy last year.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's profit beat estimates on gains from cloud services.
Alphabet's profits for the three months to 30 September rose to $7.8bn, from $5.6bn for the same quarter last year.
The company's chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was delighted with the way it was performing.
"We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets," she said.
"Our momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products and partnerships."
Google continues to make up the vast majority of Alphabet's revenue and income.
However the so-called Other Bets unit, which includes the Waymo driverless car business and the Project Loon WiFi-enabled weather balloon venture, saw revenue increase and losses fall.
Total Other Bets revenue was up to $302m, from $197m last year.
YouTube continued to see "phenomenal growth", said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in a conference call, with more than 1.5 billion people spending an average of an hour a day watching videos there on mobile devices, and surging use on television screens in homes.
Amazon Despite Amazon's sales growth, the firm's profits were nearly flat as it ploughed money into tech gadgets, streaming video, data centres and warehouses to support its growing empire.
The firm said profits in the three months to the end of September were $256m, up from $252m in 2016.
Shares surged in after-hours trade anyway, as investors, who had been expecting a smaller number after being warned to expect the reinvestment, cheered the firm's growth prospects.
Chief executive Jeff Bezos said the Amazon sales increase was in part down to the growing demand for the firm's smart home products, which are powered by artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa.
"In the last month alone, we've launched five new Alexa-enabled devices, introduced Alexa in India, announced integration with BMW, surpassed 25,000 skills, integrated Alexa with Sonos speakers, taught Alexa to distinguish between two voices, and more," Mr Bezos said.
Upmarket grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in August, brought in $1.3bn in sales in the quarter.
Excluding Whole Foods, sales increased 29%, Amazon said.
Sales were up 35% overall in North America, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's business.
They increased 29% in its international division thanks in part to a Prime Day surge, but the unit is still running at an operating loss.
The firm also said it now has nearly 542,000 full and part-time staff, including workers from Whole Foods.
It continues to look at ways to expand its physical stores as well.
Microsoft Microsoft said it earned revenue of $24.5bn in the three months to end-September, up 12% year-on-year.
The firm's profits were $6.6bn, rising 16%.
Microsoft shares rose 3.1% after-hours to a record $81.2.
Microsoft said growth was driven in part by its cloud computing products, which it has focused on in a bid to be less reliant on computer sales and older software.
Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Microsoft, called it a "strong start" to the year.
The firm reported $6.9bn in revenue from its intelligent cloud unit, up 14% year-on-year.
Its productivity and business processes division, which includes sales from Office 365, reported $8.2bn in revenue, up 28%.
A fourth tech company, Intel, also posted a jump in revenues and profit.
The world's largest computer chip maker said revenue rose 2% during the quarter to $16.1bn, with net income up 34% to $4.52bn.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The domain name was checked regularly by software installed as standard on many Dell PCs A web address used by recovery software on Dell PCs was taken over by a third-party after a contractor apparently failed to renew it.
Dell's software checks in with the domain periodically, so whoever snapped it up could use it to distribute malware.
Security expert and author Brian Krebs - who first reported the issue - believed there was a possibility that this had happened.
Dell says no malware was transferred.
Dell's Backup and Recovery Application software is installed by default on many of the firm's PCs and allows users to restore their computers to factory settings, in the event of problems.
The software downloaded updates from dellbackupandrecoverycloudstorage.com.
That web address used to be controlled by US-based tech firm SoftThinks, but was taken over by another party at some point between June and July this year.
"Approximately two weeks after Dell's contractor lost control over the domain, the server it was hosted on started showing up in malware alerts," Mr Krebs said in his blog.
In a statement, Dell admitted it had lost control of the domain name but said the problem had been "addressed".
Dell said: "We do not believe that the Dell Backup and Recovery calls to the URL during the period in question resulted in the transfer of information to or from the site, including the transfer of malware to any user device."
A spokeswoman for Dell said that, on 9 July, the developer of the program bought the domain back from the third party that snapped it up - but she would not confirm how much this cost.
The BBC has contacted SoftThinks for comment.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Nazi rallies in the US have prompted counter-protests recently Reddit has closed down several extremist forums after updating its policy regarding violent content.
The newly banned and removed pages include r/NationalSocialism, r/Nazi, r/whitesarecriminals and r/far_right.
Reddit's new policy says: "Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people."
One legal expert has said the policy may be difficult to enforce.
The updated policy notes that violent content may sometimes be posted as part of educational, newsworthy or artistic material but adds that the context and reason for posting such content should be made clear.
Material that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals, such as bestiality, is also now being removed.
In 2015, Reddit updated its policy to deter harassment - a move that resulted in the shutting down of forums including r/fatpeoplehate.
However, Reddit has sometimes allowed material that would commonly be banned on mainstream social media sites.
The new crackdown suggests the site is trying to position itself as a more mainstream business, said legal expert Prof Eric Heinze of Queen Mary, University of London.
As companies grow, "they start caring about social norms, they care about PR, regardless of whether they had a more maverick origin," he told the BBC.
Prof Heinze also said people with controversial views may find ways of dodging the crackdown.
"Instead of a gross attack against black people, for example, it'll just be things about 'preserving our identity'.
They find a coded speech that everyone understands," he said.

"I have been reviewing some [unpublished] research on whether or not these [Reddit] bans make a difference," he said.
"The researchers found that there was a reduction in terms of hate speech overall [on the site]," he told the BBC.
"So in that sense it was an effective move."
In August, a neo-Nazi and white supremacist website called The Daily Stormer was rejected by several web companies and was forced to move to the dark web.
This treatment was later criticised by civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which said it believed "no-one" should decide who is able to speak or not, including the government and private companies.
Image copyright Getty Images WhatsApp and Facebook will be scrutinised by a data protection taskforce, after they were accused of "non-compliance" with EU laws.
The regulators took issue with the messaging app's plan to share user data with parent company Facebook.
A group of watchdogs and regulators from EU nations, known as the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, said WhatsApp had not fixed issues raised.
WhatsApp and Facebook have yet to reply to the BBC's request for comment.
Facebook bought the messaging app in 2014 and pledged to keep it independent from its social network.
However, in August 2016, it announced plans to share user data with its parent company to offer up "friend suggestions" and "more relevant ads".
At the time, the move was criticised by the UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who said she did not believe the firm had obtained valid consent from its users.
In its newest letter to WhatsApp chief executive Jan Koum, the Working Party said "the information presented to users was seriously deficient as a means to inform their consent".
It said: the pop-up notice on WhatsApp did not make it clear that users' personal data would be shared with Facebook WhatApp gave a "misleading impression" to users by saying the privacy policy had been updated to "reflect new features" that using a pre-ticked check box to accept the new terms did not indicate "unambiguous consent" the company failed to offer "sufficiently granular user controls" to let people opt out of data sharing Both Facebook and WhatsApp have been invited to meet with the taskforce, which will be led by the UK's information commissioner.

The sign, which has displayed electrical advertisements for more than a century, was switched off in January and replaced with a temporary banner.
The new state-of-the-art screen is interactive and fully responsive allowing advertisers to include aspects such as live video streaming.
About 100 million people pass the central London site each year.
Before January it was the first time since World War Two the lights had been switched off, apart from during power cuts and special events.

Image copyright Reuters Twitter said it may turn a profit in the fourth quarter as the tech company narrowed its losses and added users.
The firm, which has not posted a profit since going public four years ago, said its losses narrowed from $103m (78m) to $21m in the third quarter.
The number of monthly active users grew by four million to a total of 330 million at the end of September.
Twitter said its revenue reached $590m, a 4% decrease compared with the same period in 2016.
The social media company, which faces intense competition from the likes of Facebook and Instagram, said it had previously mis-stated the number of users, as it "had included users of certain third-party applications".
It revised those figures down by two million users in the second quarter.
"This quarter, we made progress in three key areas of our business," Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said.
"We grew our audience and engagement, made progress on a return to revenue growth, and achieved record profitability."
The numbers come as Twitter ramps up efforts to boost engagement, following mounting criticism that it is not doing enough to tackle abuse on the social network and that its ads platform was misused.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chief executive Jack Dorsey has been taking action against abuse on Twitter Earlier this month, Mr Dorsey said Twitter would take a more "aggressive stance" against online abuse.
The firm also promised to penalise users who post messages that glorify or condone violence and to review user complaints more quickly.
Twitter has also been focusing on boosting engagement through video and live events.
Many social platforms are adding millions a day by comparison and "Twitter is done growing," said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki.
Video has not made much of a difference and its ad platform has made little progress, he added.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The letter claims Patreon had helped prevent some porn creators from becoming homeless Dozens of adult content creators have signed an open letter to Patreon challenging restrictions it has placed on the creation of pornography.
The crowdfunding service updated its rules last week to explicitly ban the sale of pornographic content and provision of sexual services.
It said at the time that it was clarifying an existing policy.
But the firm has been accused of betraying some of its members who say their activity is not illegal.
"We know people who would be homeless if it wasn't for making porn on Patreon - and it's not a small number," the letter states.
"Your fuzzy position on 'adult content' versus 'porn' gives you the freedom to discriminate at will.
"And it makes content creators live in fear of that discrimination, itself leading to self-censorship of important viewpoints."
Patreon's chief executive has said he intends to issue a "thorough response" later this Wednesday.
Skip Twitter post by @jackconte Regarding changes to our content policy: I hear you, I read the open letter.
I'm working with the team to have a thorough response by 2mrrow Jack Conte (@jackconte) October 25, 2017 Report 'Fringe content' Unlike most crowdfunding platforms - which focus on delivery of a single product or experience - Patreon provides its members with a way to charge a monthly subscription fee for an ongoing service, from which it takes a cut.
In many cases, this involves the delivery of podcasts, music, training videos and artistic performances.
But on 17 October, the site's legal chief said he had become concerned that "a small number of creators" were involved in the creation of what he termed fringe adult content.
Image copyright Patreon Image caption Patreon says more than 50,000 creators use its platform to earn money As a result, the San Francisco-based firm's community guidelines were amended to state: "You can't use Patreon to raise funds in order to produce pornographic material such as maintaining a website, funding the production of movies, or providing a private webcam session."
Prior to this the wording was less detailed, stating instead that "Patreon is not for pornography, but some of the world's most beautiful and historically significant art depicts nudity and sexual expression".
It had added that "suggestive imagery" was permitted if marked NSFW (not safe for work).
Billion dollar business Although Patreon has indicated there has not been a major policy shift, the letter references a blogger who claims there has indeed been a "substantial change after a long period of stasis".
"Porn is a multi-billion dollar industry mostly in the hands of well-heeled men," the letter adds.
"You were helping us hold it in our own hands.
We ask you to take a stand on behalf of the sex workers who use your platform, their fans, and everyone who supports freedom of expression."
One academic said that Patreon might want to avoid the risk of being associated with "exploitation" but that censorship carried its own risks.
"There's a lot of amateur work on Patreon that blurs the line, including people who draw erotic images that are likely to be affected by this," commented Dr Bernie Hogan from the University of Oxford's Internet Institute.
"And for some people, the notion that there is a strong distinction between porn that is bad and other expression that is good is not as tenable as it used to be.
"But it makes sense that [Patreon] would try to get more conservative as it tries to scale up.
And I imagine there has been a particular use case... that has been trouble for it."
Image copyright Amazon Image caption The Amazon Key service uses the Cloud Cam camera Amazon is launching a service that will let couriers open people's front doors and put deliveries inside.
Users of Amazon Key will need a smart lock and Cloud Cam camera.
Couriers will scan a package barcode and once the delivery has been verified online, the camera will start recording and the delivery person will be able to unlock the door using an app.
One analyst said consumers would have to be convinced the system was secure if they were to use it.
Users will be able to choose to watch the delivery live or receive a short video after the drop-off.
Compatible smart locks include models made by Yale and Kwikset.
The system can also be used to give access to dog walkers, cleaners or visiting guests.
The online shopping giant has long sought ways of improving delivery convenience for customers - including a trial with Audi in 2015 in which packages were deposited in car boots.
'Unstoppable' "Amazon seems to be on an unstoppable mission to own every aspect of the home," said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood.
Mr Wood said he used a video doorbell and smart lock to give couriers access to his garage.
He said asking customers to make their front doors accessible might be more difficult.
"My understanding is there's an awful lot of work being done to make connected locks secure," he said, in order to address security concerns.
"But it would only take a few incidents to stop this dead in the water - people wouldn't want to have something on their front door if they felt it wasn't secure."
Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon Key works with a range of smart locks Last month, Amazon rival Nest launched new smart home products, including an internet-connected intruder alarm and a video-streaming doorbell that could be paired with a Yale smart lock.
This too allows doors to be unlocked remotely, giving access to friends or couriers.
Amazon Key will initially be available in 37 US cities where the firm's own courier, Amazon Logistics, will handle deliveries.
"These individuals are thoroughly vetted, with comprehensive background checks and motor vehicle records reviews," Amazon says.
Users with home security systems will need to disarm them on delivery day in order to allow couriers access.
Amazon also recommends not using in-home delivery if a pet can reach the front door.
The Amazon-made Cloud Cam camera costs $120 (90) and a bundle with a smart lock and free installation will be available for $249.99.
Image copyright PA Image caption Two images uploaded in June should have been identified as ads Two Snapchat posts by the reality TV star Marnie Simpson have fallen foul of the UK's advertising rules.
The Geordie Shore and Celebrity Big Brother cast member uploaded images of products from two firms that she has business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts.
This was judged to be a breach of the rules against "hidden" advertising on social media.
It is the first case of its kind to have involved Snapchat.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) normally deals with such matters by ordering offending posts to be deleted or amended.
But since Snapchat Story posts automatically self-delete 24 hours after being added, Ms Simpson has not been ordered to take any action.
The two companies involved, however, have agreed to ensure the hashtag #ad appears alongside adverts they produce in the future.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ASA chief Guy Parker: 'Rules apply equally to Snapchat' Ms Simpson could not be reached for comment.
The 25-year-old has been a "brand ambassador" for tooth polish-maker Diamond Whites for nearly two years, while her management agency, Unleashed PR, began selling a range of coloured cosmetic contact lenses marketed as being "iSpyEyes by Marnie Simpson" earlier this year.
On 20 June, Ms Simpson uploaded two images.
The first showed her posing with a Diamond Whites case with the text "50% of [sic] everything" superimposed, and a link to the company's site.
The second featured the celebrity wearing a grey lens on one of her eyes, with the words "mrs grey coming soon" placed alongside her.
In both cases an unidentified individual contacted the ASA to complain the images had not been identified as ads.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Marnie Simpson was a Miss Newcastle finalist before joining MTV's Geordie Shore Diamond Whites tried to defend the promotion featuring its product on the grounds that Ms Simpson's followers would already be aware of her commercial relationship with the firm.
But the watchdog did not accept that this would be known by everyone who saw the image.
Unleashed PR suggested that in its case the wording featured was so vague that consumers would not know what product was being advertised or where to buy it.
But the ASA said its code still required marketing promotions to be flagged as such.
"These might be our first Snapchat rulings, but the principle behind them is as old as the hills - ads, wherever they appear, must be obviously identifiable as ads," the authority's chief executive Guy Parker told the BBC.
"It's just not fair to expect people to play the detective, to work out the status of a tweet, post or story."
Other recent cases where the advertising watchdog has intervened: a post by the make-up blogger Sheikhbeauty on Instagram promoting Flat Tummy Tea that did not make clear she was being paid by the drinks company a tweet by the TV presenter AJ Odudu that featured a photo of an Alpro dessert with text describing it as one of her favourite snacks, but without any acknowledgement that she was being paid to promote it on social media a video uploaded by Made In Chelsea TV star Millie Mackintosh advertising a Britvic drink that used #sp - referring to "sponsored post" - to identify its nature.
The ASA said it did not think consumers would realise what the hashtag referred to The ASA does not have the power to impose fines itself, but can refer repeat offenders - whether they are brands or the celebrities endorsing them - to Trading Standards to take further action.
However, it hopes that the negative publicity that arises from its interventions acts as deterrent enough.
Even so, the ASA acknowledged earlier this month that an increasing amount of its time was being taken up policing "influencer marketing".
And it urged marketers to put monitoring systems in place so that they themselves could spot and fix instances where celebrities had failed to use the #ad label.
How lucrative is it to be a social media influencer?
Image copyright Getty Images Marketers tend to be secretive about how much they pay specific influencers to promote their clients.
But PMYB - a Nottingham-based agency that works with more than 10,000 influencers - told the BBC that campaigns could range from 5,000 to hundreds of thousands of pounds.
It said that personalities that could deliver a YouTube audience had traditionally been able to charge the most - in part because people are likely to spend longer watching a video than reading a tweet - but Instagram fashionistas were also among the top earners.
Managing director Rohan Midha added that the agency had been involved in a "surprisingly low number" of campaigns on Snapchat to date, and that when it was used it was typically in addition to other social networks.
Although TV stars might seem an obvious pick, they can often be very expensive to employ because their agents inflate their prices.
San Francisco-based Captiv8 - which has developed software to match brands with relevant ambassadors - suggests "micro-influencers" often have more impact.
In other words, a financial tech specialist with tens of thousands of followers might be more valuable to a bank than a generalist with hundreds of thousands.
Even so, reach still plays a role in calculating an influencer's worth.
Last year, Captiv8 estimated that personalities with more than seven million followers could charge on average:
Image copyright Apple Image caption Jay Hunt will begin work at Apple at the start of 2018 Apple has hired Jay Hunt - the former controller of BBC One and chief creative officer of Channel Four - to join its video team.
Ms Hunt was responsible for TV shows including Sherlock and Luther at the BBC before helping Channel 4 sign up the Great British Bake Off.
Her title at Apple will be creative director, Europe, worldwide video.
Apple has not specified what it involves, but she is expected to commission programmes on its behalf.
Until now, Apple's own programming has served as an adjunct to its Music subscription service and included Planet of the Apps - a business reality TV competition - and Carpool Karaoke - a spin-off from James Corden's Late Late Show.
However, the US firm has committed $1bn (754m) to acquire and produce further content over the coming months, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
Image copyright Love Productions/Channel 4 Image caption Ms Hunt helped Channel 4 take Bake Off from the BBC Earlier in the year, Apple revealed it had hired two Sony Pictures TV executives.
Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg had overseen Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and Rescue Me among other US shows.
These developments have fuelled speculation that the company is preparing to launch a video subscription service to rival Netflix and Amazon Video, with original content, after failing to convince the US networks to let it sell bundles of their programming.
"It seems like Apple is going for a worldwide push already, even though it hasn't yet made much headway in the US," said Tom Harrington, an analyst at research firm Enders Analysis.
"Jay Hunt is exceptional in the commissioning space.
She's exceptional at finding programmes that fit the outlet she's working at.
"She could have worked anywhere she wanted."
Apple is not the only US tech giant investing in the TV industry.
Facebook launched its Watch service in the US in August, offering cookery, fitness and travel-themed programmes among other content.
Twitter is developing news programming in conjunction with Bloomberg and Buzzfeed, and has also acquired streaming rights to several sports events.
Google continues to invest in its YouTube Red service, which produces ad-free films and shows for subscribers.
Analysis Image caption Sherlock was one of Ms Hunt's most successful commissions at the BBC By Amol Rajan, media editor When Jay Hunt missed out on the job of chief executive at Channel 4, where as chief creative officer she had overseen a series of big hits and bought Great British Bake Off from the BBC, everyone in the industry asked the same question.
What jobs in British TV might she actually now want?
Answer: not many.
As television is reinvented - from linear, scheduled programmes watched by families around a single television set, to on-demand shows watched largely on mobile phones and tablets, or sometimes through multiple screens - it is the big American technology companies that are driving innovation.
Last week, Netflix showed impressive quarterly growth in subscribers.
Many senior figures in the industry say Amazon is changing the rules of the game, by offering massive budgets for drama and documentaries.
And there is talk aplenty about social media giants buying up live sports rights.
In hiring Ms Hunt, Apple has reinforced the message that it is taking television and original content very seriously.
At her leaving party in Channel 4's London headquarters recently, the universal feeling was that it would be to one of these big technology companies that she moved.
That has now come to pass.
Jay Hunt poached Bake Off from the BBC in a move that was met with widespread scepticism, and plenty of derision.
Yet with six million viewers per episode, its switch has been a success.
What show might she poach from another broadcaster next - perhaps even her former employers?
Given Apple's market capitalisation of more than $800bn (603bn), I suspect money won't be an issue.
Ms Hunt is going to enjoy her new budget.

Mr Musk's firm, Tesla, has set up solar panels and energy storage batteries at Hospital del Nino, a children's hospital in San Juan.
The batteries will provide energy from the panels when sunlight is scarce.
Tesla said on Twitter this was the "first of many" such projects going live.
Mr Musk has also donated $250,000 (190,000) of his own money to support humanitarian efforts in Puerto Rico, where many people are still without electricity.
Earlier this month, Tesla's co-founder offered - via Twitter - to help rebuild energy infrastructure.
The US territory's governor, Ricardo Rossello, responded: "Let's talk."
Mr Rossello has since thanked Tesla for its work at the hospital - also on Twitter (in Spanish).
Contract controversy A $300m contract to repair the power grid was recently awarded to a small, two-year-old US firm with just two employees.
Following criticism from US lawmakers, Mr Rossello defended the deal this week.
He said the company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, was the only one that met Puerto Rico's requirements at a low enough cost.
Tesla is known for its electric cars, such as the Model S, but the company is expanding into the renewable energy sector.
It is installing a 100 megawatt set of its Powerpack batteries in Australia - the largest lithium ion battery storage project in the world.
And last week, it won a $160m contract with wind turbine maker Vestas to place batteries at a new wind farm, also in Australia.
The wind farm will feature solar panels as well as wind turbines and has been designed to provide power for more than 35,000 homes.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Two other ransomware outbreaks have made headlines this year - WannaCry and Petya A new strain of ransomware nicknamed "Bad Rabbit" has been found spreading in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere.
The malware has affected systems at three Russian websites, an airport in Ukraine and an underground railway in the capital city, Kiev.
The cyber-police chief in Ukraine confirmed to the Reuters news agency that Bad Rabbit was the ransomware in question.
It bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks earlier this year.
However, it is not yet known how far this new malware will be able to spread.
"In some of the companies, the work has been completely paralysed - servers and workstations are encrypted," head of Russian cyber-security firm Group-IB, Ilya Sachkov, told the TASS news agency.
Two of the affected sites are Interfax and Fontanka.ru.
Meanwhile, US officials said they had "received multiple reports of Bad Rabbit ransomware infections in many countries around the world".
The US computer emergency readiness team said it "discourages individuals and organisations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored".
Who was affected?
By Ksenia Idrisova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina, BBC Monitoring Initial news reports mentioned Russian media websites, such as St Petersburg-based Fontanka.ru, as well as an airport in Ukraine's Odessa and a subway system in Kiev.
Privately-owned Russian news agency Interfax was hit particularly hard, to the extent that 24 hours later its website still displayed a message reading "our service is temporary unavailable".
On the morning of 25 October, it transpired that Russian banks had also been targeted but, luckily, were not compromised.
The Russian Central Bank said in a statement that it had recorded a BadRabbit attack on Russian financial institutions, but that none of them had been compromised, as reported by RNS news agency on 25 October.
Otkrytiye, formerly Russia's biggest privately-owned bank, was one of the Russian financial institutions that repelled the attack, according to RNS.
Prominent Russian IT security firm Group-IB reported that BadRabbit had targeted several of the top 20 Russian banks but failed to penetrate their networks.
Russia hit most "According to our data, most of the victims targeted by these attacks are located in Russia," said Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky at Kaspersky Lab.
"We have also seen similar but fewer attacks in Ukraine, Turkey and Germany."
Bad Rabbit encrypts the contents of a computer and asks for a payment - in this case 0.05 bitcoins, or about $280 (213).
Cyber-security firms, including Russia-based Kaspersky, have said they are monitoring the attack.

The malware is still undetected by the majority of anti-virus programs, according to analysis by virus checking site Virus Total.
One security firm, Eset, has said that the malware was distributed via a bogus Adobe Flash update.
Researcher Kevin Beaumont has posted a screenshot that shows Bad Rabbit creating tasks in Windows named after the dragons Drogon and Rhaegal in TV series Game of Thrones.
The outbreak bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks that spread around the world causing widespread disruption earlier this year.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A QR code leading to $1,000 sounded like an easy way to make money - but a French TV channel had blurred it out Two French hackers used their computer skills to reconstruct a blurred-out code on TV and claim bitcoins worth $1,000 (760).
Michel Sassano and Clement Storck had seen an interview with entrepreneur Roger Ver on French television.
Mr Ver had offered $1,000 to viewers - but a QR code needed to claim the money had been blurred out.
The duo analysed a small part of the code that was visible, however, and managed to access the funds.
When the France 2 channel broadcast its interview with Mr Ver earlier this month, he promised the money - just over three Bitcoin Cash coins, worth $1,000 - to whichever viewer was quickest to scan an on-screen QR code.
However, the code had been blurred out by France 2 - Mr Sassano believes this is because of French broadcasting regulations that prevent news programmes from giving away prizes.
"The process to decode the private key from the moment we watched the show to when we entered it in the wallet took, I think, between 12 and 16 hours," Mr Sassano told the BBC.
He and Mr Storck have explained the process in detail in a blog.
Their fortune depended on a moment towards the end of the TV segment when a small portion of the QR code was actually shown unblurred.
Image copyright Roger Ver Image caption Entrepreneur Roger Ver didn't think the money would ever be claimed after the code was blurred out - but he was wrong The keen-eyed pair also noticed that the top of the QR code and part of the key written in letters and numbers were also not blurred sufficiently, making them readable with software.
They were able to plot what they knew for sure about the code's structure - amounting to roughly a third of it - in a spreadsheet.
From there, the duo worked out as much as they could about the missing portions, based on their knowledge of how QR codes are designed.
Finally, they calculated that there were about 2.1 million possible final combinations.
"We got down to two valid keys that would match bitcoin private keys," says Mr Sassano.
One of these proved to be the answer they were looking for.
They transferred the money on 17 October - an online bitcoin wallet shows the transaction.
"The money is the cherry on the cake but the most exciting was when we found the private key and the algorithm told us this was the one," says Mr Sassano, adding that he has not yet withdrawn the money.
Image copyright Michel Sassano and Clement Storck Image caption The reconstruction process involved some detailed detective work Roger Ver described the work as "amazing".
"With almost no information at all they were able to reconstruct the private key and claim the funds," he says.
"If you have time to read the blog it's absolutely incredible."
He also reveals that he has been "inundated" with messages from viewers who watched the programme and wanted to know if he kept a copy of the QR code - but he had not.
"I deleted it," he explains.
"Now I have something to tell the French people [who contacted me] - somebody did manage to claim it."
The BBC has contacted France 2 for comment.
Image copyright House of Commons Image caption Jared O'Mara made degrading jokes about pop stars Jared O'Mara is not the first person to have old comments he posted online come back to haunt him.
The Labour MP resigned from the Women and Equalities Committee after misogynistic remarks and degrading jokes he posted more than 10 years ago resurfaced.
The scandal raises the question: what steps can you take to avoid old online posts - that may no longer reflect your point of view - coming back to haunt you?
But first a warning!
Trying to hide your online history could draw more attention to it, than just leaving it alone - and an attempted cover-up could be a bigger scandal than the original posts.
Search for yourself A good place to start is typing your name into a search engine and seeing what comes back.
You may need to do a deep dive, several pages into the results to find old material you had forgotten was online.
The easiest way to remove embarrassing posts from the past is to log in to the website you posted them on, and delete them at the source if possible.
Revisit old haunts Check old message boards you used to frequent to make sure you did not leave any regrettable posts online.
Your username may not have been your real name, but people may still associate it with you.
Message boards often let you search for all the posts made by your account, allowing you to remove or edit anything you no longer want online.
You could also run a web search on your old message board usernames to check you have not missed anything.
Delete old social accounts Remember Myspace?
Former Faceparty fan?
Gone from Gaydar?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What lurks on your Myspace account?
The three networks - and several others - suffered a great exodus when newer social websites arrived.
But did you deactivate your old account, or leave it to fester unattended?
Old social network profiles can be a treasure trove of embarrassing photos and regrettable stories.
It might be time to log in and erase any profiles you no longer use.
Change your name Many comments sections on news websites are powered by bigger social networks such as Facebook and Disqus.
If you had used your real name on these sites, you could change your name and photo on the associated accounts so that old embarrassing posts are instead attributed to a pseudonym.
However, this does breach the terms and conditions of some social networks.
Exercise your "right to be forgotten" EU citizens can ask search engines to remove results connected to their name, if they are judged to be irrelevant or outdated.
This means news stories, old social media posts and blogs can be hidden from search results, making them less likely to resurface.
Controversially, the right to be forgotten has been used by criminals and people involved in public scandals to hide news reports featuring their name, on the grounds that they are "outdated".
Critics say people are able to censor search results in this way.
But the EU ruling stands, and so Google, Bing and other search engines let citizens request the removal of certain results.
As the ruling only applies to the EU, the "hidden" results may still appear for people using the search engine outside the EU.
Wait for new laws in May The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will give people more control over the data they have shared online.
Under the new rules, people will have the right to order websites and social networks to delete embarrassing old posts.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption New laws will give greater control to citizens However, in some cases the websites will be allowed to reject the requests - for example, if a post was of scientific or historical importance.
Despite Brexit, the UK is adopting the GDPR in its own Data Protection Bill.
It will come into force in May 2018.
Demand deletion Some social networks make it difficult for you to permanently delete your account, encouraging you to temporarily deactivate it instead.
Facebook does provide a page where you can request a permanent account deletion, while Twitter's standard deactivation procedure deletes an account after 30 days.
Deleting an account on Facebook and Twitter makes public posts disappear - but copies may still appear in search engine results.
Protect your accounts Often the material shared in private messages is more sensitive than what we post publicly.
It is always a good idea to protect online accounts with a strong, unique password.
Image copyright Getty Images If a website offers it, enable two-factor or two-step verification, which makes it harder for anybody to get into your account without permission, because they need both your password and your mobile phone.
One final word of advice...
Nothing you share on the internet is truly private, and once something is out there on the worldwide web, it can be very difficult to cover it up again.
Several sites scrape social networks such as Twitter and Facebook and archive the posts they find - while the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine does a similar thing for websites including message boards and blogs.
So to be safe, try not to post embarrassing content online in the first place.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The London clinic says it is still determining what data was stolen A high-profile plastic surgery clinic has said it is "horrified" after hackers allegedly stole data during a cyber-attack.
London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS) said its IT experts and police found evidence of the breach.
A group claiming to be behind the breach said it had "terabytes" of data, the Daily Beast news site reported.
The Metropolitan Police is investigating the attack.
The alleged hackers, using the pseudonym The Dark Overlord, said they had obtained photos showing various body parts of clients, including genitals.
Some of these images have been sent to the Daily Beast.
The hackers also claimed that the data contained information on "royal families" and added that they planned to distribute the patient list and corresponding photos online.
"We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised," LBPS said in a statement.
"We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the clinic's recent clients is model and TV presenter Katie Price A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said it was notified of a suspected breach on 17 October.
She added that there had been no arrests and that enquiries by the Organised Crime Command were continuing.
LBPS is known to have high-profile clients, including model and TV presenter Katie Price, who recently used her Instagram account to thank the clinic for her facelift.
The Information Commissioner's Office said, "We are aware of this incident and are looking into the details.
"All organisations are required under data protection law to keep people's personal data safe and secure."
The Dark Overlord has claimed to be behind high-profile data breaches before, including one at US media firm Netflix earlier this year.
In April, 10 episodes of the new series of TV show Orange is the New Black were released online after Netflix refused to pay a ransom.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Vladimir Putin has denied that Russia interfered in the US elections last year - but questions continue to be raised about alleged meddling in other democratic processes British MPs have asked Facebook if it has evidence of paid-for activity by accounts linked to Russia at the time of the Brexit referendum.
A letter addressed to Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also asks about similar activity at the time of this year's general election.
It was written by Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital, Media and Sport Committee.
Facebook said it would respond to the request once it had been reviewed.
"Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations," wrote Mr Collins.
He said he wanted to know whether Facebook could provide: examples of adverts bought, and pages set up by Russia-linked accounts information on how these ads and pages were targeted how much money was paid to promote these ads or pages how many times they were viewed "We have received a letter from the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee and will respond once we have had the opportunity to review the request," a spokeswoman for Facebook said.
The committee's inquiry - which was put on hold during the general election earlier this year - aims to explore the impact of fake news.
The closing date for submitting evidence is 7 November.
Russia has consistently denied interfering in the democratic processes of other countries.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The massive data breach affects nearly 700,000 UK customers Credit rating firm Equifax is being investigated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over a large data loss.
The FCA released a short statement announcing the investigation but did not provide further details.
Equifax said it welcomed the opportunity to "learn the lessons from this criminal cyber-attack".
Earlier this month, the firm admitted that more UK customers had been hit by a cybersecurity incident between mid-May and the end of July this year.
It originally believed that fewer than 400,000 British people were affected, but it has now put the figure at 694,000.
An estimated 143 million US customers also had their data compromised.
Equifax has said that those affected may be at risk of "possible criminal activity".
This may include identity theft and targeted scams.
"The FCA announces today that it is investigating the circumstances surrounding a cybersecurity incident that led to the loss of UK customer data held by Equifax Ltd on the servers of its US parent," the regulator said in a statement.
"This statement is made given the public interest in these matters."
Equifax said: "We welcome this opportunity to learn the lessons from this criminal cyber-attack in order for all businesses to better protect consumers in the future."
Four groups of UK customers have so far been detailed by the firm: 637,000 whose phone numbers were stolen 29,000 whose driving licence numbers were stolen 15,000 who had some of their Equifax membership details, such as usernames and passwords, stolen and 12,000 whose email addresses were stolen UK customers have been advised to phone Equifax for advice on 0800 587 1584.

Victoria, from Leeds, was told to "go kill yourself" on the Live.me streaming app and her home address was shared on Twitter as a "house to burgle".
Figures obtained by BBC Yorkshire show reports of malicious communication have almost doubled to more than 200 a day.
There were 79,372 offences recorded in 2016, up from 42,910 the year before.
Police forces in England and Wales were asked to provide the data, with 38 out of 43 responding.
'Tip of the iceberg' Image copyright Getty Images Image caption West Yorkshire Police said investigations into Victoria's case were ongoing Victoria, 18, had open profiles on Live.me, Twitter and Instagram, where she had thousands of followers.
She said she was sent pornographic images that featured her face and had photographs of her house shared online, while another message to her simply said "die".
"I'm on anxiety tablets now.
It's knocked my confidence.
I don't even go out of the house that much," she said.
"There's still that thought in the back of my mind, where you never know if they are going to be there while you are out.
"At the end of the day, this has legit just ruined my life.
I used to be an outgoing person.
I'm just trying to get back to my old self."
What is Live.Me?
Fast growing Live video streaming application Has approximately 20 million users to date Users have no control over who shares their videos Likes and electronic gifts raise a users online ranking In August 2017 a man was convicted after forcing a nine-year-old child to expose herself in a video that has been viewed more than 200 times.
Victoria went to the police about the malicious communication - defined as sending a letter or electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety - but no arrests were made.
She said: "Sometimes I feel like it's my fault.
But it's easier for people to get targeted because they're putting themselves out there on the internet, which I thought was just fun, to make new friends.
"I never thought it would turn out like this."
Supt Mat Davison said West Yorkshire Police was investigating Victoria's case and new lines of inquiry would be acted on.
"Officers have been in regular contact with the victim and members of her family and provided them with updates on the progress of the investigation," he added.
The Times recently reported nine people are arrested each day for posting offensive material online, sparking criticism from human rights groups about "over-policing" of the internet.
However, Essex Police Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said the rise in malicious communication was "the tip of the iceberg".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twitter plans to impose new restrictions on pornographic and hateful imagery to tackle abuse The chairman of the Digital Policing Board, which deals with digital crime nationally, said social network providers should do more to protect online users.
"I think as policing and society changes in to the digital age this is only going to increase," Mr Kavanagh said.
"Providers, government, law enforcers and users all need to get ready how we protect people more effectively, and how we bring criminals to justice."
Dr Michelle Newberry, senior lecturer in forensic psychology at Sheffield Hallam University, said there was a correlation between how much we use social media and the increase in trolling.
She said: "It is very unusual for people not to have their phone with them.
We just have that instant access these days."
Twitter previously said it planned to impose new restrictions on pornographic and hateful imagery to tackle abuse.
A spokesperson for Live.me said: "Our goal at Live.me is to create a safe and friendly environment for all of our users which is why it's always heartbreaking to hear stories of users being harassed or bullied.
"We have strict protocols for our moderators to address any community violations, and our automatic software detection and human moderators are on call 24-hours a day, seven days a week, working to combat cyber-bullying, indecent behaviour, or threats of self-harm."

Image copyright AFP Image caption Christopher Wray said more than half of the devices the FBI had tried to access in 11 months had been impenetrable Agents at the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been unable to extract data from nearly 7,000 mobile devices they have tried to access, the agency's director has said.
Christopher Wray said encryption on devices was "a huge, huge problem" for FBI investigations.
The agency had failed to access more than half of the devices it targeted in an 11-month period, he said.
One cyber-security expert said such encryption was now a "fact of life".
Many smartphones encrypt their contents when locked, as standard - a security feature that often prevents even the phones' manufacturers from accessing data.
Such encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, which prevents interception of communications on a large scale.
Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey said device encryption was clearly frustrating criminal investigations but it would be impractical and insecure to develop "back doors" or weakened security.
Trade-off "Encryption that frustrates forensic investigations will be a fact of life from now on for law enforcement agencies," he said.
"Even if the equipment manufacturers didn't build in such encryption it would be possible to obtain software that encrypted data in the same way."
Referring to the trade-off between cyber-security and investigative hacking, the FBI director said: "I get it, there's a balance that needs to be struck between encryption and the importance of giving us the tools we need to keep the public safe."
Mr Wray was speaking at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Philadelphia on Sunday.
In 2016, the FBI asked Apple to unlock an iPhone used by San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook.
Apple refused, explaining that its phones had been designed so that even their manufacturer could not access them once encrypted.
The FBI later said a third party firm had discovered a way of breaking into Farook's device.
Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that the FBI did not have to reveal the identity of the firm or how much the agency paid for its services.
The ruling followed freedom of information requests filed by journalists.
Image copyright Doppel Image caption Doppel is one of the start-ups that will have space at the UK's pavilion The chief of the CES tech expo has revealed that the UK government is helping fund a selection of start-ups to attend its next event in January.
The funding of a "pavilion" within the show's Eureka Park start-up zone represents a strategy shift for the UK.
Gary Shapiro had previously said it was "a source of embarrassment" that small UK companies had not received such support at the 2017 show.
Ministers had insisted that UK firms still had a "significant" presence.
TechUK - an industry group that has partnered with the government to run the stands - acknowledged that Mr Shapiro's intervention had made a difference.
"It definitely helped," Paul Hide, TechUK's director of market engagement, told the BBC.
"We've been pushing the DIT [Department for International Trade] for some time to give us additional support.
"It gives us a stronger identity by having a hub of a number of UK companies and allows us to promote a central location."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Shapiro has welcomed the UK's decision to fund a start-up area More than 4,000 exhibitors and 180,000 people attended this year's CES expo.
The event attracts both the media and retail buyers from across the globe, allowing manufacturers to attract publicity and strike business deals at the week-long event.
Last time, 55 UK companies booked show floor space.
France fielded 248 companies and mainland China 1,314.
The Great Britain and Northern Ireland Pavilion will provide pods to about a dozen start-ups.
The spaces will be smaller than a separate stand, but help is being provided to design the area and attract visitors.
Mr Shapiro revealed the initiative at a CES preview event in London.
He later told the BBC that the British government and TechUK had "stepped up, [by] having a presence that they did not have last year".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption UK start-ups did not receive the support France gave to its tech firms at the last show One beneficiary is Doppel, a five-person London-based firm that has created a wrist-based device designed to make wearers feel more alert or relaxed, depending on its setting.
The company, which will pay its own travel and accommodation costs, said it expected its total bill to come to about 2,100.
"Without this support we definitely wouldn't have been able to exhibit," said Doppel's head of marketing, Georgina Orso.
"Saving thousands of pounds makes the difference between attending and not attending for a pre-revenue company like us."
TechUK said that if the initiative was a success, it hoped to host an even bigger space in 2019.
The DIT added in a statement: "We help exporters make the most of global opportunities... [including] trade missions for high value sectors like the tech sector and trade shows like CES, where we will be supporting a number of UK exhibitors next year."
Image copyright Unihertz The Chinese firm behind a palm-sized 4G smartphone has admitted that the handset's performance may fall short of expectations in certain circumstances.
Unihertz says the Jelly phone battery has up to three days of working time and lasts seven days on standby.
But chief executive Stephen Xu told the BBC that "heavy use" could reduce battery life to three or four hours.
This included keeping wi-fi and Bluetooth switched on all the time, he said.
"If you use a phone quite a lot even an iPhone can't last a day," Mr Xu said.
The Jelly battery should last about a day with "normal use", he added.
He said problems reported by some Jelly users with GPS functionality were down to a combination of hardware and software reasons.
Unihertz hoped to issue an update soon, he said.
"[With Jelly,] we are trying to find a balance between bigger phones and smaller wearables," Mr Xu said.
Stuart Miles, founder of review website Pocket Lint, said there was a market for small phones.
"As phones have got bigger and bigger there is an urge for people to just want something small to put in their pocket," he said.
"This phone is clearly trying to tap into that supposed need, but I do wonder whether a smartwatch with 3G calling would offer you the same, if not more functionality."
The Jelly phone, which Unihertz calls the world's smallest 4G phone, was developed after its maker raised more than $1.2m (0.9m) in crowdfunding.
It is available in the UK, US and in many other countries but it is not compatible with the CDMA mobile standard, which means it will not work with some mobile phone networks including Verizon and Sprint in the US.
Unihertz also decided to stop providing plugs for the device, which now comes with a USB cable only.
"We realised that due to the different standards of the charger products, it's harder for us, so we have removed the plugs," said Mr Xu.
"I think most people already have a plug."
Image copyright Alamy Image caption Netflix's Stranger Things has been one of the company's big hits Netflix is raising another $1.6bn (1.2bn) from investors to finance new shows and possibly make acquisitions.
The video streaming service plans to spend up to $8bn on content next year to compete with fast-growing rivals.
Netflix will issue bonds to investors, although the interest rate it will pay has yet to be decided, the company said in a statement.
Netflix plans to release 80 films next year, but some analysts are wary about its cash burn and debt interest costs.
The company's latest debt fundraising is its largest so far, and the fourth time in three years it has raised more than $1bn by issuing bonds.
Earlier this month, Netflix said it would raise prices in countries including the UK and US for the first time in two years.
The price rises come as Netflix faces growing competition from Amazon and other sites such as Hulu and Disney in the US.
Netflix has spent heavily on original programming such as The Crown, Stranger Things and House of Cards.
One movie, Mudbound, was described by Variety as "an epic about race and poverty in the 1940s Mississippi Delta", and stars Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan.
Some critics say it is a contender for the Academy Awards and would be the first Netflix feature to be in the Oscars race.
Netflix's share price has risen more than 50% this year on the back of subscriber growth that has beat expectations.
The company now has more than 109 million subscribers globally, adding 15.5 million so far this year.
The move to take on more corporate debt comes amid expectations that borrowing costs may increase in coming months.
The US Federal Reserve is weighing another rate hike by the end of 2017.

The bids come after the e-commerce giant said it was looking to build a "second headquarters" in North America, where it would invest $5bn (3.8bn) and hire as many as 50,000 people.
The locations are vying on factors such as workforce talent, tax breaks, and proximity to an international airport.
Amazon said it will decide on a location next year.
Amazon has seen major growth.
The firm had nearly $136bn in sales last year and employs about 380,000 people globally - adding about 39,000 since the start of 2017 alone.
Politicians are eager to attract the economic engine to their home towns.
The proposals come from all but seven US states, most southern provinces in Canada and three states in Mexico, as well as Washington DC and the territory of Puerto Rico, according to a map published by the company.
The places competing include sites in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Newark and Toronto.
Image copyright Alphabet Image caption The balloons carry telecommunications equipment that allows them to form an airborne network Mobile phone data services have been boosted in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico by balloons provided by Google's parent company, Alphabet.
The Project Loon devices beam signals between each other and to users on the ground.
This extends communications networks in places where infrastructure is scarce or has been damaged.
The balloons will allow residents with LTE phones to send and receive text messages and access the web.
However, much of the country is still without electricity, and more than a quarter of the population lacks safe drinking water.
"This is the first time we have used our new machine learning-powered algorithms to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we're still learning how best to do this," said head of Project Loon Alastair Westgarth.
"As we get more familiar with the constantly shifting winds in this region, we hope to keep the balloons over areas where connectivity is needed for as long as possible."
Alphabet launched the balloons in collaboration with the government of Puerto Rico, the US Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency and telecoms firm AT&T.
Earlier this year, Alphabet sent its balloons to Peru following serious floods.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The post that caused the alert has now been deleted Israeli police arrested a Palestinian man last week after a Facebook post he made saying "good morning" in Arabic was mistranslated to read "attack them" in Hebrew, local media have reported.
Police confirmed that the construction worker was briefly held under suspicion of incitement but was released as soon as the mistake was realised.
The post showed a photo of the worker next to a bulldozer in the West Bank.
Such vehicles have been used to attack Israelis in the past.
There is only one difference in lettering between the colloquial Arabic phrase for "good morning to you all" and "hurt them", pointed out The Times of Israel.
No Arabic-speaking officer was consulted before the arrest was carried out, say reports, with officers wholly dependent on Facebook's automatic translation.
The post in question has now been deleted.
There were red faces at Google last year, when its online translation tool rendered the Russian Federation as "Mordor".
Mordor is the name of a fictional region in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.
In addition, "Russians" was translated to "occupiers".
Google said at the time that Translate worked by looking for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents - but translation remained difficult as the meaning of words was tied to the context in which they were used.
Image copyright Getty Images Online gambling companies have been urged to remove adverts featuring images likely to appeal to children.
Regulators said the "unacceptable" ads and third-party media, which contain graphics and images that are likely to be attractive to minors, should be "immediately" removed or amended.
They said this particularly applied to adverts for free and pay-to-play games.
In a joint letter, the regulators said under-18s and other vulnerable people should be protected from exploitation.
The Gambling Commission, the Advertising Standards Authority, the Committee of Advertising Practice, and the Remote Gambling Association said companies needed to advertise responsibly.
Under the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) code, gambling activities must not be advertised in a way that could appeal to the under-18s.
Peter Pan "The use of particular colours, cartoon and comic book images, animals, child- and youth-orientated references and names of games such as 'Piggy Payout', 'Fluffy Favourites', 'Pirate Princess' and 'Jack and the Beanstalk' are likely, alone or in combination, to enhance appeal to under 18s," the letter sent to more than 450 online gambling operators says.
The letter warned that those who failed to adhere to Advertising Standards Authority guidelines could face sanctions.
It follows an investigation by the Sunday Times that found gambling sites were using cartoons and characters including Peter Pan and Jack and the Beanstalk.
The paper said the letter was sent to more than 450 online gambling operators.
Tim Miller, executive director at the Gambling Commission, said new technology brought "opportunities but also new risks".
In a letter to the Sunday Times he said: "Our rules require strong age-verification checks to prevent underage gambling.
Where businesses fail to protect vulnerable people, especially children, we have and will continue to take firm action."
Image copyright AFP Image caption IS militants have used social media to spread propaganda Tech giants Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and Google have agreed to do more to remove extremist content within hours of it being posted.
The accord was decided at a two-day meeting between the G7 nations and the tech firms, hosted on the Italian island of Ischia.
The aim, according to officials, is to remove jihadist content from the internet within two hours.
In a tweet, Twitter said the talks had been "important and productive".
Twitter and Google declined to give further comment.
Italy's interior minister Marco Minniti said they were "important first steps".
In a statement issued after the meeting, the G7 said: "We underscore the challenge to industry and we urge it... to develop solutions to identify and remove terrorist content within one to two hours of upload, to the extent it is technically feasible, without compromising human rights and fundamental freedoms."
It also urged the companies to develop better detection tools and to ensure all removed material is reported to authorities.
In September, UK prime minister Theresa May said technology companies must go "further and faster" in removing extremist content.
She said then that she wanted such content removed within two hours.
MI5 head Andrew Parker said that allowing extremists "safe spaces online" made threats harder to detect.
It is the first time that representatives from Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter have taken part in G7 talks.
The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.
Image copyright Vichai Image caption Generating crypto-currencies involves lots of computer hardware The booming price of Bitcoin and other crypto-coins has kicked off a gold rush among malicious hackers keen to cash in, warn security firms.
Many sites are now harbouring code that secretly uses a visitors' computer to mine the valuable e-cash coins.
The code is inserted by hackers who exploit poor site security or web software bugs.
The problem has led Google engineers to consider putting protections against mining in the Chrome browser.
Freshly minted Earlier this month, hundreds of websites were found to be running code created by the Coin-Hive project.
This let the web domains generate coins for the Monero crypto-currency by using the processing power of visitors' computers.
While some sites had put the Coin-Hive code on their site themselves, many others had been hacked to host the short script.
Bitcoin, and almost every other crypto-coin, works by using lots of different computers to log and verify who has done what with the electronic coins.
In return for carrying out these computational tasks, called mining, users are regularly rewarded with new coins.
Palo Alto Networks said it had found Coin-Hive on almost 150 separate domains.
The most popular locations for the code were porn, video and file-sharing sites.
"The use of Coin-Hive or similar mining services is itself not a malicious activity," said Yuchen Zhou and colleagues at security company Palo Alto.
"It is how they are used that makes the sites malicious."
The wide uptake of Coin-Hive and the surging price of Bitcoin, now worth about $5,630 (4,288) per coin, has led to the creation of many "copycat" coin-mining systems.
Security news website Bleeping Computer has now found 10 separate "clones" of Coin-Hive that mine different types of coins for their creators.
"Most are behaving like malware, intruding on users' computers and using resources without permission," wrote Catalin Cimpanu on the Bleeping Computer site.
On portable devices, the code can drain batteries very quickly.
Some of the copycat coin-mining programs specifically target popular website creation and admin systems such as WordPress.
Others, said Mr Cimpanu, are written in Javascript and their creators try to insert them wherever they can.
Many anti-virus firms have updated their software so they now spot and disable mining software.
Also, Coin-Hive has now launched an authorised version of its software which only mines coins if users give their explicit permission.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Many people are looking to cash in on Bitcoin's growing value The growing number of coin miners kicked off a discussion among Google engineers working on the firm's Chrome browser about how to tackle it.
"Yes, we should do something about it," wrote Ojan Vafai, a Chrome engineer on the forums where browser changes are debated.
Mr Vafai suggested getting the browser to watch for situations when mining software grabs lots of processing power from a computer or portable device.
If the browser spots this activity it would "aggressively throttle" browser activity to limit how much number-crunching power can be grabbed.
Users would also be warned about what was happening.
The change would let users see when their browser was being used for mining and let them choose if it continued.
Blocking the activity any other way would be difficult, he said.
"I'm effectively suggesting we add a permission here, but it would have unusual triggering conditions," he wrote.
"It only triggers when the page is doing a likely bad thing."
Image caption Brian Thompson had previously said he wanted to know whether he was doing anything illegal A trader who sold TV boxes which allowed viewers to watch subscription films and football for free has been given a suspended jail term.
Brian Thompson had denied breaking the law by selling the Kodi boxes, setting up the prospect of a landmark trial.
But appearing at Teesside Crown Court he changed his plea to guilty.
The 55-year-old, who runs Cut Price Tomo's TV store in Middlesbrough, was given an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.
Thompson, of Barnaby Avenue, Middlesbrough, admitted one count of selling and one count of advertising devices "designed, produced or adapted for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of effective technological measures".
The court heard Thompson had been selling "fully loaded" Kodi boxes - ones that had been installed with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content.
He had previously claimed the law was a "grey area" and said he wanted to know whether he was "doing anything illegal".
'No doubt' Thompson had sold an estimated 400 boxes, earning him about 40,000, and losses to Sky were an estimated 200,000 in subscriptions, the court heard.
Judge Peter Armstrong said there could be no doubt now about the legality of the fully loaded boxes.
"Those who lawfully have to pay 50 a month or more on Sky or BT subscriptions, are done a disservice by people like you and those who buy these devices," he said.
He said he was suspending Thompson's jail sentence but others in the future may not be so fortunate.
Cameron Crowe, prosecuting, said streaming devices were not illegal if they were used to access free content.
But he added: "If they are designed, produced or adapted for gaining unauthorised access to copyright content or subscription services - such as Sky and BT Sports - they become illegal."
Image copyright Kodi Image caption Kodi turns compatible devices into a "media centre" What are Kodi boxes?
Some shops sell ready-to-use set-top boxes or television sticks preloaded with the Kodi software.
The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content "freely available" on the internet.
However the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to illegal copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels.
Some traders sell Kodi boxes preloaded with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content.
It is the sale of these "fully-loaded" boxes which was the subject of the case against Mr Thompson.
Trading Standards officers made a test purchase from Thompson's Dundas shopping centre outlet in 2015 and a raid was carried out.
He moved premises after the raid and advertised on Facebook claiming to have "every film and box set ever made, even ones at the cinema".
Paul Fleming, defending, said his client was a hard worker who had succeeded and failed in businesses over the years.
Kieron Sharp, the chief executive of Fact (formerly the Federation Against Copyright Theft), said one million illegal Kodi TV boxes had been sold in the UK in the past two years.
He said the perpetrators were not "Robin Hood characters", but criminals.
"Selling pre-configured streaming devices that allow access to content you normally would have to pay for is illegal," he added.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The government thinks mobile operators need to inform customers once the handset is paid off Vodafone, EE and Three are continuing to charge customers for the mobile phones they buy as part of a contract, even after the cost of the handset has been paid off, research suggests.
Citizens Advice found that customers who do not take out a new contract are paying an average 22 extra a month.
The government said the mobile firms needed to inform customers when they had paid for their handsets.
The operators said that their billing systems were fair.
Minister for Digital Matt Hancock said: "It's only right that mobile customers should be notified when they have paid off the price of their handset, and that their future bills should reflect this.
"I welcome Citizens Advice's call for better billing information for consumers, and hope that providers will now take the initiative by clearly separating the cost of handsets and tariffs in mobile contracts."
Vodafone told the BBC it strives to give customers "the price plan that best suits them".
Who's affected and what can you do?
Anyone who purchased a mobile deal with the operators Three, Vodafone or EE, which included a handset, is being overcharged when their contract comes to an end Users can ask their phone company to swap them to a cheaper sim-only deal, or they can end the contract and find another provider No-one is automatically entitled to compensation - consumers can only make a claim if it wasn't made clear in their contract that the deal would continue at the same price Source: Citizens Advice The consumers who were overcharged "Wherever possible, we contact customers nearing the end of their contract to offer them a range of options.
These include being able to upgrade their handset, receiving an extra allowance to enhance their existing plan or, if they choose, a sim-only plan," the firm said in a statement.
Three said: "Whenever a new customer signs with us, we make the end-date of the contract term very clear.
We also let them know that they can contact us at any time to discuss the range of options available should they wish to change their plan with us."
And EE commented: "Separating phone and tariff doesn't always represent the best deal for consumers, it can sometimes result in them paying more."
O2 does separate airtime and device costs and chief marketing officer Nina Bibby said: "Forcing customers to continue to pay for a phone they already own not only hits their pockets but undermines trust and the reputation of the industry."
Are you paying extra?
Vodafone, EE and Three customers after end of handset-inclusive two-year fixed term deal 22 average monthly cost if customers do not buy a new contract 36% of customers failed to change after their deal 23% of over-65s stayed on after their deal 38 average extra monthly cost of contracts with handsets like the Galaxy S8 or the iPhone 8 46 potential monthly over-charge for customers with a 256GB iPhone 8 Getty Images Exploiting customers The majority of those who take out a mobile phone contract with the cost of the new handset included in the price will have paid off the price of phone over a period of two years, the study found.
The research suggested that users paying out for handsets such as the iPhone 7, the Galaxy S and Xperia XZ Premium, paid 38 extra a month, after the two-year period.
According to the study, people aged over 65 were the most likely to be stung - with 23% staying on their contract past the end of the fixed deal period.
Overall, 36% of people with a handset-inclusive contract failed to change it after the end of the fixed deal period.
Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: "The cost of handsets are hidden within some mobile phone contracts giving phone providers a way to exploit their customers.
"It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for.
It's especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice."
She called on the phone providers to make sure that any customers staying on a contract past the end of the fixed deal have their monthly bill reduced to reflect the fact they have paid for the handset.
"Providers could make it much easier for consumers to compare prices by separating out the cost of handsets from the cost of services like data and minutes for all contracts; that way it would be much clearer what they're paying for," she added.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Users "clap" for Mr Xi by tapping their phone screen A smartphone game in which players can "applaud" Chinese president Xi Jinping has gone viral.
The app, released in the week of the Communist Party Congress, lets users clap for Mr Xi by tapping their phone screen as many times as possible in 19 seconds.
The game, from Tencent, has racked up 1.2 billion plays in three days.
Public displays of loyalty to the president are commonplace in China and have intensified ahead of the congress.
The closed-door summit, which ends on Tuesday, will determine who rules China and the country's political direction.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Xi gave a speech lasting three and a half hours to the Communist Party Congress Mr Xi, who is widely expected to be re-appointed as leader, opened the summit with a speech lasting three and a half hours, in which he said China had entered a "new era" and should "take centre stage in the world".
In the Tencent game, users are shown extracts of the speech on topics such as regulating the housing market to protect young homebuyers, or improving the lives of poor farmers.
They are then encouraged to tap the screen to see how fast they can "applaud".
Many have challenged friends to compete and shared their scores on social media.
On Thursday, Tencent said players had clapped over a billion times in total so far.
'Cult of personality' It is not the first time apps have been used to encourage political loyalty in China.
The Communist Party has released more than 100 for its members, featuring quizzes and classes that promote its values.
Public displays of loyalty to the president are also commonplace in China, with Mr Xi's face appearing prominently on billboards and souvenirs sold in tourist areas.
Top officials also often publicly praise his ideology - although this has led some to warn that Mr Xi is creating a cult of personality around himself to entrench his position.
Since taking office in 2012, Mr Xi has taken steps to cement his leadership including a wide-reaching corruption crackdown, likened by some to a political purge.
The Communist Party is widely expected to rewrite its constitution next week to enshrine his political ideology - dubbed "Xi Jinping Thought".
The move would elevate him to the level of previous leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.
"Absolutely we took criticisms of the original Destiny to heart," Jason Jones, co-founder of Bungie, tells Newsbeat.
"We knew it had amazing parts... but we also saw the real mistakes we made."
In a rare interview inside their Seattle offices, in the US, he says the experience shaped how they tackled Destiny 2.
"It was stuff we already knew but it was a sharp and clear message from our community - they expected better."
Walking around the high-tech studios, where few journalists have seen the inner workings, it's clear there's a focus on righting those wrongs.
Jason tells us: "The story for example, that was one of the big sources of negative reviews for Destiny.
"We weren't surprised by that feedback because, when you're a creator immersed in that work, you feel it."
The narrative drew criticism for being dull and repetitive.
However, the online-only science fiction game was still seen by some as ground-breaking - establishing the new genre of MMO shooter and winning a Bafta for Game of the Year in 2014.
Jason says the studio have learnt their lessons, and judging by the reaction to the new title and the positive reviews he might just be right.
The challenge now is keeping the players coming back for more.
Speaking to Newsbeat, the game director of Destiny 2, Luke Smith, says: "For our game, quantity is a part of quality.
"Especially for our players who'll consume our content faster than we can build it.
It takes months to make a cool adventure and players will go through it in 20 minutes!"
Since being founded in the 1990s, Bungie has become one of the most influential games developers in the industry.
It first became famous for making the early titles of the award-winning Halo franchise.
Despite the console version of Destiny 2 being out since September, the studio is still a hive of activity.
Many of the studio's 700 employees are busy keeping the game's online living universe going, working on extra content and developing a PC version.
The franchise has never been playable off console before and adapting the game is the job of David Shaw.
He tells us: "Making the mouse and keyboard really feel like Destiny has been one of the challenges.
"On consoles when you're firing certain weapons they'll kick and rise up quickly.
"That recoil is a integral part of making that experience feel good and heavy like you're actually there.
"But on keyboard and mouse it meant you were just chasing the barrel of the gun the whole time, just dragging the mouse."
The team made a big effort to make sure it pushes the technical capabilities of expensive PCs.
David says: "When someone spends several thousand pounds on a gaming rig, you want to make sure you're honouring that investment."
Everything the team needs to make the game and all the upcoming extra content is all under one roof, from motion capture rooms to sound design studios.
Award-winning composer Michael Salvatore tells us: "We had to make over 900 minutes of music for this game, that's 15 hours.
"We released the soundtrack a day before the game came out and it became the number one seller on Amazon, we knocked Taylor Swift from first place.
"I love Taylor Swift but enough is enough!"
Keeping Desitny fans happy is the main job for people in the studio at the moment but Jason tells us that they have started thinking about what's next.
He says: "We're starting in a small way to look at what's beyond Destiny.
"Every time you do a new thing to surprise and delight people you risk being ignored.
"So you could make your hand very tired writing down all the risks going into a new game project, but unless you're taking risks then you're not going to do something people care about."

Earlier on Friday his Wikipedia entry said he died in Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.
As of lunchtime it was changed to say he died in the Republic of Ireland.
Wikipedia showed the edits had been made from an IP address which could be traced to the House of Commons.
Minutes later, it had been "restored", by another user.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The search for the Malaysia Airlines plane was suspended in January Malaysia is negotiating a "no find-no fee" deal with a US company to renew the search for downed flight MH370.
The government announced in a statement that it was in talks with Texas-based salvage firm Ocean Infinity.
If the deal goes ahead, Ocean Infinity will foot the bill and recoup costs only if it finds the missing plane.
The disappearance of MH370 remains shrouded in mystery.
The flight fell off radar on 8 March 2014 en route to Beijing, with 239 people on board.
Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester said on Friday that a deal had been reached between Malaysia and Ocean Infinity, but the Malaysian government later clarified in a statement that it was still in talks.
A massive search operation for the plane cleared 120,000 sq km at an estimated cost of about A$200m (120m; 133m), before it was suspended in January.
Ocean Infinity has not revealed the estimated cost of a search.
According to Mr Chester, any new operation will focus on a 25,000 sq km area identified by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as having a "high probability" of containing the aircraft.
Ocean Infinity is in talks with the government about using a centuries-old model known in the salvage industry as "no cure-no pay" - a type of deal usually applied in the recovery of valuable sunken cargo.
Under such a deal, a salvage company will take on the financial risk of a recovery and recoup from the owner a percentage of the cargo's value if it is found, often 80 or 90%.
In this case, Ocean Infinity would be working instead for a set fee from the Malaysian government, and for the significant publicity on offer should it find the wreckage, an industry expert told the BBC.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A search operation that went on for almost three years failed to find the wreckage MH370 was carrying passengers and crew from 14 different countries when it disappeared, most from China and Malaysia.
Australia led the initial search, after aviation officials identified the ocean floor off its coast as the likely location of the wreckage.
The country has agreed to provide technical assistance for the new search, Mr Chester said.
Earlier this month, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said the government had received proposals from three private search firms - Ocean Infinity, Dutch firm Fugro and an unidentified Malaysian company.
Delivering its report into the disappearance earlier this month, Australia's Transport Safety Bureau said it was "almost inconceivable" that the aircraft had not been found.

The move could increase profits from the Japanese company's mobile phone business.
Although it is free to play, it will include an option to pay a small amount of money for in-app purchases.
The game, which was first designed for the Nintendo 64 console, will now be available on iPhones and Android smartphones.
People got a bit excited when they heard the news.
Animal Crossing has been a real success story for Nintendo and has attracted younger gamers.
The game is based around being the mayor of your own town and you can spend your time how you like.
This can range from collecting items, planting things, selling stuff you've collected, customising your character's clothes, your home and some of the places around you.
The characters are all cartoony animals with unique personalities.
Gaming blogger Nick Hickman told Newsbeat: "Players of the game have reacted positively to the endlessly customisable nature of the towns you can create.
"There are lots of people who still play it even now, years after it first came out.
"Given the initial success of Pokemon Go and the financial success (although not quite breaking the zeitgeist like Pokemon did) of Mario Run and Fire Emblem heroes, people are excited for Nintendo to publish more games on mobile making them much more accessible.
"Nintendo usually only puts their games on their own machines, so breaking from that tradition and allowing games they've made on a platform that everyone has is quite a big deal."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Zimbabweans jokingly refer to the newly appointed cyber security tsar as the "Minister of WhatsApp" A spoof government notice hit social media as soon as President Robert Mugabe announced he had set up a new ministry responsible for Cyber Security, Threat Detection and Mitigation.
Zimbabweans reacted with customary humour to the letter, which faked the signature and letterhead of the newly appointed cyber minister - Patrick Chinamasa - and instructed all WhatsApp group members to register with the ministry by November.
The letter was signed "By The Cyber Powers Vested In Me".
Image copyright .
But the jokes have since subsided, and Zimbabweans are now considering what the new ministry will mean for their civil liberties - especially freedom of speech.
'A threat to the state' Zimbabwe's government has been uneasy about social media after pastor Evan Mawararire spearheaded the #ThisFlag movement last year.
Using platforms like Twitter and Facebook it organised a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade.
President Robert Mugabe's spokesperson, George Charamba, says Mr Mugabe came up with the idea of a new ministry to deal with an "emerging threat to the state... a threat founded on abuse and unlawful conduct".
Social media is possibly the primary platform Zimbabweans use to communicate and receive news.
It is thriving despite restrictive laws governing freedom of expression.
Over the last 16 years, internet usage in the country has grown from 0.3% penetration to 46%, data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) shows.
Several TV stations and online publications, some operating from the diaspora, use the internet to disseminate news out of the reach of the government.
Image copyright AFP Image caption #ThisFlag protestors brought Harare to a standstill last year When petrol stations ran out of fuel last month, there were dramatic scenes of long queues at supermarket as Zimbabweans stocked up, anticipating food shortages.
Worried by these events, the government blamed social media messages for spreading panic.
"Social media was abused to create a sense of panic, thereby creating some sort of destabilising in the economy," says Mr Charamba.
The new cyber security minister, Mr Chinamasa, agrees.
He commented at the time, before his appointment, that "the cause basically was social media".
"It means it's a security issue," he adds.
"It is also a political agenda, a regime change agenda.
We are going to look at what exactly happened with a view to take corrective measures in the security arena."
'Muzzling' opinion But others say the government's stance is a threat to civil liberties.
One communications rights group, the Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (Misa), says this new scrutiny of social media goes against the spirit of the constitution and freedom of expression.
"These unfortunate threats have resulted in self-censorship by [individuals] when engaging on topical issues affecting the country," it said in a statement.
It also criticises censorship of Zimbabwe's media, "who have on occasion been chastised for incorporating citizen opinion as expressed online in their reportage".
Going a step further, Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says the government's new cyber threat ministry is a means for government to spy on its people.
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also believes that the ministry has been created to curb free speech in time for the 2018 polls.
"Mugabe... will do whatever it takes to control and muzzle social media in order to suppress public discontent against his regime," he said.
"However the good news is that the regime has no capacity to suppress the use of social media."
Many Zimbabweans have reacted wryly to the news of the creation of a cyber minister, referring to Mr Chinamasa as the "Minister of WhatsApp".
Some say the ridicule shows a lack of understanding about the global threat of cyber crime.
Others see a link between the government's scrutiny of online communication and the forthcoming elections.
Zimbabwe already has several pieces of legislation which rights groups say curb freedom of expression.
Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says that since 2010, it has assisted more than 100 people arrested under a law which makes it a jailable offence to "insult the president" and "undermine his authority".
Ordinary people have been arrested and charged for calling the 93-year-old leader "old", "a donkey" and even for accusing him of ruining the country.
The Zimbabwean government has said new legislation will not stifle freedom of expression and will protect the public from new threats such as revenge pornography and cyber attacks.
Presidential spokesperson Mr Charamba says Zimbabwe will look closely at how other nations have dealt with the threat of cybercrime - including Russia, China, and South Korea "who have faced similar challenges".
Arrests ahead?
While several countries around the world have anti-cyber crime departments and agencies, Zimbabwe is among the first to create an entire ministry.
Meanwhile on social media, ominous warnings have begun circulating.
One is from a "Mr Chaipa", urging Zimbabweans only to share content on social media that they would be able to defend in court.
Mr Chaipa said it was easy for the government to monitor online messages, and gave a list of online activities that could be classified as criminal offences.
"In the coming months a lot of people will be arrested and used as examples to deter people from 'abusing' social media towards the elections," he warns.
"Don't be made an example."

But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.
And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately.
"Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.
It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."
Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.
This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.
Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.
Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars.
"Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says.
"For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.
So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain.
"Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.
So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."
Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.
More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is.
"Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme.
"Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.
The only thing to do is unpack the drone.
The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."
Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.
Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.
In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans.
Online grocer Ocado believes it will not need any human labour at all within 10 years.
And online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.

"Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."
But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.
The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.
So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.
Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.
And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate.
"Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder.
"But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this.
"As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.
And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace.
"The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."
This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rollout of Australia's National Broadband Network has been heavily criticised In 1872, rugged, frontier Australia was lauded for overcoming the tyranny of distance to connect itself to the world via the "bush telegraph", a two-year project stringing 3,200km (2,000 miles) of wire through the outback that became part of the nation's folklore.
By contrast today, while striving to be seen as an "innovation nation", Australia stands condemned, even ridiculed, for its latest drive for connectivity: a modern, fast internet network.
Three letters - NBN - have come to strike dread into the minds of consumers, with the National Broadband Network symbolising for many a template in how not to do things.
Given Australia's large size and sparse population density of three people per square kilometre, the NBN is the country's largest ever infrastructure project.
The total budget sits at A$49bn (29bn; $38bn).
Of that budget, around 35% must be spent connecting the final 10% of users, including wiring to remote areas, erecting many of the required 2,600 wireless towers and, most expensively, putting two satellites in the sky.
This week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the NBN a mistake and a "calamitous train wreck" by a previous Labor government.
Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd hit back by saying the project's issues "lie all on your head" - meaning the current conservative government.
The escalating blame game, the NBN's slow roll-out, and a switch to inferior technology midstream have combined with other factors to leave Australians frequently asking the question: Why is our internet so slow?
In 2013, Australia ranked 30th for average internet speeds.
The NBN was meant to improve that, but the most recent standings ranked Australia 50th.
The State of the Internet survey by US internet firm Akamai put Australia - with an average of 11.1 Mbps (megabits per second) - behind countries including Kenya, Hungary and Russia.
And while it promotes itself as part of go-ahead Asia, Australia sits only eighth in the region, behind neighbours such as Thailand (21st overall) and New Zealand (27th).
Some comparisons are misleading.
Only 1.75% of Kenyan homes have fixed-line internet, compared with 90% in Australia.
For many, particularly inner-city Australians on the best NBN technology, fixed-line speeds are adequate, particularly if you pay more.
But there's no escaping Australia has been overtaken by many countries on the internet table.
What's worse is that with many of those connected to the NBN reporting no improvement over old ADSL connections, of the homes equipped to take the new service, only 40% have chosen to do so.
In business, and international competitiveness, the fears are perhaps more serious.
NBN by the numbers A$49bn The current estimated cost of building the network 2007 The year the project was announced 2020 When the rollout is expected to be completed A$91,196 The cost of connecting one remote property 159% The rise in complaints since last financial year Getty Images "Going lower in ranking is alarming, and just not acceptable," says University of Sydney academic Dr Tooran Alizadeh, who has researched the NBN extensively and, like others, worries Australia's best minds will be lost to countries with better technology.
"Australia wants to be in the first 10 or so economies in the world.
Obviously if you want to do that your internet access cannot be ranked 50th."
The history In 2007, Mr Rudd announced 98% of Australian homes would be on the NBN by 2020.
It was a breathtakingly ambitious idea.
It was also, according to critics, backed by inadequate research into logistics and costs, initially put at A$15bn.
The natural starting point was Australia's oldest telecom company, Telstra.
Elsewhere, countries like New Zealand simply used the infrastructure already laid by their major telecom company to install fast internet cabling.
But Telstra, halfway privatised at the time, clashed with regulators over how it might onsell broadband access to its competitors, and so pulled out of the running to build the network.
Eventually, the government announced it would simply start a whole new semi-autonomous company from scratch.
Called the NBN, it would set up the infrastructure to connect Australians with state-of-the-art fibre optic cables to their homes, selling bandwidth wholesale to retailers.
Progress was slow, sporadic, and expensive.
With Australia's preference for underground wiring, often concrete driveways would have to be dug up and relaid.
Costs thus blew out for connecting houses from an envisaged average of A$4,400 to, in some cases, more than A$20,000, an NBN spokesman says.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A rocket carrying the NBN's first satellite is launched into space from French Guiana in 2015 Complaints soon arose over why some regions were connected before others, with schools and hospitals, for example, getting very unequal standards of internet quality.
Accusations of government pork-barrelling, however, were wide of the mark.
"The government just wanted progress, so it became a matter of which places were easiest and quickest to connect," one source with intimate knowledge of the subject told the BBC.
"Often this came down to issues like basic geology - where was the rock easiest to drill through?"
After the conservative government attained power in 2013, the NBN struck more upheaval, with copper wire ordered for the final stretches of connection, surrounding neighbourhood broadband nodes.
This presents a slower connection to the twice-as-expensive fibre optics.
It also means residents, say 400 metres from the node, will have slower internet than a neighbour a few doors away.
Critics also charge it's a false saving, since copper wire needs replacing far earlier than fibre optics.
Complaints and competition Then came the NBN's high pricing to retailers, who buy limited supply to pass on to consumers, which leaves so many Australians staring in frustration while buffering or, worse still, service drop-outs occurring each peak hour.
"NBN has worked hard to bring the cost of bandwidth down but we cannot fill the pipes ourselves - it is up to the retailers to make sure that they are buying enough capacity to deliver a good quality of service," an NBN spokesman told the BBC.
Yet another complication is the number of retailers - 180 - making it hard for the NBN to police quality control for end users.
"We've had huge problems getting our house connected to the footpath node," says Matt Grant, a factory manager in suburban St Clair, just 39km from central Sydney.
"But when I complained to the retailer, they told me to talk to the NBN.
When I talked to the NBN, they sent me back to the retailer."
Image copyright Getty Images He was eventually connected, but said "it's no better than we had with ADSL, especially in peak times".
Last week, Australia's Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman revealed there had been a 159% increase in NBN-related complaints in the last financial year.
NBN chief executive Bill Morrow told the Australian Broadcasting Corp this week that it "turns [his] stomach" that some customers were being left behind, but he placed blame on retailers, and said the government would ultimately decide when to replace copper connections.
He also noted increasing competition from mobile broadband technology.
"Look, it is a competitive environment, but I just want to repeat we are doing everything we can to ensure the NBN delivers a great service," he said.
The network says it's still on target to have 98% of homes connected by 2020, but Australia's internet malaise will still take some solving.
There's hope of improvement, but not until base prices can come down as the NBN gradually recoups its massive expenditure.
And despite the political finger-pointing, Mr Turnbull's government insists the network will be "fit for purpose".
"Australia needs a 21st Century broadband network and this is not being delivered," said Laurie Patton, executive director of consumer advocacy group Internet Australia.
"The way we're heading now, whoever is in office in 2020 will have to deal with our biggest ever national infrastructure debacle."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.
But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?
It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.
One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road.
"No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip.
"He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?
A light-bulb came on."
Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.
The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.
These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.
Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says.
"We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."
The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.
It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.
So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura.
"Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.
But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.
Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.
More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.
This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.
Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.
Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.
And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.
With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.
These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence.
"These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says.
"That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly.
"And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."
Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.
Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers.
"There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai.
"How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"
The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.
As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.
The customer then shares their location with Fetchr.
"Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says.
"Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."
The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.
Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses.
"Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou.
"But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."
Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London.
"We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.
This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.
Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.
Smaller retailers can't.
So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.
His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com.
"These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell.
"I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."
That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.
This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.
But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?
Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.
Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.
But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward.
"One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains.
"In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.
Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."
These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.
But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.
Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges.
"Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says.
"Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."
Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.
Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.
That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.
Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees.
"Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time.
"Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."
Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.
Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.
But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.
For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.
In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.
In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.
So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.
It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.
Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using.
"You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."
Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.
More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.
With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.
Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.
But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.
Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."
Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scientists are now developing an ultra-fast quantum internet that will be partly based on light Imagine super-fast computers that can solve problems much quicker than machines today.
These "quantum computers" are being developed in laboratories around the world.
But scientists have already taken the next step, and are thinking about a light-based quantum internet that will have to be just as fast.
It's not easy to develop technology for a device that hasn't technically been invented yet, but quantum communications is an attractive field of research because the technology will enable us to send messages that are much more secure.
There are several problems that will need to be solved in order to make a quantum internet possible: Getting quantum computers to talk to each other Making communications secure from hacking Transmitting messages over long distances without losing parts of the message; and Routing messages across a quantum network What is a quantum computer?
A quantum computer is a machine that is able to crack very tough computation problems with incredible speed - beyond that of today's "classical" computers.
In conventional computers, the unit of information is called a "bit" and can have a value of either 1 or 0.
But its equivalent in a quantum system - the qubit (quantum bit) - can be both 1 and 0 at the same time.
This phenomenon opens the door for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously.
However, qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed "spooky action at a distance".
There are four types of quantum computers currently being developed, which use: Light particles Trapped ions Superconducting qubits Nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds Quantum computers will enable a multitude of useful applications, such as being able to model many variations of a chemical reaction to discover new medications; developing new imaging technologies for healthcare to better detect problems in the body; or to speed up how we design batteries, new materials and flexible electronics.
Pooling computing power Quantum computers might be more powerful than classical computers, but some applications will require even more computing power than one quantum computer can provide on its own.
If you can get quantum devices to talk to each other, then you could connect several quantum computers together and pool their power to form one huge quantum computer.
However, since there are four different types of quantum computers being built today, they won't be all be able to talk to each other without some help.
Some scientists favour a quantum internet based entirely on light particles (photons), while others believe that it would be easier to make quantum networks where light interacts with matter.
"Light is better for communications, but matter qubits are better for processing," Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies tells the BBC.
"You need both to make the network work to establish error correction of the signal, but it can be difficult to make them interact."
It is very expensive and difficult to store all information in photons, Mr Fitzsimons says, because photons can't see each other and pass straight by, rather than bouncing off each other.
Instead, he believes it would be easier to use light for communications, while storing information using electrons or atoms (in matter).
Quantum encryption Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quantum encryption will make communications much more secure One of the key applications of the quantum internet will be quantum key distribution (QKD), whereby a secret key is generated using a pair of entangled photons, and is then used to encrypt information in a way that is impossible for a quantum computer to crack.
This technology already exists, and was first demonstrated in space by a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde, UK, in December 2015.
But it's not just the encryption that we will need to build in order to secure our information in the quantum future.
Scientists are also working on "blind quantum computer protocols", because they allow the user to hide anything they want on a computer.
"You can write something, send it to a remote computer and the person who owns the computer can't tell anything about it at all except how long it took to run and how much memory it used," says Mr Fitzsimons.
"This is important because there likely won't be many quantum computers when they first appear, so people will want to remotely run programs on them, the way we do today in the cloud."
There are two different approaches to building quantum networks - a land-based network and a space-based network.
Both methods work well for sending regular bits of data across the internet today, but if we want to send data as qubits in the future, it is much more complicated.
To send particles of light (photons), we can use fibre optic cables in the ground.
However, the light signal deteriorates over long distances (a phenomenon known as "decoherence"), because fibre optics cables sometimes absorb photons.
It is possible to get around this by building "repeater stations" every 50km.
These would essentially be miniature quantum laboratories that would try to repair the signal before sending it on to the next node in the network.
But this system would come with its own complexities.
Land or space?
Image copyright Johannes Handsteiner / AW Image caption Artwork: a ground station beams a message contained in a light signal up to the Micius satellite Then there are space-based networks.
Let's say you want to send a message from the UK to a friend in Australia.
The light signal is beamed up from a ground station in the UK, to a satellite with a light source mounted on it.
The satellite sends the light signal to another satellite, which then beams the signal down to a ground station in Australia, and then the message can be transmitted over a ground-based quantum network or classical internet network to the other party.
"Because there's no air between the satellites, there's nothing to degrade the signal," says Dr Jamie Vicary, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's department of computer science and a member of the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT).
"If we want to have a really global-scale quantum internet, it looks like a space-based solution is the only way that will work, but it's the most expensive."
Quantum teleportation via space has been conducted successfully, and scientists are currently vying to demonstrate longer and longer distances.
Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences generated headlines in June when they succeeded in teleporting entangled photons between two towns in China located 1,200km apart.
They used a specially developed quantum satellite called Micius.
The same Chinese scientists recently topped their own record on 29 September, by demonstrating the world's first intercontinental video call protected by a quantum key with researchers at the Austrian Academy of Sciences - over a distance of 7,700km.
The call lasted for 20 minutes and the parties were able to exchange encrypted pictures of the Micius satellite and Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger.
Rupert Ursin, senior group leader at the Austrian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information believes the quantum internet will need land-based and space-based networks to operate in parallel.
"In the cities, we need a fibre network, but long haul connections will be covered by satellite links," he explains.
How does quantum key distribution work?
Image copyright AW Image caption The video call between Austrian and Chinese scientists on 29 September 2017 To understand how QKD works, let's go back to the video call made between the Austrian and Chinese scientists.
The Micius satellite used its light source to establish optical links with the ground stations in Austria and the ground stations in China.
It was then able to generate a quantum key.
The great thing about quantum encryption is you can detect whether someone has tried to intercept the message before it got to you, and how many people tried to access it.
Micius was able to tell that the encryption was secure and no one was eavesdropping on the video call.
It then gave the go ahead to encrypt the data using the secret key and transmit it over a public internet channel.
Routing messages Multiple groups of scientists are developing land-based networks by working on the technologies for quantum repeater stations, which are located every 50km, connected by fibre optic cables.
These repeater stations, also known as "quantum network nodes", will need to perform several actions in order to route, or direct, messages around the network.
First, each node needs to repair and boost the signal that was damaged from the previous 50km stretch of the network.
Imagine that you're using an old fax machine to send a one-page document to someone else, and each time you send the page, a different part of the message is missing, and the other party has to piece the message together from all the failed attempts.
This is similar to how a single message may have to be sent between different nodes on a quantum network.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fibre optic cables will be used for land-based quantum networks There will be many people on the network, all trying to talk to each other.
So the node, or repeater station, will also have to figure out how to distribute its available computing power in order to piece together all the messages being sent.
It will also have to send messages between the quantum internet and the classical internet.
The University of Delft is building a quantum network using nitrogen vacancies in diamonds, and it has so far shown the ability to store and distribute the links needed for quantum communications over quite large distances.
The University of Oxford and the University of Maryland are both currently building quantum computers that work in a similar way to a network.
Their quantum computers consist of trapped ion nodes that have been networked together to talk to each other.
The bigger the computer you want, the more nodes you have to add, but this type of quantum computer only transmits data over a short distance.
"We want to make them small so they can be well-protected from decoherence, but if they're small then they can't hold many qubits," says Dr Vicary.
"If we connect the nodes up in a network, then we can still have a quantum computer without being limited by the number of qubits, while still protecting the nodes."
Quantum memory The repeater station will also need to have a quantum memory chip.
The nodes create "links", which consist of entangled pairs of light particles.
These entangled pairs are prepared in advance.
While the node calculates the route across the network that the message will need to take, it needs to store the entangled pair of photons somewhere safe, so a quantum memory chip is needed.
It has to be able to store the photons for as long as possible.

This device is able to store light in the right colour and it is able to do so for longer than one second, which is 10,000 times longer than all other attempts so far.
"The biggest challenge is now to demonstrate a quantum memory with a large data storage capacity," associate professor Matthew Sellars, program manager in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T) at ANU tells the BBC.
"It will be the memory's storage capacity that will limit the data transmission rate through the network.
"I think it will take about five years before the technology [for the quantum internet] is practical."
Image copyright Peat Image caption Voruganti Surendra says farmers are finding pest and disease recognition apps "very useful" India's farmers have never had it easy; drought, crop failure, low market prices and lack of modernisation have taken their toll on the nation's population, about half of whom work in agriculture.
Every year thousands of farmers take their own lives.
So can crop management apps help?
Voruganti Surendra is a farmer who grows paddy rice on an acre of farmland in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.
He and hundreds of his fellow farmers are using a new app that can recognise a growing number of crop pests and diseases and give advice on how to treat them.
"It is very useful," he says.
"Farmers need it."
The app, called Plantix, was developed thousands of miles away in Berlin, Germany, by a group of graduate students and scientists who came together to help farmers combat disease, pest damage and nutrient deficiency in their crops.
"It was really important for us to understand what farmers wanted," says Charlotte Schumann, co-founder of Peat (Progressive Environmental & Agricultural Technologies) the company behind the app, "so we did a lot of groundwork in India".
Image caption Peat boss Simone Strey (left) and co-founder Charlotte Schumann created the Plantix app After months criss-crossing this vast country by train, conducting research in rural areas, the team concluded that a diagnostics app featuring image recognition would help farmers most, especially since smartphone prices were falling to affordable levels.
"The smartphones gave many of them access to the internet for the first time," says Ms Schumann.
There are 500 or so farmers in Mr Surendra's village of Karlapalem in Bapatla Mandal, growing rice, maize, cotton, banana, chilli and a host of other crops.
While just 20 own their own smartphones, these lucky few share them so that their fellow farmers can take photos of their crops and upload the images to the app.
The farmer photographs the damaged crop and the app identifies the likely pest or disease by applying machine learning to its growing database of images.
Not only can Plantix recognise a range of crop diseases, such as potassium deficiency in a tomato plant, rust on wheat, or nutrient deficiency in a banana plant, but it is also able to analyse the results, draw conclusions, and offer advice.
Image copyright Peat Image caption The app can recognise different types of pest damage and suggest treatments These abilities rely on deep neural networks, or DNNs, which processes information in a way similar to how biological nervous systems operate.
"It works a bit like the human brain," says Peat's chief executive, Simone Strey.
Initially, or if the image recognition software gets confused, pathologists and other experts will provide information about what the app is looking at.
"Obviously, it needs some backup from human experts," says Ms Strey.
The app had to be multi-lingual because "the farmers often use different names for crop diseases than those used by scientists", she says.
"And if the farmers don't know the scientific name, they won't be able to search for solutions online."
It is currently available in Hindi, Telugu and English in India, and in five other languages for use in other countries.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About half of India's 1.3 billion people work in agriculture But Peat is not the only firm developing smartphone apps to help farmers.
In Africa, for instance, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research - a body dedicated to food security - has just won a $100,000 (76,000) award to expand its research and bring a similar app to farmers across the continent.
David Hughes of Penn State, who co-leads the project, describes it as "transformative" and says they "can amplify by 100 times what we have achieved so far".
In fact, the number of digital helpers that can fit in farmers' pockets has grown dramatically in recent years.
They include fertiliser firm Yara's ImageIT app, which uses photos to measure nitrogen uptake in a crop and offer recommendations to farmers.
University of Missouri's ID Weeds app helps farmers identify unwanted plants.
And John Deere's GrainTruckPlus app helps with grain harvesting storage and fleet logistics.
Then there's PotashCorp's return-on-investment calculator, called eKonomics, and AgVault 2.0 Mobile's Sentera app, which controls drones that can systematically film entire fields autonomously and feed back the footage for analysis.
Image copyright Yara Image caption Yara's ImageIT app aims to measure the nitrogen content in plants "Technological innovations play a very important role," says Harsimrat Kaur Badal, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries, in reducing waste, improving hygiene, creating jobs, and addressing "farmers' distress".
Krishna Kumar, chief executive of CropIn Technology, a data-driven farming company, believes agricultural "start-ups [will] innovate fast and change every aspect of the industry".
While such apps are practically useful to farmers now, it is the data they collect that is potentially more useful in the longer term, argues Peat's Ms Strey.
"Each farmer represents a data point, and it's really the data set that's valuable.
Research on this scale in this field hasn't been done before by any global research organisation."
This is why farmers don't usually have to pay to use such apps.
"If you want to collect data, you don't make the users pay," says Ms Strey.
More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Peat's database currently contains some 1.5 million images - up from 100,000 a year ago, with 80% of its 300,000 to 400,000 users currently in India.
Geo-tagging offers insight into which plants are grown where, and whether or not they are healthy.
Apps can record the weather, too, and build up a picture of the climatic conditions.
Such knowledge is valuable not just to the farmers themselves but also to producers of fertilisers or pesticides, to the food industry which wants to source crops, and to governments keen to see the bigger picture in their countries.
As such, the challenge, according to CropIn Technology's Mr Kumar, is not merely to gather the data, but to "make sense of it and present it as actionable insights to agri businesses".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Your fluffy pillows and memory foam mattress could be helping to reduce CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process?
When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change.
This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street.
It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet.
Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2.
UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics.
In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic.
And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process.
"Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year," explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies.
"This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."
Image copyright CarbonCure Image caption CarbonCure's Robert Niven thinks his firm's concrete is far more environmentally friendly The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market.
Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete.
CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer.
The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger.
Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects.
Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel.
While Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes.
But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference?
Simply put, levels of "greenhouse gases" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Should we be reducing the amount of CO2 used in making plastics, or simply using less plastic?
At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions.
But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark.
A gigatonne is a billion tonnes.
Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year.
And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year.
Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes.
"It's great to have these options coming up," says Mr Christensen, "but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."
Image copyright Ashley Cooper Image caption Greenpeace's Doug Parr thinks renewable energy is a better way to reduce CO2 emissions Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy.
A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes.
"Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels," says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.
"A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."
In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale.
More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed," he argues.
Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon.
Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood.
So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue.
This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed.
"Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down.
Then carbon capture can come in," says Mr Christensen.
"It could have an important role to play."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Romance scams remain a successful tactic for criminals online.
In the flesh, Wayne May (not his real name) is an affable gentleman in his late 40s, softly spoken with a lilting Welsh accent.
When we meet he's casually dressed in jeans and a Batman T-shirt.
He works full-time as a carer.
On the net, he's a tireless defender of scam victims and a fearless scam baiter - a person who deliberately contacts scammers, engages with them and then publishes as much information about them as possible in order to warn others.
He regularly receives death threats, and his website, Scam Survivors, is often subjected to attempted DDoS attacks - where a site is maliciously hit with lots of web traffic to try to knock it offline.
But Mr May is determined to continue helping scamming victims in his spare time, and has a team of volunteers in the US, Canada and Europe doing the same.
Image caption "Wayne May" says victims need to accept that they are unlikely to get their money back Scam Survivors is not an official platform - in the UK victims are encouraged to contact Action Fraud - but the team has dealt with 20,000 cases in the past 12 years, he claims.
According to the Office for National Statistics there were 1.9 million reports of "cyber-related" fraud in the year ending March 2017 in England and Wales.
But the report also says that many incidents go unreported.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission website says nearly AUS$13m (8m, $10m) has been lost this year to romance fraud alone.
Scamming may be an old trick but it's still an effective one.
Mr May, who does not charge but invites donations on his website, says his website gets up to 10,000 hits a day and the group also receives up to two dozen messages a day from people who are victims of sextortion - when a person is blackmailed after being persuaded to carry out a sex act on webcam, which is then recorded.
"A lot of people, when they come to us are already so far deep into it, they have nowhere to turn," he says.
"They're not stupid, they're just unaware of the scam."
"It's not obvious [that it's a scam] if they've never experienced it before."
He discovered he was "rather good" at baiting romance scammers and found relatives of victims were approaching him to help loved-ones.
"I started dealing more with the victims of the scams rather than the scammers themselves, so my priorities changed then from just having fun to actually helping people."
Many scams are not a particularly sophisticated form of fraud.
"There are constantly new scams coming out, and we need to be aware of those," says Mr May.
"But a lot of the scams aren't high-tech, they simply write messages to people and that's it.
"You might think, 'I'm not going to fall for this scam' but then you'll fall for another one.
The scammers will find a chink in your armour."
Image copyright Other Image caption Daniel Perry, 17, died in a fall from the Forth Road Bridge in July 2013 - he was a victim of sextortion The first thing Mr May has to explain to those who get in touch is that Scam Survivors cannot recover any money the victim has been persuaded to hand it over.
In his experience, the average victim will end up around 1,000 out of pocket, but some will go a lot further - one man who recently made contact with the support group had given more than 500,000 to a male Russian scammer he thought he was in a relationship with.
"We say upfront, we can't get your money back.
We can't offer you emotional support.
We're not psychiatrists.
We're just people who know how scams work and how to deal with them," he says.
Advice for victims Drop all contact with the scammer.
Don't try to track them down - remember, the scammer has your real details and possibly compromising information about you.
It's not worth the risk to continue talking to them, and especially not worth confronting them.
If you sent cash, there's no realistic way to get it back - beware the "recovery scam" where the scammer then claims to be an agency able to get the money back, for a fee.
Contact the police.
Share as many details about the scam as you can to warn others.
To prevent being a victim, his advice is simple: "Google everything."
Search the images you are sent, the messages you receive - often scammers use the same material and the more widely shared it is, the more likely it is to end up on a website dedicated to exposing scams.
If you fear blackmail, Mr May suggests setting up an alert so that you are notified if your name is mentioned online.
If, in the case of sextortion, a video is published on the net, you will then know straight away and can report it, as you are likely to be tagged in it.
"Be aware and learn how to search everything," he says.
"If someone sends you a picture or text, search it, try to find out as much as you can.
If you're unsure don't send them money."
Image copyright Getty Images Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime reporting service, said all scams reported to it are passed on to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, which is part of City of London Police.
However, a spokeswoman told the BBC that only around 30% of all fraud cases had "viable lines of inquiry".
"We know that at these levels it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to investigate all these crimes," said a spokeswoman.
"We have to maximise our resources where there is the best chance of a successful investigative outcome."
Professor Alan Woodward, cyber-security expert from Surrey University, said it was still important to keep reporting scams to the national body even if individual justice was not always possible.
"For those contacting Action Fraud UK to report a crime it may appear that little happens, but your information is vital in constructing an accurate picture of where, when and how online scams are occurring," he said.
"It may be that the police are unable to solve your individual crime but by studying the big picture they are able to zero in on the scammers.
"Your report could be vital in completing the overall picture and enable law enforcement to prevent others suffering as you have."
No sympathy Some people argue that the scammers themselves are also in desperate situations - many of them operate in some of the poorest parts of the world, such as West Africa and the Philippines.
Wayne May has no sympathy.
"These people aren't Robin Hood types," he says.
"If you go online and scam people you have the money to go online, if you can't afford food you can't spend hours in an internet cafe."
He is, however, haunted by one occasion when a woman from the Philippines he was scam-baiting offered to perform on webcam for him.
When he declined she then asked if she should involve her sister.
"She called this girl over and she couldn't have been more than nine or 10," he recalls.
"That horrified me.
I said, 'Don't do this, not for me, not for anybody.
You shouldn't do this'.
I couldn't talk to her again after that.
I had to completely walk away."
He says he has no idea what happened to her.
"I can't let it affect me too much, otherwise I wouldn't be able to do what I do," he said.
"I've been doing it for almost 12 years now, and if I let every case affect me I'd be a gibbering wreck in the corner."
