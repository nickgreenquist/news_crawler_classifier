California woman, 45, in 'shock' after unexpectedly giving birth:::::A 45-year-old woman in California reportedly gave birth to a surprise baby boy after not realizing she was even pregnant.Beth Clay, the now mother of three, went to the emergency room last week thinking she had kidney stones, she told KTLA on Wednesday.But instead she and her husband found out that not only was she pregnant, but she was about to give birth.I was like, that just cant be real.It's all contrived, never could happen.You would know if there was a baby in your belly, but we're living proof," Scott Clay, Beths husband, said.BABY BORN WITH VOCAL CORDS FUSED TOGETHER SAYS DADA FOR THE FIRST TIME Doctors reportedly believe that the baby, named Liam Ryder Clay, was hiding behind his mothers organs.Throughout her unknown pregnancy, Beth Clay said she had been very active and kept to a healthy diet, even losing 15 pounds, which only added to her astonishment of the news, KTLA reported."I was in tiptop shape, and then the next three days, heres this little rascal," she said.The shock is just amazing."3-YEAR-OLD GIRL GETS HER DREAM TARGET-THEMED BIRTHDAY PARTY Baby Liam was reportedly in intensive care for a few days following his birth but is healthy overall.His parents, who were not expecting to have another baby at this point in their lives, told KTLA they were ecstatic about their newest bundle of joy.We waited a whole day before we told any of our family," Beth Clay said."Just so we could absorb what was actually happening, it's huge."
The emergency declaration was a start. Here’s how else Trump plans to combat the opioid epidemic:::::President Trumps remarks Thursday that he was directing his administration to declare the opioid epidemic a public health emergency mostly focused on the extent of the problem and highlighted in broad strokes that the country would find ways to combat the crisis.But Trump also laid out ways in which his administration would be attempting to combat the opioid epidemic.Here are a few of the steps Trump mentioned.Treatment beds By law, federal Medicaid dollars cannot go to facilities that treat mental illness or substance use disorders if they have more than 16 beds, a policy that dates to a time when federal officials did not want to be in the practice of reimbursing state psychiatric hospitals.But with the opioid epidemic, some advocates have called for abandoning this policy.Read more: Whats in the White Houses opioid emergency declaration and whats not Trump said that his administration would announce a new policy that would overcome the rule, suggesting officials would focus on granting waivers that allow states to expand treatment options.The Obama administration in 2015 started offering waivers that states could apply for so larger clinics get reimbursed, and at least four states have received waivers to improve access to treatment.Trump seemed to suggest that his administrations policy would be focused on expediting the process.Those approvals will come very, very fast, Trump said.Changing the policy entirely which is known as the IMD exclusion would take congressional action.While clearly overturning it may not be in the scope of what the executive branch can do, laying out a clear vision for how waivers could be used to improve the system on a state-by-state basis would be a significant and welcome improvement, Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, wrote in an email to STAT after Trumps address.There are some concerns that in-patient treatment should not always be prioritized, and that treatment in such facilities takes people out of their communities, which can provide a stable source of support for people embarking on recovery.Many advocates who favor changing Medicaid rules have also noted that Trumps administration has backed cutting and reshaping Medicaid in a way that would lead to fewer people having coverage overall.Prescriber training Trump said he would require prescribers who work for the federal government to receive, finally, special training for prescribing opioids.Its not clear what sort of education campaign Trump is envisioning, but the Obama administration in 2015 also announced a training program in opioid prescribing for prescribers who worked for the federal government.Pain treatment Federal health officials are going to launch a task force to come up with best practices for treating pain, Trump announced.This speaks to something that is often lost when discussing the opioid epidemic: There are still lots of patients who need pain medication, and there are some concerns that because of new prescribing limits and the fear of feeding addiction, they are not able to get access to them.Whatever best practices the task force comes up with will likely be scrutinized by advocates both for pain patients who worry about not being able to get medication they feel they need and those who support stronger prescribing limits.(At the event, Trump highlighted CVS Caremarks recent announcement that it was imposing prescription limits for first-time opioid prescriptions.)Bad actors Trump said the federal government will pretty soon start suing bad actors, including people and companies that are hurting our people.He offered no specific, but dozens of cities, counties, and states have filed lawsuits against drug makers and drug distributors for their alleged roles in seeding the opioid crisis.Public education Trump said its really, really easy not to use drugs if you never start and suggested public education would be an important strategy for the government.He told the story of his brother Fred, who struggled with alcoholism and died in his 40s from complications of the disease; Freds life instilled in Trump the commitment to never drink and never smoke.But thats also an explanation that overlooks how some people become addicted to opioids.Although the epidemic is increasingly being driven by heroin and the illicit use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, many people developed addictions after being prescribed opioids by their doctors for legitimate pain treatment a fact that first lady Melania Trump highlighted as she told stories of people she had met has she has learned more about the epidemic.Those people did not have a choice to, as Trump said, not to take drugs, just not to take them.Meanwhile, Trumps opioid commission, led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, is set to release its final recommendations on Nov. 1.Trump said he will move to implement appropriate recommendations.
Study finds arsenic, BPA and lead in baby food products:::::A study which looked at hundreds of baby food products found that 65 percent of the items tested positive for the dangerous chemical element arsenic, according to the Clean Label Project.The nonprofit group, which describes itself as "focused on health and transparency in consumer products," said that it had completed a study of 500 infant formulas and baby food products from 60 brands.The report said that other harmful chemicals were found in baby food products.BABY BORN WITH VOCAL CORDS FUSED TOGETHER SAYS 'DADA' FOR FIRST TIME According to the Clean Label Project, 36 percent of the items it examined tested positive for lead, 58 percent tested positive for cadmium, and 10 percent tested positive for acrylamides, a potentially toxic chemical compound.Almost 80 percent of infant formulas also tested positive for arsenic, the group said.Researchers also found that 60 percent of BPA-free products actually tested positive for Bisphenol A, also known as BPA."The baby industry needs to do a better job in protecting Americas most vulnerable population," Jaclyn Bowen, the Clean Label Project's executive director, told USA Today.Companies Gerber, Mead Johnson, and Plum Organics have since released statements saying their products follow safety standards, the news outlet reported, noting that the study wasnt published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Baby born with vocal cords fused together says 'dada' for the first time:::::A baby girl born with her vocal cords fused together said "dada" for the first time in a precious clip captured by her parents.Mike and Becca Caputo, both 35, shared footage of daughter Maddie Caputo, 1, after she underwent eight hours of surgery to give her a voice.The tot was born with a narrow airway not much bigger than a straw and a glottic web, meaning her vocal cords were 75 percent fused together.The fused cords meant it would take Maddie all her energy to muster up a squeak and when she laughed or cried all that came out was a raspy, breathy whisper.And her tiny airway meant when she suffered near-fatal septic shock from an infection in April, medics had to use a mini breathing tube meant for preemies to save her.After three weeks fighting for her life in intensive care, Maddie battled back to full health and eventually underwent laryngotracheal reconstruction surgery (LTR) in August.Specialists cut open her airway and sewed in cartilage from between her ribs to make it larger before cutting her vocal cords, giving her the ability to make louder noises.Sixteen days after the operation Maddie said her first word - "dada" - and now the brave youngster is constantly chattering to her parents and brother Andrew, 3.You can tell Maddies voice is different, but she definitely has a voice now," Becca, a nurse in Aurora, Illinois, said.Before the surgery she was using also all her energy to try and make sounds and babble words."When people heard her cry they would say, 'Oh my gosh, does she have croup?'because it sounded like a raspy whisper.It was quiet and weak," she said.Now her cry is louder and she has started forming words.She says 'momma,' 'dada' and 'bye bye.'It was incredible to hear her.It is a miracle for us."Maddie is just amazing," Mike, who works in product management at a software company, said."Maddie is just amazing.She is so resilient.At one point things were looking really bleak, but she fought on.It is like she has some kind of superpower."9-YEAR-OLD BATTLING BRAIN CANCER SERENADES FELLOW PATIENTS DURING TREATMENT The doctors said she will probably always have a little hoarseness to her voice but otherwise she will be able to talk and that is all we care about," he said.Maddie was born healthy in October 2016, but in the weeks following the birth, Becca and Mike noticed she had a quiet, hoarse cry.Doctors put a camera down her nose to look into her throat and discovered that her vocal cords were fused and that the area between them was abnormally narrow.Medics tried to cut the cords when she was four months old but could not operate because her vocal cord gland was too thick - so would close back up again.They planned a more complex surgery for a few months down the line, when Maddie would be older and stronger.But in April, she fell ill with an unrelated urine infection and was rushed to hospital where medics battled to save her life after she went into septic shock.The team had to call in specialist anaesthetists to fit her with a tiny breathing tube which is typically used for premature babies because her airway was so small.They saved her life that day.It was very scary," Becca said.Somehow she didnt have any brain or organ damage long term," Mike said."She didnt miss a beat.Maddie spent three weeks in the ICU before returning home and eventually had the LTR surgery at Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago in August.After three weeks of recovery she was back to her normal self - plus a brand new voice.Maddie is now racing around the house, getting into trouble, pointing and yelling at things and talking all the time, Becca said.You would look at her and never know anything of what she went through."I get choked up when I think about what the doctors did for Maddie," he said."They saved her."Dr Jonathan Ida, an otolaryngologist who treated Maddie at Lurie Childrens Hospital, said Maddie is recovering beautifully.Without repair, her voice would have continued to be high-pitched, strained, and weak," Ida said.Although it will likely never be completely 'normal' in tone due to the web and its repair, she should have an adequate voice as she grows."We continue to monitor airway reconstruction patients for years to ensure the grafted cartilage is continuing to grow with the child, so the ultimate outcome cannot be determined yet," he said.As of now, however, Maddie is on track to do very well.
'Dancing with the dead' ritual could help plague spread in Madagascar:::::The current plague outbreak in Madagascar has killed more than 100 people, and officials say that a centuries-old tradition may increase the risk of further spread, according to news reports.The tradition, called "famadihana" in Malagasy, is sometimes referred to as "dancing with the dead," "the turning of the bones" or "body turning," according to Newsweek.It involves exhuming the bodies of the dead, rewrapping them in fresh cloth and then dancing with the wrapped corpses before returning the remains to their graves.The tradition is practiced in the central region of the island nation, on the country's high plateaus.But removing infected bodies from graves poses a threat.WALGREENS TO BEGIN STOCKING NARCAN IN PHARMACIES NATIONWIDE "If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opned for a famadihana, the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body," Willy Randriamarotia, the chief of staff in Madagascar's health ministry, told the Agence France-Presse (AFP), an international news organization.The plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.The most common form of the disease is the bubonic plague; it occurs when Y. pestis gets into the body and travels to the lymph nodes.These lymph nodes become inflamed, and are referred to as "buboes," the World Health Organization says.If the bubonic plague goes untreated, the bacteria can spread to the lungs, causing pneumonic plague.This form of the disease can be spread through the air, the WHO says.The Malagasy government has issued rules dictating that the bodies of plague victims cannot be buried in tombs that can be reopened.However, local media have reported several instances of such bodies being exhumed covertly, the AFP reported.During a famadihana ceremony in a community located near the country's capital, one woman told the AFP, "I will always practice the turning of the bones of my ancestors plague or no plague.The plague is a lie."Since the outbreak began in August, nearly 1,200 cases of the deadly disease have been reported in the country, according to an Oct. 23 report from the United Nations' humanitarian affairs office and the Malagasy government.Originally published on Live Science.
Puppy that collapsed on walk is saved with overdose antidote:::::A puppy that collapsed after ingesting some sort of opioid in Massachusetts has survived after being given an overdose reversal drug more often administered to humans.Peter Thibault tells The Eagle-Tribune he was walking his 3-month-old yellow Labrador named Zoey in Andover last week when the dog picked up a pack of cigarettes on the ground and soon passed out.He carried her home and when she got worse, Thibault took Zoey to a veterinary hospital.WALGREENS TO BEGIN STOCKING NARCAN IN PHARMACIES NATIONWIDE After hearing the story, a veterinarian administered several doses of naloxone over 12 hours.Veterinarians think Zoey ingested fentanyl because heroin would have likely taken longer to leave her system and would have required more naloxone.The hospital's medical director says it's not the first time they treated a dog for an opioid overdose.
9-year-old battling brain cancer serenades fellow patients during treatment:::::A 9-year-old girl being treated for an aggressive form of brain cancer is bringing joy to patients around her with her love of music.Oliviah Hall, who was diagnosed with Glioblastoma and is receiving treatment at the Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center, has become well-known around the oncology department, Fox 8 reported.She just really brightens up the whole department; everyone here knows her, Allison Ochocki, a radiation and oncology nurse, told the news outlet.Hall, who has undergone 33 radiation therapy sessions as part of her treatment, said she enjoys making people happy.FDA APPROVES INTRAVENOUS VERSION OF TESARO DRUG FOR CHEMOTHERAPY NAUSEA I just feel like Im singing to people and making them really happy; I Just like seeing people, and it feels great singing to them, she told Fox 8.Her songs have worked on 83-year-old Diane Weiss, who said watching her sing helps inspire her to live a happier life.Weiss husband, Benjamin, said Halls songs make his wifes treatments bearable.If she can looking at things in life in spite of the problems she has and look at them in such a positive way, then the adults should also be living that way, Weiss told the news outlet.Hall is now taking a break from treatments while doctors monitor her progress.Her family keeps supporters updated on the "Team Oliviah" Facebook page.
Walgreens to begin stocking Narcan in pharmacies nationwide:::::Walgreens announced on Tuesday that it will begin stocking noloxone, the FDA-approved nasal spray sold under the brand Narcan and used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, in all of its pharmacies nationwide.The pharmacy will also implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to educate patients about Narcan.By stocking Narcan in all of our pharmacies, we are making it easier for families and caregivers to help their loved ones by having it on hand in case it is needed, Rick Gates, Walgreens group vice president of pharmacy, said in a press release.As a pharmacy we are committed to making Narcan more accessible in the communities we serve.TRUMP TO DECLARE OPIOID EPIDEMIC A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY The company has been offering naloxone without requiring a prescription in 45 states since last year, and has also implemented medication disposal kiosks in 600 pharmacies nationwide.It emphasized a willingness to work with the remaining states to make naloxone easier to obtain.Many police departments and first responders across the country are now equipped with Narcan to use when responding to potential overdose calls.Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, with President Trump expected to declare the epidemic a nationwide public health emergency on Thursday.
First test of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children shows dramatic benefit:::::Brain surgery for children whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure-free after one year and can do it without affecting IQ, according to a new Indian study of 116 patients in The New England Journal of Medicine.Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery.Behavior and quality of life also improved.But surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis.The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures."What the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions," senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.FDA APPROVES INTRAVENOUS VERSION OF TESARO DRUG FOR CHEMOTHERAPY NAUSEA Not only "does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective," she said, it demonstrates that surgery "should be done as early as possible" once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.About 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can't control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases."This is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children," said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.He was not involved in the research."The results are impressive," he told Reuters Health by phone.Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures."The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better.It's documentation that these techniques really work."Although 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery.Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time.Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.When all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child's particular brain abnormality.Surgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn't affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures.But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and "that may be too soon to see a noticeable change" in the intelligence quotient.Post-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.The weakness "is significant," Dr. Tripathi said."The child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself.But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months.The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers.They are left with this minor deficit.But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness."Other side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AMONG US ADULTS DECLINING, CDC REPORTS In contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.The surgery "had a transforming effect on how they get along in life," Dr. Tripathi said."Many could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life."But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said."Studies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome," he said."I hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term."
5 early signs of lung cancer you shouldn't ignore:::::You might dismiss lung cancer because you dont smoke or because you live in a less polluted area.However, its important that you understand the early signs of this illness in the event that you or someone you love develops this dangerous disease.According to the American Cancer Society, as many as 20 percent of people with lung cancer were diagnosed as non-smokers.While these patients may have eliminated an important risk, secondhand smoke, environmental factors or gene mutations may have triggered their onset.ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WARNING SIGNS AND PREVENTION In addition, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death as well as one of the most common types of cancers overall.Of new cancers diagnosed each year in the U.S., about 14 percent are lung cancer cases.Important Signs of Lung Cancer With numbers like the ones above, you shouldnt wait around with lung cancer.If you notice any of these 5 common signs of lung cancer, consult your doctor immediately.1.Persistent cough A common cold or other respiratory illness will cause a cough, but only for about a week or two.If your cough keeps going for a month or more, you should get it checked out.Also, let your doctor know if youre getting sick repeatedly, and each illness goes straight to your chest.2.Abnormal breathing or wheezing Patients with lung cancer usually notice a change in breathing.Having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing after activities you normally find easy suggests a problem.10 SIGNS THAT YOUR SNIFFLES ARE A SINUS INFECTION Similarly, dont dismiss wheezing as a symptom of allergies unless your doctor has confirmed it.Wheezing happens when your lungs are constricted or blocked.Check into it, especially if you havent had a recent cold or known allergies.3.Hoarse voice Lung cancer may start pressing on the nerve that controls the larynx.When that happens, you will notice a change in your voice, such as a deepening or hoarseness.You should take note if the change lasts for more than two weeks and let your doctor know about this symptom.4.Unexplained weight loss Have you lost weight without trying recently?Although effortless weight loss might excite you, it could mean a deeper problem and needs your doctors evaluation.Coupled with any of the other symptoms here, the weight loss may directly signify lung cancer.5.Back pain Finally, a lesser known sign of lung cancer is a deep ache in your bones or joints.Many feel this ache in the back or hips, and the pain may worsen overnight with sleeping.Diagnosis: What to Expect The best way for your doctor to screen you for lung cancer is through a low-dose CT scan.A simple X-ray may not catch the disease in its early stages.During the CT scan, an X-ray will scan your body while low doses of radiation will create detailed pictures of your lungs for your doctor.PAY ATTENTION TO THESE EARLY SIGNS OF OVARIAN CANCER If the results of the scan appear abnormal, your doctor may order a tissue sample (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis.He may also recommend a sputum test to see if there are cancer cells there.Then, the next step after diagnosis is determining the extent of the lung cancer.At this point, your doctor may recommend further CT scans, PET scans, bone scans or an MRI to get an accurate analysis.The type of test will depend on your specific situation.Treatment Options Again, your treatment will depend largely on the type and stage of lung cancer as well as your own preferences.For non-small cell lung cancer, your doctor can recommend a variety or combination of treatments: Surgery Doctors will work to remove the cancer and may need to remove tissue or part of the lung in further stages.Specialists often work together in these cases.Expect shortness of breath after any lung surgery.Targeted therapy You may be able to take these drugs alongside chemotherapy.The drugs target abnormalities in cancer cells, and your doctor may need further testing to ensure that the therapy will help.Radiation This method uses high doses of radiation from X-rays or another source to kill cancer cells.Chemotherapy Here, your doctor will give you oral or IV drugs that will kill cancer cells.Chemotherapy is often used in combination with any of the above treatments.For small cell lung cancer, you will probably receive radiation and chemotherapy as your main treatment.In either case, you may also choose to participate in clinical trials.Because of outside factors, lung cancer does happen to both smokers and non-smokers.Although smoking or age may increase your risk, you should stay aware of any early signs of this disease.As with any cancer, treatment proves much easier and faster in the early stages.This article first appeared on AskDrManny.com.
‘Fat but Fit’? The Controversy Continues:::::The bottom line is that metabolically healthy obesity doesnt exist, said Dr. Rishi Caleyachetty, of the College of Medical and Dental Sciences at the University of Birmingham in England, who was the lead author of the paper, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.Obesity is not a benign condition.But critics say the analysis, based on the electronic health records of 3.5 million British patients who were followed from 1995 to 2015, leaves a lot out.Doctors records dont typically capture lifestyle habits, so the study fails to account for the wide-ranging effects of diet.They classify weight status by using body mass index, a formula based on height and weight that doesnt distinguish muscle from fat.Most important, critics say, such analyses dont take fitness level or physical activity into account.Other studies have found a higher rate of heart failure among obese individuals, said Dr. Carl Lavie, the medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and preventive cardiology at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans.But when it comes to coronary heart disease outcomes, studies that take both weight and physical fitness into account have concluded that fitness is more important than fatness, at least for the moderately obese, he said.For the very large number of people who are overweight or mildly obese, I dont think its doomsday if they can keep themselves out of the low fitness level, Dr. Lavie said.Dr. Caleyachetty, the author of the new paper, agreed that the lack of information about fitness and exercise was an important caveat.Those people who are metabolically healthy, obese and vigorously active may have a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, he conceded.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Critics say thats an important message to convey, because many people will find it easier to embark on an exercise regimen and stick with it than to lose weight and maintain the weight loss.I do think thats a better message than telling people, You better not gain weight, Dr. Lavie said.People arent trying to gain weight.Theyre not trying to get to be obese.A better message would be to tell people that if they get themselves to be more physically active, they can improve their prognosis, despite carrying a few extra pounds.Thats a better message, and a more obtainable message.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Jennifer W. Bea, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona Cancer Center who was a co-author of an editorial accompanying the new study, said, we havent heard the whole story yet and questioned whether someone can be obese but metabolically healthy.Obesity itself is a metabolic disorder, Dr. Bea said, noting that being overweight and obese is often associated with low-grade inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease, regardless of metabolic measures.That doesnt mean that weight trumps all.Indeed, the study found that individuals who were considered to be of normal weight but who had a single risk factor such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol were actually at greater risk for coronary heart disease than the healthy obese people.The messaging is always, lose weight no matter what, said Patrick Bradshaw, an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.But when youre at normal weight, youre not given a lot of lifestyle guidance.Your doctor may say exercise and eat right, but if you have these metabolic abnormalities youre at higher risk of disease, and you may need more intensive lifestyle modifications not to lose weight, but to improve health.One of the messages of this new paper is that metabolic health is important regardless of your weight, Dr. Bradshaw said.That goes for people who are considered underweight as well.The new study found, for example, that underweight individuals with no metabolic problems were at higher risk for stroke than normal weight, overweight or obese people with no metabolic problems, and if underweight people had metabolic issues, their risk increased even further.Interestingly, while the risks of being overweight and obese draw scrutiny, doctors are often at a loss to explain the risks of being too thin.
The Battle of Brains vs. Brawn:::::But whether a similar trade-off occurred with our muscles has remained in doubt.Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species early days.With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel.So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn.Did one take precedence over the other?If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them.The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember.This was their mental task.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task.Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump.The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource, which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.And the brain won.The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly.The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues.They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical, he says.An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human.This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.More humbly, the results also indicate that intense workouts may not be the optimal time to compose your next epic poem or calculate tax withholding.
C.D.C. Panel Recommends a New Shingles Vaccine:::::Once a person has had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue.Years later, it may reactivate as shingles.The C.D.C.estimates that about one million cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.This is what weve been waiting for, said Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an expert in the disease.Shingles is an unappreciated and common cause of severe problems throughout the nervous system.Dr. Oaklander said that while rash symptoms lead some people to consider shingles as minor as a bad sunburn, the illness can cause strokes, encephalitis, spinal cord damage and loss of vision.Photo Given in one dose, Zostavax had shown a 51 percent reduction in shingles and a 67 percent reduction in nerve pain.Shingrix is given in two doses, and the company said clinical trials showed it to be about 98 percent effective for one year and about 85 percent over three years.By preventing shingles, the vaccine also drastically reduces the overall incidence of severe nerve pain, a lasting complication for about one in three people who get shingles.GlaxoSmithKline said it tested the vaccine in more than 38,000 people.We believe Shingrix will provide confidence in the protection one can expect from a shingles vaccine, said Luc Debruyne, the companys president of global vaccines.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The recommendation of the advisory committee will be considered an endorsement of Shingrix over Zostavax, although the closeness of the committee vote, 8 to 7, may mitigate the market loss for Merck.Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer in the C.D.C.s division of viral disease, said she expected the agencys final recommendation to be issued early next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Shingrix vaccine has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles and its complications, Dr. Dooling said.She cautioned, however, that more people had adverse reactions to Shingrix than to Zostavax, including fever and muscle aches.Patients and health care providers should be aware that this vaccine is very effective, but it also causes more reactions than they may be used to with other adult vaccines, she said.All indications are these are not dangerous to ones health, but they may interfere with your daily activities for a few days.GlaxoSmithKline said its new vaccine would cost about $280 and would be available next month.Zostavax costs about $223.
Thinking on Your Feet:::::Photo Health experts widely agree that most of us should sit less, especially at work.Prolonged sitting has been linked with higher risks for diabetes and heart disease, among other conditions.While treadmill and standing desks have grown in popularity, they provide a clear impact on our health but perhaps not on our work itself.We know that most people type better when they sit still than when they stand up or move about.But do they also think better?Most studies of prolonged sitting have looked at the benefits from breaking up sitting time on blood sugar and blood pressure.For an innovative new study published recently in The Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, researchers at Arizona State University in Phoenix recruited nine sedentary, overweight men and women and asked them to show up at a simulated office space at the university.During one visit, the volunteers sat continuously for eight hours (apart from bathroom breaks), while using a computer and talking on the phone, as if it were any workday.Twice during the day, they also completed computerized measures of many thinking skills, including working memory and decision making.Then, during three other faux workdays, the volunteers broke up their sitting time by variously standing, walking at a treadmill desk or pedaling a modified stationary bicycle placed beneath their desks for at least 10 minutes once an hour.The exercise was gentle a walking pace of one mile per hour or comparable effort while pedaling and the volunteers typed and chatted during these breaks.They also repeated the tests of thinking twice each day, immediately after standing or exercising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The researchers had wondered whether standing or exercising might impair the ability to concentrate and think, much as it did with typing proficiency, says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise and health promotion at Arizona State who oversaw the study.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Instead, the exercise breaks substantially improved scores on the tests of the kinds of thinking skills that help people perform their jobs well.Immediately after standing or moving for 10 minutes or more, the volunteers performed better on all the tests of thinking, compared with when they were sitting all day and the gains were greatest after they pedaled their under-desk bikes.Gaesser says that the physical and mental arousal that occurs when people end their seated stillness and stroll, pedal or stand up improves attention, memory and other cognitive skills.He also speculates that because the volunteers had never before cycled at work, the novelty of that activity amplified its stimulative effects and impact on thinking.
To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient:::::But now Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead are testing a new, experimental technique one that some in the field are eager to learn, but that others regard warily, questioning its long-term safety for the fetus.The surgeons had made a wide incision in the mothers lower abdomen, gently lifted out her uterus still attached internally and made two tiny, 4-millimeter slits.In one, they inserted a fetoscope, a small telescope fitted with a camera, light and grasping tool.The second slit was for other miniature instruments.Lit from within, the uterus glowed, red and magical in the darkened room.Spina bifida occurs early, at three to four weeks of pregnancy, when the tissue forming the spinal column should fold into a tube but does not close properly.There are 1,500 to 2,000 cases a year in the United States.Photo The causes are not fully understood, but in some cases a deficiency in the B-vitamin folic acid plays a role, which is why supplements are recommended for pregnant women and the vitamin is added to grain and cereal products.Introducing prenatal surgery for spina bifida was a bold step.In the early days, doctors were so worried about risk that they operated only for conditions that would be fatal if left unrepaired; if the surgery did harm, it would be to a fetus that would have died anyway.Spina bifida is generally not fatal, so the standard practice was to operate after birth.But the results of postnatal surgery were mixed: most children could not walk and had other problems.Doctors began to suspect that outcomes might be better if they could fix the defect before birth.Some of the spinal damage is caused by amniotic fluid, which turns increasingly toxic to the exposed nerve tissue as the pregnancy progresses and the fetus passes more and more wastes into the fluid.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Surgeons thought that if the opening could be closed before birth, sealing out the fluid, some of the nerve damage might be averted.They began operating in the 1990s, but it was not clear the surgery was helping.A landmark study published in 2011 found that for carefully selected fetuses prenatal surgery was better than operating after birth.The percentage of children who could walk independently rose to 40 percent from 20 percent, and the need for a shunt was cut in half, to 40 percent from 82 percent.The percent who benefit, I wish it was higher, Dr. Whitehead said, adding that so far prenatal surgery does not seem to help with bladder incontinence, and most children with spina bifida need catheters to pass urine.The ideal time for the surgery is from 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy, Dr. Belfort said early enough to prevent some nerve damage, but late enough so that the baby has a decent chance of surviving and doing well if something goes wrong and it has to be delivered.Prenatal Surgery for Spina Bifida Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spinal column does not close properly during the earliest stages of fetal development.In some cases, surgery on the fetus may reduce the severity of the condition.EMBRYO A groove along the embryos back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will fill with the brain and spinal column.But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida.Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Back Gap DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.Gap Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Gap Back Gap EMBRYO A groove along the embryos back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will be filled with the brain and spinal column.But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida.DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.His patient, Lexi Royer, 28, and her husband, Joshuwa, 29, were high-school sweethearts who had always wanted children.But Mrs. Royer had health problems that doctors said made pregnancy unlikely.She had one miscarriage and then did not conceive again.So the couple were thrilled in May to discover that she was pregnant.During an ultrasound exam at 13 weeks, they saw their son for the first time.There were a lot of happy tears, Mrs. Royer said.Then the ultrasound tech said she had to go back and get the doctor.A wrenching series of tests and visits to specialists followed.With each one, the news got worse.The defect was big and severe, and the brain stem was being pulled down into the spinal column.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It sounded like we were looking at brain damage, feeding tubes, a breathing tube, a wheelchair, just a bad quality of life, Mrs. Royer said.Termination was offered as an option, and Mrs. Royer felt that doctors were pushing it.But this might be their only chance to have a child.They wanted to learn more about their sons condition.Mrs. Royer, a hairdresser, and her husband, a firefighter and emergency medical technician, turned to the internet and discovered Facebook groups for parents of children with spina bifida.Some reported good results from a procedure that doctors in their home city, San Diego, had never even heard of: fetoscopic surgery.In early September, they went to Houston for two days of testing.The results confirmed that their son had a severe spinal defect, but still gave them hope.
U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico:::::Some device and supply companies have already begun limiting shipments of certain items from the island, ranging from mesh for repairing hernias to surgical scalpels and tools used in orthopedic surgery.On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies statements that their plants were back in operation: We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production, Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday.In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less.We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.Photo In a recent interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he was worried that if conditions dont improve, more shortages of both drugs and medical devices might follow by early next year.Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A.has said.I dont think weve dealt with a situation where weve had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities, Dr. Gottlieb said.So far, we have been able to mitigate these issues, but its been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and theres been close calls.Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A.is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices.Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria.We here at Vizient had an aha moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico, she said.Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldnt rule out intermittent shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere.Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V.drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products.Soon after the storm, Johnson & Johnson Vision informed customers that a product used in cataract surgery might go into short supply, according to Vizient.A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said production of the product has resumed, but that it has not yet been shipped from Puerto Rico.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The F.D.A.has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island.Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair.Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly.Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said.With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives, said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madisons health system.We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.Photo Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A.had allowed it to import bags from the companys factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming.The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers use.While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time, the company said in a statement.Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months.This is a big deal for hospitals across the country, said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic.Were really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use.We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients, said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic.The impact has rippled throughout the clinics normal operations.Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV known as an IV push take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs.And the method is not appropriate for some drugs.This has repercussions, Mr. Knoer said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error.If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed.It is a predicament that is all too familiar.While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nations hospital system for years.The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins.In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane.Its like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they havent been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolinas Smoky Mountains.Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon.With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages it may only be the beginning.
Iowa Withdraws Request to Leave Obamacare Market:::::Critics said approving the Iowa waiver would have paved the way for other states to follow, eroding the health laws protections for low- and middle-income Americans.Some had planned on filing a legal challenge if the Trump administration had said yes to the request, known as a state innovation waiver.This is a case of the laws guardrails protecting people and their coverage, said Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that had opposed the waiver.Hopefully now Iowa can start looking at more practical and less disruptive solutions to deal with the challenges in its market.The Washington Post reported recently that President Trump in August had asked Seema Verma, the federal official in charge of reviewing Iowas plan, to reject it.Some supporters of the law saw that as a deliberate effort to keep premiums high; Mr. Trump frequently cites sharply rising premiums as proof that the health law is failing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Ms. Reynolds said the Trump administration had worked with Iowa to the greatest extent possible to get the waiver approved.The health law allows such waivers only if a state proves the alternative coverage will be as comprehensive and affordable, covers a comparable number of people and does not increase the federal deficit.Last week, the administration informed the state that its plan would likely increase the federal deficit, but that it would take several weeks to figure out by how much.That, Ms. Reynolds said, prompted her to withdraw the request.In a joint statement with Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Verma echoed Mr. Trumps contempt for the 2010 law, calling it unaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.The individual insurance market is particularly fragile in Iowa, partly because the state has allowed tens of thousands of healthy people to keep old plans that do not comply with the health law.Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the states most popular insurer, are both withdrawing at the end of the year.The only insurer remaining in Iowas Affordable Care Act marketplace for next year, Medica, is seeking premium increases that average 56 percent, blaming Mr. Trumps decision to stop paying subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions that lower many peoples deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.Most Iowa customers will not feel the increase, however, because they qualify for premium subsidies that will rise to cover it.But state officials have predicted that most of the 28,000 people who receive no subsidies will cancel their coverage.So far, the Trump administration has granted state innovation waivers to three states, Alaska, Minnesota, and Oregon; they will use federal money to help insurers cover the claims of their most expensive customers next year, with the intent of lowering premiums.Oklahoma abruptly withdrew a similar request last month one that state officials said would have reduced premiums by an average of 30 percent saying that the Trump administration had been too slow to approve it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The administration on Monday also deemed a similar waiver request from Massachusetts incomplete and said there would not be enough time for the state to put in place a so-called reinsurance program for 2018.
Underweight Women at Risk of Early Menopause:::::Photo Underweight women are at increased risk for early menopause, a new study has found.This study, in Human Reproduction, followed 78,759 premenopausal women ages 25 to 42 beginning in 1989.Over the following 22 years, 2,804 of them reported natural menopause before age 45.After controlling for smoking, pregnancies, oral contraceptive use and other factors, they found that compared with women who had a body mass index of 18.5 to 22.4 (within the normal range), those with a B.M.I.under 18.5 at any age had a 30 percent increased risk of early menopause.Overweight women (B.M.I.25 to 34.9) had a slightly lower risk of early menopause, and there was no significant increased risk in very obese women with a B.M.I.higher than 35.The lead author, Kathleen L. Szegda, who was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, when the work was done, said the reasons for the link between weight and the timing of menopause are unclear and that more research is needed to replicate these results.Still, she said, Underweight women may want to discuss the findings with their doctors.Early menopause is associated with several health conditions, including osteoporosis, dementia, heart disease and early death, and has implications for family planning.
How Fiction Becomes Fact on Social Media:::::Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum a cultural hack, in the words of one expert.Yet the psychology behind social media platforms the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think theyre immune to being duped.For all the suspicions about social media companies motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.Skepticism of online news serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected meme.At a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, Facebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences, said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Timess Upshot column).For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, People have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own.What its actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site.Its curating news and information that will keep you watching.That kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as meme, or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms.The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).Advertisement Continue reading the main story For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or information cocoons is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite.Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.But they dont have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests.Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth mutations find psychological traction, then go viral.There is no precise formula for such digital catnip.The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.Photo My experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them, Mr. McKinney said.Theyre just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard at the source.Digital social networks are dangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct, Dr. Nyhan said.One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: The networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers ability to check it.Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The extent to which Facebook and other platforms function as marketers of misinformation, similar to the way they market shoes and makeup, is contentious.In 2015, a trio of behavior scientists working at Facebook inflamed the debate in a paper published in the prominent journal Science.The authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that individuals choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to contrary news and commentary than Facebooks own algorithmic ranking which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief.Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated facts as possibly true.A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: Was Obama a Muslim?I seem to remember that....In a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if its a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And, as salespeople have known forever, people tend to value the information and judgments offered by good friends over all other sources.Its a psychological tendency with significant consequences now that nearly two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media.Your social alliances affect how you weight information, said Dr. Seifert.We overweight information from people we know.The casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally its hard work.Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.If I didnt have direct evidence that all these theories were wrong from the scanner, Mr. McKinney said, I might have taken them a little more seriously.
The Opioid Crisis: An Epidemic Years in the Making:::::Advertisement The Opioid Crisis: An Epidemic Years in the Making Image Examining the body of a woman who died of an overdose in August.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times The current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history.Overdoses, fueled by opioids, are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50 years old killing roughly 64,000 people last year, more than guns or car accidents, and doing so at a pace faster than the H.I.V.epidemic did at its peak.President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday.Administration officials expect the directive to quickly lead to crucial changes, which have the potential to help rural areas ravaged by opioid use, where doctors are often in short supply.The New York Times has been covering the outbreak from when it started bubbling up in towns around the United States years ago to now, as it decimates communities and families.Here is a roundup of our best reporting on the epidemic, including short answers to hard questions about it.Snapshots of a Public Health Crisis A team of reporters went inside the epidemic, from New England to safe injection areas in the Pacific Northwest, to explore the experiences of addicts and those trying to stem the tide.I dont know how Im alive, honestly, one Massachusetts woman said.Here are their stories .Image Even babies are affected by the crisis, with a surge of newborns dependent on opioids.Credit Ty Wright for The New York Times The youngest members of society have not been exempt from the crisis.Toddlers and young children are increasingly being found unconscious or dead after consuming an adults drugs, and a surge of opioid-dependent newborns has forced doctors to rethink treatment .And images and videos of children with adults who have overdosed have been shared, as recently as Thursday in Florida .The Numbers Our reporters have been deciphering and providing context to masses of data about the many and varied ways opioids are affecting Americans.Image How overdose deaths rippled across the United States.Credit Haeyoun Park and Matthew Bloch/The New York Times Illustrated in a series of maps , heres how overdose deaths rippled across the United States from 1999 to 2014, along with a breakdown of the large concentration of deaths in regions like Appalachia and the Southwest.This interactive quiz aims to provide a deeper understanding of the mounting toll by asking readers to compare drug overdose deaths with other causes of death.Video Its the deadliest drug crisis in American history.It kills about 90 Americans every day.Here are answers to some key questions about the crisis.The governments account of drug deaths in 2016 was the first national data to break down the growth by drug and by state, which revealed that deaths involving synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyls, had risen 540 percent in just three years .While Mr. Trump fulfilled his vow to add urgency to the rapidly escalating opioid problem, his declaration falls short of the national emergency declaration he had pledged.These are the 28 currently active national emergencies .Health Care Drug companies and doctors have been accused of fueling the opioid crisis, but insurers may also be playing a role by making it easier to get opioids than the drugs that treat addiction to them.Here are the findings of our analysis .Image A patient had to begin taking a hydrocodone, an opioid, to treat her pain after her insurer changed what it covered.Credit Kevin D.

Rath, a former associate director of the naval laboratory, said, Isabella Karle took the task of deciphering the theory to provide not only a solution but also to show that it could be used to solve very complex molecules, such as proteins.Other scientists took notice in the mid-1960s.With a clearer picture of the structure of biological molecules, drug researchers now have a much better idea of the chemistry going on inside the body and how to formulate drugs to treat illnesses.After I found some structures that no one could have dreamt of solving before, it started to get a lot of attention, Dr. Karle told The New York Times in 2013.When Jerome Karle and Dr. Hauptman were awarded the Nobel for their work in 1985, Jerome Karle was deeply disappointed that his wife was not also honored.He wanted to not accept it, Ms. Hanson said, and she told him, Go ahead, thats silly, you should accept it.Photo Isabella Helen Lugoski was born in Detroit on Dec. 2, 1921, the daughter of Polish immigrants.Her father, Zygmunt Lugoski, worked for the citys transportation system.Her mother, the former Elizabeth Graczyk, ran a restaurant eventually with Isabellas help.My mother realized fairly early that I like numbers, Dr. Karle recalled in an interview in 2015.I soon became the accountant, so to speak.Fresh meat was delivered every day, and the butcher left the bill that had to be paid once a week.So once a week I added up all the numbers of the money that was owed him.She skipped a couple of grades in elementary school.Later, she learned she would need to take a science class in high school to attend a university.By whim, she said, she chose chemistry, and the teacher, a woman, sparked her passion for the subject.(Her father was initially disappointed.He had hoped she would be a lawyer, as he had wanted to be.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story She attended Wayne University (now Wayne State University) in Detroit for a semester before obtaining a four-year scholarship to the University of Michigan, where she received her bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees, all before she turned 23.She met her husband while an undergraduate: The spaces in the physical chemistry laboratory were assigned in alphabetical order, so Karle was seated next to Lugoski.I walked into the physical chemistry laboratory and theres a young man in the desk next to mine with his apparatus all set up running his experiment, Dr. Karle said.I dont think I was very polite about it.I asked him how did he get in here early and have everything all set up.He didnt like that.So we didnt talk to each other for a while.Eventually, they did talk again.They married in 1942.Both worked in Chicago on the Manhattan Project, the government effort during World War II to develop an atomic bomb.Isabella Karle developed processes to synthesize plutonium chloride out of lumps of impure plutonium oxide.The Karles moved to the Naval Research Laboratory after the war and stayed there until both retired on the same day in July 2009.Jerome Karle died in 2013.In addition to her daughter Louise, Dr. Karle is survived by two other daughters, Jean Karle Dean and Madeleine Karle Tawney; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Isabella Karle published more than 350 papers.She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.In 1993, the Franklin Institute presented her with the Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science, and in 1995 she received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in a White House ceremony.Dr. Rath, who supervised Dr. Karles work in Washington, said that her renown within the scientific community was so wide that when scientists from around the world visited the Naval Research Laboratory, they would very often make one request.They all wanted to see Isabella, he said.
The Facts on America's Opioid Epidemic:::::Its the deadliest drug crisis in American history.It kills about 90 Americans every day.Here are answers to some key questions about the crisis.
Why Doing Good Is Good for the Do-Gooder:::::Why is the first instinct for many to volunteer and donate after a natural disaster?One reason is that as humans weve evolved to survive in groups, not alone.Rallying together makes us feel less alone in the experience, explained the sociologist Christine Carter, a fellow at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley.When our survival is threatened, we are going to reach out and strengthen our connections with people around us.We show generosity.We show compassion.We show gratitude.These are all emotions that function to connect us with each other, Dr. Carter said.Scientific evidence supports the idea that acts of generosity can be beneficial when we volunteer and give back regularly and not just after a natural disaster.Volunteering is linked to health benefits like lower blood pressure and decreased mortality rates.Dr. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has been studying the effects of positive emotions, such as compassion and kindness, on the brain since the 1990s.He said the brain behaves differently during an act of generosity than it does during a hedonistic activity.When we do things for ourselves, those experiences of positive emotions are more fleeting.They are dependent on external circumstances, he said.When we engage in acts of generosity, those experiences of positive emotion may be more enduring and outlast the specific episode in which we are engaged.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Helping others also gives us a sense of purpose.Dr. Linda Fried co-founded Experience Corps, a program that engages retirees as literacy tutors, after she discovered a strong association between a sense of purpose and well-being throughout life.Older adults who volunteered to help children with reading and writing tended to experience less memory loss and maintain greater physical mobility, one study suggested.Giving back is a fundamental teaching of many religions.Jesus had the Golden Rule.Buddha said in order to brighten ones own path, one must light the path of others.During a trip to India in 2016, I experienced firsthand how the benefits of doing good are well established in Indian society.I paid a visit to a Vedic astrologer because I was anxious about an uncertain future, my own personal crisis, and received a list of prescriptions to help others to get through it.The first task was to buy a black-and-white checkered blanket, then visit a local leper colony and donate it to the first person I saw.My next task was to buy a six-pound bag of lentils, circle it around my head, chant a Sanskrit mantra and give it to a homeless person.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Certainly, many Westerners would roll their eyes at these unconventional prescriptions, but they were familiar to my Indian friends, who believe they hold real power.Later, to better understand the significance of the rituals, I reached out to Dr. Deepak Chopra, author of You Are the Universe.He said the philosophical underpinnings in India come from the Vedas and Buddhist traditions, where all human suffering is a result of the hallucination of the separate self.Dr. Chopra explained: The moment you identify yourself as separate from other beings, or other people, or separate from life in general then you will suffer.And it all begins with initial anxiety because when youre disconnected from people and life, you feel fear, and that creates the beginning of suffering.Would Western doctors ever prescribe acts of generosity?Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, doesnt rule it out.We have sufficient scientific information to justify a very significant public health initiative, he said.If there were a retiree in my office I would ask them, Do you smoke?Do you exercise?What is your diet like?I should also be asking them if they volunteer.
The More Lavish the Gifts to Doctors, the Costlier the Drugs They Prescribe:::::Photo When drug companies give gifts to doctors, the doctors prescribe more and more expensive drugs.The more lavish the gifts, the greater the effect.Researchers used data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services on the prescriptions written by doctors in Washington, and information from the D.C. Department of Health on gifts from pharmaceutical and medical device companies given to providers in 2013.The study, in PLOS One, found that 39.1 percent of prescribers received gifts ranging in value from $7 to $200,000, while the rest received none.Health care providers given gifts wrote an average of 892 prescriptions compared with 389 for those who accepted none.The average cost of a prescription was $135 for gift recipients and $85 for the others.Gift recipients chose the brand-name drug a third of the time, compared with a quarter of the time for non- recipients.Any gift was associated with higher cost prescriptions, but the larger gifts had an even greater effect.Those who received gifts worth more than $500 during the year averaged $189 per prescription.The senior author, Dr. Adriane J. Fugh-Berman, director of PharmedOut, a project on drug prescribing based at Georgetown University Medical Center, had some straightforward advice for patients.You shouldnt see doctors who see drug reps, she said.Less than a minute of talking to a drug rep will increase prescribing of brand-name drugs.
Arsenic Reductions in Drinking Water Tied to Fewer Cancer Deaths:::::Photo The Environmental Protection Agencys revised rule on arsenic contamination in drinking water has resulted in fewer lung, bladder and skin cancers.In 2006, the E.P.A.reduced the arsenic maximum in public water systems to 10 milligrams per liter, from the previous level of 50 milligrams.The rule does not apply to private wells.Using data from a continuing nationwide health survey, researchers compared urinary arsenic levels in 2003, before the new rule went into effect, with those in 2014, after it had been fully implemented.There were 14,127 participants in the study, and the scientists adjusted for arsenic contributions from tobacco and dietary sources.The report is in Lancet Public Health.They found a 17 percent reduction in arsenic levels among those using public water systems.The researchers estimate that the new rule resulted in 200 to 900 fewer lung and bladder cancers and 50 fewer skin cancers annually.The senior author, Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, a professor of environmental health sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said that water treatment to remove arsenic is expensive and a challenge for smaller cities.We are trying to provide information in a way thats useful for policymakers, she said.If we could eliminate arsenic entirely, it would be ideal.But we have to be realistic.
Lights, Camera and, Yes, Music: Reporting From the Operating Room as Doctors Perform Fetal Surgery:::::I learned about this one when I contacted Dr. Belfort about a YouTube video in which he described the need for tiny tools to operate on fetuses.Hes got a book full of his own detailed drawings a cross between Leonardo and Rube Goldberg of instruments he wants made.In our conversation he mentioned spina bifida surgery, and I wanted to see it.Permission was not immediate: Doctors, patients and hospital officials had to consent.Once they agreed, a public relations person was assigned to accompany me and a photographer in the operating room.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before the operation started, one of the surgeons who would assist, Dr. Oluyinka O. Olutoye, shared a sobering thought about the potential risks of performing surgery on two patients at once.Fetal surgery, he said, is one of the few operations with a 200 percent risk of mortality.Operating rooms are usually kept cool, almost chilly.But not for fetal surgery.If the temperature is too low, the fetuss heartbeat can slow down too much, so this operating room was pretty hot.When the photographer, Batrice de Ga, and I were changing into scrubs in the womens locker room, a nurse warned, Its going to be like a sauna in there.It was crowded, too.Besides Dr. Belfort and a pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. William Whitehead, there were two anesthesiologists, a pediatric cardiologist and two doctors who would steady the uterus and help to gently hold the fetus in position, as well as several nurses.For reporters in the operating room, the job is to see whats going on, stay out of the way and not touch or even get near anything draped in blue, which is the sterile stuff.Its O.K.to look over the surgeons shoulders as long as you dont brush their gowns.And the reporter has to stay out of the photographs, too.In this case there were amazing views of the surgery, on three flat screens that showed images from the camera inside the uterus.Because the doctors were operating through the tiny slits, they needed those images to see what they were doing.People often ask if Ive ever felt sick or faint in an operating room.So far, no: Whats going on is invariably so interesting, and Im so caught up in trying to understand it, that squeamishness just doesnt happen.I dont like the smell: Surgeons seem to cauterize everything they cut, and burning flesh has an acrid odor, but either it doesnt last or my nose gets used to it.At 9:28 that Tuesday morning, the soft Pandora music had moved on from Eric Church to Neil Youngs Harvest Moon, and he was singing, I want to see you dance again, as Mrs. Royers son came into view.He seemed to be kneeling inside her womb; we could see his bottom and the soles of his feet, impossibly small.Photo The operation was an endurance test for the surgeons.They stood shoulder to shoulder for hours, hands and arms in the air as they worked through the slits, painstakingly snipping tissue, stretching it over the open spine and stitching it shut to make a watertight seal.The spinal defect was so big that there seemed barely enough skin to cover it, and it was painful to watch it being tugged into place.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The room was so hot that I took off a gown Id been given to put over my scrubs, and I found a chair to sit in periodically, to give my legs a break.There were no breaks for the surgeons.Israel Kamakawiwoole was singing Over the Rainbow as the last stitch went into the fetus.By noon, the surgeons were done.I sweat like hell, Dr. Belfort said, peeling his gloves off pale waterlogged hands that looked as if theyd spent too long in the bath.Mrs. Royers husband, Joshuwa, his mother and Mrs. Royers parents were waiting anxiously, and crowded into a small room when Dr. Belfort arrived.Everything went very well, so you can relax, he said, showing them pictures of the fetuss back, before and after.So far, so good.Now we have to hope and pray she doesnt go into preterm labor.Mr. Royer was stoic, but the parents, the reporter and the photographer all burst into tears and hugged one another.Later, Mrs. Royers mother, Raquel Bourgeois, said the family understood that the operation was not a cure, and that her grandson would almost certainly have some degree of disability.But were strong believers in God, and were at peace, Mrs. Bourgeois said.This baby is going to be so loved.We just dont care.She went on: Lexi and Josh are very strong together.This is not going to break them.They are the best possible parents for this child in this situation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am wishing the best for Mrs. and Mr. Royer and their son, and I hope to report on how theyre all doing after hes born.
The Symptoms of Protracted Dying:::::We can place a long-term breathing tube in her neck and a feeding tube in her stomach, I said, but there are no cases in the medical literature of someone like her living independently again.The best we could hope for is a life of near-complete dependence.When we first came to the hospital, doctors told us my mom might be brain-dead, one of Geraldines daughters countered.Now, she takes breaths on her own sometimes.Shes already improving.Just as Geraldine was stubborn and exceptional in life, her family believed she would be exceptional in beating her prognosis.It might be different if my mom was 70 or 80, her daughter went on, but shes only 56.For Geraldines family, the immediate fear of watching her die outweighed the unfamiliar pain of sustaining her on machines and watching her disappear in a long-term care facility.Our medical team had seen hundreds of people like Geraldine, most of whom returned to the hospital month after month to manage complications of immobility.Sparse cases of recoveries were overwhelmed by painful, expensive, drawn-out deaths, ones we would never wish for ourselves or our own families.But for Geraldines family, every decision was new.For them, nobody was like Geraldine.In every other part of medicine, doctors make recommendations for medications, lifestyle changes and surgeries.We dont offer cancer patients six different chemotherapy regimens and ask them to weigh the pros and cons.Yet when it comes to end-of-life decisions, doctors are terrified of violating patient autonomy.We are scared of our own medical opinions.Instead of saying, I recommend..., we often offer a platter of life-prolonging measures, most of which are unlikely to improve a patients quality of life, but which offer the possibility of hope.The patients heart will still beat.Her personality will be gone, but her chest will still rise and collapse.Families see an opportunity for loss to be delayed, perhaps even dodged.Then we are surprised when they take us up on the offer to prolong dying.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think she would want more time to try and recover, Geraldines daughter said.So we kept Geraldine alive.A plastic breathing tube sprouted from her neck and a feeding tube with peach-colored formula buried itself in her stomach.In the hospital, Geraldines family learned the common complications of immobility: infection, blood clots and bedsores.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.When the infection started, a fever sounded the alarm.We counted the possible causes.Geraldine had a breathing tube in her windpipe, a feeding tube in her stomach and an IV line in her neck, each an access road for bacteria.Lying in bed put her at risk for pneumonia and urinary tract infections.Like mosquitoes in standing water, infections proliferate when the body is still.Geraldines blood clots werent a surprise.Medical students are inculcated with the famous triad of conditions that predispose patients to clots, and Geraldine had all of them.Her body was inflamed and torn from the heart attack, infections and procedures that caused her blood vessels to release molecules that helped blood to clot.Lying in a hospital bed, not moving anything unless it was moved, her circulation slowed.Pools of static blood dried into a thick paste in her blood vessels.Thanks to aggressive nursing care, when Geraldine developed a bedsore it was managed at an early stage.But the term bedsore is an understated euphemism.It recalls the annoyance of a cold sore or the tenderness of muscles after the gym.The grotesque image of bone pressing through skin is hidden.In people who are immobilized, bedsores develop under bony prominences like the heels and the skull.At first, the skin becomes red.If the bedsore progresses, the skins outer layer, then the inner layer, breaks down.Finally, in the most severe stage, bone, muscles and tendons are exposed.The entire process can happen in just a few days.Sixty days after her heart attack, Geraldine was stable enough to leave the I.C.U.She was in a persistent vegetative state unresponsive to external stimuli.She opened her eyes, as if she were about to say something, but nothing ever came out.Her gaze roved around the room.An ambulance took her to a long term care facility, where she was dependent on machines and people.When you first hear someone you love is sick, you think its a short term thing, her daughter told me over the phone a month later.Its adjusting to the long term aspect thats hard.Geraldines daughter woke up at 5 a.m. every day to spend time with her mom before work.I think its more of a disappointment for my dad, she said.He told us that if he ever gets sick, he doesnt want any of this.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Geraldines family lived between hope and guilt, with the weight of each side in flux.If my mom knew what we were doing right now, shed probably be mad at us, her daughter reflected a few weeks ago.Yet in the same breath, her voice rose and she said: My moms a fighter, so I think she would be happy with us giving her a shot.Were hoping for this miraculous turnaround.It did not come.Geraldine died of sepsis earlier this month, after more than four months of care.People dont know what theyre in for, Geraldines daughter reflected after the funeral.It hurt all of us to see her like that.In the final days of Geraldines life, a doctor asked if the family of another patient in the I.C.U.could visit Geraldine to see what prolonged dying looked like.Geraldines family was kind enough to agree.The visiting family chose to transition their loved one to hospice care.
Wild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans:::::Researchers used different questionnaires to assess the chimps traits in the two studies, but most of the personality types were consistent across the two studies.These traits seen among wild chimps matched ones seen among captive animals, the study found, and are similar to those described in people.Dr. Goodall, who is promoting a new documentary, Jane, about those early days of her research, said shes not surprised.She knew from childhood experiences with guinea pigs, tortoises and her favorite dog, Rusty, that animals have personalities that are quite familiar.I honestly dont think you can be close to any animals and not realize their very vivid personalities, she said.Clive Wynne, a professor and director of the Canine Science Collaboratory at Arizona State University in Tempe, who was not involved in the research, said the new study offered a really rich picture of the overlap among species.Video Its backing up and reinforcing a number of things that we assume about animal personality that are seldom established with this degree of security in substantial wild-living populations, said Dr. Wynne, who concurs that dogs, his area of specialty, also have similar personality traits.Robert Latzman, an associate professor at Georgia State University, who was not involved in the study, said his research with chimpanzees in zoos has always left open the question of whether animals in the wild are somehow different.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whats exciting about these data is theres some suggestion that wild apes look very similar to what we would expect in terms of basic dispositional traits and continuity of those traits and I dont mean just to captive chimpanzees, but to humans, he said.The work in the wild underscores how similar these animals truly are to humans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Alexander Weiss, who led the new study, said he was particularly interested in examining the personality traits of animals in the wild.His findings were in line with previous research hes done on chimpanzees in captivity.The fact that were showing this consistency in the wild is nice, because it allows us to draw more general conclusions, said Dr. Weiss, a senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.Its not just being in a zoo thats causing these individual traits to be stable.The studys underlying data will be made publicly available so other scientists can use them in their own research, he said.Although most of the animals tested in 1973 had died by the time the recent analysis was conducted, the study also concluded that an animals personality traits were generally consistent over time.Dr. Goodall said that fits what shes seen, too.She only visits Gombe twice a year now, and only two animals are still alive from the days when she knew them as individuals.One, a mother of twins named Gremlin, has changed a bit, Dr. Goodall said.I think the main difference in her personality is shes become more confident as she gets older, just like people do, she said.Dr. Goodall added that shes pleased that researchers are still finding so much of interest at Gombe, and tapping into the expertise of Tanzanian field workers.And, of course, shes happy that the academic perspective has shifted from the time when she was told only humans had personalities, minds and emotions.Today you can get your Ph.D. studying animal personality.I think weve come around full-cycle, she said.It absolutely vindicates all that Ive ever believed.
The Rules of the Doctor’s Heart:::::M. was on this list of supplicants.His own heart, meanwhile, was failing so precipitously that he needed constant medical monitoring.Weird, deadly electrical rhythms arose out of his dying cardiac muscles, like ripples on a stagnating pond, necessitating defibrillating shocks to reset his rhythm.Fluid pooled in his feet, and the skin on his calves came off in strips.Photo There was a second reason to monitor M.s status.Hearts are so rare that patients have to be under constant surveillance to ensure that they continue to qualify for the transplant.Transplantation is a touch-and-go procedure; a patient on the wait-list must be in the best possible condition before receiving the donor organ.An innocuous-seeming infection, or kidney failure, can spiral out of control after the transplant.If its bad now, itll only be worse later, the transplant nurse told me, grimly.She was efficient-looking, dressed in a white nursing smock.She noted M.s vital signs and then disappeared down the corridor with her book.And so we watched him.Every vital sign temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate was dutifully recorded in the log books and on the residents notes.I was on call every third night.I would stop by to say hello to M. and wait for the transplant nurse to come around.He would be puzzling over 40-across on the Sunday crossword.She would check his numbers.Maybe there will be one tonight, she would say, before signing off for the day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It must have been on the third or fourth week of M.s hospitalization, sometime late in the evening, that the transplant unit called up to the I.C.U.A kid had dead-ended his motorcycle on a concrete barrier on the expressway.He was declared brain-dead shortly after the accident, but his heart was intact.M. was on the top of the transplant list.I half-ran, half-walked to his room to bring him the news.He had been dozing through most of the day and night a sign, perhaps, that he was having trouble pumping blood to his brain.He woke up, smiled wearily and then drifted off to sleep again.Around midnight, I was paged to the unit.Hes spiked a small fever, the unit nurse said.She tried to look at me blandly.Its nothing, she wanted me to say.Its not real.Nothing to see here, folks.Get back to work.How small?101.Well, lets retake the temperature.She measured it again.101.His systolic blood pressure had also dropped ever so slightly a few, barely discernible notches.But his pressures had always been low.I paused for a moment, weighing my choices.Try another thermometer.And check the pressure again.Actually, lets wait and try in 10 minutes.She brought another instrument out from the nurses station.M. began to sense the slowly building hubbub in the unit.He sat up woozily.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Do you feel anything wrong?A chill?Nope, he said.Nothing.I examined him, pore by pore, looking for a potential source.The nurse entered the room and made a tiny motion to see her outside.I met her by the nurses station.Should we record the temperature?she asked, whispering, as if the intercom might be eavesdropping.The stakes could not have been clearer to both of us.If we put the number in the chart, M. would temporarily fall off the list for the next morning.The transplant surgeons at this hospital, I knew, would never risk taking a febrile, potentially septic, patient to the operating room.I felt paralyzed.Medicine depends on looking at data objectively, dispassionately; a decade of training had taught me that.But it also depends on understanding that tests can mislead us, that data can deceive: What patient ever fits squarely into an assigned box?My fingers hovered above the computer, where I was meant to write my note and record the fateful temperature spike, but I found that I couldnt type a word.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At 1 a.m., I called the attending physician.I felt foolish: I imagined her scuffling around her nightstand for her spectacles, anticipating a question about an acute cardiac crisis.Instead, there was a mumbling, hesitant resident trying to decide whether to write a note.But she understood immediately.She walked through the details of the case.Had I really evaluated the infection?Yes, yes, I reassured her or rather, tried to reassure myself.Its really your decision, Sid, she said.But youve got to consider that in some other hospital, theres some other young guy a doctor, with a Ph.D. waiting for that same heart.If your patient goes to the O.R.infected, hes not going to make it, and the new heart is going to die with him.I put the phone down and turned to the nurse.The fever had come down to 100 degrees.What if we hadnt measured it in the first place?What if wed forgotten to take the vitals on one shift?How about all the things we dont measure?Muscle tone?Wakefulness?If a temperature spikes in a forest....I returned to the computer, tried to type my note, hesitated and stopped again.I wrote my final note at 2 in the morning.Temperature: 101 degrees, currently 100.No obvious source of infection.A chest X-ray showed no signs of a pneumonia.A complete history and physical exam was unrevealing.Awaiting blood-culture data.At rounds the next morning, I felt as if I had let the team down.I presented the case quietly, feeling the eyes of my co-residents burning holes into my skull.No one had any questions.There were just a few more days left in the rotation, and I went to say goodbye to M. His fever had subsided on its own after that overnight spike.Im sorry, I said, and he nodded.M. died of a fatal arrhythmia a few weeks later.No other heart became available.The fever never returned.
Stricter Gun Laws Tied to Fewer Firearm Injuries After Gun Shows:::::Photo Gun shows in a state with weak gun restrictions increase the short-term risk for firearm-related injuries, a new analysis has found.Researchers studied deaths, emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to firearms before and after 915 gun shows in California and Nevada from 2005 to 2013.California has laws requiring background checks, waiting periods, documentation and Department of Justice surveillance at gun shows.Nevada has no regulations pertaining explicitly to gun shows.When gun shows were held in California, there was no difference between rates of firearm incidents in the two weeks before and the two weeks after the shows.But after Nevada shows, incident rates rose 69 percent in regions of California within two hours driving distance.The study is in the Annals of Internal Medicine.Were seeing a pattern that suggests that Californias strict gun regulations may be effective in preventing short-term increases in firearm injuries after gun shows, said the lead author, Ellicott C. Matthay, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley.Also, travel to less restrictive states may threaten the effectiveness of firearm laws in California.Still, she said, This study is not definitive.Policy differences are one of many possible explanations there might be other factors operating that could explain the findings.Wed need more studies to figure out the impact of gun shows and the policies that regulate them.
Courts Reverse Johnson’s Baby Powder Judgments for Nearly $500 Million:::::Photo In back-to-back victories for Johnson & Johnson, the courts have reversed two judgments against the consumer products giant totaling nearly $500 million.The money had been awarded to women who said that they developed ovarian cancer after using the companys talcum powder for decades.On Friday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge tossed out a $417 million award won in August to Eva Echeverria.She was found to have ovarian cancer in 2007, after using Johnsons Baby Powder for more than 40 years.In her ruling, Judge Maren E. Nelson granted the companys motion for a new trial.The judge cited the insufficiency of the evidence and said that the damages awarded were excessive.Ms. Echeverria has died, The Associated Press reported, but her lawyer, Mark P.

The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Buckle Up a Helmet to Save a Life:::::But a few weeks ago I learned firsthand how foolish it was to worry more about my hair than my head.Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home.Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders.A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets.One of the most frequent excuses: Im only going to the store (or the gym).Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds.Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds, said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute.All it takes is gravity the distance to the ground to cause a head injury.Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury.Theres often a rebellion aspect among teens, Mr. Swart said.They say, All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe.Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle.I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases Ive observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the childs (or adults) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures.When the straps are too loose (or, as Ive often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head.The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it, Mr. Swart said.Another excuse Ive heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions.And that is true.You dont even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion.A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head.What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones.His organization had three extremely cheap helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three very expensive ones ($150 and above) and, he said, their performance level was almost identical.So if youre not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said.They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.Now, don that helmet, enjoy the ride and come home safe and sound.
Pediatricians’ New Germ-Control Advice: Bring Your Own Toys:::::But concerned parents dont necessarily have to stay in the waiting room, she said; you can check with the desk about how long its likely to be and then take a walk or wait in the car, and ask the staff to call your cellphone when its your childs turn.The policy also provides guidelines for cleaning exam rooms in between patients, disinfecting equipment (including wiping stethoscopes with alcohol), cleaning up after any spills involving body fluids, and general housekeeping.(Certain infections require more than just cleaning, of course; if a child has measles or chickenpox, we have to track down everyone who was exposed and offer specific protections to those who arent fully immunized, and measles is so infectious that cleaning the room isnt enough we actually have to leave it empty for a while to get rid of the risk.)Parents might want to ask about infection control when they are choosing a pediatrician, Dr. Jackson said.Look to see that surfaces and toys look easy to clean, that tissues and a place to dispose of tissues are provided, that hand sanitizer is easily accessible.You might also want to ask how the practice handles children who are not adequately immunized, and whether they are kept out of the waiting room when theyre sick.Ask, How do you triage?What does your waiting room look like?Are your health care workers immunized against influenza?Do you have a policy for infection control?she said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.No matter where we start, we always come back to good hand-washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Hand hygiene at all levels is critical, said Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, the lead author on the policy statement, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville, and the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Wolfson Childrens Hospital.Parents should be vigilant, he said, teaching their children hand hygiene, practicing their own hand hygiene, insisting health care providers practice hand hygiene its O.K.to ask.And then there is what we now refer to as cough etiquette, that is, covering a cough, coughing into your elbow rather than your hand, and, yes, again, practicing hand hygiene after wiping your nose or dealing with a cough.But while infection control in the waiting room and the exam room are important, the best ways to protect your child actually go back well before that trip to the doctor.First and foremost, make sure your child is fully immunized, including getting the annual influenza vaccine as soon as its available.Yes, I know, that means going to the doctors office, but its still the most crucial thing you can do, and if you get the flu shot early in the season, your child will have had time to generate a full immune response before theres a lot of flu going around.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And if the bad thing happens, in spite of everyones best efforts, and theres that dreaded waiting room exposure for a very contagious disease like measles or chickenpox, you at least want to be one of the people who was there with a fully immunized child.Theres nothing better than giving your child vaccines to prevent infections, Dr. Rathore said.More immediately, for any given visit to the doctor, good infection control precautions start before you actually come in, and they involve both the parent and the pediatric office staff.The people you talk to on the phone should have the training they need to ask you if there are concerning symptoms a funny rash, a fever, a bad cough which suggest that your child should not spend any time in the waiting room.If you have a sick child, make sure to explain the symptoms when you make the appointment, and tell the staff if there are additional details that might raise the odds that its something contagious (recent return from exotic travel, exposure to someone with a known infection, child not properly immunized).Maybe they can put you into an exam room right away or have you come at the very beginning or the very end of the day.We had a case very recently, a parent who called us, said the child may have chickenpox, Dr. Rathore said.We asked them not to bring the child in to the clinic.We looked at the child outside.If you have a child who is particularly vulnerable to infections, you might ask whether there is a way to minimize time in the waiting room, especially during the winter months.Some practices try to batch the well child checkups, or the newborn and young-infant checkups, for example, so that there are certain hours or days when the waiting room and exam rooms are dedicated to infants, too young to be fully immunized (we dont start giving flu shots till 6 months, and babies born premature are especially vulnerable to respiratory infections).If you have a child who is at risk for serious complications of certain infections, like flu, you dont want them waiting in the waiting room, Dr. Jackson said.Again, ask if you can come at a particular time when you can go right into an exam room.
W.H.O. Removes Robert Mugabe as ‘Good-Will Ambassador’:::::He also praised Zimbabwe as a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide health care to all.The reaction was swift and unforgiving.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada joined a chorus of world leaders, the State Department, medical professionals and social media users who expressed outrage or puzzlement at the appointment.Appearing in Edmonton on Saturday, Mr. Trudeau told reporters that he thought the choice of Mr. Mugabe was a bad April Fools joke, according to the local news media.Twenty-eight health organizations, including the NCD Alliance which works with the W.H.O.and other global groups to battle noncommunicable diseases released a statement expressing shock at the appointment.Obert Gutu, a spokesman for Zimbabwes main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, said, It is an insult.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.He added: Mugabe trashed our health delivery system.He and his family go outside of the country for treatment in Singapore after he allowed our public hospitals to collapse.Under Mr. Mugabes authoritarian rule, critics say, the countrys health care system, like many of its public services, has suffered badly, with hospitals frequently lacking essential supplies and nurses and doctors regularly left without pay.Mr. Mugabe and Zimbabwe have also been slapped with international sanctions over human rights abuses.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hillel Neuer, the executive director of UN Watch, a human rights group, had condemned the choice.He called on Dr. Tedros to reconsider, writing on Twitter: @DrTedros I urge you to cancel your appointment of Mugabe as W.H.O.good-will ambassador he ruined Zimbabwes health.Neither the president nor his government has reacted publicly to the controversy.In a tweet on Saturday, Dr. Tedros wrote: Im listening.I hear your concerns.Rethinking the approach in light of WHO values.A spokesman for the W.H.O., Christian Lindmeier, had said that the agencys director general was seeking broad support for its work.Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health, he said.In his statement on Sunday, Dr. Tedros said, I remain firmly committed to working with all countries and their leaders to ensure that every one has access to the health care they need.
Undocumented 17-Year-Old Must Delay Abortion, Court Rules:::::She decided to end her pregnancy, but Texas law requires a minor to get parental consent or a judicial waiver to do so.She obtained a waiver, but the government prevented her from going to any abortion-related appointments, the American Civil Liberties Union said in court documents, and forced her to visit a religiously affiliated crisis pregnancy center where she was asked to view a sonogram.President Trump has worked to restrict abortions since his first days in office by expanding the so-called global gag rule, which withholds American funding from international organizations that discuss or perform abortions; taking aim at Planned Parenthood funding; and appointing several leaders who are anti-abortion, including E. Scott Lloyd, the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the health department, and one of the defendants in the Jane Doe case.The federal government said that it was not its role to facilitate abortion, and that the teenager still had the option of returning to her home country.Ms. Doe has options for leaving federal custody either by requesting a voluntary departure to her home country (which the federal government is willing to expedite if requested) or by being placed in the custody of a sponsor, the defendants stated in a memorandum on Tuesday.Given these options, the government is not causing Ms. Doe to carry a pregnancy to term against her will.On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the government to allow the teenager to get an abortion.Tanya S. Chutkan, the United States District Court judge who initiated the temporary restraining order, said she was astounded by the governments position.She can leave the country or she cannot get her abortion, those are her options?The government next argued for the right to appoint the teenager with a sponsor, which would release her from government custody, and said in court documents that the process of securing a sponsor would not unduly burden the teenagers right to an abortion.On Friday, the appeals court agreed.The health department has until Oct. 31 to find a suitable sponsor; if it does, Jane Doe would be able to have an abortion.If she is not released to a sponsor by then, the government has the option of appealing once more.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.The 11-day timeline to find a sponsor seems far-fetched, said Brigitte Amiri, one of the A.C.L.U.lawyers representing the teenager.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sponsors are typically family members, according to the health departments website, who help care for a child who has entered the United States illegally without their parents often because the child is fleeing an abusive or violent situation.The vetting process, which includes a background check, can take months, Ms. Amiri said, and earlier attempts to find a sponsor for Jane Doe were unsuccessful.They kicked the can down the road, and in this case they kicked the woman down the road, Dr. Stanwood said.They are just delaying her care to no end but their own ideology.A spokesman for the Administration of Children and Families, which is part of the health department, said in a statement that the care of minors like Jane Doe was important.For however much time we are given, the Office of Refugee Resettlement and H.H.S.will protect the well-being of this minor and all children and their babies in our facilities, and we will defend human dignity for all in our care, the statement said.The teenager will be 16 weeks and five days pregnant at the end of October, according to the nonprofit legal organization Janes Due Process, which has been working with the A.C.L.U.If the appeals process continues into November, the teenager will reach the 20-week mark, which would prevent her from having an elective abortion in Texas.The sooner the teenager can have the abortion, the safer it will be for her, said Dr. Hal C. Lawrence, the executive vice president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who practiced obstetrics for nearly three decades.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the uterus gets bigger, he added, the walls of the uterus get thinner, which increases the possibility of perforation and puts women at risk of additional blood loss during an abortion.Health risks aside, delaying an abortion can cause emotional trauma.Women dont just wake up one morning and decide theyre going to have an abortion, Dr. Lawrence said.And so to make her continue to struggle and be denied access to something which is legal all that does is increase the psychological stress for her, and thats not healthy.The United States has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the developed world, and abortion has been shown to be safer for women than childbirth.The A.C.L.U.is considering several options, including further appeals.For the teenager, the process has been exhausting, Ms. Amiri said.She talks about feeling very tired.
The E.P.A.’s Top 10 Toxic Threats, and Industry’s Pushback:::::How it could hurt you: Exposure can cause dizziness, headaches, slurred speech, confusion, muscle twitching, difficulty walking and loss of consciousness.Studies on animals suggest that exposure is also associated with reduced blood cell counts along with toxicity to the liver and the reproductive and nervous systems.Industry intervention: The Alkylphenols & Ethoxylates Research Council, which represents companies that manufacture the chemical, argue that the E.P.A.should not consider health threats that occur when people do not follow warning labels.Where you may find it: Carbon tetrachloride, a clear liquid with a sweet smell, was once used in refrigeration fluids, aerosol propellants, pesticides, cleaning fluids, spot removers and degreasing agents.Most of those uses have been banned, but it is still has industrial applications, such as manufacturing petrochemicals.How it could hurt you: It can cause injuries to the liver and kidneys and, at high levels, can result in fatal damage to the brain and nervous system.Industry intervention: Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance argues that worker exposures are already regulated by Labor Department safety rules and that occupational conditions of use do not pose an unreasonable risk.Where you may find it: 1,4-dioxane is a flammable liquid with a variety of industrial applications, such as the manufacture of adhesives and sealants and other chemicals.It is used in paint strippers, dyes, greases, varnishes and waxes, and it can be found in antifreeze, aircraft de-icing fluids, deodorants, shampoos and cosmetics.How it could hurt you: The E.P.A.says that the chemical is likely to be carcinogenic to humans and that it may cause kidney and liver damage.It is now often found at low levels in drinking water supplies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Industry intervention: The American Cleaning Institute argues that while many consumer products may have small amounts of 1,4-dioxane, they are extraordinarily low levels and should be ignored.Where you may find it: Cyclic aliphatic bromide cluster is a group of chemicals found in flame retardants, plastic additives and certain polystyrene foams used in the construction industry for thermal insulation boards.How it could hurt you: People may be exposed to the chemicals from products and dust in the home.Animal test results suggest potential reproductive, developmental and neurological effects.Industry intervention: The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers argues that the E.P.A.should not consider potential of an accident or misuse, whether intentional or unintentional, when deciding to restrict these chemicals, as misuse is not even predictable and should never be included in toxicological risk assessment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Where you may find it: Methylene chloride is used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and polyurethane foam manufacturing.It is also found in paint strippers, adhesives, metal cleaners and aerosol solvents.Many products are sold at home improvement stores.How it could hurt you: Exposure can harm the central nervous system, with effects including dizziness, incapacitation and, sometimes, death.It is also linked to liver toxicity, liver cancer and lung cancer.It has been associated with dozens of deaths.The E.P.A., just days before the end of the Obama administration, proposed banning its use as a paint stripper because of these hazards.Industry intervention: W.M.Barr & Company, the largest national manufacturer of solvents, removers, fuels and cleaning products, asked the E.P.A.to withdraw its proposed rule to ban methylene chloride in paint strippers, arguing that its products do not present an unreasonable risk.Where you may find it: N-Methylpyrrolidone is a solvent used in petrochemical processing.It can be found in plastics, paints, inks, enamels, electronics, industrial and consumer cleaning products and arts and crafts materials.How it could hurt you: It may pose a particular risk to women who are pregnant or of childbearing age, according to studies on animals that suggest delayed fetal development.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Industry intervention: The NMP Manufacturers Group argues that the chemical is used in many industry sectors, in varied processes, and that it would be unworkable for industry and unworkable for EPA to evaluate them all.Where you may find it: Perchloroethylene, also known as perc, is a solvent widely used in dry-cleaning chemicals, automotive-care products, cleaning and furniture-care products, lubricants, greases, adhesives, sealants and paints and coatings.How it could hurt you: High-level inhalation exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, dizziness, headache, sleepiness and unconsciousness, while long-term inhalation exposure may affect the liver, the kidneys and the immune and reproductive systems.The E.P.A.has classified it as likely to be carcinogenic to humans, as it is associated with bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma.It is also a drinking-water contaminant.Industry intervention: The Drycleaning and Laundry Institute and the National Cleaners Association argue that any future decision to reduce or phase out the use of perc in drycleaning will put an oppressive burden on thousands of cleaners and that sadly, in taking any radical regulatory action the EPA will be doing little to reduce the negligible risks associated with the use, while threatening the future viability of thousands of dry cleaners.Where you may find it: Pigment Violet 29 is used in watercolors, acrylic paints, automotive paints, inks for printing and packaging, cleaning and washing agents, pharmaceuticals, solar cells, paper, sporting goods and industrial carpeting.It is also approved to be used in food packaging.How it could hurt you: There are limited health studies, but preliminary work suggests acute toxicity, eye irritation, skin irritation, skin sensitization, and perhaps reproductive and developmental toxicity.Industry intervention: Color Pigments Manufacturers Association argues that it does not pose any known hazard in any reasonably foreseeable use or misuse, and therefore cannot present an unreasonable risk.Where you may find it: Trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, is used to make a refrigerant chemical and remove grease from metal parts.It is also a spotting agent for dry cleaning and can be found in consumer products.The E.P.A., in the final days of the Obama administration, proposed a ban on its use in dry-cleaning chemicals, spot removers and aerosol degreasers.How it could hurt you: It is associated with cancers of the liver, kidneys and blood.Animal studies suggest that it may also be a factor in birth defects, testicular cancer, leukemia, lymphomas and lung tumors.TCE is also a drinking-water contaminant.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Industry intervention: The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance, which manufactures the chemical, argues that the E.P.A.has conducted a very deficient risk assessment.Pointing to one study the E.P.A.has used, the group says that a single flawed study should not be the basis for the toxicological value that serves as the basis for regulation.
Why Has the E.P.A. Shifted on Toxic Chemicals? An Industry Insider Helps Call the Shots:::::The changes directed by Dr. Beck may result in an underestimation of the potential risks to human health and the environment caused by PFOA and other so-called legacy chemicals no longer sold on the market, the Office of Waters top official warned in a confidential internal memo obtained by The New York Times.Photo The E.P.A.s abrupt new direction on legacy chemicals is part of a broad initiative by the Trump administration to change the way the federal government evaluates health and environmental risks associated with hazardous chemicals, making it more aligned with the industrys wishes.It is a cause with far-reaching consequences for consumers and chemical companies, as the E.P.A.regulates some 80,000 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic and used in workplaces, homes and everyday products.If chemicals are deemed less risky, they are less likely to be subjected to heavy oversight and restrictions.The effort is not new, nor is the decades-long debate over how best to identify and assess risks, but the industry has not benefited from such highly placed champions in government since the Reagan administration.The cause was taken up by Dr. Beck and others in the administration of President George W. Bush, with some success, and met with resistance during the Obama administration.Now it has been aggressively revived under President Trump by an array of industry-backed political appointees and others.Dr. Beck, who has a doctorate in environmental health, comes from a camp firmly backed by the chemical industry that says the government too often directs burdensome rules at what she has called phantom risks.Other scientists and administrators at the E.P.A., including Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, until last month the agencys top official overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals, say the dangers are real and the pushback is often a tactic for deflecting accountability and shoring up industry profits at the expense of public safety.Since Mr. Trumps election, Dr. Becks approach has been unabashedly ascendant, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former E.P.A.and White House officials, confidential E.P.A.documents, and materials obtained through open-record requests.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In March, Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A.chief, overrode the recommendation of Ms. Hamnett and agency scientists to ban the commercial use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos, blamed for developmental disabilities in children.The E.P.A.s new leadership also pressed agency scientists to re-evaluate a plan to ban certain uses of two dangerous chemicals that have caused dozens of deaths or severe health problems: methylene chloride, which is found in paint strippers, and trichloroethylene, which removes grease from metals and is used in dry cleaning.It was extremely disturbing to me, Ms. Hamnett said of the order she received to reverse the proposed pesticide ban.The industry met with E.P.A.political appointees.And then I was asked to change the agencys stand.The E.P.A.and Dr. Beck declined repeated requests to comment that included detailed lists of questions.No matter how much information we give you, you would never write a fair piece, Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in an email.The only thing inappropriate and biased is your continued fixation on writing elitist clickbait trying to attack qualified professionals committed to serving their country.Before joining the E.P.A., Ms.Bowman was a spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council.The conflict over how to define risk in federal regulations comes just as the E.P.A.was supposed to be fixing its backlogged and beleaguered chemical regulation program.Last year, after a decade of delays, Congress passed bipartisan legislation that would push the E.P.A.to determine whether dozens of chemicals were so dangerous that they should be banned or restricted.The E.P.A.s Top 10 Toxic Threats, and Industrys Pushback The chemical safety law was passed after Congress and the chemical industry reached a consensus that toxic chemical threats or at least the fear of them were so severe that they undermined consumer confidence in products on the market.But now the chemical industry and many of the companies that use their compounds are praising the Trump administrations changed direction, saying new chemicals are getting faster regulatory reviews and existing chemicals will benefit from a less dogmatic approach to determining risk.Advertisement Continue reading the main story U.S. businesses, jobs and competitiveness depend on a functioning new chemicals program, Calvin M. Dooley, a former congressman who is president of the American Chemistry Council, said in a statement.It was issued in June after Dr. Beck, his recent employee, pushed through many industry-friendly changes in her new role at the E.P.A., including the change in tracking legacy chemicals such as PFOA.Anne Womack Kolton, a vice president at the council, said on Wednesday that Dr. Becks appointment was a positive development.We, along with many others, are glad that individuals who support credible science and thorough analysis as the basis for policymaking have agreed to serve, she said in an email.Consistency, transparency and high quality science in the regulatory process are in everyones interests.The Trump administrations shift, the industry has acknowledged, could have financial benefits.Otherwise, the industry may lose millions of dollars and years of research invested in a chemical, the American Chemistry Council and other groups wrote in a legal brief defending the changes Dr. Beck had engineered.But consumer advocates and many longtime scientists, managers and administrators at the E.P.A.are alarmed by the administrations priorities and worry that the new laws anticipated crackdown on hazardous chemicals could be compromised.You are never going to have 100 percent certainty on anything, Ms. Hamnett said.But when you have a chemical that evidence points to is causing fatalities, you err more on the side of taking some action, as opposed to Lets wait and spend some more time and try to get the science entirely certain, which it hardly ever gets to be.The divergent approaches and yearslong face-off between Ms. Hamnett and Dr. Beck parallel the story of the chemical industrys quest to keep the E.P.A.s enforcement arm at bay.The two women, one a lawyer from New Jersey, the other a scientist from Long Island, have dedicated their lives to the issue of hazardous chemicals.Eachs expertise is respected by her peers, but their perspectives couldnt be more dissimilar.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Hamnett, 63, spent her entire 38-year career at the E.P.A., joining the agency directly from law school as a believer in consumer and environmental protections.Dr. Beck, 51, did a fellowship at the E.P.A., but has spent most of her 29-year career elsewhere: in a testing lab at Este Lauder, as a toxicologist in the Washington State Health Department, as a regulatory analyst in the White House and most recently with the chemical industrys trade group.Photo Before Mr. Trumps election, Ms. Hamnett would have been regarded as the hands-down victor in their professional tug of war.Her decision to retire in September amounted to a surrender of sorts, a powerful acknowledgment of the two womens reversed fortunes under the Trump administration.I had become irrelevant, Ms. Hamnett said.Her farewell party in late August was held in the wood-paneled Map Room on the first floor of the E.P.A.headquarters, the same room where Mr. Trump had signed an executive order backed by big business that called for the agency to dismantle environmental protections.Dr. Beck was among those who spoke.She thanked Ms. Hamnett for her decades of service.I dont know what I am going to do without her, she said, according to multiple people who attended the event.Ms. Hamnett, in an interview, said she had little trouble envisioning the future under the new leadership.Its time for me to go, she said.I have done what I could do.Unreasonable Risk of Injury Chemical regulation was not part of the E.P.A.s original mission.But several environmental disasters in the early 1970s prompted Congress to extend the agencys authority.Industrial waste, including highly toxic PCBs, led to fish kills in the Hudson River.Chemicals from flame retardants were detected in livestock in Michigan, contaminating food across the state.And residents in Niagara Falls, N.Y., first started to notice a black, oily liquid in their basements, early hints of one of the worst environmental disasters in United States history: Love Canal.President Gerald R. Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act in October 1976, giving the E.P.A.the authority to ban or restrict chemicals it deemed dangerous.It was hailed as a public health breakthrough.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For the first time, the law empowers the federal government to control and even to stop production or use of chemical substances that may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment, a federal report said.A few years later, after graduating from George Washington University Law School in 1979, Ms. Hamnett landed at the E.P.A.She arrived fully embracing its enhanced mission.She had grown up in Trenton, where the words Trenton Makes, the World Takes are affixed in neon to the side of a railroad bridge spanning the Delaware River.Photo Her childhood memories included passing by the 200-acre Roebling Steel Company plant named after the designer of the Brooklyn Bridge.At its peak, the plant was Trentons largest employer, and it helped spread prosperity to the region.But the company was also a chronic polluter.For decades, it dumped arsenic, chromium, lead and other hazardous chemicals, contaminating soil and groundwater.Ultimately, the pollution was so pervasive that the E.P.A.declared the property a Superfund cleanup site.It was this legacy, as well as the congressional directive to the E.P.A.to protect the public from harm, that Ms. Hamnett said guided her.During the Bush administration, she was drawn into a contentious debate involving lead paint that highlighted her resolve and that of her opponents.Few environmental hazards are as well understood as the dangers of lead in paint.Since it was first used in homes in the United States, more than a century ago, it has poisoned children.Even after it was banned in the late 1970s, it remained a threat, particularly when renovations took place in the tens of millions of homes with lead-based paint.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The E.P.A.set out to establish standards governing home renovations, and Ms. Hamnett came to the discussions with a strong perspective.What is the effect of exposure likely to be?she recalled asking.If it is likely to be a severe effect and result in a significant number of people exposed, if so, I am going to err on the side of safety.While the evidence was solid that lead caused learning disabilities and other problems for children, it was less definitive on whether it was also a factor in adult diseases.To Ms. Hamnett and her colleagues, the results of multiple studies were compelling enough to establish an apparent link to cardiovascular disease in adults.They concluded in a report in 2006 that there was stronger evidence for a relationship between lead exposure and blood pressure for adults, citing it as a factor for aggressive safety requirements.The home renovation industry filed protests over the inappropriate and costly rule with the Bush administration and Congress.Taking up its cause was a White House official with a reputation for assessing risk much differently: Dr. Beck.Throwing Sand in the Gears As the Bush administration took office, John D. Graham, who ran the White House office overseeing regulations, unveiled a plan to ease the governments burden on business by reining in the regulatory state.To that end, Mr. Graham hired scientists to review major federal regulations and make recommendations about their worthiness, something the E.P.A.itself had done over the years.Dr. Beck, Mr. Graham said, was an excellent addition to his staff.She had grown up in Oyster Bay, N.Y., an affluent suburb on Long Island, earned an undergraduate microbiology degree in 1988 from Cornell and a doctorate from the University of Washington a decade later.Her dissertation, which examined how the sedative phenobarbital impacts the metabolism of the liver, started with words still relevant to her today: Each day the human body is confronted with many potentially toxic substances in the form of food items, medicinal products and environmental agents.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She started her career at Este Lauder, where she helped develop preservatives used to extend the shelf life of cosmetics, and also designed laboratory tests to determine if products caused adverse reactions when applied to skin.When Mr. Graham hired her, she had been working as a science fellow at the E.P.A.s center for environmental reviews.He described her as having street smarts and thick skin, someone who did not need the limelight to be effective.Dr. Beck is easy to underestimate, Mr. Graham said in an email.When the proposed lead paint rule came along in 2006, Dr. Beck, in her White House role, pressed Ms. Hamnett and others in the E.P.A.to revise the language to diminish the link to cardiovascular disease in adults, Ms. Hamnett recalled, before letting the rule go into effect.That was one marker in Dr. Becks journey to redefine the way the government evaluates risk.Though they repeatedly found themselves on opposite sides, Ms. Hamnett said that, in a way, she admired Dr. Becks effort during those years.She described Dr. Beck as a voracious reader of scientific studies and agency reports, diving deep into footnotes and scientific data with a rigor matched by few colleagues.She combed through thousands of comments submitted on proposed rules.And she had a habit of reading the Federal Register, the daily diary of new federal rules.All of it made Dr. Beck an intimidating and confident adversary, Ms. Hamnett recalled.Shes very smart and very well informed, she said.But there was a destructive side to that confidence, others said.In particular, Dr. Beck was seen as an enemy of scientists and risk assessors at the E.P.A., willing to challenge the validity of their studies and impose her own judgment, said Robert M. Sussman, a lawyer who represented chemical industry clients during the Bush administration and later became an E.P.A.lawyer and policy adviser under the Obama administration.Her goal was to throw sand in the gears to stop things from going forward, said Mr. Sussman, who now is counsel to Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a coalition of consumer and environmental groups.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jack Housenger, a biologist who served as the director of the E.P.A.s pesticide program, had a more positive recollection.He said Dr. Beck asked reasonable questions about his findings related to a wood preservative used in playgrounds and outdoor decks that was being pulled from the market.She wanted us to present the uncertainties and ranges of risk, said Mr. Housenger, who retired this year.She was trying to understand the methodology.Paul Noe, a lawyer who worked with Dr. Beck during the Bush administration, also said her critics got her wrong.What you really want to do as a government is to set priorities, he said.If you dont have a realistic way of distinguishing significant risks from insignificant ones, you are just going to get bogged down and waste significant resources, and that can impede public health and safety.One of the harshest criticisms of Dr. Becks tenure in the Bush White House came in 2007 from the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences, which examined a draft policy she helped write proposing much stricter controls over the way the government evaluates risks.The committee agrees that there is room for improvement in risk assessment practices in the federal government, the review said, but it described Dr. Becks suggestions as oversimplified and fundamentally flawed.It recommended her proposal be withdrawn.Dr. Beck was so aggressive in second-guessing E.P.A.scientists that she became central to a special investigation by the House Committee on Science and Technology.The committee obtained copies of her detailed emails to agency officials and accused her of slowing progress in confirming drinking-water health threats presented by chemicals like perchlorate, used in rocket fuel.Suppression of Environmental Science by the Bush Administrations Office of Management and Budget, the committee wrote in 2009, before describing Dr. Becks actions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The opposition became so intense that Dr. Becks efforts started to get shut down.First, the new risk assessment policy she had proposed was formally withdrawn.Then, after Mr. Obama took office in 2009, Mr. Sussman recalled going to the White House along with Lisa P. Jackson, the new E.P.A.administrator, to ask for a commitment to curb Dr. Becks power.We told them that we need the White House out of the E.P.A.science program, Mr. Sussman said.We demanded that.And we got it.Continuing the Fight During Mr. Obamas first term, Dr. Beck left the White House for the American Chemistry Council, whose members include Dow, DuPont and dozens of other major manufacturers and chemical companies.As the trade associations senior regulatory scientist, she was perfectly positioned to continue her second-guessing of the E.P.A.s science.Now her detailed criticisms of the agency came on trade association letterhead and in presentations at agency meetings and events.If the same person says the same thing three times, does this create a weight of evidence?Dr. Beck said in a presentation in 2013, essentially mocking the scientific standards at the agency.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.E.P.A.records show her challenging the agencys scientific conclusions related to arsenic (used to manufacture semiconductors), tert-Butanol (used in perfumes and as an octane booster in gasoline), and 1-bromopropane (used in dry cleaning).Her point was often the same: Did the scientists producing work that federal regulators relied on adequately justify all of the conclusions about any risks?Scientists today are more prolific than ever, she said in a November 2014 presentation, later adding that unfortunately, many of the scientific studies we read about in the news were not quite ready for prime time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But at the same time, the industry was confronting a much larger existential problem.E.P.A.and government-funded academic researchers were raising serious health questions about the safety of a range of chemicals, including flame retardants in furniture and plastics in water bottles and childrens toys.Consumer confidence in the industry was eroding.Some state legislatures, frustrated by the E.P.A.s slow response and facing a consumer backlash, moved to increase their own authority to investigate and act on the problems threatening the chemical industry with an unwieldy patchwork of state rules and regulations.Dr. Beck and other chemical industry representatives were dispatched to the E.P.A.and Congress to press for changes to the federal regulatory system that would standardize testing of the most worrisome existing chemicals and improve and accelerate the evaluation of new ones.The resulting law, passed last year with Democratic and Republican support, gave both sides something they wanted.The chemical industry got pre-emption from most new state regulations, and environmentalists got assurances that new chemicals would be evaluated on health and safety risks alone, not financial considerations.It was the most significant overhaul of the Toxic Substances Control Act since its enactment in the 1970s, and once again Ms. Hamnett was prepared to help shepherd it into place.The task was shaping up to be what she considered her final, crowning act at the E.P.A.Ms. Hamnett was invited to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a part of the White House complex, to be present as Mr. Obama signed the bill into law.She was so excited that she arrived early and sneaked up to the stage to look at the papers Mr. Obama would be signing.Photo Protecting people and the environment for decades to come, she said, recalling her thoughts, as she excitedly stood on the stage.At least, that is what we planned.Turning the Tables They gathered in early June around a long conference table at the E.P.A.headquarters, the sunlight shining in from Constitution Avenue.In the crowd were Dr. Beck, Ms. Hamnett and other top agency officials charged with regulating toxic chemicals, as well as environmentalists worried about last-minute changes to rules being pushed by the chemical industry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Olga Naidenko, an immunologist specializing in childrens health, said she was struck by the head-spinning scene.Dr. Beck, who had spent years trying to influence Ms. Hamnett and others to issue rules friendly to the chemical industry, was now sitting at the conference table as a government decision maker.I am running the show.I am now in the chair.And it is mine, Dr. Naidenko said, describing her impressions of Dr. Beck at the gathering.The Obama-era leadership at the E.P.A., in its last weeks, had published drafts of two critical rules needed to start the new chemical program.The rules detailed how the agency would choose the most risky chemicals to be tested or evaluated and how the hazards should be judged.It would be up to Mr. Pruitt, the new E.P.A.chief, and his team to complete the process in time for a June deadline, set in the legislation.Dr. Naidenko, a staff scientist at the Environmental Working Group, was there to plead with the agency to ignore a request from the American Chemistry Council to make more than a dozen last-minute changes, some pushed by Dr. Beck while she was at the council.Dr. Beck did not seem convinced, recalled Dr. Naidenko and one of her colleagues, Melanie Benesh, a lawyer with the same organization.Tell me why you are concerned.What is it about?Ms. Benesh and Ms. Hamnett each said they recalled Dr. Beck saying.In fact, behind the scenes, the deed was already done.Before Dr. Becks arrival, representatives from the E.P.A.s major divisions had agreed on final wording for the rules that would be sent to the White House for approval.But they were told to wait until May 1, when Dr. Beck began her job as the acting assistant administrator for chemical safety.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Beck then spent her first weeks on the job pressing agency staff to rewrite the standards to reflect, in some cases, word for word, the chemical industrys proposed changes, three staff members involved in the effort said.They asked not to be named for fear of losing their jobs.Dr. Beck had unusual authority to make it happen.When she was hired by the Trump administration, she was granted the status of administratively determined position.It is an unusual classification that means she was not hired based on a competitive process as civil servants are and she was also not identified as a political appointee.There are only about a dozen such posts at the E.P.A., among the 15,800 agency employees, and the jobs are typically reserved for technical experts, not managers with the authority to give orders.Crucially, the special status meant that Dr. Beck did not have to abide by the ethics agreement Mr. Trump adopted in January, which bars political appointees in his administration from participating for two years in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.Her written offer of employment, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, also made it clear that Dr. Becks appointment was junior enough not to require Senate confirmation, which would have almost certainly delayed her arrival at the agency and prevented her from making changes to the rules ahead of the June deadline.None of these arrangements raised concerns with the E.P.A.s acting general counsel, Kevin S. Minoli, who issued a ruling on her unusual employment status.Mr. Minoli saw Dr. Becks background as a benefit, according to a memo he wrote that was reviewed by The Times.You have extensive prior experience with the regulated industrys perspective and are already familiar with (and may well have authored) A.C.C.comments now under consideration, he wrote, referring to the American Chemistry Council.He added that Dr. Becks unique expertise, knowledge and prior experience will ensure that the agency is able to consider all perspectives, including that of the regulated industrys major trade association.Photo Others at the E.P.A., however, were stunned at the free pass given to Dr. Beck.It was a clear demonstration this administration has been captured by the industry, said Elizabeth Southerland, who served as the director of science and technology in the Office of Water until her retirement in July.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Getting Her Way In the weeks leading up to the June deadline, Dr. Beck made clear what changes she wanted.The conversations were polite, and Dr. Beck listened to counterarguments that Ms. Hamnett and her team made, Ms. Hamnett said.But in most cases, Dr. Beck did not back down, demanding a variety of revisions, particularly related to how the agency defined risks.It all had a familiar ring.Ms. Hamnett and the others had fielded many of the same demands from the American Chemistry Council and from Dr. Beck herself when she worked there.Ms. Hamnett took detailed notes in spiral notepads, excerpts from which she showed The Times.One area of contention was Dr. Becks insistence that the E.P.A.adopt precise definitions of terms and phrases used in imposing rules and regulations, such as best available science and weight of the evidence.The agency had repeatedly rejected the idea, most recently in January, in part because the definitions were seen as a guise for opponents to raise legal challenges.These terms have and will continue to evolve with changing scientific methods and innovation, the agency said in a Jan. 17 statement in the Federal Register, three days before Mr. Trump was sworn in.Codifying specific definitions for these phrases in this rule may inhibit the flexibility and responsiveness of the agency to quickly adapt to and implement changing science.Another area of dispute involved the all uses standard for evaluating health threats posed by chemicals.Under that standard, the E.P.A.would consider any possible use of a chemical when determining how to regulate it; Dr. Beck, like the chemical industry, wanted the E.P.A.to limit the evaluations to specific intended uses.There is no way we can look at thousands of uses, Dr. Beck told Ms. Hamnett in one meeting in mid-May, according to Ms. Hamnett and her notes.We cant chase the last molecule.Photo As the June deadline under the new law approached, Dr. Beck took control of the rewriting herself, a highly unusual step at the E.P.A., where expert Civil Service employees traditionally hold the rule-writing pen.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Hamnett said she did not try to stop Dr. Beck given she had the support of the agencys new leadership.Mr. Noe, the lawyer who worked with Dr. Beck during the Bush administration, was not involved in the rewriting of the new rules.But he said it was wrong to interpret Dr. Becks actions as pro-industry; instead, he said, she was a defender of rigorous science.Anyone who would question Nancys ability or integrity does not know her at all and just has a political ax to grind, he said.Ms. Hamnetts handwritten notes, however, record increasingly urgent objections from across the agency, including from the Waste and Chemical Enforcement Division, the Office of Water and the Office of General Counsel.Everyone was furious, said Ms. Southerland, the official from the Office of Water.Nancy was just rewriting the rule herself.And it was a huge change.Everybody was stunned such a substantial change would be made literally in the last week.The general counsels objections to the substance of the changes were among the most alarming.Laurel Celeste, an agency lawyer, questioned whether the last-minute changes would leave the agencys rule-making open to legal challenges.Her objections were outlined in a memo reviewed by The Times that was marked confidential attorney client communication.Do not release under FOIA, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.Federal law requires rules to be a logical outgrowth of the administrative record.But Dr. Beck had demanded changes that the staff had rejected, meaning that the rule contained items that differ so greatly from the proposal that they cannot be considered to be the logical outgrowth of the proposal and the comments, Ms. Celeste said.Her memo, sent by email on May 30 to Dr. Beck and more than two dozen agency scientists and staff members, also raised concerns about the preamble, an important piece of any regulation that must accurately reflect its contents.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We are also concerned that, as currently drafted, the preamble lacks an adequate rationale for a number of final rule provisions that have changed significantly from the proposal, Ms. Celeste wrote.The objections were strongly worded, but they fell short of an important legal threshold the formal filing of a nonconcurrence memo that would have triggered further review of Dr. Becks actions.Several E.P.A.staff members said in interviews that they had been told by Mr. Pruitts top deputies to air their concerns in so-called concur-with-comment memos, which put objections on the record but allowed the process to move forward.The rules, with Dr. Becks changes, were sent to the White House and approved by the June deadline.Mr. Pruitt assembled the team in late June for a brief ceremony to celebrate the completion of the work.Everybody here worked very, very hard, Ms. Hamnett said, as Mr. Pruitt signed his name, according to a video of the ceremony posted by the E.P.A.Photo Not One of My Best Days Environmentalists were dismayed, but Ms. Hamnett emerged from the whirlwind process with some confidence that all was not lost.While she disagreed with a number of Dr. Becks changes, she trusted that the E.P.A.staff would maintain its commitment to honor Congresss intent in the 2016 legislation.That would translate into a rigorous crackdown on the most dangerous chemicals, regardless of the changes.But her confidence in the E.P.A.s resolve was fragile, and it had been shaken by other actions, including the order Ms. Hamnett received to reverse course on banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos.The order came before Dr. Becks arrival at the agency, but Ms. Hamnett saw the industrys fingerprints all over it.Mr. Pruitts chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, instructed Ms. Hamnett to ignore the recommendation of agency scientists, she said.The scientists had called for a ban based on research suggesting the pesticide might cause developmental disabilities in children.Photo To keep the pesticide on the market, under E.P.A.guidelines, the agency needed to have a reasonable certainty that no harm was being caused.The science and the law tell us this is the way to go, Ms. Hamnett said of a ban.But the reaction from her superiors was not about the science or the law, she said.Instead, they queried her about Dow Chemical, the pesticides largest manufacturer, which had been lobbying against a ban.The clash is recorded in Ms. Hamnett notebook as well as in emails among Mr. Pruitts top political aides, which were obtained by The Times.They are trying to strong arm us, Mr. Jackson wrote after meeting with Ms. Hamnett, who presented him with a draft petition to ban the pesticide.Mr. Jackson, Ms. Hamnetts notebook shows, then asked her to come up with alternatives to a ban.He asserted, her notes show, that he did not want to be forced into a box by the petition.Photo I scared them, Mr. Jackson wrote in an email to a colleague about his demands on Ms. Hamnett and her team.As a possible compromise, Ms. Hamnetts team had been talking to Dow about perhaps phasing out the pesticide instead of imposing an immediate ban.But Dow, after Mr. Trumps election, was suddenly in no mood to compromise, Ms. Hamnett recalled.Dow did not respond to requests for comment.She now knew, she said, that the effort to ban the pesticide had been lost, something Mr. Jacksons emails celebrated.They know where this is headed, Mr. Jackson wrote.Just over a week later, Ms. Hamnett submitted a draft order that would deny the request for a ban.It was hard, very hard, she said, worrying that the pesticide would continue to harm children of farmworkers.That was not one of my best days.The episode is one reason she worries the E.P.A.will defer to the chemical industry as it begins to evaluate toxic chemicals under the standards created by the new law.She became particularly concerned because of a more recent exchange with Dr. Beck over methylene chloride, which is used in paint removers.After more than a decade of research, the agency had concluded in January that methylene chloride was so hazardous that its use in paint removers should be banned.Methylene chloride has been blamed in dozens of deaths, including that of a 21-year-old Tennessee man in April, who was overwhelmed by fumes as he was refinishing a bathtub.How is it possible that you can go to a home improvement store and buy a paint remover that can kill you?Ms. Hamnett asked.How can we let this happen?Furniture-refinishing companies and chemical manufacturers have urged the E.P.A.to focus on steps like strengthening warning labels, complaining that there are few reasonably priced alternatives.Ms. Hamnett said Dr. Beck raised the possibility that people were not following the directions on the labels.She also suggested that only a small number of users had been injured.Is it 1 percent?Ms. Hamnett recalled Dr. Beck asking.Ms. Hamnett said she was devastated by the line of questioning.After years of successfully fending off Dr. Beck and her industry allies, the balance of power at the agency had shifted toward the industry.Photo She had long planned to wrap up her work at the agency soon, as her husband, David, had retired three years ago.On Sept. 1, Ms. Hamnett turned in her badge and joined him.Mr. Pruitt has selected a replacement for Ms. Hamnett: Michael L.

Chief Is ‘Rethinking’ It:::::The role of good-will ambassador is largely symbolic, but rights groups were scathing in their reaction to the symbolism of giving it to a man whose leadership, they say, has led to the collapse of its health service and major rights abuses in Zimbabwe.Iain Levine, the program director at Human Rights Watch, said on Twitter, Given Mugabes appalling human rights record, calling him a goodwill ambassador for anything embarrasses WHO and Doctor Tedros.The NCD Alliance, which works with the W.H.O.and other global groups to battle noncommunicable diseases, released a statement signed by 27 other health organizations including the World Heart Federation, Action Against Smoking and Cancer Research UK expressing shock at the appointment.Members of the NCD civil society movement present at the conference are shocked and deeply concerned to hear of this appointment, given President Mugabes long track record of human rights violations and undermining the dignity of human beings, the statement said.The State Department and the British government also reacted negatively.There was no immediate comment from Mr. Mugabe or his government.A spokesman for the W.H.O., Christian Lindmeier, told Reuters that the agencys director general was seeking broad support for its work.Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health, he said.Mr. Mugabe, one of the worlds longest-serving rulers, has shown no signs of stepping down even as Zimbabwe has fretted over his increasingly frail health and he has traveled abroad for treatment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Under his authoritarian rule, the countrys health care system, like many of its public services, has suffered badly, with hospitals frequently lacking essential supplies and nurses and doctors regularly left without pay.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Zimbabwes main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, described the W.H.O.appointment as laughable.A spokesman, Obert Gutu, was quoted in The Guardian as saying: The Zimbabwe health delivery system is in a shambolic state.It is an insult.He added: Mugabe trashed our health delivery system.He and his family go outside of the country for treatment in Singapore after he allowed our public hospitals to collapse.Hillel Neuer, the executive director of UN Watch, a human rights group, condemned the choice, saying: The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents and turned the breadbasket of Africa and its health system into a basket case.The notion that the U.N. should now spin this country as a great supporter of health is, frankly, sickening.The United Nations naming of ambassadors has run into trouble before.In October, shortly after choosing Antnio Guterres over seven female candidates for its top leadership position, the agency named the comic book heroine Wonder Woman as an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls.Nearly 45,000 people signed a petition protesting the selection.A large-breasted white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery, thigh-baring body suit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots is not an appropriate spokeswoman for gender equity at the United Nations, the petition said.The United Nations dropped the superhero in December.Dr. Tedros, an Ethiopian, is the first African to lead the United Nations health agency.He took office this year, replacing Margaret Chan, who stepped down in June after 10 years.On Twitter, Mr. Neuer urged him to reverse course on Mr. Mugabe: @DrTedros I urge you to cancel your appointment of Mugabe as W.H.O.good-will ambassador he ruined Zimbabwes health.In a tweet later on Saturday, Dr. Tedros wrote: Im listening.I hear your concerns.Rethinking the approach in light of WHO values.I will issue a statement as soon as possible.
Memoir of Growing Up Fat Forces France to Look in the Mirror:::::In short, Ms. Deydier had touched a nerve.Her small publisher, which ran a limited first printing, has ordered a second.A book like this had not been done, said Clara Tellier Savary, Ms. Deydiers publisher at ditions Goutte dOr.For an obese person to be aware of all the issues and step back is very rare.Unlike in the United States, where TV regularly features programs urging viewers to take a positive view of their bodies and where a plus-size clothing industry is booming, celebrating ones girth is almost unheard-of in France.Yet more and more French people are obese.A report published last year by Inserm, the National Institute of Health and Medical Research, found that 16 percent of the adult population was obese, up from about 12 percent eight years ago.That is still low compared with the United States, where 36.5 percent of the adult population was clinically obese in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(International standards define being obese as having a body mass index of 30 or higher, and overweight as a B.M.I.of 25 to 29.)Activists trying to increase public awareness about the problems the obese face, and demanding that the French Health Ministry disseminate more information about treatment options, are only beginning to get a hearing, said Anne-Sophie Joly, president of an umbrella association of groups representing obese people.Society is very harsh with women, Ms. Joly said.Women face the most demands: She must be beautiful, but not too much; she must be thin, but not too thin; she must be intelligent, but not too much because you mustnt put the man in the shadows.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Deydier, a native of the southern city of Nmes, studied literature as well as a bit of politics and philosophy in Montpellier and has worked in journalism.In her book, she describes with sometimes caustic candor the daily humiliations of grossophobie, or fat-phobia, in France.France is one of few countries prohibiting job discrimination based on physical appearance, in a 2001 law, but the measure appears to be more often ignored than observed.Jean-Franois Amadieu, a sociologist at the Sorbonne in Paris who tracks public perceptions of obesity, said that obese men were three times less likely to be offered job interviews, and obese women six times less likely.(It is customary in France for job applicants to include photographs with their rsums.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Deydier recalled applying for a job at McDonalds as a university student, when she weighed around 200 pounds.The manager didnt want customers to see me working there, she said, because he didnt want them to think they would look like me if they came often.Later, during a trial period working with autistic children, a senior teacher told her, You are the seventh handicapped person in the class, Ms. Deydier recalled.She was told that she made the children feel doubly like misfits because they were saddled with an obese teacher.At the end of her six-month trial period, her bosses suggested that she look elsewhere for a job.I was ashamed to bring a complaint, Ms. Deydier said about filing a discrimination suit, adding that people had told her that she would never win one anyway, given her weight.One indicator of French views on obesity is the rising rate of extreme treatments like bariatric surgery, in which part of the stomach or intestine is removed or bypassed.The number of such operations has doubled in France in the past six years, to 50,000 annually.Ms. Deydier, who has tried dieting repeatedly and lost weight only to regain it, said she had considered having the operation but had been disturbed by the idea of choosing to amputate a functioning part of my body.Of the possible complications, she added, the most upsetting was the risk of social isolation: It can be difficult to share a meal after such surgery, which leaves people needing five small meals a day instead of the traditional three.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet for many, the desire to be svelte prevails over health risks or discomfort.In France, people are much more invested in ideas about physical appearance than in other places, said Mr. Amadieu, the sociologist.Norms have changed from the 1960s and 1970s; they have become thinner and thinner.Ms. Deydier describes her reluctance to take trains or buses because of frequent derision from fellow passengers, the discomfort of being out of breath even after walking a short distance and the sense of having her eating habits watched hawkishly.Over a cup of coffee far from the high-fashion redoubts of the Avenue Montaigne, Ms. Deydier described walking into a bakery in her neighborhood in Paris late one morning and, having missed breakfast, ordering two croissants.Before she even had time to put away her change, she recalled, the woman behind her in line said to the attendant, One will be enough for me, thank you.She spoke as if I couldnt hear her, Ms. Deydier said, but I was standing right there.Sociologists link such censure to a strong emphasis on appearance, to attachment to rules and to fears that order will dissolve if conventions are flouted.Abigail Saguy, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied attitudes toward appearance in the United States and France, said that obesity is seen in France as a sign of being out of control.Even if youre not heavy, you can receive criticism if you are eating in a way that is perceived as out of control, such as not at meal times, she said, citing a book whose French author described with horror seeing Americans eating alone, or at any time of day.France is a very rules-based society, Ms. Saguy said.There are rules about eating in France, about mealtimes, and you need to follow the rules.
I.R.S. Says It Will Reject Tax Returns That Lack Health Insurance Disclosure:::::The I.R.S.s guidance makes it clear that taxpayers cannot simply ignore the Affordable Care Act.While the penalty applies only to people without insurance, all taxpayers are required to say whether they have coverage.Legal experts say the I.R.S.has been clear that the law was in effect, despite repeated efforts by Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers to repeal it.Congress would have to specifically repeal the mandate, they say, even if the administration has significant leeway over how aggressively it enforces it.This guidance should put to rest speculation that the I.R.S.is no longer enforcing the individual mandate and improve compliance, wrote Timothy Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee University in a recent analysis.But there has been substantial confusion among taxpayers and insurers.Many insurance companies raised their rates for next years plans because they were worried the administration would essentially stop penalizing people who refused to buy coverage, leading to fewer enrollments, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University.People may have also mistakenly believed they did not have to comply with the laws reporting requirements.The new guidance suggests taxpayers will now face a sharp reminder that they need to provide this information, when they go to file a return electronically or submit the appropriate paperwork to get any refund they are due.Under the law, an individual who does not have insurance can face a penalty of $695 a year for an individual, up to a maximum of $2,085 for a family or 2.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, whichever is higher.People are exempt from the penalty if they have too little income or if the lowest-priced coverage available costs them more than 8.16 percent of their household income.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The I.R.S.had initially held off rejecting returns because the law was new, but then it delayed its plans to assess the effect of the executive order, said Nicole M. Elliott, a tax lawyer for Holland & Knight and a former I.R.S.official involved in putting into effect the Affordable Care Act.It is curious, given the executive order, Ms. Elliott said.Its a little unclear where the agencies are going and how heavy-handed they will be in enforcing it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In evaluating its stance, the agency may have decided the requirement eases the burden on taxpayers by making it clear they need not worry if they have insurance or are exempt from the penalty, she said.But the I.R.S.may still decide not to actively enforce the mandate, Ms. Elliott added.While the agency is taking steps to be sure it collects all the information necessary to levy the penalty, it could also take a very lenient view of how aggressively it goes after anyone who does not sign up.Its dangerous to read too much into this, she said.The White House declined to comment.The I.R.S.s decision to actively prepare to enforce the mandate only adds to the uncertainty about where the president stands about the future of the law.Just this month, he issued a second executive order aimed at allowing the sale of skimpier plans to both individuals and small businesses, the same day he announced he would abruptly stop funding subsidies for low-income individuals.He has abruptly switched positions on a new bipartisan proposal aimed at providing short-term stability to the insurance marketplaces under the law.The proposed bill, drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, would restore the government subsidies called cost-sharing reductions for two years.While the draft legislation is unlikely to reduce insurance premium prices for 2018, it could serve to reassure jittery insurance companies that the law has a future beyond next year.On Friday, a group of health plans, hospitals and doctors, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, came out in support of the proposal.The I.R.S.action does make it easier to see who should be buying coverage under the law, said Gary Claxton, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation.This was the best way to enforce the mandate, he said.But much still depends on what happens next.As part of the second executive order he issued, Mr. Trump seemed to raise the possibility that the A.C.A.market could be further disrupted by the introduction of new plans that would not have to comply with the law.These plans, short-term policies sold to individuals and association plans sold to employers, would be much cheaper and offer far less coverage.If those plans were widely available, younger and healthier individuals and groups could buy them, causing turmoil on the exchanges and soaring prices for A.C.A.plans.That would be a bigger deal than this, Mr. Claxton said.
During Labor, Lie Down:::::Photo Many doctors recommend that women in labor sit upright or walk to speed things along.But a randomized trial suggests the best bet may be to lie on your side.British researchers randomly assigned 3,093 first-time mothers with a low-dose epidural in the second stage of labor to either an upright position (walking, kneeling, standing or sitting up straight) or to a lying-down position (up to 30 degrees inclination).All the women had singleton pregnancies, and about 40 percent had their labor induced.The groups were similar in other health and behavioral characteristics.The study, in BMJ, found that 35.2 percent of women in the upright group achieved a vaginal delivery without the use of forceps, compared with 41.1 percent in the group lying down a statistically significant increase.(Forceps are more commonly used in Britain than in the United States.)Labor was slightly shorter in the women lying down, but there were no differences in other outcomes, including cesarean section or other medical interventions.Wed recommend that women try to lie down on their sides when the cervix is fully dilated, said the lead author, Dr. Peter Brocklehurst, a professor of womens health at the University of Birmingham in England.If they cant, thats fine.But most women want to have a spontaneous vaginal birth, so most will try to lie on their side if that gives them a better chance.
The Long War on Polio, as Recalled by Its Generals:::::Photo Coffee With Polio Experts will not be picked up by Hulu anytime soon, but there is something compelling in these short videos put out by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.The formula is simple: Doctors who have spent years fighting polio in the worlds most remote regions sit down over coffee with a World Health Organization representative to tell war stories.The production values are amateurish cups rattle, the bustle of the coffee shop intrudes.But the tales can be gripping, and they are recalled by soldiers who save lives rather than taking them.When the eradication drive began in the 1980s, polio paralyzed 1,000 children a day.Now, fewer than 100 a year suffer that fate.But the virus is never quite extinguished.Field commanders explain how the battle must be fought, literally village-to-village and house-to-house.In the most recent video, Dr. Naveed Sadozai describes pulling off a highway in Afghanistan, hoping to vaccinate sheepherders in a camp.To avoid land mines, he drives only in recent tire tracks; because the herders have huge attack dogs, he cajoles them from inside the car.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To win over a father skeptical of the vaccine, Dr. Sadozai offers to buy a sheep and chooses an emaciated one with a withered leg.When the herder explains why his choice is bad, Dr. Sadozai turns the tables, saying he will let the herder be the sheep expert if he can be the medical expert.He prevails: All the fathers children are vaccinated.In another video, Christopher Maher describes how the eradication campaign stopped the assassinations of vaccinators by the Pakistani Taliban: staffers recruited additional vaccinators from the same clans as the attackers.In a third, Dr. Ousmane Diop, a laboratory expert, explains how, as the virus became ever more rare, the campaign shifted from taking stool samples from crippled children to sampling the sewage of entire neighborhoods for signs of the virus.And while it has nothing to do the eradication campaign, a startling polio-related video can be seen on the website Sweatpants and Coffee: Dergin Tokmak, a child of Turkish immigrants in Germany whose legs were withered by childhood polio, does a leaping, spinning break-dance routine on a pair of bright red crutches.Under the name Stix, Mr. Tokmak danced with the Cirque du Soleil for several years.
Why Are Hearing Aids So Expensive?:::::Photo Q.Why are hearing aids so incredibly costly?Is it patents?A lock on manufacturing?With todays digital revolution, it would seem that they should be approaching the cost of eyeglasses.A.Hearing aids remain expensive $900 to $3,500 or more per ear but that is likely to be changing soon.The Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, which became law in August, includes a provision for selling hearing aids over the counter to adults with mild to moderate hearing loss in two to three years.The extra time allows the F.D.A.to establish safety, effectiveness and labeling standards.Under the new law, hearing aids are expected to cost around $300 or less per ear.Experts dont know exactly why hearing aids are still so costly, except that companies continue to invest in improvements, and fees usually cover the services of a highly trained audiologist.Cost reductions cant come soon enough for those who depend on hearing aids.Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America, said her office gets a handful of calls every day from people needing help paying for hearing aids.The association refers them to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid or foundations like the Lions Club, depending on their military status and where they live.Its still really tough, she said.Medicare does not cover the cost of hearing aids, though theres a bill before Congress that would require such coverage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Eighty percent of people who could benefit from a hearing aid dont get one, Ms. Kelley said, often because of cost or access to care.Some of the reason is stigma: They dont want to be seen as being old.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Research has clearly shown that hearing problems can have serious health consequences, leading to falls, cognitive problems, depression and social isolation.There are other risks too, noted Elizabeth Levine-Davis, a clinical audiologist and coordinator of the Hearing Aid Dispensary at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai: You cant hear the car coming down the block, your home smoke alarm, the doorbell, things like that.
New Study Casts Doubt on Diagnosis of Adult-Onset A.D.H.D.:::::Dr. Solanto said the study all but ruled out adult-onset A.D.H.D.as a stand-alone diagnosis.Other experts cautioned that it was too early to say definitively, and noted that attention deficits often precede mood and substance abuse problems which in turn can mask the condition.The new analysis drew on data from a study of childhood A.D.H.D.that had tracked people from age 9 or 10 up through early adulthood, gathering detailed histories from multiple sources, including doctors and parents.That project, begun in 1994, recruited 579 children with diagnosed A.D.H.D., as well as a group of 289 in the same classrooms for comparison purposes.Of those control youngsters, the new study found, 24 would go on to develop attention deficit problems much later on, during high school or after.Classic A.D.H.D.is diagnosed between ages 5 and 12.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The authors of the new report, led by Margaret Sibley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health at Florida International University, carefully examined the extensive records of those 24 with adult-onset A.D.H.D.The researchers found that the attention deficits in all but five cases most likely stemmed from other causes, like marijuana use, depression or anxiety.And the remaining five were hardly straightforward cases: One subject had previously had an eating disorder, another had shown signs of mania.This suggests to me the diagnosis doesnt exist independent of a compelling psychiatric history, said Dr. Sibley.No one in our group developed A.D.H.D.in adulthood out of nowhere.Some 10 percent of children are given a diagnosis of A.D.H.D., and most grow out of it to some extent.One reason that symptoms may emerge seemingly from nowhere in high school or later, experts say, is that some youngsters have offsetting abilities, like high I.Q., or supports, such as sensitive parents or teachers, that mask the problems early on.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In this respect, upbringing and environment may effectively blunt or contain symptoms.Not all experts believe the new report is the last word.When we take out all those people who have complicating problems, like substance use and mood disorders, we still find that about a third of late-onset cases remain, said Jessica Agnew-Blais, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at Kings College London.She was co-author of a previous study that estimated the prevalence of adult-onset A.D.H.D.at about 6 percent.What this discrepancy points to is that its important to look at different populations, Dr. Agnew-Blais said of the new findings.I dont think clinicians should be shutting the door, if the only sticking point is the age of onset of symptoms, she added.
Education may help HPV vaccination rate in college men:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Researchers have found that an education program can increase knowledge of human papillomavirus infection in college men leading to higher vaccination rates.The study, published today in The Nurse Practitioner, revealed that male college athletes have low rates of HPV vaccination and relatively little knowledge of their high rates of risk factors for infection, such as multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex and being young at sexual initiation.The findings are of particular importance since a study published last week found that 1 in 9 males age 18 to 69 in the United States are infected with oral HPV, which can cause cancers of the head, neck and throat."The incidence of this cancer has increased 300 percent in the last 20 years," Ashish Deshmukh, a research assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions, said in a UPI article Oct. 16.There is no cure currently for HPV but the HPV vaccines are effective at preventing initial infection of the disease.Preteen boys and girls are encouraged to get the series of vaccines before becoming sexually active and doctors say it is still effective for young adults who did not receive the vaccine as an adolescent.However, in the current study of 114 male college athletes, found that more than two-thirds had not had the HPV vaccine.Researchers developed a program to educate college students on the risks of HPV and the benefits of getting the HPV vaccine.Of the study participants, 77 were football players and 37 were baseball players who attended an educational session on HPV and were questioned before and after the session to assess changes in opinions about HPV and the vaccine.The study found that immediately after participating in the educational session, the men had significant increases in their knowledge of HPV, but in a three-month follow-up survey, only 12 percent of the unvaccinated men reported getting the HPV vaccine."The ability to provide HPV education to high-risk populations will further empower individuals to make informed decisions regarding high-risk behaviors, increase HPV vaccination rates, and decrease HPV infection rates," the authors stated.
Survey: At least one-quarter of American workers go to work sick:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- American workers are not doing their part to combat the spread of influenza, according to a new survey by NSF International.The survey suggests that, while nearly everybody judges coworkers who come in when they are sick and more than half of people would tell a sick coworker to go home, at least a quarter of people still turn up at the office while under the weather.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates nearly stagnant flu vaccination for the 2016-2017 flu season, aside from small increases in individuals age 50 and older.The Department of Health and Human Services announced a focus this flu season on increasing the number of people receiving the vaccine, with former HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price encouraging anybody six months or older to get their shot, specifying several higher risk groups especially need to be vaccinated."Vaccines are only as useful as when we take advantage of them," Price said at the press conference in September.However, the new survey by NSF showed vaccination rates do not have an affect on the number of American workers who go to work sick.The survey found 26 percent of Americans admit going to work while sick mainly due to workload, deadlines and loss of income.Nearly 42 percent of participants said they were afraid they would have too much work to make up if they were sick and 37 percent reported that they could not afford to take a sick day and miss work.The study also found that 98 percent of those surveyed admitted they judge co-workers who come to work sick, although just 16 percent said they viewed their co-workers who come in sick negatively.Men were twice as likely to come to work sick compared to women, 33 percent and 17 percent respectively.A previous survey by NSF in 2014 showed that one-quarter of workers who went to work sick said their boss required them to do so, 37 percent said they needed money and 42 percent blamed the workload.Healthcare providers recommend getting the flu vaccine each year to protect against the virus, along with proper hand washing practices and avoiding going to work to reduce the chance of spreading illness.
Outpatient antibiotics increase risk for C. difficile in the community:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Research shows outpatient antibiotic use can increase a person's risk of developing C. difficile infection after discharge from the emergency room.C. difficile, is a bacterial infection that results in inflammation of the colon known as colitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms of the disease include severe diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain.C. difficile is commonly associated with antibiotic use in hospital settings but beginning in 2014, 41 percent of all C. difficile infections have come from outside hospitals.Earlier research has detailed how antibiotics can promote C. difficile infection by killing helpful bacteria in the gut.In that study from 2016, researchers from North Carolina State University found that a single course of antibiotics can allow C. difficile to thrive because the antibiotics kill off bacteria responsible for altering bile acid.For the current study, published today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases, researchers enrolled 452 patients from 10 U.S. sites from 2014-2015 who tested positive for C. difficile as an outpatient or within three days of being hospitalized, and who had not been admitted to a hospital within the past 12 weeks with each patient being matched with a control who had not tested positive for C. difficile.The study showed 82 percent of patients with community-associated C. difficile had previous outpatient healthcare visits, 62 percent had taken antibiotics compared to 58 percent who were not infected and 10 percent who had taken antibiotics."There's a lot of work that needs to be done in terms of improving outpatient prescribing practices and making sure that providers are appropriately prescribing antibiotics," Dr. Alice Y. Guh, of the CDC, said in a press release."Health-care associated C. difficile infection is still a huge burden, but there is increasingly more recognition that community-associated C. difficile can occur.Outpatient antibiotic use is a risk factor, and we need to improve antibiotic stewardship not just in inpatient settings but also outpatient settings."The findings point to emergency rooms being the source of infection in the community.
CDC: Americans getting a handle on cholesterol:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that improvements in the rate of high total cholesterol in Americans has remained steady.Total and HDL cholesterol are commonly used to assess a patient's health along with systolic blood pressure, diabetes and smoking.Doctors use these factors to identify risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in the blood and is based on LDL, often referred to as bad cholesterol, HDL, or good cholesterol, and triglycerides, which are a type of fat in the blood used for energy by the body.The study, published today by the CDC, found that from 1999-2000 to 2015-2016 there were declining trends in high total cholesterol levels and from 2007-2008 to 2015-2016 in low HDL cholesterol.CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the study.The analysis reveals that about 12.4 percent of adults had high total cholesterol in 2015-2016, down from a high of 18.3 percent in 1999-2000.The percentage of adults with low HDL cholesterol has dropped to 18.4 percent, down from 22.2 percent in 2007-2008.The study showed the incidence of high total cholesterol was greater in men aged 40-59 than men aged 20-39 and 60 and older.Roughly 18 percent of adults had low HDL cholesterol, especially among Hispanics when compared to non-Hispanic white, black and Asian adults.Researchers believe the results come from a growing awareness of the danger of having high cholesterol, the reduction of the use of artificial trans fats in food production, cholesterol-lowering statin drugs and more health conscious diets.
Timing of treatment may predict cancer cell response:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- A study at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center found that the timing of DNA damage impacts the fate of cells, and could lead to new cancer treatments.DNA damage to cells caused by normal processes, smoking or sun exposure happens regularly during the process of making new DNA.The study, published today in Cell Systems, showed that checkpoints within cells preventing them from dividing before damaged DNA can be repaired are ignored and, in the case of cancer cells, go on to divide with damaged DNA -- essentially spreading cancer.Using time-lapse microscopy to study cells as they transition through cycle phases, UNC Chapel Hill researchers found cellular response to DNA damage during certain phases could be strong and halt the cycle, while in other phases cells were less sensitive or showed delayed progression.The researchers found "commitment points" in cell phases that allow them to move forward to the next cycle regardless of unrepaired damage to DNA."It's very important to look at the timing of cell damage because depending on when it occurs within a certain cell cycle, there can be a totally different outcome," Sherry Chao, a graduate research assistant in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Genetics, said in a press release."Some stages of the cell cycle are very vulnerable to DNA damage."Researchers used the information to create a mathematical model of how timing affects checkpoint behavior to show that exact timing of DNA damage determines checkpoint behaviors and can also change the outcome for damaged cells.These new findings could create new treatment strategies for treating cancer."Conceptually, it makes sense that if you could get all of the cells in the same cycle at the same time, you could damage them all with one shot," Jeremy Purvis, UNC Lineberger member and assistant professor in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Genetics, said."The key will be finding ways to separate cancerous and healthy cells based on the timing and synchronization of their cell cycles."
Study finds gaps in care for Rhode Island hepatitis C patients:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- A study by Brown University described gaps in care for young opioid users at risk for hepatitis C. The study found it's much less common for young opioid users to receive hepatitis C care than it is for them to get screened for the disease.Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that ranges from mild to serious and lifelong.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were an estimated 30,500 cases of acute hepatitis C in the United States in 2014 and there are an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people living with chronic hepatitis C in the United States.A CDC study in 2015 showed that rates of hepatitis C more than tripled in Appalachian states that included rural areas of Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee, where rates of hepatitis C infection increased by 364 percent between 2006 and 2012.For the current study, researchers found that between January 2015 and February 2016, 78.6 percent of the 196 young adults ages 18 to 29 in the study who used opioids recreationally in Rhode Island reported getting HCV screening.Of those who were screened, 18 tested positive for HCV.Of the participants who tested positive, 13 had a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis, 12 were referred to specialists, 10 received information on protecting others from contacting the disease and nine received education on how to live with the disease."Many young people who are at risk for hepatitis C may acquire the infection and then not know it, and then through drug injection practices may transmit it to others," Brandon Marshall, associate professor of epidemiology in the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a press release."For this reason, we need to not only be screening, but also providing care to young people who test positive for hepatitis C." The study was published today in the Journal of Adolescent Health."Screening for HCV is free in many parts of the state, but financial and other barriers exist for youth who test positive and are in need of additional resources and hepatitis C care," Marshall said."We need to work on improving access to hepatitis C treatment programs and other referral services for young people."
Weight loss from bariatric surgery improves heart health:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Losing weight after being overweight or obese has been shown to have numerous health benefits, but now a new study finds weight loss after bariatric surgery can help the heart.Findings from the new study, which will be presented this week at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2017, suggest weight loss from bariatric surgery can return the heart to its natural shape and function.Both are altered due to large amounts of belly fat.Excess body weight causes the heart to have to generate more force in order to pump more blood through the body.In a previous study, researchers found that women may have a lower risk of heart disease compared to men after weight-loss surgery.That study of 2,000 patients found that women had a 41 percent reduced risk of heart disease after bariatric surgery, compared to a 35.6 percent in men."We know that obesity is the most prevalent disease in the United States.And that the cardiovascular system is significantly affected by this disease process," Dr. Raul J. Rosenthal, chairman, department of General Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida, said in a news release."But we wanted to know to what degree the shape of the heart changes in someone who is obese, what the heart looks like in someone after having bariatric surgery and losing weight, and how that change in geometry affects heart functionality."For the new study, researchers at Cleveland Clinic analyzed data from 51 obese men and women who had bariatric surgery between 2010 to 2015.The patients had an average body mass index of 40, or roughly 100 pounds overweight, and were an average age of 61.Preoperative and postoperative echocardiography was taken and assessed to measure the size and geometry of the heart as well as heart function.Researchers found that one year after surgery there were significant improvements in the patients' heart shape, including that the size of the ventricles that decreased by 15.7 percent."When the size of the chambers gets bigger and the walls of the heart get thicker, the blood flow to the heart is not as good, the functionality of the heart is not as good, and the heart itself doesn't get enough blood," Rosenthal said."The whole body suffers because there is less blood going to your feet and to your toes and to your brain."Researchers do not yet know if the duration of obesity has an affect on the chances to restore heart shape and function.
Retailer, insurance company move to tackle opioid crisis:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump has signaled he may formally declare a national emergency over the opioid crisis in America this week, but some private industry stakeholders aren't waiting for government action.Retail chain CVS and the Cigna health insurance company are launching their own efforts to combat an epidemic of overdoses on potent opioid-based painkillers by restricting prescriptions of OxyContin.Cigna told UPI it plans to work with patients, doctors and pharmacists to reduce use of OxyContin, identifying another drug it says works just as well but has less risk of misuse and abuse.The company will also soon stop approving payments for the drug for its plan participants.CVS plans to limit the size and dose of prescriptions, based on conversations with individual doctors to be sure patients receive what they need, the company told UPI.Although public health emergencies are generally related to outbreaks of disease or other medical issues, the idea of declaring a national emergency would offer wider availability of resources to states, counties and municipalities struggling with an epidemic of addiction and deaths.Trump has called the crisis a "national emergency."He has scheduled an announcement for Thursday at the White House.A formal declaration could spur funding for urgent treatment centers, closer work with healthcare providers to limit the spread of non-medical or overuse of opioid-based painkillers, and lower prices of overdose treatments like Naloxone.Overdose deaths from prescription opioids and the sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with more than 180,000 deaths in the United States between 1999 and 2015 linked to prescription opioids.The overprescription of opioid-based painkillers is a contributing factor.A CDC study found that the average supply administered by doctors for opioid prescriptions increased from 13 days in 2006 to 18 days in 2015.In March, Trump established a task force, the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, headed by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie.The panel has published recommendations for dealing with the crisis, though no government action has been taken.Meanwhile, CVS became the first drugstore chain to limit all opioid prescriptions to a seven-day supply.The company told UPI pharmacists will consult with physicians on a case-by-case basis to find alternatives or make exceptions if needed.Health insurance giant Cigna announced Oct. 4 that it will start removing OxyContin from its group commercial drug lists beginning Jan. 1 -- but not other painkillers that contain oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin."This is a nationwide change," Cigna spokeswoman Karen Eldred told UPI."It is important to note that individuals who have started using OxyContin for hospice care or cancer treatments will continue to have the medication covered in 2018.In addition, Cigna will consider approving coverage for OxyContin for reasons determined to be medically necessary through conversations with our customers' treating physicians."The company says it is in the process of notifying customers with current OxyContin prescriptions and their doctors of the change so there is time to discuss treatment options.Cigna signed a contract with the company Collegium, which manufactures the drug Xtampza ER, that "ties financial metrics to dosage levels being prescribed for Cigna customers."Eldred said Collegium is financially accountable if the average daily dosage strengths of Xtampza ER prescribed for Cigna customers exceed a specific threshold.If the threshold is exceeded, Collegium will reduce the cost of the medication for Cigna customers, which the insurer believes will encourage better education for healthcare providers to prevent overprescribing."We believe linking financial terms to dosage metrics will incentivize more education to prevent overprescribing," Eldred said.Cigna wouldn't comment on any plans for other prescription opioid drugs containing oxycodone, which include the widely used Percocet, as well as Endocet, Percodan, Endodan and Combunox.The White House commission, in an interim report published July 31, calls for increased funding and oversight for drug monitoring programs, enhanced education for healthcare providers and efforts such as those by CVS and Cigna.The commission calls on the federal government to increase research and funding into government- run efforts, but to go beyond lawmaking and law enforcement efforts as outlined in the report."It is not only critical that the federal government provide sufficient resources to prevent and combat this disease," commission members wrote in the report, "it must also provide the easiest pathway for private providers and local and state governments to achieve success."
Arsenic in drinking water may cause cancer decades after exposure:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- A new study reveals that inorganic arsenic, found naturally occurring in drinking water in some countries, can cause cancer decades after initial exposure ends.Inorganic arsenic is naturally occurring at high levels in groundwater in many countries across the globe and can cause several types of cancer, including skin, kidney, lung and bladder cancer, among other diseases.A recent study found the U.S. government's tighter limits on arsenic in drinking water since 2006 have resulted in a 17 percent decrease in the levels of arsenic found in individuals, according to public water systems with an estimated 200 fewer cases of lung and bladder cancer the following year.In the study, published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers found that arsenic in drinking water has one of the longest dormancy periods of any carcinogen, possibly up to 40 years after exposure ended.Researchers studied the affects of arsenic contamination in a water source in Antofagasta, Chile.The town experienced a sudden dramatic increase of arsenic in its drinking water in 1958.This increase was followed in 1970 by a dramatic reduction in exposure when an arsenic removal plant was installed.By analyzing medical records and data from residents who lived in Antofagasta during that time period, researchers found that lung, bladder and kidney cancer mortality rates began to increase roughly 10 years after the spike in arsenic exposure occurred.This increase in cancer mortality rates did not peak until nearly 20 years after exposure reduction started.Cancer mortality rates for lung, bladder and kidney cancers remained high for 40 years after the high arsenic exposure was halted.Researchers believe these findings mean the incidence of arsenic-related diseases will remain high for years to come.
New drug may block muscle scarring linked to heart failure:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- Excessive scarring of the heart muscle can lead to heart failure, a potentially deadly condition with no cure, but a new drug may provide hope for patients.Muscle scarring or fibrosis, including skeletal and cardiac muscle fibrosis, are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with no real treatment options.A study, published today in Nature Communications, tested the efficiacy of an experimental drug to prevent heart muscle scarring after a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack.The experimental treatment works by targeting molecules on alpha V integrins, or scar-forming cells."Cardiac fibrosis is a major contributor to chronic heart failure, which is a major cause of death worldwide," Neil Henderson, of the Medical Research Council Center for Inflammation Research at the University of Edinburgh, said in a news release."Our research has identified a promising therapeutic target in the development of new treatments for patients with chronic heart failure."An earlier study by the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill found a method to reprogram scar tissue cells into healthy heart muscle cells.UNC researchers identified two methods to regenerate cardiomyocytes, heart muscle cells that normally remain damaged following a heart attack.For the current study by the University of Edinburgh, researchers blocked the alpha V integrins molecules with an experimental drug."We found that Pdgfrb-Cre effectively targeted quiescent PDGFR+ cells and activated myofibroblasts in both skeletal and cardiac muscle," study authors wrote."Selective depletion of v integrins on PDGFR+ cells protected mice from fibrosis in both these muscle types, and v integrin depletion on PDGFR+ cells had no adverse effects on skeletal muscle regeneration."Researchers also found that treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of v integrins, or CWHM 12, weakened fibrosis in both skeletal and heart muscle after the fibrotic process was established."Scarring of the heart muscle has a major impact on the heart's ability to pump effectively," said Jeremy Pearson, professor and associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation."This can lead to heart failure and there is no effective treatment at the moment.By finding a new way to limit scarring in the hearts of mice, this research has unlocked the route to a potential treatment for this life-threatening problem."
Researchers find lung cancer driver in non-sun melanoma:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Researchers know all melanomas are not alike but a new study has revealed how much different non-sun-related melanomas are from sun-related melanomas.Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is most commonly related to sun exposure but the can also be genetic in nature and not related to the sun.These types of melanomas are not susceptible to the same targeted treatments as sun-related melanomas.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 76,665 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanoma in 2014, and 9,324 people died from the disease that year.The new study, published in the October edition of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, identified ALK-fusion, a genetic change, in a patient sample of the mucosal melanoma, a melanoma subtype not caused by sun exposure.Researchers treated the sample with crizotinib and ceritinib, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for ALK-positive lung cancer and found that the tumor shrank dramatically.The results seemed to reinforce the theory that genetic changes that cause cancer might be shared among different cancer types."Maybe these non-sun-exposed melanomas are molecularly more like a lung cancer or a colorectal cancer, and maybe we should be treating them like that," Kasey Couts, an assistant research professor at the CU School of Medicine, said in a news release.A genetic change known as gene fusion involves genes that should sit adjacent on the genome but instead are accidentally spliced together in a process that creates a new fusion protein.Researchers found that the gene ALK gets fused with the EML4 gene to create the fusion gene EML4-ALK, creating a new protein responsible for a subset of non-small cell lung cancers.Researchers found EML4-ALK fusion in the sample of mucosal melanoma, which they successfully treated with ALK-inhibitors used to treat ALK-positive lung cancer."It seems like these melanomas that don't come from sun exposure may have fusions not seen in the more common form of the disease, and thus may be more susceptible to targeted treatments that attack these fusions than they are to drugs developed to treat other kinds of melanoma," Couts said.
Teens unaware Adderall is an amphetamine, underreport use:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- A new study is highlighting a problem with teenagers, the underreporting of amphetamine use mainly due to lack of knowledge of which drugs are amphetamines.Amphetamine is the most common stimulant drug prescribed in the United States for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Two of the most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD are Ritalin and Adderall.Due to the ability of these drugs to enhance cognitive function, focus and ultimately academic performance, many high school and college students take the drugs for nonmedical use, a dangerous practice that can lead to abuse, dependency, cardiovascular events and seizures.The study, published in the October edition of Drug and Alcohol Dependence, was conducted by the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research at New York University Meyers College of Nursing.Researchers analyzed data from more than 24,000 high school seniors questioned in the Monitoring the Future study from 2010-2015 regarding nonmedical Adderall use and nonmedical amphetamine use."Our findings suggest that many young people are unaware that Adderall is amphetamine," Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at NYU Langone Health, said in a press release."In addition, such conflicting reports mean that prescription stimulant misuse may be underestimated."Roughly 6.9 percent of teens said they used Adderall for nonmedical purposes, 7.9 percent said they used amphetamine for nonmedical purposes, however, 28.7 percent of those surveyed who reported nonmedical Adderall use also reported no amphetamine use for nonmedical reasons.Of those reporting nonmedical Adderall use and no nonmedical amphetamine use, older students over age 18, African American students and those whose parents had a lower level of education were the most likely to fall into that category."Over a quarter of teens who reported using Adderall without a doctor telling them to take it contradicted themselves by saying they do not use amphetamine," Palamar said."As a result, the estimated prevalence of nonmedical amphetamine use of 7.9 percent may be an underestimate; it may be as high as 9.8 percent, or one out of 10 high school seniors, when considering the discordant reporting we found."
Irregular heartbeat may be tied to elevated thyroid levels:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- A review of 11 studies from Australia, Europe and the United States found that patients with atrial fibrillation have higher levels of thyroid hormone.Atrial fibrillation impacts 2.7 to 6.1 million people in the United States and is expected to impact up to 12.1 million by 2030.According to researchers, previous studies have found that the risk for atrial fibrillation, or irregular heartbeat, is higher in people with an overproduction of thyroid hormone.A 2013 study found that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism increased atrial fibrillation in studies on rats.In the new study, published today in Circulation, researchers analyzed data from two cohort databases, finding that participants with higher levels of the thyroid hormone free thyroxine, FT4, were more likely to develop an irregular heartbeat than those with normal levels.People with hypothyroidism typically are treated with medications containing thyroxine to increase their hormone levels."Our findings suggest that levels of the thyroid hormone, free thyroxine, circulating in the blood might be an additional risk factor for atrial fibrillation," Dr. Christine Baumgartner, specialist in General Internal Medicine from the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, and currently a postdoctoral scholar at University of California San Francisco, said in a press release."Free thyroxine hormone levels might help to identify individuals at higher risk."Researchers examined the incidence of atrial fibrillation in people with normal thyroid hormone levels.Participants who had higher blood levels of FT4, but still within the normal range when the study began, were at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared to those with lower levels of the hormone.Patients who had the highest levels of FT4 had a 45 percent increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation and even modest increases in FT4 had an increased risk."Patients who are treated with thyroxine, one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States, generally have higher circulating free thyroxine levels compared to untreated individuals," Baumgartner said."So, an important next step is to see whether our results also apply to these patients, in order to assess whether target free thyroxine thyroid hormone concentrations for thyroid-replacement therapy need to be modified."
More symptoms mean greater risk of readmission for cancer patients: Study:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Patients with advanced stage cancer with more severe physical and psychological symptoms are at a greater risk of longer hospital stays and readmissions.In a study, published today in Cancer, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital found a relationship between the number and severity of symptoms in patients with advanced stage cancer and an increase in hospital stays and readmissions."We know that hospitalized patients with advanced cancer often experience a higher symptom burden compared with those treated in the outpatient setting, but until now, most efforts to improve symptom management have focused on ambulatory patients," Dr. Ryan Nipp, an instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in a press release."There is a critical need to focus on efforts to alleviate suffering among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.For example, future efforts should determine the efficacy of implementing symptom monitoring and supportive care interventions for such patients in an effort to relieve their symptoms, improve quality of life and enhance the quality of their cancer care."Of 1,036 study participants with advanced cancer, who received palliative care for comfort and pain relief between September 2014 to May 2016 at MGH, more than half reported moderate to severe fatigue, pain, lack of appetite, drowsiness and overall poor well-being.One-quarter of patients reported significant depression or anxiety.The study found that the more significant the physical and psychological symptoms in patients, the higher the risk of longer hospital stays and increased risk of unplanned readmissions.These patients were not the only group that have higher risks of unplanned hospital readmission rates."Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer experience an immense burden of physical and psychological symptoms," Nipp said."Patients' symptoms represent potentially modifiable risk factors, and prior research has shown that interventions aimed at symptom improvement can enhance patient-reported outcomes.""We found novel results regarding the relationship between patients' symptoms and their use of health care services, which highlight the critical need to develop and test interventions addressing the symptoms experienced by hospitalized patients with advanced cancer to improve both the care these patients receive and their utilization of health care services."
Patients using less opioids after hip, knee replacement surgery:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- It seems that there is at one area where the opioid abuse trend is on the decline -- patients having hip and knee replacement surgery.The study, conducted by University of Massachusetts Medical School, is being presented this week at the ANESTHESIOLOGY 2017 conference in Boston."Opioids are powerful pain medications but have many unwanted side effects, including the risk of addiction," Philipp Gerner, a medical student at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said in a press release."This has prompted more interest in offering patients multimodal therapies to manage pain while also reducing the amount of opioids prescribed.Our research reflects that there has been steady progress over time toward achieving that goal."Researchers analyzed medical records for more than 1 million patients who had knee or hip replacement surgery between 2006 to 2014 from the Premiere Perspective nationwide database of joint replacement surgeries.There were 377,657 hip replacement and 779,338 knee replacement surgeries between 2006 and 2014 listed in the database, which collects information from 546 hospitals.A November 2016 revealed that older surgical patients -- age 66 and up -- are at significantly lower risk of developing an addiction to opioids after surgery compared to younger patients.The current study found fewer patients having hip and knee replacement surgery received prescription opioids as the sole treatment for pain during recovery.More of these patients successfully used a variety of pain management methods, including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, peripheral nerve block, gabapentin/pregabalin, COX-2 inhibitors or ketamine to control pain instead of prescription opioids.Roughly 27 percent of patients who received opioids alone to manage pain for hip replacement surgery in 2006 solely used opioids.In 2014, that number dropped to 10 percent.For knee replacement patients, 23 percent used opioids alone in 2006, and just 7 percent in 2014."While we tend to think of large, academic hospitals as implementing changes more effectively, smaller hospitals -- especially specialty institutions performing a lot of orthopedic surgeries -- may be more open to evidence-based changes in practice to stay competitive," said Dr. Stavros G. Memtsoudis, director of critical care services in the Department of Anesthesiology at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.
New pneumonia vaccine protects against dozens of additional forms:::::Oct. 20 (UPI) -- A new vaccine being developed at the University at Buffalo not only targets 72 forms of S. pneumoniae, but can anticipate future versions of the disease.In laboratory animal testing, the new vaccine triggered an immune response to the 23 most common forms of bacteria that cause pneumonia, which are currently covered by the Prevnar 13 and the Pneumovax 23 vaccines.Pneumonia is responsible for the deaths of nearly 1 million children each year worldwide under the age of 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In the United States, more adults are impacted by the disease with nearly 1 million Americans being hospitalized each year and 50,000 deaths caused by the infection."We've made tremendous progress fighting the spread of pneumonia, especially among children," Blaine Pfeifer, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at the University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said in a press release."But if we're ever going to rid ourselves of the disease, we need to create smarter and more cost-effective vaccines."Vaccines like Prevnar 13 and Synflorix work by connecting to the unique polysaccharides in each strain of pneumonia via a shared protein called CRM197, forming a covalent bond.This covalent bond triggers the body to find and destroy bacteria before they have a chance to colonize in the body.However, this method of creating covalent bonds for every strain of S. pneumoniae is costly and time consuming for scientists.Other negatives to this type of immunization called a conjugate vaccine makes the body eliminate the targeted bacteria types even if the bacteria is not attacking the body."Traditional vaccines completely remove bacteria from the body.But we now know that bacteria -- and in a larger sense, the microbiome -- are beneficial to maintaining good health," Charles H. Jones, of the University at Buffalo, said."What's really exciting is that we now have the ability -- with the vaccine we're developing -- to watch over bacteria and attack it only if it breaks away from the colony to cause an illness.That's important because if we leave the harmless bacteria in place, it prevents other harmful bacteria from filling that space."Researchers believe that even though forms of pneumonia not covered by the current vaccines are only responsible for 7 to 10 percent of the disease in U.S. children, these forms could eventually replace the 23 common forms targeted in the current vaccines.By utilizing a liposome that acts as storage for the sugars in pneumonia, the sugars are not covalently bonded so the liposome can host all the sugars appear in individual strains of the disease.The new vaccine not only has been shown to trigger a strong immune response like that of Prevnar 13, but can also easily have sugars added to it depending on the type of strains that become more prevalent."The advantage of our approach is that we don't have to apply the more complex covalent chemistry that is required for Prevnar," Pfeifer said."As a result, we can extend beyond the 13 types of sugars, potentially providing universal coverage against bacteria that cause pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and other types of pneumococcal disease.It holds the promise of saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year."
Scientists reveal e-cigarettes may trigger unique immune responses:::::Oct. 20 (UPI) -- As the debate over the safety of electronic cigarettes rages, a new study found that e-cigarettes trigger damaging immune responses not seen from tobacco cigarettes.Research from the University of North Carolina has found that not only do e-cigarettes cause potentially damaging immune responses seen in traditional cigarettes, but they can also trigger a new immune response that has not been seen before in traditional cigarettes."There is confusion about whether e-cigarettes are 'safer' than cigarettes because the potential adverse effects of e-cigarettes are only beginning to be studied," Dr. Mehmet Kesimer, an associate professor of pathology at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, said in a press release."Our results suggest that e-cigarettes might be just as bad as cigarettes."In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its oversight of tobacco products to include e-cigarettes after ongoing questions about their health effects and safety.An earlier study in September by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that nicotine in e-cigarettes can cause stiffened arteries leading to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.In June, researchers at the University of Connecticut found that e-cigarettes contain a nicotine-based liquid as harmful as unfiltered tobacco cigarettes and that the vapor from non-nicotine e-cigarettes can lead to similar amounts of DNA damage as filtered cigarettes.For this study, researchers compared sputum samples from 15 e-cigarette users, 14 traditional cigarette smokers and 15 non-smokers.E-cigarette and traditional cigarette smokers both showed significant increases in biomarkers of oxidative stress and the activation of defense mechanisms linked to lung disease.They also found increased mucus secretions including mucin 5AC, which has been linked to chronic bronchitis, asthma, wheezing and bronchiectasis.But researchers also found immune response triggers that were unique to e-cigarette smokers alone.E-cigarette smokers had significant increases in neutrophil granulocyte and neutrophil extracellular trap-related proteins that contribute to inflammatory lung diseases like cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.They also found the NETs, neutrophils that are associated with cell death in tissues lining the blood vessels and organs, existing outside the lung.This finding has researchers concerned about potential systemic inflammatory diseases like lupus."Our data shows that e-cigarettes have a signature of harm in the lung that is both similar and unique, which challenges the concept that switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is a healthier alternative."Kesimer said.
New neural network restores diaphragm function after spinal cord injury:::::Oct. 20 (UPI) -- Researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine have made a discovery that may revolutionize the treatment of spinal cord injuries.Individuals who experience spinal cord injuries are often reliant on a ventilator due to the fact that the diaphragm becomes paralyzed as in quadriplegia.The researchers at CWR found that two different sets of neural signals control the movement of the diaphragm in rats and mice -- one neural pathway originates in the brain, and the other in the spinal cord.The study, published in the October edition of Cell Reports, used a drug to turn this alternative nerve pathway on and restore breath-like movements in rodents."We found a way to make the diaphragm work again in mice and hope the same approach could be applied to humans," Jared Cregg, a graduate student in the Neurosciences Department at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, told UPI."We discovered a new circuit in the spinal cord that nobody knew of before.We describe it functionally based on the types of neurons in the network.We induced cervical level injury in rats and mice.We induced paralysis on the left side and found that correlated to the diaphragm function on the left side.We applied drugs that block inhibitions which kind of released the brakes so the diaphragm could start moving again."Spinal cord injury leads to paralysis in approximately 17,000 people in the U.S. each year.Many of those injured must rely on mechanical ventilators to breathe.By discovering the new network, researchers could help spinal cord injury patients bypass missing brain signals and return motor function below injury sites -- reducing the need for ventilators.Patients on ventilators for a long period of time are at an increased risk for developing serious, potentially fatal infections.Bacteria can grow in breathing tubes in the lungs, leading to pneumonia or septicemia.Diaphragm muscle atrophy, which can develop from not using their diaphragm during long-term ventilator use, can reduce the chance of patients of ever breathing on their own.According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, ventilator-associated pneumonia is a serious risk factor for patients on ventilators and other complications include risk for blood clots, serious skin infections, pneumothorax, lung damage and oxygen toxicity."It would benefit patients to be able to get them off the ventilator," Cregg said.When researchers treated the rodents with inhibitor drugs, they were able to induce electricity that originated in the spinal cord, not the brain.The researchers then used optogenetics -- the use of light to "flip switches" inside neurons -- to induce electrical signals in the diaphragm.The findings show the diaphragm can operate via nerve circuitry entirely separate from the brain."We have discovered a way to control the diaphragm in the absence of input from the brain.This exciting discovery may pave the way for future strategies aimed at augmenting motor output after cervical spinal cord injury," Cregg said.Cregg cautions that the research is in the early stages and they have conducted acute experiments for short periods of time, but that longer term studies need to be done before expanding to human trials.
New study finds HPV vaccine to be safe for adult women:::::Oct. 19 (UPI) -- Although most human papillomavirus prevention efforts are targeted toward adolescents, a new study found that the HPV vaccine is safe for adult women.While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration originally approved Gardasil, a vaccine against HPV, in 2006 for use with pre-teen and teen girls, and later added approvals for boys, more adult women are opting for vaccination and the safety of the vaccine in adults has not been the subject of many trials.HPV causes genital warts, which can lead to cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus and cervical cancer in women.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 11,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year in the United States, so preventing HPV in adult women is a major priority for healthcare professionals.Nearly 14 million people become infected with HPV each year, meaning most sexually-active men and women will develop at least one type of HPV in their lifetime.There are more than 100 types of HPV but just 13 have been linked to cancer -- and HPV 16 and 18 have been shown to lead to 70 percent of cervical cancers.Gardasil protects against HPV 6 and 11, and both Gardasil and another vaccine, Cervarix, are effective at preventing infection from HPV 16 and 18.Researchers found the newest HPV vaccine, 9vHPV, is effective at preventing HPV infection and can protect against HPV 16, 18, 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58.A 2014 study found that women in Australia age 27 to 45 had limited vaccine coverage due to barriers such as cost, time constraints and the three-dose schedule required.The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of Internal Medicine, investigated the effect of the HPV vaccine in more than 3 million adult women age 18 to 44 in Denmark and Sweden.Researchers aimed to find any association between the HPV vaccine in women and 44 chronic diseases, which the team narrowed down to seven, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease, localized lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, Addison's disease, Raynaud's disease and other encephalitis, myelitis or encephalomyelitis.The study found no adverse association between the HPV vaccine in adult women and these diseases, except for an increased risk of developing celiac disease in women of Danish decent.Researchers say, though, that celiac disease is significantly underdiagnosed in the general population in Denmark and the increase could also be due to undiagnosed pre-existing conditions."This is the most comprehensive study of HPV vaccination safety in adult women to date.It is not unreasonable to expect different safety concerns in adult women compared with young girls, and our study is an important supplement to the safety studies in young girls," Dr. Anders Hviid, of the Statens Serum Institut, in Denmark, said in a press release.
Level of preventive screenings, care similar regardless of mental health condition: Study:::::Oct. 19 (UPI) -- Preventive health screenings are conducted at the same or better rates in people with mental illness as they are in healthy individuals, according to a new study.The study, published today in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed data on more than 800,000 patients enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare and patients attending safety-net clinics.The study was divided into 100,000 adults who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other mental health disorders compared to 700,000 adults without mental health disorders.According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 9.8 million U.S. adults have a serious mental illness, with 1.1 percent of adults in the United States diagnosed with schizophrenia and 2.6 percent of U.S. adults having bipolar disorder.Researchers examined the prevalence of preventive care in patients with mental health disorders compared to the general public.They found that patients who were diagnosed with a mental health disorder received 80 and 81 percent of the recommended preventive care, while roughly 80 percent of people without a mental health condition received preventive care.The preventive health care included in the study was related to diabetes, tobacco use, colorectal cancer, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and preventive vaccines like the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.The researchers found a larger difference in patients visiting safety-net clinics, with those diagnosed with mental health disorders receiving 62 and 70 percent of preventive care, compared to 60 percent in patients without mental health disorders.Studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia were roughly three times more likely to die prematurely, often due to lack of care for preventable causes of death such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, as well as negative lifestyle factors such as poor diet, smoking, lack of exercise and drinking."It may be that people with mental illnesses aren't getting the support and treatment they need to prevent chronic disease," Bobbi Jo Yarbrough, a researcher with the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, said in a press release."For example, we know that the medications people take to manage serious mental illnesses can cause rapid weight gain, but there are few programs to help these people manage their weight while they are on the medications."
Study finds even regular walking can lower mortality risk:::::Oct. 19 (UPI) -- In the age of Fitbit, the Apple Watch and numerous apps that allow people to count steps -- with a daily goal of 10,000 steps, most of the time -- many may think walking is only beneficial if you meet certain step goals.A new study, published today in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, suggests instead that regular walking, even without meeting minimum requirements, can lower a person's mortality risk when compared to being sedentary."Walking has been described as the 'perfect exercise' because it is simple, free, convenient, doesn't require any special equipment or training, and can be done at any age," Dr. Alpa Patel, a researcher in the Intramural Research Department of the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.Current guidelines recommend that adults have at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week, but around half of adults actually meet these guidelines.For the study, researchers analyzed data on 140,000 older adult participants over age 65 in the Cancer-Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, with 95 percent of participants engaging in some walking and the rest reporting no moderate or vigorous activity.Research showed that walking for less than two hours a week was linked to a lower mortality rate for all causes compared to being completely sedentary.Walking two and a half to five hours a week showed a 20 percent lower mortality risk.Walking was also linked to specific types of lower mortality risks, for example, walking more than six hours a week was linked to a 35 percent lower mortality risk from respiratory disease.Participants who walked as their only form of exercise had a 20 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and a 9 percent lower risk of cancer deaths.For older adults, walking even below the minimum recommended guidelines was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to being completely inactive."With the near doubling of adults aged 65 and older expected by 2030, clinicians should encourage patients to walk even if less than the recommended amount, especially as they age, for health and longevity," Patel said.
FDA approves new gene therapy for blood cancer:::::Oct. 18 (UPI) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new form of cell-based gene therapy for adults with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma, marking only the second time a gene therapy has been approved for the disease.The therapy is called Yescarta and will be used to treat patients with the deadly blood cancer who have not responded to other forms of treatment."Today marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases," FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement."In just several decades, gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer."Researchers call the gene therapy a "living drug" that attacks cancer cells through immunotherapy, which strengthens the immune system and has led to long remissions in some cases, reported the New York Times.The FDA said diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's Lymphona in adults and there are approximately 72,000 new cases of NHL diagnosed in the United States each year.Yescarta is administered once through the vein and will cost $373,000 for the shot.The drug is produced by Kite Pharma, which is owned by pharmaceutical giant Gilead.After the FDA's announcement Wednesday., Gilead shares jumped 4 percent.
Treatment timing critical for melanoma survival:::::Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Diagnosis and treatment for any cancer is key to survival, but a new study finds that in the case of melanoma, timing of treatment is critical.Researchers at Cleveland Clinic's Dermatology & Plastic Surgery Institute found that the sooner a patient is treated after diagnosis of melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, the significantly better their survival outcome.Melanoma accounts for just 1 percent of all skin cancers, but is responsible for the vast majority of deaths from skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.For many patients, surgery is included in treatment, however the urge for patients to immediately begin treatment surpasses the number of surgeons or hospitals available for the procedure.This, researchers write in the study, was a major impetus for attempting to define the safest period of time after diagnosis for patients to undergo surgery."The ideal timing for melanoma treatment, predominantly surgery, had yet to be determined -- until now," Dr. Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon, director of melanoma surgery at Cleveland Clinic, said in a press release.For the new study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, researchers analyzed data from the National Cancer Database of 153,218 adults diagnosed with stage I-III melanoma between 2004 and 2012.Results showed that delayed surgery for melanoma dramatically decreased the overall survival rate of patients, especially in stage I melanoma -- delaying surgery to remove melanoma lesions after the first 29 days after diagnosis reduced overall survival in stage I, but not stage II or III.When treated for melanoma between 30 and 59 days from diagnosis, patients with stage I melanoma had a 5 percent higher risk of dying than patients treated within the first 30 days from diagnosis.These numbers increased as the length of time between diagnosis and treatments were extended.Patients were 16 percent more likely to die when treated between 60 and 89 days from diagnosis, 29 percent between 91 and 120 days from diagnosis and 41 percent when treated after 120 days from diagnosis.The risk for melanoma diagnosis increases as people age, and is more than 20 times more common among white people than in African Americans.The overall risk of being diagnosed with melanoma in a person's lifetime is 2.5 percent for whites, 0.1 percent for African Americans and 0.5 percent for Hispanics."Patients and referring physicians are not only concerned with how a melanoma is removed, but also when it's removed," Gastman said."We saw significantly worse prognoses and outcomes for those surgically treated after 30 days of stage I melanoma diagnosis.Knowing for certain that a more expedient time to surgery to remove an early melanoma improves the chances of survival is a game-changer in treating this life-threatening skin cancer."
Migraine frequency may be associated with anxiety and depression:::::Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Migraine headaches have been associated with anxiety and depression, but researchers in Taiwan have found a link between migraine frequency and mood disorders.A team of researchers from the National Defense Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan, found patients with anxiety and depression had more frequent migraines than patients without anxiety and depression.Prior research has found that headaches can be a common symptom and indicator of an anxiety disorder, including generalized anxiety disorder.In a 2009 study, researchers found 11 percent of migraine patients in the study had either major depression, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, dysthymia, substance abuse disorders and other mental health diagnoses.Experts say migraine patients are two to five times more likely to have either anxiety or depression, and a study published earlier this year suggests anxiety is "robustly" linked to migraine headaches.The current study, published today in Headache, consisted of 588 patients in an outpatient headache clinic in Taiwan who were analyzed for their migraine frequency, demographic data and sleep habits.The study found emotional distress and migraine frequency can be intertwined due to a common pathophysiological mechanism.Sleep quality, or lack there of, due to migraines was also a significant factor leading to severe depression and anxiety."These findings potentially suggest that adequate medical treatment to decrease headache frequency may reduce the risk of depression and anxiety in migraine patients," Dr. Fu-Chi Yang, an investigator in the Department of Neurology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan, said in a statement.
Scientists study therapeutic form of arsenic to treat brain cancer:::::Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Scientists from Northwestern University are taking a radical approach by testing the potential for arsenic to treat a deadly form of brain cancer.The study by researchers at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Translational Genomics Research Institute, or TGen, identified arsenic trioxide as a potential new treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, the most common and deadliest type of brain cancer.GBM is responsible for roughly 17,000 deaths in the United States a year and has an average survival rate of about 15 months.Arsenic trioxide has been the standard of treatment to prevent acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL, a rare subtype of blood cancer.Researchers at Northwestern participated in a clinical trial to test whether adding arsenic trioxide to the standard treatment of temozolomide, or TMZ, and radiation would be effective for treating GBM.That Phase II clinical trial found arsenic trioxide did not improve overall survival, but a deeper examination of data from the study suggested it could be effective for some patients -- inspiring the new study, which found it works for specific subgroups of patients with GBM."Our findings show that, for some patients, arsenic trioxide could be a powerful therapy that could extend the lives of certain glioblastoma patients by as much as three to four times the median expectation," Dr. Harshil Dhruv, an assistant professor in TGen's Cancer and Cell Biology Division, said in a press release."We were then able to identify these particular patients as having the same genomic signatures as those we had tentatively identified in our computer and laboratory screenings of potential therapies."The study, published Tuesday in Molecular Cancer Research, identified mesenchymal, or MES, and proneural, or PN, glioma subtypes with genomic signatures that vary according to specific underlying genes."Arsenic trioxide was found to be the most potent compound in non-MES GBM cells," Dr. Jonathan Bell, of Northwestern University, said."We found that PN GBM patients responded better to ATO (arsenic trioxide) than any other subtypes as demonstrated by longer overall and progression-free survival."The study also showed the advantages of using arsenic trioxide to treat GBM in that it is a small molecule able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.Arsenic is also cost effective because it is abundant in nature, the researchers say."Rather than treat all patients, we want to design a prospective clinical trial that we can enrich for those patients whose genomic signatures indicate they would be the best candidates for success," Dhruv said."This would be a biomarker-driven, precision-medicine clinical trial for glioblastoma -- a way to match the right drug to the right patient."

Vanderbilt leads international effort to develop universal flu vaccine:::::Researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center are leading an international effort to develop a universal influenza vaccine that would protect everyone against all strains of the flu anywhere in the world.Current flu vaccines can reduce the risk of influenza by up to 60 percent during seasons when the vaccine is well-matched to most circulating strains of the flu.In some years, however, vaccine effectiveness has dropped to 10 percent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).With influenza killing 250,000 to 500,000 people around the world each year, "we are long overdue to solve this very real global health threat," said Wayne C. Koff, Ph.D., President and CEO of The Human Vaccines Project, a public-private partnership that is funding the effort.The Universal Influenza Vaccine Initiative, which was announced today, will be led by James Crowe Jr., M.D., director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, and C. Buddy Creech, M.D., MPH, associate professor of Pediatrics and director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases.The initiative will launch a series of influenza vaccine clinical trials in globally diverse populations beginning early in 2018.Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, J. Craig Venter Institute, the University of British Columbia and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will conduct a broad spectrum analysis of blood and tissue samples from vaccinated and infected individuals.Coupled with artificial intelligence driven computer simulation models, they will seek to determine why some people are protected against the flu while others are not."These trials will be among the most comprehensive human clinical research studies ever undertaken," said Crowe, the Ann Scott Carell Professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology."They will determine how the immune system protects against different strains of influenza in different populations and geographic regions of the world, and what is required for a vaccine to generate long-term protective immunity," he said in a prepared statement."Until now, we have lacked the biomedical and computational tools to probe the complex and dynamic features of the human immune system in a complete way," Crowe added."But with today's technology, we can decipher the core principles behind how the immune system protects vulnerable populations, and develop a full understanding of how it prevents and controls influenza to inform the development of a universally effective vaccine."### About Vanderbilt University Medical Center- Managing more than 2 million patient visits each year, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) is one of the largest academic medical centers in the Southeast, and is the primary resource for specialty and primary care in hundreds of adult and pediatric specialties for patients throughout Tennessee and the Mid-South.The School of Medicine's biomedical research program is among the nation's top 10 in terms of National Institutes of Health peer review funding, receiving more than $500 million in public and private awards during 2017.The Medical Center is the region's locus of postgraduate medical education, with over 1,000 residents and fellows training in more than 100 specialty areas.Vanderbilt University Adult Hospital and the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt are recognized each year by U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals rankings as national leaders, with 21 nationally recognized adult and pediatric specialties.Through the Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network, VUMC is working with more than 60 hospitals and 5,000 clinicians across Tennessee and five neighboring states to share best practices and bring value-driven and cost-effective health care to the Mid-South.About the Human Vaccines Project-
Is Alzheimer's disease a disorder of energy metabolism?:::::A team of investigators from McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School, led by Kai C. Sonntag, MD, PhD, and Bruce M. Cohen, MD, PhD, has found a connection between disrupted energy production and the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).The findings appear in the current issue of Scientific Reports."These findings have several implications for understanding and developing potential therapeutic intervention in LOAD," explained Sonntag, an associate stem cell researcher at McLean Hospital and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School."Our results support the hypothesis that impairment in multiple interacting components of bioenergetics metabolism may be a key mechanism underlying and contributing to the risk and pathophysiology of this devastating illness."For three decades, it has been thought that the accumulation of small toxic molecules in the brain, called amyloid beta, or in short, A??is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Strong evidence came from studying familial or early-onset forms of AD (EOAD) that affect about five percent of AD patients and have associations with mutations leading to abnormally high levels or abnormal processing of A??in the brain.However, the "A?hypothesis" has been insufficient to explain the pathological changes in the more common LOAD, which affects more than 5 million seniors in the United States."Because late-onset Alzheimer's is a disease of age, many physiologic changes with age may contribute to risk for the disease, including changes in bioenergetics and metabolism," said Cohen, director of the Program for Neuropsychiatric Research at McLean Hospital and the Robertson-Steele Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School."Bioenergetics is the production, usage, and exchange of energy within and between cells or organs, and the environment.It has long been known that bioenergetic changes occur with aging and affect the whole body, but more so the brain, with its high need for energy."According to Sonntag and Cohen, it has been less clear what changes in bioenergetics are underlying and which are a consequence of aging and illness.In their study, Sonntag and Cohen analyzed the bioenergetic profiles of skin fibroblasts from LOAD patients and healthy controls, as a function of age and disease.The scientists looked at the two main components that produce energy in cells: (1) glycolysis, which is the mechanism to convert glucose into fuel molecules for consumption by mitochondria, and (2) burning of these fuels in the mitochondria, which use oxygen in a process called oxidative phosphorylation or mitochondrial respiration.The investigators found that LOAD cells exhibited impaired mitochondrial metabolism, with a reduction in molecules that are important in energy production, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).LOAD fibroblasts also demonstrated a shift in energy production to glycolysis, despite an inability to increase glucose uptake in response to the insulin analog IGF-1.Both the abnormal mitochondrial metabolism and the increase of glycolysis in LOAD cells were disease- and not age-specific, while diminished glucose uptake and the inability to respond to IGF-1 was a feature of both age and disease."The observation that LOAD fibroblasts had a deficiency in the mitochondrial metabolic potential and an increase in the glycolytic activity to maintain energy supply is indicative of failing mitochondria and fits with current knowledge that aging cells increasingly suffer from oxidative stress that impairs their mitochondrial energy production," said Sonntag.Cohen added that because the brain's nerve cells rely almost entirely on mitochondria-derived energy, failure of mitochondrial function, while seen throughout the body, might be particularly detrimental in the brain.The study's results link to findings from other studies that decreasing energy-related molecules (and specifically NAD) are features of normal aging by suggesting that abnormalities in processes involving these molecules may also be a factor in neurodegenerative diseases like LOAD.Whether modulating these compounds could slow the aging process and prevent or delay the onset of LOAD is unknown.However, several clinical trials are currently under way to test this possibility.Other changes are unique to AD, and these, too, may be targets for intervention.While these findings are significant, the paper's authors emphasize that the pathogenesis of LOAD is multifactorial, with bioenergetics being one part of risk determination and note that the skin fibroblasts studied are not the primary cell type that is affected in LOAD."However, because bioenergetics changes are body-wide, observations made in fibroblasts may also be relevant to brain cells," said Sonntag."In fact, metabolic changes like diminished glucose uptake and insulin/IGF-1 resistance may underlie the association between various disorders of aging, such as type 2 diabetes and AD."Sonntag and Cohen are already in the midst of follow-up work aiming to study these bioenergetics features in brain nerve cells and astrocytes generated from LOAD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, as an aging and disease model in the dish.It is the group's hope that findings from these studies will reveal further insight into the role of bioenergetics in LOAD pathogenesis and novel targets for intervention--both prevention and treatment.###

CNS awards Lithuanian professor for the paradigm shift in neurolog:::::The paper based on the study undertaken by the team of Lithuanian researchers was bestowed Paper of the Year award by The Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), US.The paper based on the study undertaken by the team of Lithuanian researchers was bestowed Paper of the Year award by The Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), USA.The paper "Association of Severe TBI Patients' Outcomes with Duration of Cerebrovascular Autoregulation Impairment Events" was awarded in Neurotrauma & Critical Care section.Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Professor Arminas Ragauskas was granted the award during the annual meeting of the Congress in Boston.CNS each year honours the most impactful papers from each neurosurgical subspecialty published in the Neurosurgery journal from June 2016 to June 2017.The winning papers challenge dogma, create a paradigm shift, and inspire neurosurgeons to rethink their approaches to patient care, big data, and trial results.The scientific objective of the awarded paper was to explore the influence of the duration of cerebrovascular autoregulation impairment events on severe traumatic brain injury patient outcomes.The results of the clinical study show that the longer duration of autoregulation impairment significantly correlated with worse outcomes.These results create a paradigm shift in clinical understanding of functioning of impaired human brain."Our research indicates that there is a possibility to regulate cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) impairment; the CA episodes need to be as short as possible", says Professor Ragauskas, the Founder and Director of KTU Health Telematics Science Institute.Unique technology for brain monitoring The research with traumatic brain injury patients was carried out in Vilnius University Hospital (Lithuania) by the team of scientists from KTU - Arminas Ragauskas, Aidanas Preikaitis, Vytautas Petkus, Solventa Krakauskait?, Romanas Chomskis - Vilnius University Professor and neurosurgeon Saulius Roka, and Professor of Harvard and Belfast Universities Teodoro Forcht Dagi, who is also a honorary doctor at KTU."Our research revealed that when treating patients with severe brain injury it is important to identify the single long-term impairment event of cerebral autoregulation and to restore the normal brain circulation as fast as possible", says Professor Ragauskas.According to the existent paradigm, an integrative approach is presently used for the association of series of temporal cerebrovascular autoregulation impairments.However, the Lithuanian scientists' research shows that in order to decrease mortality in patients with severe brain injury and to increase the efficiency of treatment it is important to identify the long episodes of impairment.Professor Ragauskas maintains that when an CA impairment event is observed, urgent intervention is needed to shorten this pathological process, which results in the secondary injury of the brain."Our technology provides real-time monitoring of cerebral circulation and human brain function in people with traumatic brain injuries.We need to see what happens in the brain during intensive therapy and to avoid too long and too dangerous episodes of cerebrovascular autoregulation impairments", says Professor Ragauskas.World-class science in Lithuania KTU Professor Arminas Ragauskas, who also holds a nomination for European Inventor Award for designing a non-invasive technology to measure intracranial pressure, says that Lithuanian technology and medical scientists working together create world-class science.### Although the paper was co-authored by the team of researchers, following the US tradition in science, the Paper of the Year award from CNS was assigned to Professor Arminas Ragauskas for the unique life-time achievements in medical research.
Case Western Reserve research advance may prevent a form of hereditary hearing loss:::::A research advance co-led by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine's Kumar Alagramam, PhD, may stop the progression of hearing loss and lead to significant preservation of hearing in people with Usher syndrome type III, a form of hereditary hearing loss linked to defects in the sensory "hair" cells in the inner ear.USH3 is caused by a mutation in the clarin-1 gene.The onset of sensory deficits in USH3, which also can result in loss of vision, is generally noticeable in childhood and is primarily found in people of Finnish background and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.In a new study published in Scientific Reports, Alagramam, who is an associate professor of otolaryngology, genetics and genomic sciences, and neurosciences at CWRU School of Medicine, and Lawrence Lustig, MD, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology--Head & Neck Surgery at Columbia University Medical Center, found that loss of hearing can be curtailed in a mouse model for hearing loss in USH3 through gene therapy.In gene therapy, normal genes are transplanted into cells in place of malfunctioning or missing ones to repair genetic disorders.The clarin-1 gene provides information for making CLRN1, a protein found in hair cells, which help convey sound signals to the brain."I think of hair cells as neatly arranged mini-microphones in the inner ear that are sensitive to different frequencies of sound entering the ear," said Alagramam.Previous work from the Alagramam lab showed that clarin-1 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the hair cells."There are several 'firsts' in our paper," said Alagramam."This is the first time researchers have been able to successfully mimic in any animal the progressive hearing loss observed in USH3 patients with a disabling mutation in the clarin-1 gene."Previous research showed that there was already deterioration in the hair cells of mice with USH3 two or three days after birth, which explained why conducting gene therapy that early, even before the ear had fully developed, was already a lost cause.This precluded treating the cells before the onset of symptoms.Seeking to address this problem, the authors surmised that inducing gradual hearing loss in mice would parallel the progression of hearing loss in humans with USH3, paving the way to investigate therapies for eventual human benefit.As reported in the new study, the researchers were able to postpone the onset of hearing loss and associated hair cell degeneration by about a month, providing enough time to inject normal copies of the Clarin-1 gene into the ear before the onset of hearing loss to see if the treatment was effective.Secondly, this is the first research to demonstrate that the loss of hair cells and hearing can be curtailed in USH3 mice by clarin-1 gene therapy.Normal mice can hear 30 decibels, just above a human whisper.But by the age of 80-90 days, untreated USH3 mice in the study couldn't hear 100 decibels - akin to standing next to a running snowmobile or in a busy woodshop and not hearing anything."We found that gene therapy blocked progressive hearing loss and improved hearing in treated mice by nearly four orders of magnitude compared to untreated sibling controls," said Alagramam."The treated mice could hear at 45 decibels until about five months of age, when we concluded our study.This is significant preservation of hearing and could dramatically change the lives of hearing-impaired children and adults since, while the age of USH3 onset in people is typically three to ten years of age, hearing loss in USH3 can surface as late as age 30."In a third "first," Alagramam and his colleagues revealed the potential importance of untranslated regions of genes in gene therapy.They showed that both the coded and the untranslated regions of the Clarin-1 gene are critical for effective gene therapy.Coded regions are portions of the gene that are translated into amino acids.Untranslated regions, once thought of as evolutionarily useless junk remnants, are now known to be vital for many of the regulatory aspects of genes."This is an important finding that will help future researchers, and eventually physicians, to maximize the effectiveness of gene therapy for curtailing sensory deficits associated with USH3 syndrome and, perhaps, in other disorders linked to defects in single genes," said Alagramam."Our findings, combined with undertaking detailed family histories and, when appropriate, early genetic diagnosis, could eventually allow clinicians to replace the defective Clarin-1 gene before patients start to lose their hearing.While there is much work to be done before our approach can be tested in humans, it is reasonable to project that preservation of hearing, and preventing deafness, in humans with USH3 syndrome could become a reality within the next ten years."### This work was supported by the Usher III Initiative, the Maniglia Endowed Funds, and US NIH grant R01-DC010816.For more information about Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, please visit: case.edu/medicine
Penn researchers awarded $3.75 million to study how mealtimes influence human health:::::PHILADELPHIA -- Disrupting sleep-wake cycles from a predominantly daytime to a delayed eating lifestyle, -- i.e., skipping breakfast and making lunch the first meal of the day, plus eating late dinner, disrupts the body's natural circadian (24-hour) rhythm, the cycle that tells us when to sleep, wake up, eat, and influences hormones and other functions.Penn research has previously shown that delayed eating increases weight, negatively affects fat metabolism, and increases glucose, insulin, triglyceride and cholesterol levels - markers implicated in obesity, heart disease, diabetes and other health problems.Now these researchers have received a grant to figure out why.Namni Goel, PhD, a research associate professor of psychology in Sleep and Chronobiology, and Kelly Allison, PhD, an associate professor of psychology in Psychiatry, in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, have received a 5-year, $3.75 million grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to continue their research investigating how meal times influence human health.In their initial research, the team found a daytime eating schedule, compared to a delayed eating schedule, promoted weight loss and a positive profile for fuel oxidation, energy metabolism and hormonal markers in adults of normal weight.This work also showed that short sleep duration increased caloric intake, particularly late at night, leading to weight gain and impaired metabolism.The current study will keep sleep timing and duration constant, only varying the timing of eating, to determine its independent effect on weight and other metabolic measures.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report released this month found that 39.8 percent of US adults were obese in 2015-2016.Additionally, the CDC reports that 610,000 people in the United States - one in every four deaths - die of heart disease each year."We know from previous research, that the time of day you eat your meals has a significant effect on the body's weight regulation and other health markers," said Allison, who also directs the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders."Now we're delving deeper into the underlying mechanisms that explain these effects, and how they influence specific populations."The five-year NIDDK grant allows the team to conduct a randomized, long-term study of subjects' eating times to compare weight and metabolic effects and circadian-mediated mechanisms of a daytime versus delayed eating schedule, each of 8 weeks duration, in adults with obesity (BMI of 30-50 kg/m2) without metabolic syndrome (characterized by high blood sugar, high blood pressure, excessive body fat around the waist, and abnormal triglyceride or cholesterol levels).The sleep-wake cycle (hours of the day spent sleeping) and activity levels will be controlled."By targeting these mechanisms, we can help in developing treatment of a range of conditions plaguing societies across the globe," said Goel."This research has potentially broad clinical implications, including informing recommendations of healthy timed eating habits that influence weight and metabolic health, identifying targets for medical interventions for obesity, and preventing metabolic syndrome and diabetes from developing in persons with obesity."### Penn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.Penn Medicine consists of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania(founded in 1765 as the nation's first medical school) and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which together form a $5.3 billion enterprise.The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States for the past 18 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools.The School is consistently among the nation's top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $373 million awarded in the 2015 fiscal year.The University of Pennsylvania Health System's patient care facilities include: The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center -- which are recognized as one of the nation's top "Honor Roll" hospitals by U.S. News & World Report -- Chester County Hospital;

Sonic Hedgehog at the center of Parkinson's research at CCNY:::::You may know Sonic Hedgehog as a Sega videogame character who saves us all from world domination.But within the realm of science, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is also helping to solve the mysteries of Parkinson's Disease.Just ask Andreas Kottmann of The CUNY School of Medicine at The City College of New York.Kottmann and his team were recently awarded a research grant by the American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA) to validate their findings around SHH's potential role in Parkinson's.Parkinson's Disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of a certain type of neuron in the brain, so called dopamine neurons.Kottmann and his team have found that dopamine neurons do not only communicate with other neurons with the chemical dopamine as their name wrongly suggests, but also by secreting Sonic Hedgehog (SHH).Using genetic engineering, the scientists produced a line of mice with dopamine neurons that cannot express SHH.These mice grow up healthy but then develop deficits that are reminiscent of Parkinson's disease.Interestingly, at first, the deficits of these mice can be reduced by the drug L-Dopa, which is the most effective anti PD drug, But, like in humans, when chronically dosed with L-Dopa, the mice exhibit dyskinesia (involuntary movement).Recently, Lauren Malave, a RISE fellow and graduate student in Kottmann's laboratory, found that agonists (binding agents) of the SHH co- receptor Smoothened can ameliorate the formation and display of L-Dopa induced dyskinesia (LID).CUNY Technology Commercialization Office has filed patent applications protecting various aspects of the technology and its uses.The new grant will allow the team to determine whether agonists of the SHH co-receptor Smoothened can ameliorate established L-Dopa Induced Dyskinesia (LID) not just in mice but in Parkinsonian Macaques.What they learn might open the door for testing Smoothened agonists as anti-dyskinetic agents in clinical trials...Learn more here about Kottmann and team's research, officially titled Validation of the G-protein coupled receptor Smoothened as a target for ameliorating L-Dopa induced dyskinesia.###
Hormones help tadpoles trade size for survival in a warming climate, says UC study:::::Deep within aquatic ecosystems all over the world, certain toad species have managed to survive warmer and drier climate change.But the method behind their metamorphic adaptation to environmental change over time has long puzzled scientists -- until now.Research at the University of Cincinnati reveals how certain species of the pudgy spadefoot toads manage to ramp up their larval periods.They instinctively regulate their hormone production altering their developmental timetables -- all in an adaptive response to changes in their environment.Daniel Buchholz, UC associate professor and biologist on the study, credits this survival process to a theory called "genetic accommodation" -- hereditary changes that occur in response to a changing environment."We found that when certain species combined stress hormones produced by the adrenal gland with hormones produced in the thyroid gland, this was key in speeding their development and shortening the larval periods.This process helps assure that they metamorphose or hatch before the pond dries up," claims Buchholz.The study, recently published in Nature Communications, sheds light on how metamorphosis is controlled by hormone changes in certain species of spadefoot toads, supporting the theory of genetic modification by way of "phenotypic plasticity" or a change in physical characteristics of any plant, animal or microbe as a reaction to changes in their environment over time.**Life finds a way** To illustrate this phenomenon the researchers spanned the globe and collected three species within the spadefoot family.They compared the Pelobates cultripes from Doana, Spain, to two different species from Arizona.In controlled experiments in the laboratory at UC, Buchholz and Saurabh Kulkarni, UC biology graduate student at the time and first author on the publication, compared larval periods directly to each other without outside environmental impact.They found that Spanish and American species indigenous to permanent and semipermanent pond conditions had more flexible control over their development and could activate their own metamorphosis when they perceived their pond drying up too soon.On the other hand, the desert specie Scaphiopus couchii from the dry American southwest had already developed shorter and shorter larval periods -- primarily in response to environment conditions that gradually became more ephemeral or short-lived over time.At this stage of evolution, the desert toads were unable to react to pond water level and their short larval periods were now fixed.While many of a given species will die if introduced to a profound change in their environment, Buchholz argues, some of the more hearty and healthier of the species will eventually evolve to survive in a new environment in an evolution by natural selection.But Buchholz says the key issue with these desert species is, "How did that process occur exactly?""One of the effects from rapid larval development in the desert toads is they don't have certain physical characteristics that their cousins in wetter environments have," says Buchholz.""For example, the desert spadefoot is smaller and doesn't have the metatarsal tubercles to dig, and they don't have their gonads differentiated at that point.**"So there are consequences for having this rapid metamorphosis."** But genetic modifications over time enabled desert species not only to survive but also to thrive in this new previously inhospitable environment.**Which came first?** In the complex cycle of survival, the researchers pondered whether the genes changed first or did a phenotypic plasticity allow for the survival that subsequently enabled their genes to change to ultimately survive in desert pools?The researchers say their evidence is the best so far for showing how species' differences may come about directly as a consequence of evolution of phenotypic plasticity in a changing environment.For example, other scientists have shown similar effects in experimental populations of insects or within species with various populations living in different environments.They can see changes in the phenotype because they have been living in different environments.But the researchers say this study is the clearest example where differences between species can be understood based on evolution from phenotypic plasticity."One of my basic questions has been, 'Why do these animal as well as human species look different from each other?'"asks Buchholz."What we have found about a major unappreciated piece of the explanation is that species differences in physical characteristics may be initially caused by environmental sensitive hormone levels controlling development followed by genetic changes that set the physical shape or morphological difference."**You are what your ancestors did** If hormones control development and those hormones are a responsive system to the environment, Buchholz says the environment can transmit an environmental signal by way of temperature, food, predators, stress and anything that can impact the animal enough to turn hormonal signals on that help it adapt to those environmental stressors.Similarly, humans can achieve different body sizes and skin conditions depending on their diets, activity, stress and other environmental factors.He says that differences between species can evolve through the changing of their ancestral physical characteristics -- explaining how some changes can become fixed through the process of genetic accommodation."We think the ancestors enabled desert survival because their physical characteristics were flexible and they were able to respond to a drying pool by freaking out and having a stress-induced increase in metamorphic rate," says Buchholz."This enabled them to shorten their larval periods from months and weeks to just days by switching on corticosterone stress hormones that act synergistically with thyroid hormones to accelerate the metamorphosis to speed the development."Eventually this ability becomes fixed as the desert species consistently encountered short duration ponds.This allowed the tadpoles to use newly developed lungs to escape the drying pond and move safely onto land."**Climate-driven changes** Buchholz contends that species living in permanent or semipermanent ponds can prompt their own metamorphosis when they sense that their pond is drying up too quickly.Thyroid glands are critical in frog development, just as in humans, but the spadefoot toads also activate their adrenal glands.This produces a stress hormone that accelerates metamorphosis in species with naturally longer larval periods."Over time the smaller desert toads that survived a natural selection process developed a more rapid metamorphosis but now lack the ability to change their rate of development back in response to new environmental changes," says Buchholz."Another strategy to survive desert ponds seen in other spadefoot species is to become carnivorous when tadpole numbers are high in order to take advantage of a highly nutritious food source, which helps increase their rate of growth and development."This study characterized the differences in species' growth and development in different pond drying conditions and clearly shows how evolution of phenotypic plasticity within species can explain the physical differences between species through the process of genetic accommodation, say the researchers."Questions remain around whether the mechanisms detailed in our paper can apply to species dealing with modern climate change which is happening at such a rapid pace?"adds Buchholz.Researchers involved in the study are Saurabh Kulkarni and Daniel Buchholz in the University of Cincinnati department of biological sciences, Robert Denver, professor in the University of Michigan department of molecular, cellular and developmental biology and Ivan Gomez-Mestre at the Doana Biological Station in Spain ###
UC San Diego Health researchers help launch second pancreas cancer 'dream team':::::Scientists and physicians at Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health, in partnership with colleagues at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and elsewhere, have been awarded a $7 million grant over four years by Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) to create a "dream team" to develop new ways to prevent pancreatic cancer -- one of the nation's deadliest malignancies.The grant, sponsored and administered by SU2C, the Lustgarten Foundation and the American Association for Cancer Research, was accepted by Scott Lippman, MD, director of Moores Cancer Center, and his two co-leaders at an international cancer conference in Philadelphia earlier today.Pancreatic cancer is among the most devastating and lethal of all cancers.It comprises just 3 percent of all cancer cases in the United States -- the average lifetime risk of developing it is roughly one in 67 or 1.5 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute -- but it is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, after lung, prostate and colon.More than 53,000 American men and women (evenly split) will be diagnosed this year with pancreatic cancer; more than 43,000 will die from the disease (7 percent of all cancer deaths).For all stages of the disease combined, the 5-year relative survival rate is just 8 percent (a 6 percent increase since 1940)."Because pancreatic cancer occurs deep within the body, it's hard to detect early.Doctors can't see or feel tumors during routine physical exams," said Lippman."There is no simple blood test for persons without symptoms.By the time symptoms appear, such as weight loss or abdominal discomfort, the disease has likely progressed and metastasized, which of course makes it deadlier."Lippman is co-leader and a principal investigator in the new "Pancreatic Cancer Interception Dream Team."He is a recognized advocate and leader for developing cancer prevention strategies.Other key members of the team include Anirban Maitra, MBBS, professor of pathology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Michael G. Goggins, MD, professor of pathology, medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins University; Elizabeth Jaffee, MD, deputy director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, also at Johns Hopkins; Bert Vogelstein, MD, director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics at Sidney Kimmel; Tyler Jacks, PhD, director of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT; Jim Allison, PhD, chair of the Department of Immunology at MD Anderson Cancer Center; Karen E. Nelson, PhD, director of the J. Craig Venter Institute campus in Rockville, MD; and J. Craig Venter, PhD, founder, chairman and CEO of the J. Craig Venter Institute.The grant is the second specifically targeting pancreatic cancer to be awarded to Moores Cancer Center researchers.A first pancreatic cancer "dream team" with Andrew Lowy, MD, and Tannishtha Reya PhD, as members was announced in 2015 with a three-year, $12-million grant.Their goal focuses on finding new ways to treat the disease or render it less lethal."The idea is that you can reprogram pancreatic cancer cells to a different state so they can be less aggressive or you can create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited with combination drug therapies," said Lowy.Lowy will also be part of the new dream team, focusing on the identification and management of patients at high risk for development of pancreatic cancer.Lippman said the new grant seeks to find ways of fending off disease before treatment is required."Before there is cancer, there are often red flags, such as lesions or bits of abnormal tissue.Sometimes these lesions don't change and remain benignly abnormal.They may even regress.But sometimes they transform into cancer," he said."The best remedy for cancer is to avoid having to treat it at all.That's what prevention is all about -- better understanding cancers before they actually become cancers, before they harm health or threaten life."Unfortunately, typical lifestyle changes, such as diet and smoking, have little effect on pancreatic cancer compared to the beneficial effects on other cancer types.Our SU2C dream team is and will be assessing new risk biomarkers and immune interception with cancer vaccines, which hold tremendous promise."Lippman's co-investigator Stephen Schoenberger, PhD, at La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology and an adjunct professor at UC San Diego, will lead efforts to develop personalized cancer prevention vaccines.###
New network will advance treatments for children:::::For a variety of reasons, medications and devices specifically developed for children have traditionally lagged behind similar products for adults.A new federally funded program intends to address these unmet medical needs by improving quality and efficiency in developing innovative pediatric medicines and devices.A pediatrician from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is among the leaders of a national program currently launching a global clinical trials network, aimed at strengthening the development of innovative treatments and devices for children.To accomplish this, the network plans to incorporate best practices, novel approaches and streamlined conduct of regulatory-quality clinical trials.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently awarded a cooperative agreement for $1 million in fiscal year 2017 funds with the potential for $1 million each year for an additional four years, to the Institute for Advanced Clinical Trials for Children (I-ACT for Children), contingent on annual appropriations and the availability of funding.I-ACT for Children, a new independent, nonprofit organization that works to improve the planning and completion of pediatric clinical trials, is allied with several other organizations committed to children's health--one of which is PEDSnet, a national clinical research network of eight children's hospitals, including CHOP."This award brings together leaders in pediatric trials innovation from across the public and private sectors in an exciting new clinical trials network, and creates an environment of continuous learning and quality improvement to ensure its sustainability," said CHOP pediatrician Christopher Forrest, MD, PhD, co-investigator of the FDA grant and the principal investigator of PEDSnet.Forrest added that the new network will focus on planning and strategy, best practices and education, and management of trials infrastructure for development of new medicines and devices.Leading the network as principal investigator is Edward Connor, MD, MBE, president of I-ACT and an emeritus professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine at George Washington University School of Medicine and Children's National Health System.Connor said, "Through this cooperative agreement we and our alliance partners will work to establish a sustainable global infrastructure for pediatric clinical trials that is collaborative, child-centered and promotes regulatory science and innovative methodologies to improve research on the safety and effectiveness of new medicines and devices for children.We are honored by FDA's confidence in our approach for a new paradigm in pediatric clinical trials."Joining I-ACT and PEDSnet are the James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence, the Critical Path Institute and the National Capital Consortium for Pediatric Device Innovation, working together with leading children's institutions and health systems.PEDSnet and the Anderson Center will serve as the network's data and learning core, the Critical Path Institute will be the regulatory science core, and the National Capital Consortium will be the device core.Work has been initiated to integrate network components and engage public and private shareholders in this work.Next steps include selecting priority projects for implementation in 2018 and beyond, and scaling the network in North America and abroad.### Funding for this work was made possible, in part, by the Food and Drug Administration through grant 1 U18 FD 006297.Views expressed in written materials or publications and by speakers and moderators do not necessarily reflect the official policies of the Department of Health and Human Services; nor does any mention of trade names, commercial practices, or organization imply endorsement by the United States Government.
TGen-USC study finds 'Precision Medicine' may not always be so precise:::::PHOENIX and LOS ANGELES -- Oct. 26, 2017 -- Precision Medicine in oncology, where genetic testing is used to determine the best drugs to treat cancer patients, is not always so precise when applied to some of the world's more diverse populations, according to a study led by the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), an affiliate of City of Hope, and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC).Precision Medicine in oncology is based upon identifying mutations that have turned normally healthy cells into tumor cells and where possible matching those to targeted therapies.There are two main approaches to identify those changes.Ideally, a patient's tumor, as well as normal tissue -- usually from a blood sample -- are sequenced to identify mutations specific to the tumor.However, collecting normal tissue is not always possible or feasible, thus tumor-only sequencing is an alternative.One is then left with trying to distinguish normal genetic variation from the actual tumor mutations.In general, population databases are used to filter out genetic changes that are inherited rather than specific to the tumor.Precision Medicine using this type of tumor-only approach, as a means of guiding therapeutic intervention, is more precise for those of European decent, and less precise for those whose ancestry is from Latin America, Africa and Asia, according to the study published online Oct. 19 in the scientific journal BMC Medical Genomics.In an effort to help identify those genetic variants that might cause cancer when normal tissue is not available, the TGen-USC team devised a genomic tool with the Harry Potter-ish name of LumosVar.While this tool represents a significant improvement for research purposes, even this technological advance is not of sufficient precision to determine which anti-cancer drugs to give individual patients."The field of precision medicine isn't taking into account population differences.The approaches being used are imprecise when you look at very specific populations," said Dr. John Carpten, Director of the Institute of Translational Genomics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and one of the study's lead authors.The problem is multi-pronged: Most of the tens of thousands of individuals worldwide who have undergone whole-genome sequencing -- the spelling out of the nearly 3 billion chemical bases in their DNA -- are of European decent, biasing existing databases used to exclude false-positive variants.There is a need to sample more people from more diverse parts of the world.European ancestry turns out to be among the least diverse genetically, having the fewest genetic variants, especially individuals with roots in Scandinavia.Those whose ancestry is traced from less developed parts of the world -- areas that have experienced the most rapid population increases over recent millennia -- have the most genetic variants, with individuals originating from Bangladesh having among the world's most diverse genomes.Many hospitals collect tumor tissue for research purposes without collecting normal tissue for comparison.This is especially true in under-developed nations.Without these normal-cell samples, it is difficult to determine which mutations potentially cause cancer and which are simply benign variants in the human genome."It is very difficult to identify a somatic, or potentially cancer-causing, variant when you don't have a germline, or normal, sample," said Dr. Rebecca Halperin, a TGen Assistant Research Professor and the study's other lead author."It's even worse, depending on your ancestry.You get more false positives -- those genetic variants that don't cause cancer -- from populations with non-European ancestry."To assist researchers in sorting out false positives, TGen and USC researchers devised a computational tool called LumosVar, a Harry Potter reference to Lumos (light) in the story's magic spells, and Var for genetic variance.LumosVar is essentially a tool to light up the genome's potentially cancer-causing genetic mutations."Simply sequencing more individuals from various populations is not enough.We really need access to the germlines.But when those aren't available, we need better tools and this is where we have put our focus," said Dr. David W. Craig, Vice Chair of the Keck School of Medicine of USC's Department of Translational Genomics and the study's senior author.Drs.Craig and Halperin are the co-creators of LumosVar.One surprising finding of the study involves the "out of Africa" theory of evolution; the fact that all modern humans across the globe can be genetically traced back to ancestors from Africa.Researchers assumed that because Africa was a starting point that those with African ancestry would be more genetically diverse, and those populations who spread elsewhere across the globe would, as descendants of more recent common ancestors, became less genetically diverse.Instead, rapid population expansion in Africa, as in South America and Asia, over millennia has been the driving force resulting in more genetically diverse individuals."The added complexity of identifying inherited genetic changes surprised me and many others we have shared these findings with," said Dr. Craig, who also is a Professor and Co-Director of the Institute of Translational Genomics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC."There is a growing body of knowledge on the shortfalls of Precision Medicine," said Dr. Rick Kittles, Professor and Founding Director of the Division of Health Equities, Department of Population Sciences, at City of Hope, and one of world's foremost scientists in the area of population genetics and cancer."This study goes beyond the barriers to participation and provides insight on the lack of genetic data from diverse populations and its impact on the value and utility of Precision Medicine.There is still much work to be done in order for all communities to benefit from Precision Medicine," said Dr. Kittles, who was not part of the study, but was asked by the authors to provide perspective on the study's findings.The problem is not trivial or academic.Patients whose tumor-cell sequencing cannot be matched with their normal-cell sequencing, run the risk of being misdiagnosed, researchers said."That means you might be getting the wrong therapy simply because of our lack of understanding of the genetic architecture based on one's ancestry," Dr. Craig said."These findings argue that we're really not doing a very good job of doing Precision Medicine for many populations."Dr. Carpten added, "Tumor-only sequencing in patients from populations that have undergone rapid expansion significantly decreases the precision of Precision Medicine.Importantly, the greater impact will be on individuals from underrepresented communities."Even for those of European ancestry, the lack of normal-cell sequencing to compare to tumor-cell sequencing still poses substantial risk, the study says: "Even within a European ancestry cohort, there are many individuals who still will have a high number of private variants that would result in a higher number of false positives."Still, the study points to the LumosVar, which the TGen-USC team has offered as an open-source tool for any researcher to use, as a substantial improvement in searching for potentially cancer-causing mutations."While the goal of the present study was to evaluate the benefit and limitations of leveraging allele frequencies to distinguish somatic and germline variants in unmatched tumor samples, in the process we have developed a tool that we have made available to the research community," the study says."We have clearly demonstrated that LumosVar has improved positive predictive value in calling somatic variants compared to database filtering, which is the most commonly used approach with unmatched tumor samples," the study says."When analyzing archival samples in a research setting, we believe LumosVar would be of great utility."The study -- titled: A method to reduce ancestry related germline false positives in tumor only somatic variant calling -- predicts that, as the cost of high-depth sequencing continues to decline, the sensitivity of tools like LumosVar will continue to improve.### This study was funded by The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation and by the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.LumosVar is available for download at: https:/ / github.com/ tgen/ LumosVar

Closest look yet at killer T-cell activity could yield new approach to tackling antibiotic resistance:::::ANN ARBOR -- In a study that could provide a roadmap for combatting the rising threat of drug-resistant pathogens, researchers have discovered the specific mechanism the body's T cells use to kill bacteria.University of Michigan researchers, in collaboration with colleagues at Harvard University, have discovered a key difference between the way immune cells attack bacteria and the way antibiotics do.Where drugs typically attack a single process within bacteria, T cells attack a host of processes at the same time.Today, the journal Cell published findings from a team headed by U-M's Sriram Chandrasekaran and Harvard's Judy Lieberman.It's a study with potential implications for drug-resistant pathogens--a problem projected to kill as many as 10 million people annually across the globe by the year 2050."We have a huge crisis of antibiotic resistance right now in that most drugs that treat diseases like tuberculosis or listeria, or pathogens like E.coli, are not effective," said Chandrasekaran, U-M assistant professor of biomedical engineering."So there is a huge need for figuring out how the immune system does its work.We hope to design a drug that goes after bacteria in a similar way."Killer T cells, formally known as cytotoxic lymphocytes, attack infected cells by producing the enzyme granzyme B.How this enzyme triggers death in bacteria has not been well understood, Chandrasekaran said.Proteomics -- a technique that measures protein levels in a cell--and computer modeling, allowed researchers to see granzyme B's multipronged attack targeting multiple processes.Chandrasekaran and his team monitored how T cells deal with three different threats: E. coli, listeria and tuberculosis."When exposed to granzyme B, the bacteria were unable to develop resistance to the multipronged attack, even after exposure over multiple generations," Chandrasekaran said."This enzyme breaks down multiple proteins that are essential for the bacteria to survive.It's essentially killing several birds with one stone."The possible applications of the new findings on T cells run the gamut from the creation of new medications to the repurposing of previously approved drugs in combination to fight infections by mimicking granzyme B. Chandrasekaran's team is now looking at how bacteria hide to avoid T-cell attacks.And the need for a new approach in some form is dire.World Health Organization officials describe antibiotic resistance as "one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today."Each year, an estimated 700,000 deaths are linked to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, according to the WHO.Projections show that number skyrocketing to 10 million by 2050.England's top health official, Sally Davies, recently said the lost effectiveness of antibiotics would mean "the end of modern medicine.""We really are facing -- if we don't take action now--a dreadful post-antibiotic apocalypse," she was quoted saying earlier this month."I don't want to say to my children that I didn't do my best to protect them and their children."Of particular concern is the fact that there are few new antibiotics in the pipeline.The heyday of new antibiotics occurred in the 1940s through the 1960s, with releases eventually grinding almost to a halt by the end of the 20th century."We've reached a point where we take what antibiotics can do for granted, and we can't do that anymore," Chandrasekaran said."We're taking inspiration from the human immune system, which has been fighting infections for thousands of years."### The paper is titled, "Granzyme B disrupts central metabolism and protein synthesis in bacteria to promote an immune cell death program."The research is funded by the National Institutes of Health, Harvard University and the University of Michigan.
Three new lung cancer genetic biomarkers are identified in Dartmouth study:::::In a large genome-wide association analysis, Dartmouth researchers identify novel gene-smoking interactions in lung cancer development, providing new candidate biomarkers and further closing the gap between heritability and lung cancer LEBANON, NH - Both environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to development of lung cancer.Tobacco smoking is the most well-known environmental risk factor associated with lung cancer.A Dartmouth research team led by Yafang Li, PhD, has conducted a study to display that gene-smoking interactions play important roles in the etiology of lung cancer.In their study, three novel SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), or variations in our DNA that underlie our susceptibility to developing disease, were identified in the interaction analysis, including two SNPs for non-small cell lung cancer risk and one SNP for squamous cell lung cancer risk.The three identified novel SNPs provide potential candidate biomarkers for lung cancer risk screening and intervention.The team's findings, "Genome-wide interaction study of smoking behavior and non-small cell lung cancer risk in Caucasian population," have been published in Carcinogenesis.The genotype and phenotype data used in this analysis came from OncoArray Consortium."Genome-wide interaction scanning remains a challenge as most genome-wide association studies are designed for main effect association analysis and have limited power for interaction analysis," said Li."This study is by far the largest genome-wide SNP-smoking interaction analysis reported for lung cancer.We also adopted a two-step strategy in the analysis to reduce the power loss from ordinary gene-environment interaction analysis."The three SNPs, identified in the team's study, stratify lung cancer risk by smoking behavior.These three SNPs can be potential biomarkers used to improve the precision to which researchers can categorize an individual's risk of lung cancer disease by smoking behavior, which are helpful for individualized prognosis and prediction of treatment plan.While this reported study was restricted to a Caucasian population and the results may not be generalized to other ethnicities because of the different genetic backgrounds, the team aims to further test the identified interaction effect using genotype from other populations."The limited overlap between discovery genotype and replication genotype may have reduced the power in our validation study," says Li."We believe as more genotype data becomes available in the future we can discover more important gene-smoking interaction in lung cancer disease."### Yafang Li, PhD, is an Instructor in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine.About Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center combines advanced cancer research at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine with patient-centered cancer care provided at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH, at Dartmouth-Hitchcock regional locations in Manchester, Nashua and Keene, NH, and St. Johnsbury, VT, and at partner hospitals throughout New Hampshire and Vermont.It is one of 49 centers nationwide to earn the National Cancer Institute's "Comprehensive Cancer Center" designation.Learn more about Norris Cotton Cancer Center research, programs, and clinical trials online at cancer.dartmouth.edu.
Mistakes in how proteins of the ear are built contribute to early hearing loss:::::PHILADELPHIA -- From the moment a baby is born, they are put through a battery of screenings to test for all sorts of characteristics, which includes the sense of hearing.One in 500 newborns fail their newborn hearing screens and are diagnosed with hearing loss, making this the most prevalent sensory deficit in humans.About half of these cases of early hearing loss in developed countries have an identifiable genetic cause, with mutations in over 100 different genes identified so far.Mutations in the majority of these genes result in isolated hearing loss (meaning not part of a more complex hearing loss syndrome such as Usher Syndrome).These cases are called non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, or SNHL, where an abnormal inner ear function is the only diagnostic feature.Despite the large number of identified hearing loss genes, the cause of inherited hearing loss remains a mystery in more than half the children.A trio of researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) found mutations in a master-switch protein called Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1) in individuals with SNHL.This research is published this week in Developmental Cell.In general, what connects most of the unexplained hearing-loss cases is that protein building in the cochlea during development goes awry.The cochlea has the all-important job of transforming mechanical energy in the form of sound waves into electrical signals that run along auditory nerves to the brain.Overall, ESRP1 determines how RNAs expressed in epithelial tissues are spliced together.This is achieved by splicing different exons (the sequence of DNA that codes for proteins) together in alternative ways to produce more than one messenger RNA (mRNA) from the same gene.These mRNAs go on to make different versions of encoded proteins.Co-senior authors Doug Epstein, PhD, a professor of Genetics, and Russ Carstens, MD, an associate professor of Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension, worked with Ian Krantz, MD, a professor of Pediatrics, and a family he cares for at the pediatric hearing clinic he directs at CHOP.In the family, two out of the six children use cochlear implants for their hearing loss.The team sequenced the entire exome in the siblings and parents and found damaging mutations in ESRP1, with associated hearing loss.Using induced pluripotent stem cells made from affected and unaffected family members they showed that RNA splicing switches were restored when the ESRP1 mutation was corrected with CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing."We were excited to see these results as they provided clear evidence that ESRP1 mutations were responsible for the splicing defects in the affected children" Epstein said.The gene editing experiments were performed by Penn co-authors Kiran Musunuru, MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Chris McDermott-Roe.Krantz and CHOP research intern, Ricky Tilton, MD, identified the ESRP1 gene mutations central to this family's case."Beyond providing a long sought after answer for this family, this research is exciting as it implicates this critical molecular pathway with a developmental diagnosis in humans for the first time and helps shed light on a novel contributor to hearing loss that may lead to new approaches for therapeutics down the road," said Krantz, who is also director of Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center in the Roberts Collaborative for Genetics and Individualized Medicine at CHOP.Mini Anatomy Lesson "The act of hearing is based on hair cells in the ear that are like piano keys sensitive to vibrations at different pitches," Epstein said.According to John Germiller, MD, PhD, director of Clinical Research in the Division of Otolaryngology at CHOP, the two siblings in the family had a defect in the vestibular canals of their ears, but no obvious defect in the cochlea.In addition, loss of the Esrp1 gene in mice leads to changes in the shape of the inner ear that is very similar to the situation with the siblings.To determine how ESRP1 mutations cause hearing loss Alex Rohacek, a graduate student in the Epstein lab, evaluated embryos in which Esrp1 was deleted in a mouse model developed by the Carstens lab.The most striking finding in this part of the study was that formation of the stria vascularis was blocked.This set of cells is equivalent to the battery of the cochlea in that it provides hair cells with energy to transmit signals to the auditory nerve.These findings implicate mutations in ESRP1 as a cause of SNHL.But how do alterations in RNA splicing result in hearing loss?Tom Bebee PhD, a postdoc in the Carstens lab and Rohacek compared RNA sequences from the cochleae of normal versus Esrp1 knockout mice.Working with a new algorithm developed by Yoseph Barash, PhD, an assistant professor of Genetics, the team made a list of differentially spliced genes."We saw impaired expression and splicing of genes with essential roles in cochlea development and auditory function," Carstens said.At the top on the list was a Fibroblast growth factor receptor gene that (Fgfr2) that Carstens had used to identify ESRP1 in earlier research.Because of altered Fgfr2 splicing, cells of the stria vascularis are missing in Esrp1-deficient mice, and possibly in humans.In the mice, formation of the stria vascularis was recovered by taking away a copy of Fgf9.The team says that this was one of the most compelling aspects of their study, because it speaks to the remarkable plasticity that exists in the genetic programs regulating inner ear development.Although this line of research is far from contributing to changes in the clinic, the team now has a much better understanding of how RNA splicing is controlled in the ear.This knowledge opens up possibilities about treatment ideas that can be tested in animal models as a first step toward human trials.### This work was funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health R01 DC006254, R01 DE024749, U01 HG006546, R01 AG046544.Penn Medicine is one of the

Health care access improves with state-level medicaid expansion:::::New Rochelle, NY, October 26, 2017-A new study has shown that low-income U.S. residents living in Medicaid expansion states are significantly more likely to have health insurance and to receive a routine check-up compared to low-income residents of non-expansion states.While state Medicaid expansion has positively impacted access to health care for low-income Americans, in states that decided not to expand Medicaid coverage, very low-income residents have been disproportionately negatively affected, according to the study published in Population Health Management, a peer-reviewed journal from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.The article is available free on the Population Health Management website until November 26, 2017.The article entitled "The Effects of State Medicaid Expansion on Low-Income Individuals' Access to Health Care: Multilevel Modeling" presents the results obtained from analyzing a nationally representative sample of more than a half million adults from 50 states and Washington, DC.Coauthors Sunha Choi, PhD, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Sungkyu Lee, PhD, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea, and Jason Matejkowski, PhD, University of Kansas, Lawrence, showed that not only were the residents of Medicaid expansion states more likely to have health insurance, but they were also significantly more likely to have a usual source of care and were less likely to avoid visiting a doctor because of cost."Given the current political environment and proposed deep cuts in Medicaid, this work emphasizes how vital access to care is for this population.Medicaid coverage promotes the health of the population," says David Nash, MD, MBA, Editor-in-Chief of Population Health Management and Dean and Dr. Raymond C. and Doris N.

Assaults decrease by 3 percent the Monday after Daylight Saving:::::On Sunday, Nov. 5, Daylight Saving Time officially ends.That means as we "fall back," we add an hour of sleep and return to Standard Time.When DST officially begins, which happened this year on Mar.12, we lose that same hour.Much has been studied about long-term effects of sleep deprivation.For instance, work by Adrian Raine, the Richard Perry University Professor of Criminology, Psychiatry and Psychology, connected daytime drowsiness at age 15 to violence at age 24.But fourth-year criminology doctoral student Rebecca Umbach wanted to better understand what happens immediately following sleep loss in the short term.Working with Raine and criminologist Greg Ridgeway, an associate professor of criminology and statistics, Umbach hypothesized that after a night with an hour less sleep--like what happens the Monday starting DST--people would become more antagonistic."In the spring, the day after we move into Daylight Saving Time, there are more car accidents, greater stock market losses, more workplace injury, reduced test scores, and higher suicide rates," Ridgeway says.Their research, however, told a different story: On Mondays after the start of DST, the overall assault rate dropped by about 3 percent, findings the researchers published in the Journal of Experimental Criminology."Sleep problems have previously been associated with increased antisocial and criminal behavior, so we were surprised to find that increased sleep was associated with increased offending," Raine says."This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that 40 to 60 minutes of lost sleep in one night is just not the same as months, or even years, of poor sleep."The researchers also looked at the fall time change, when we regain that hour of sleep.Though they found that assaults rose by about 3 percent the next day--a mirror image of the spring findings--they say their supporting evidence here isn't as robust.Regardless, the researchers say it is challenging to explain why these results occurred.Umbach surmises it may relate to internal biases."You think, 'If I don't get a lot of sleep, I'm going to be cranky and angry.'You assume that's the way you would react," she says."Your intention is to act more aggressively, but your behavior does not reflect that because you're tired.You're too lethargic and sleepy to act."Daylight Saving Time made for a logical study subject.For one, research has shown that we tend to lose sleep because of the time switch, as opposed to anticipating the shift and going to bed early.Secondly, nearly any other Monday of the year could, in theory, act as a control; to isolate sleep as the explanatory variable--rather than changes in weather or daylight, say--the Penn researchers chose the Monday the week after each time switch.Finally, a large database called the National Incident-Based Reporting System tracks the time, date, and details of individual crimes for many cities across the country.The researchers supplemented this with data from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.Though the researchers don't currently have plans for follow-up, Raine says anyone who ignores the morning alarm ring might take heed."Before we hit that snooze button, perhaps we should stop and think," he says."Hit the button and we might end up at least a little grumpier at work, and possibly more aggressive."###
Scientists find a role for Parkinson's gene in the brain:::::A new study published in the journal Neuron sheds light on the normal function of LRRK2, the most common genetic cause for late-onset Parkinson's disease.The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.For more than 10 years, scientists have known that mutations in the LRRK2 gene can lead to Parkinson's disease, yet both its role in the disease and its normal function in the brain remain unclear.In a study in mice, researchers have now found that LRRK is necessary for the survival of dopamine-containing neurons in the brain, the cells most affected by Parkinson's.Importantly, this finding could alter the design of treatments against the disease."Since its discovery, researchers have been trying to define LRRK2 function and how mutations may lead to Parkinson's disease," said Beth-Anne Sieber, Ph.D., program director at NINDS."The findings in this paper emphasize the importance of understanding the normal role for genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders."LRRK2 is found along with a closely related protein, LRRK1, in the brain.A mutation in LRRK2 alone can eventually produce Parkinson's disease symptoms and brain pathology in humans as they age.In mice, however, LRRK2 loss or mutation does not lead to the death of dopamine-producing neurons, possibly because LRRK1 plays a complementary or compensatory role during the relatively short, two-year mouse lifespan."Parkinson's-linked mutations such as LRRK2 have subtle effects that do not produce symptoms until late in life.Understanding the normal function of these types of genes will help us figure out what has gone wrong to cause disease," said Jie Shen, Ph.D., director of the NINDS Morris K. Udall Center of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital and senior author of this study.To better understand the roles of these related proteins in brain function using animal models, Shen and her colleagues created mice lacking both LRRK1 and LRRK2.They observed a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in areas of the brain consistent with PD beginning around 15 months of age.When the researchers looked at the affected brain cells more closely, they saw the buildup of a protein called -synuclein, a hallmark of Parkinson's, and defects in pathways that clear cellular "garbage."At the same time, more dopamine-containing neurons also began to show signs of apoptosis, the cells' "self-destruct" mechanism."Our findings show that LRRK is critical for the survival of the populations of neurons affected by Parkinson's disease," said Dr. Shen.While the deletion of both LRRK1 and LRRK2 did not affect overall brain size or cells in such areas of the brain as the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, the mice showed other significant effects such as a decrease in body weight and a lifespan of only 15 to 16 months.Thus, the scientists were unable to study other Parkinson's-related effects such as changes in behavior and movement nor were they able to conduct a long-term analysis of how LRRK's absence affects the brain.Interestingly, the most common disease-linked mutation in LRRK2 is thought to make the protein more active.As a result, most efforts to develop a treatment against that mutation have focused on inhibiting LRRK2 activity."The fact that the absence of LRRK leads to the death of dopamine-containing neurons suggests that the use of inhibitory drugs as a treatment for Parkinson's disease might not be the best approach," said Dr. Shen.Dr. Shen and her colleagues are now developing mice that have LRRK1 and 2 removed only in the dopamine-containing neurons of the brain.This specific deletion will allow the researchers to study longer-term and behavioral changes while avoiding the other consequences that lead to a shortened lifespan.### This study was supported by the NINDS (NS071251, NS094733) Article: Giaime et al.Age-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration and impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in LRRK-deficient mice.Neuron.October 19, 2017 DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.09.036 For more information: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/ disorders/ parkinsons_disease/ parkinsons_disease.htm http://www.ninds.nih.gov/ disorders/ parkinsons_disease/ parkinsons_research.htm http://www.ninds.nih.gov The NINDS (http://www.ninds.nih.gov ) is the nation's leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.
Underwater defense: New ways to protect divers in the deep:::::ARLINGTON, Va. -- Special Operations divers like Navy SEALs take on life-threatening risks such as enemy combatants and harsh environments.But another hazard is silent and unseen -- oxygen toxicity, the result of breathing lethal levels of oxygen that occur at depth and pressure.A professor at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, is conducting a new type of research that may protect Navy divers from this deadly threat.The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is sponsoring the work, being carried out by Dr. Blair Johnson, who teaches exercise physiology at the University at Buffalo.Oxygen toxicity stems from Navy divers' most precious asset -- oxygen itself.Breathable air consists primarily of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.While divers need oxygen to breathe underwater, the ratio of gasses can become hazardous the deeper they plunge."Recent evidence suggests that hormone levels critical to maintaining breathing and heart function drop sharply when someone is immersed underwater," said Dr. William D'Angelo, who manages ONR's Undersea Medicine Program."Dr. Johnson's groundbreaking research will expand on how water immersion triggers oxygen toxicity."Special Operations divers are especially vulnerable.They can encounter deadly levels of nitrogen and carbon dioxide gasses, requiring a rebreather to mitigate the toxicity.The divers use a closed-circuit rebreather that filters out the gasses in such a way that bubbles don't appear on the water's surface -- useful when trying to avoid detection by adversaries.However, this additional stealth increases how much oxygen the divers breathe and, combined with mission stress and physical exertion, can lead to seizures, convulsions, nausea, dizziness and even coma or death -- all symptoms of oxygen toxicity.Johnson's research focuses on the human body's sympathetic nervous system, which controls the instinctive "fight or flight" response -- a physical reaction to an attack, survival threat or perceived harmful event -- in order to maintain proper heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and body temperature.Johnson and his team built a special water-immersion tank in the University at Buffalo's Center for Research and Education in Special Environments, where scientists can study simulated extreme environments -- like breathing different gas mixtures underwater.During the experiments, which started this month, volunteers sit in the tank for four hours, with their head and one arm above water.They endure changes in water temperature, and breathe air through a rebreather that contains 100-percent oxygen.Their dry arms are outfitted with sensors to measure vital signs.Johnson's research is unique because his team also sticks acupuncture needle-like microelectrodes directly into nerves--a process called microneurography.This allows them to measure real-time impulses to muscles, skin and blood vessels -- and record reactions to shifts in water temperature as well as breathing high levels of oxygen and other gas mixtures."It's been shown that breathing 100-percent oxygen on land reduces sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate and blood pressure, which could lead to oxygen toxicity in the water," said Johnson."How does that apply to someone immersed in water?What impact does cold water have?What impact does breathing different gas mixtures have?We're looking at all these factors to prevent or mitigate oxygen toxicity risk."Johnson's research is the first to directly measure sympathetic nerve activity through microneurography -- with someone immersed in water and breathing different gas mixtures.Each of his 50 volunteers will participate in up to eight immersion sessions.Afterward, Johnson will evaluate the data to come up with potential preventative measures against oxygen toxicity.###
Blood flow in the developing heart guides maturation of heart valves:::::PHILADELPHIA --Congenital heart valve defects appear in 2 percent of all live births, making them the most common type of birth defect.While some of these defects have been linked to specific genetic mutations, the majority have no clearly definable genetic cause, suggesting that epigenetic factors - changes in gene expression versus an alteration in the genetic code -- play an important role.Now researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have found that the force, or shear, of blood flow against the cells lining the early heart valve sends signals for heart "cushion" cells to become fully formed valves.Their findings are published in Developmental Cell.Heart valves ensure that the beating heart drives blood flow in one direction.As the heart beats continuously over a lifetime, valve function must be flawless.Obstruction of forward flow or backward flow due to a defective valve can result in heart failure.Most serious valve defects are treated surgically, with the original valve able to be repaired and other times it must be replaced.However, in general valve replacements are held off in growing children for as long as possible to avoid outgrowing a valve replaced too early.Embryonic heart valves develop as large cushions that, during development, reshape and thin to form mature valve leaflets."The maturation of these big fluffy cushions into the perfectly fitting leaflets of a mature heart valve is an architectural marvel," said senior author Mark Kahn, MD, a professor of Cardiovascular Medicine."We showed that shear-responsive KLF2-Wnt protein signaling is the basis of this remodeling."Lauren Goddard, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Kahn Lab, found that the protein KLF2 was expressed by the shear-sensing cells that line the primitive valve cushions.KLF2's expression was highest in the regions of the valve that experience the strongest shear forces.Using mouse models, she found that deletion of KLF2 in these cells resulted in large cushions that failed to mature properly.Profiling of the genes expressed by early cardiac cushion cells revealed that loss of KLF2 resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the Wnt binding partner, WNT9B, a molecule important in the valve maturation communication path.Loss of WNT9B in the mouse resulted in defective valve remodeling similar to what happens when KLF2 is deleted, suggesting it is a key downstream target of KLF2.Work done by co-author Julien Vermot from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, an expert in how shear forces determine zebrafish development, demonstrated that expression of the gene for WNT9B is restricted to the cells that govern developing heart valves and is dependent on the shear force of early blood flow.These findings were instrumental in linking shear forces to KLF2-WNT9B signaling during valve remodeling.This work is the first to demonstrate how blood flow shapes developing heart valves into mature valve leaflets.These studies, say the researchers, predict that even a minor breakdown in the series of precisely orchestrated cell-cell communications required to accurately pass on signals from blood flow may result in subtly defective valves.This idea supports an epigenetic explanation for common congenital valve defects.### The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01HL094326, T32HL007954, R0111770, R01116997), the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, and the European Research Council.
IOF study reveals low dietary calcium intake in Asia and Latin America:::::A new study led by an International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) research committee has found that daily average calcium intake among adults varies widely around the world.Critically low intake was found in certain Asian, African and Latin American countries - while studies showed nearly double the intake in many European countries and in the USA.Calcium is a major building block of bone, accounting for about 30-35% of its mass and much of its strength.The impact of calcium intake is most significant during adolescence, when the skeleton gains bone mass, and during later life when bone loss occurs at a rate of about 1% per year, resulting in calcium loss of approximately 15 g per year.A major concern is that in countries with sub-optimal dietary calcium intake the population may be putting itself at increased risk of osteoporosis and related fractures.The researchers looked at the scientific literature and other data sources for eligible studies that reported national averages of daily calcium intake among adults around the world.The studies varied widely, including by how nationally representative they were, and by their sample size.Nevertheless, there were enough eligible data for 74 countries, which revealed several notable regional trends: Across the 74 countries with data, average national dietary calcium intake ranges from 175 to 1233 mg/day; Southern and Eastern Asia had world's lowest average calcium intakes -- often less than 400 mg a day; Countries in South America and Africa mostly had average intakes in the mid-range, between about 400 and 700 mg a day; Only Northern European countries registered calcium intakes greater than 1,000 mg a day; Significant variation was seen within regions as well: for e.g., in Latin America, Colombia showed one of the world's lowest intakes with 297 mg/day while in Mexico the daily average was found to be 805 mg/day; Average calcium intake is generally lower in women than in men, but there are no clear patterns across countries regarding relative calcium intake by age, sex, or socioeconomic status.The study's lead author Ethan Balk, associate professor at the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health, Brown University School of Public Health, stated: "In many parts of the world there is lower intake than there should be for good bone health.While consumption is highest among adults in North America and Europe, it is alarmingly low in Asia and in some of the world's most populous countries, including in China, India and Indonesia."IOF expects that the data will motivate action to promote increased calcium consumption, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region and in places where calcium consumption hasn't been documented.An interactive online global map representing the study findings will be launched by IOF on the occasion of the World Congress on Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases in April 2018.Bess Dawson-Hughes, M.D, chair of the IOF Calcium Steering Committee and Director of the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, commented: "This study draws attention to regions where calcium intake needs to be assessed and where measures to increase calcium intake would likely provide skeletal benefits for the population.This is a necessary first step in developing culturally appropriate strategies and policies to address the deficiency."The study 'Global dietary calcium intake among adults: a systematic review' has been published in the journal Osteoporosis International.### Reference: Balk E.M., Adam G.P., Langberg V.N., Earley A., Clark P., Ebeling P.R., Mithal A., Rizzoli R., Zerbini C.A.F., Pierroz D.D., Dawson-Hughes B., for the IOF Calcium Steering Committee.Global dietary calcium intake among adults: a systematic review.Osteoporos Int (2017).doi.org/10.1007/s00198-017-4230-x The study was funded by an unrestricted grant to the International Osteoporosis Foundation from Pfizer Consumer Health.About IOF

Meyer, a TTUHSC Ph.D. candidate, along with his advisor, Pablo Artigas, Ph.D., associate professor at the TTUHSC Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics, presented, in collaboration with Craig Gatto, Ph.D., at Illinois State University, a study of the functional effects of specific mutations of the Na/K pump found in tumors that induce primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome).Aldosterone is a hormone made by the adrenal gland that helps control blood pressure by changing the levels of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium in the blood.Too much aldosterone causes the body to hold onto sodium and water and to get rid of potassium in unsafe amounts, increasing the amount of fluid in the body, and therefore increasing a person's blood pressure."Primary aldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and is often caused by a benign tumor in one adrenal gland which continuously produces aldosterone in the absence of normal physiological triggers," Meyer said."These tumors frequently have defective sodium potassium pumps."The sodium potassium pump maintains and regulates a cell's ion concentrations by moving three sodium out and two potassium into the cell using an ATP molecule.This extrudes one net positive electric charge per cycle.It was believed that sodium potassium pump mutants increase aldosterone production because they mediate an atypical inflow of charge into the cell, a so-called "gain-of-function," that is opposite in direction compared to the usual outflow of electric charge produced by the normal pumps.Under this "gain-of-function" proposal, a significant inflow of charge would reduce the voltage difference across the membrane, thus increasing aldosterone production.Meyer, Gatto and Artigas investigated the electric signals from normal and mutant pumps to test if the inward currents (positive charge inflow) through each mutated pump was large enough to produce a significant change in voltage, and therefore represent a common mechanism behind the pathology associated with the mutations."We observed that the inward currents through several of these mutants were either too small or inexistent," said Meyer."Our results demonstrate that inward current cannot be a common "gain-of-function" mechanism underlying the generation of primary aldosteronism.However, we found that impaired sodium and potassium transport was common to all mutant pumps, so we concluded that a "loss-of-function" must be the common mechanism by which Na/K pump mutants contribute to constitutive aldosterone production."Artigas said it's always important to understand why and how these and other mutations induce disease."The mechanisms uncovered here surely apply to other illnesses in which the Na/K pumps are mutated, including hemiplegic migraines and other neurological disorders," Artigas said."Knowing the fundamental cause of an illness is the first step in order to one day improve the lives of the people with these mutations".In a published commentary about this research, Hans-Jurgen Apell from the University of Konstanz in Germany, said, "The pleasure of reading this paper was that, when following the authors through their presentation and - as is common to me in this process - asking as a critical reader at a certain point, "But what if...," a satisfying answer was provided in the next (or one of the next) paragraph(s).In their systematic approach, no obvious objection or critical thought has been missed, resulting in a convincing piece of insight into a complex molecular mechanisms that eventually leads to the "phenotype" of primary aldosteronism caused by mutations of the Na,K-ATPase.And this makes it worth reading."###
Northeastern researchers discover fundamental rules for how the brain controls movement:::::The human brain is a mysterious supercomputer.Billions of neurons buzz within an intricate network that controls our every thought, feeling, and movement.And we've only just begun to understand how it all works.To conquer the puzzle of the human mind, researchers at Northeastern's Center for Complex Network Research start with simpler models.The brain of a nematode worm, for example, has about 300 neurons and 2,200 synapses.Using the nematode as one test system, scientists at CCNR have spent the past several years understanding how a network controls itself--for instance, which individual neurons in the worm's brain are in charge of a backward wiggle.And in research published online in Nature, they describe for the first time their ability to predict, test, and confirm with unprecedented detail how a nematode's brain controls the way it moves."I am delighted to have the first direct experimental confirmation of the control principles," said Albert-Lszl Barabsi, Robert Gray Dodge Professor of Network Science and University Distinguished Professor of Physics, and director of the Center for Complex Network Research."And I'm equally excited that it offered us a way to systematically predict, with exceptional accuracy, the neurons that are involved in specific processes."Researchers in Barabsi's lab studied the nematode brain, which has been mapped neuron by neuron, synapse by synapse.They developed a theory to predict precisely what neurons would control specific types of locomotion--the worm's ability to squirm and scoot around.Then, colleagues from the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, tested the predictions by killing individual neurons from the nematode brain with a laser.They then measured the effects of these "microsurgeries" on behavior."Remarkably, the predictions were confirmed, supporting the theory and providing new insight into how individual neurons control body movements," said William Schafer, a scientist at the MRC lab who led the laser experiments.This is an important first step toward what Emma Towlson, a postdoctoral researcher at CCNR and one of the study's lead authors, calls "the dream."One day, researchers may be able to translate a version of the nematode control model to the human brain.This would be life-changing for patients with cerebral palsy, Lou Gehrig's disease, and other ailments that lead to loss of muscle function."We could, in theory, turn something that is uncontrollable into something that is controllable.This is the ultimate ambition, but there is a huge leap in the middle," Towlson said.To make sense of the nematode brain, Towlson created a map of the connections between neurons and muscles.She was surprised by the relative simplicity of the model, composed of ones and zeros that indicated whether or not there was a connection.Researchers also made a number of assumptions with regard to the biological parameters."And it still comes out with this level of prediction," Towlson said."That amazes me.In my mind, that says we're really getting at something fundamental."Moving forward, Towlson would like to examine the nematode brain network in more detail.She knows which neurons control which muscles and their corresponding movements.But how much energy and time does one wiggle take compared to another, and does that explain why the worms move in the ways they do?Towlson also wants to apply the control principles to other models."I think the next sensible steps for us are zebra fish, maybe mouse, and then human," Towlson said."The human brain is always the ultimate dream."###
American College of Chest Physicians unveils new lung cancer screening guidelines at CHEST 2017:::::TORONTO (October 26, 2017) - Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast and prostate cancers combined, and low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer has become a standard practice mostly due to the results of the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Evidence continues to evolve, in turn informing the benefits and risks of LDCT in clinical practice.Lung cancer experts and authors of the manuscript submitted to the journal CHEST -- Screening for Lung Cancer: CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report -- and will present the updated evidence to provide recommendations at CHEST 2017.Key recommendations and shifts from previous guidelines include: For asymptomatic smokers and former smokers age 55 to 77 who have smoked 30 pack-years or more and either continue to smoke or have quit within the past 15 years, we suggest that annual screening with low-dose CT should be offered.For asymptomatic smokers and former smokers who do not meet the smoking and age criteria in Recommendation #1 but are deemed to be at high risk of having/developing lung cancer based on clinical risk prediction calculators, we suggest that low-dose CT screening should not be routinely performed.For individuals who have accumulated fewer than 30 pack-years of smoking or are younger than age 55 or older than age 77, or have quit smoking more than 15 years ago, and do not have a high risk of having/developing lung cancer based on clinical risk prediction calculators, we recommend that low-dose CT screening should not be performed.For individuals with comorbidities that adversely influence their ability to tolerate the evaluation of screen-detected findings, or tolerate treatment of an early stage screen-detected lung cancer, or that substantially limit their life expectancy, we recommend that low-dose CT screening should not be performed."This guideline differs from our previous guideline as we went beyond discussing harms and benefits," said Peter Mazzone, M.D., F.C.C.P., guideline chair."We addressed implementation of low-dose CT screening, including who to screen, how to identify appropriate patients for screening, how to conduct a shared-decision-making visit, how to perform LDCT and how to manage abnormal findings.""The potential benefit of cancer screening to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths must be balanced with potential harms of screening," said Gerard Silvestri, M.D., F.C.C.P., guideline panelist and CHEST immediate past president."Current evidence suggests that even within groups at high risk of developing a cancer, only a small fraction of those screened will benefit, while everyone screened is exposed to potential harms including physical and psychosocial consequences of identifying and subsequently evaluating a screen-detected nodule, radiation exposure, overdiagnosis and overtreatment.For this reason, our recommendations for screening have evolved to be even more selective and specifically target those highest risk populations.The evidence currently does not support widespread adoption of lung cancer screening outside of those patients described in our recommendations."Further results from the guidelines will be shared at the CHEST Annual Meeting 2017 in Toronto on Wednesday, November 1, 11 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, room 701A.The session will also be live streamed on Facebook Live by CHEST.The recommendation summary along with remarks for each recommendation and abstract can be viewed on the website of the American College of Chest Physicians, and forthcoming complete manuscript will be published in the journal CHEST.ABOUT CHEST 2017 CHEST 2017 is the 83rd annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians, held October 28 to November 1, 2017, in Toronto, Ontario.The American College of Chest Physicians, publisher of the journal CHEST, is the global leader in advancing best patient outcomes through innovative chest medicine education, clinical research and team-based care.Its mission is to champion the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of chest diseases through education, communication and research.It serves as an essential connection to clinical knowledge and resources for its 19,000+ members from around the world who provide patient care in pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine.For more information about CHEST 2017, visit chestmeeting.chestnet.org, or follow CHEST meeting hashtag, #CHEST2017, on social media.###
Cleveland Clinic leads development of new guidelines for radiation in breast cancer:::::Cleveland Clinic researcher Chirag Shah, M.D., led the development of updated guidelines for the appropriate and safe utilization of accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI).The guidelines are published online in the journal, Brachytherapy.APBI is a breast radiation therapy technique in which targeted radiation is delivered, either via brachytherapy (applicator devices or multiple catheters) or through external radiation, specifically to the part of the breast where the tumor was removed without treating the whole breast.For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancer, APBI has been shown to be an alternative to standard whole-breast irradiation, allowing for a reduction in the duration of radiation therapy.The technique, by reducing the amount of normal healthy breast tissue treated with radiation, may also reduce side effects of treatment and improve cosmetic outcomes.In updating the guidelines, Dr. Shah led a group of physicians - appointed by the American Brachytherapy Society, with expertise in breast cancer and breast brachytherapy - to develop a consensus statement.The new guidelines recommend the technique for a broader group of patient by allowing younger patients to be eligible as well as those with DCIS.The authors' consensus is that the appropriate candidates for APBI include patients aged 45 years or older; all invasive histologies and ductal carcinoma in situ; tumors 3 cm or less; node negative; estrogen receptor positive/negative; no lymphovascular space invasion; and negative margins."The updated guidelines support clinicians by offering them the ability to appropriately select patients for APBI, and data that supports the techniques," said Dr. Shah."Guidelines allow for the selection of patients who can finish radiation treatment in one week or less, compared to the traditional period of three to six weeks, and potentially a reduction in side effects depending on the APBI technique."The previous APBI guidelines, also led by Dr. Shah, were developed in 2013.Since then, multiple randomized trials have been published which have increased the amount of data available to develop the updated guidelines.The authors' recommendation was based on review of literature including randomized trials, prospective studies, multi-institutional series, and single-institution reports addressing clinical outcomes and toxicities with APBI.### About Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.Located in Cleveland, Ohio, it was founded in 1921 by four renowned physicians with a vision of providing outstanding patient care based upon the principles of cooperation, compassion and innovation.Cleveland Clinic has pioneered many medical breakthroughs, including coronary artery bypass surgery and the first face transplant in the United States.U.S. News & World Report consistently names Cleveland Clinic as one of the nation's best hospitals in its annual "America's Best Hospitals" survey.Among Cleveland Clinic's 51,000 employees are more than 3,500 full-time salaried physicians and researchers and 14,000 nurses, representing 140 medical specialties and subspecialties.Cleveland Clinic's health system includes a 165-acre main campus near downtown Cleveland, 10 regional hospitals, more than 150 northern Ohio outpatient locations - including 18 full-service family health centers and three health and wellness centers - and locations in Weston, Fla.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Toronto, Canada; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and London, England.In 2016, there were 7.1 million outpatient visits, 161,674 hospital admissions and 207,610 surgical cases throughout Cleveland Clinic's health system.Patients came for treatment from every state and 185 countries.Visit us at clevelandclinic.org.Follow us at twitter.com/ClevelandClinic.News and resources available at newsroom.clevelandclinic.org.Editor's Note: Cleveland Clinic News Service is available to provide broadcast-quality interviews and B-roll upon request.
How harmful are nano-copper and anti-fungal combinations in the waterways?:::::A recently published article in Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, "Effects of Micronized and Nano-Copper Azole on Marine Benthic Communities" explores the risks to the smallest creatures in aquatic communities posed by increased use of the anti-fouling wood treatment.Copper salts have a long history of use as a wood preservative.Recently, copper nanoparticles are being mixed in formulation with anti-fungal azoles, finding their way into fungicides, algaecides, and important to this research, into paints used to protect boats and other submerged surfaces, where they do leach off the surface and into the waterways.Little is known about the ecological effects of this combination on aquatic life.Author Kay Ho and her colleagues used a unique method combining in-field and laboratory practices to assess the effects of micronized copper azole (MCA) on estuarine benthic communities.The findings indicate that MCA represents a source of harm to marine benthic communities comparable to that from copper salts, such as copper sulfate.The authors note that there is a need for "better understanding of benthic community interactions when exposed to nanomaterial stress."###
Pregnancy poses no greater risk to breast cancer survivors:::::A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute indicates that pregnancy does not incur a greater risk of relapse for survivors of breast cancer.The safety of pregnancy for women with history of breast cancer has remained a controversial topic for many years, especially in cases of estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer.In these cases, hormones can promote the growth and spread of breast cancer so, as hormone levels change during pregnancy, it was thought that breast cancer would be more likely to recur in survivors of ER positive breast cancer during pregnancy.The study compared breast cancer survivors who became pregnant with those who did not become pregnant over an average period of 7 years.The study tracked the recurrence rate of breast cancer and found that those who became pregnant did not experience a greater rate of recurrence, even in cases of ER positive breast cancer.These findings show that pregnancy does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence, alleviating fears that pregnancy poses a greater risk to breast cancer survivors.The study notes that fears among physicians and patients may be a factor in the high rate of abortion among women who have a history of breast cancer.### The paper "Long-term Safety of Pregnancy Following Breast Cancer According to Estrogen Receptor Status" is available at: https:/ / academic.oup.com/ jnci/ article/ doi/ 10.1093/ jnci/ djx206/ 4565505/ Long-term-Safety-of-Pregnancy-Following-Breast Direct correspondence to: Hatem A.

Substantial decline in global measles deaths, but disease still kills 90 000 per year:::::Substantial decline in global measles deaths, but disease still kills 90 000 per year 26 October 2017 | GENEVA/NEW YORK/ATLANTA - In 2016, an estimated 90 000 people died from measles an 84% drop from more than 550 000 deaths in 2000 according to a new report published today by leading health organizations.This marks the first time global measles deaths have fallen below 100 000 per year.Saving an average of 1.3 million lives per year through measles vaccine is an incredible achievement and makes a world free of measles seem possible, even probable, in our lifetime, says Dr Robert Linkins, of the Measles and Rubella Initiative (MR&I) and Branch Chief of Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.M&RI is a partnership formed in 2001 of the American Red Cross, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF, and WHO.Since 2000, an estimated 5.5 billion doses of measles-containing vaccines have been provided to children through routine immunization services and mass vaccination campaigns, saving an estimated 20.4 million lives.We have seen a substantial drop in measles deaths for more than two decades, but now we must strive to reach zero measles cases, says Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, Director of WHOs Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals.Measles elimination will only be reached if measles vaccines reach every child, everywhere.The world is still far from reaching regional measles elimination goals.Coverage with the first of two required doses of measles vaccine has stalled at approximately 85% since 2009, far short of the 95% coverage needed to stop measles infections, and coverage with the second dose, despite recent increases, was only 64% in 2016.Far too many children 20.8 million are still missing their first measles vaccine dose.More than half of these unvaccinated children live in six countries: Nigeria (3.3 million), India (2.9 million), Pakistan (2.0 million), Indonesia (1.2 million), Ethiopia (0.9 million), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.7 million).Since measles is a highly contagious viral disease, large outbreaks continue to occur in these and other countries in Europe and North America, putting children at risk of severe health complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, encephalitis, blindness, and death.Agencies noted that progress in reaching measles elimination could be reversed when polio-funded resources supporting routine immunization services, measles and rubella vaccination campaigns, and surveillance, diminish and disappear following polio eradication.Countries with the greatest number of measles deaths rely most heavily on polio-funded resources and are at highest risk of reversing progress after polio eradication is achieved.This remarkable drop in measles deaths is the culmination of years of hard work by health workers, governments, and development agencies to vaccinate millions of children in the worlds poorest countries, said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the worlds largest supporters of measles immunization programmes.However we cannot afford to be complacent.Too many children are still missing out on lifesaving vaccines.To reach these children and set ourselves on a realistic road to measles elimination we need to dramatically improve routine immunization backed by strong health systems.Note to editors: Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographical area for more than 12 months, in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.Launched in 2001, the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) is led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and the World Health Organization.M&RI is committed to ensuring that no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome, reducing measles deaths by 95% by 2015, and achieving measles and rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions by 2020.The WHO Region of the Americas has sustained measles elimination since 2002, and the European and Western Pacific regions have made significant elimination progress.All six WHO regions have established measles elimination goals.The latest data is published in this weeks WHOs Weekly Epidemiological Report and in CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.For more information, please contact: Fadla Chaib WHO Telephone: +41 22 791 3228 Mobile: +41 79 475 5556 E-mail: chaibf@who.int Sabrina Sidhu UNICEF New York Telephone: +12128246583 Mobile +1 917 476 1537 Email: ssidhu@unicef.org James Fulker Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Telephone: +41 79 429 55 05 Email: jfulker@gavi.org Amy Rowland Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Telephone: +1 770 488 5104 Mobile: +1 678-332-9601 Email: isc4@cdc.gov
Director-General rescinds Goodwill Ambassador appointment:::::Director-General rescinds Goodwill Ambassador appointment Over the last few days, I have reflected on my appointment of H.E.President Robert Mugabe as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases in Africa.As a result I have decided to rescind the appointment.I have listened carefully to all who have expressed their concerns, and heard the different issues that they have raised.I have also consulted with the Government of Zimbabwe and we have concluded that this decision is in the best interests of the World Health Organization.It is my aim to build a worldwide movement for global health.This movement must work for everyone and include everyone.For me, what is important is to build political leadership and create unity around bringing health to all, based on WHOs core values.I remain firmly committed to working with all countries and their leaders to ensure that every one has access to the health care they need.We must build bridges that bring us together and help us move forward in our quest to achieve universal health coverage.I thank everyone who has voiced their concerns and shared their thoughts.I depend on constructive debate to help and inform the work I have been elected to do.
WHO supports containment of rare virus on Uganda-Kenya border:::::WHO supports containment of rare virus on Uganda-Kenya border 20 October 2017 | GENEVA - WHO is working to contain an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) that has appeared in eastern Uganda on the border with Kenya.At least one person is confirmed to have died of MVD and several hundred people may have been exposed to the virus at health facilities and at traditional burial ceremonies in Kween District, a mountainous area 300 kilometres northeast of Kampala.The first case was detected by the Ministry of Health on 17 October, a 50-year-old woman who died at a health centre of fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea on 11 October.Laboratory testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed the cause of death as MVD.The womans brother had also died of similar symptoms three weeks earlier and was buried at a traditional funeral.He worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave inhabited by Rousettus bats, which are natural hosts of the Marburg virus.One suspected and one probable case are being investigated and provided with medical care.An active search for people who may have been exposed to or infected by the virus is underway.The Ministry of Health has sent a rapid response team to the area supported by staff from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFNET).WHO is providing medical supplies, guidance on safe and dignified burials, and has released USD 500 000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to finance immediate response activities.We are working with health authorities to rapidly implement response measures, said Ibrahima-Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergency Director for the Africa region.Uganda has previously managed Ebola and Marburg outbreaks but international support is urgently required to scale up the response as the overall risk of national and regional spread of this epidemic-prone disease is high.Marburg virus disease is a rare disease with a high mortality rate for which there is no specific treatment.Notes to editors Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by the Marburg virus from the Filoviridae family; the same family as the Ebola virus.This virus is among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans.The incubation period is 2-21 days, and symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia.Although MVD is rare, it can result in large outbreaks with high case fatality rates (CFR range from 23 to 90%).The disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g.monkeys and fruit bats).In Uganda, the following MVD outbreaks have been recently documented: 2007: 4 cases, including 2 deaths, in Ibanda District, Western Uganda 2008: 2 unrelated cases in travelers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda 2012: 15 cases, including 4 deaths, in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda 2014: 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda.For further information, please contact: Christian Lindmeier WHO, Geneva Telephone: +41 79 500 6552 Email: lindmeierch@who.int
7 000 newborns die every day, despite steady decrease in under-five mortality, new report says:::::7 000 newborns die every day, despite steady decrease in under-five mortality, new report says At current trends, 30 million newborns will die within first 28 days of life between 2017 and 2030 19 October 2017 | NEW YORK/GENEVA/WASHINGTON DC - Every day in 2016, 15 000 children died before their fifth birthday, 46% of them or 7 000 babies died in the first 28 days of life, according to a new UN report.Levels and Trends in Child Mortality 2017, reveals that although the number of children dying before the age of five is at a new low 5.6 million in 2016, compared with nearly 9.9 million in 2000 the proportion of under-five deaths in the newborn period has increased from 41% to 46% during the same period.The lives of 50 million children under-five have been saved since 2000, a testament to the serious commitment by governments and development partners to tackle preventable child deaths, said UNICEF Chief of Health, Stefan Swartling Peterson.But unless we do more to stop babies from dying the day they are born, or days after their birth, this progress will remain incomplete.We have the knowledge and technologies that are required we just need to take them where they are most needed.At current trends, 60 million children will die before their fifth birthday between 2017 and 2030, half of them newborns, according to the report released by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the Population Division of UNDESA which make up the Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME).Most newborn deaths occurred in two regions: Southern Asia (39%) and sub-Saharan Africa (38%).Five countries accounted for half of all new-born deaths: India (24%), Pakistan (10%), Nigeria (9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (4%) and Ethiopia (3%).To achieve universal health coverage and ensure more newborns survive and thrive, we must serve marginalized families," says Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General for Family, Womens and Childrens Health at WHO."To prevent illness, families require financial power, their voices to be heard and access to quality care.Improving quality of services and timely care during and after childbirth must be prioritized.The report notes that many lives can be saved if global inequities are reduced.If all countries achieved the average mortality of high-income countries, 87% of under-five deaths could have been averted and almost 5 million lives could have been saved in 2016.It is unconscionable that in 2017, pregnancy and child birth are still life-threatening conditions for women, and that 7 000 newborns die daily, said Tim Evans, Senior Director of Health Nutrition and Population at the World Bank Group.The best measure of success for Universal Health Coverage is that every mother should not only be able to access health care easily, but that it should be quality, affordable care that will ensure a healthy and productive life for her children and family.We are committed to scaling up our financing to support country demand in this area, including through innovative mechanisms like the Global Financing Facility (GFF).Pneumonia and diarrhea top the list of infectious diseases which claim the lives of millions of children under-five globally, accounting for 16% and 8% of deaths, respectively.Preterm birth complications and complications during labour or child birth were the causes of 30% of newborn deaths in 2016.In addition to the 5.6 million under-5 deaths, 2.6 million babies are stillborn each year, the majority of which could be prevented.Ending preventable child deaths can be achieved by improving access to skilled health-professionals during pregnancy and at the time of birth; lifesaving interventions, such as immunization, breastfeeding and inexpensive medicines; and increasing access to water and sanitation, that are currently beyond the reach of the worlds poorest communities.For the first time, mortality data for older children age 5 to 14 was included in the report, capturing other causes of death such as accidents and injuries.Approximately 1 million children aged 5 to 14 died in 2016.This new report highlights the remarkable progress since 2000 in reducing mortality among children under age 5, said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Mr. LIU Zhenmin.Despite this progress, large disparities in child survival still exist across regions and countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.Yet many deaths at these ages are easily preventable through simple, cost-effective interventions administered before, during and immediately after birth.Reducing inequities and reaching the most vulnerable newborns, children and mothers are essential for achieving the SDG target on ending preventable childhood deaths and for ensuring that no one will be left behind.The report also notes that: In sub-Saharan Africa, estimates show that 1 child in 36 dies in the first month, while in the worlds high income countries, the ratio is 1 in 333.Unless the rate of progress improves, more than 60 countries will miss the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end preventable deaths of newborns by 2030 and half would not meet the target of 12 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births by 2050.These countries account for about 80% of neonatal deaths in 2016.Notes to editors Broadcast quality images and b-roll available here.Download the report here.About UN-IGME The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation or UN IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonise estimates within the UN system, improve methods for child mortality estimation report on progress towards child survival goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality.UN-IGME is led by UNICEF and includes WHO, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.For more information visit: http://www.childmortality.org/ For further information, please contact: Kimberly Chriscaden WHO Geneva Telephone: +41 79 603 1891 Email: chriscadenk@who.int Christian Lindmeier WHO, Geneva Telephone: +41 79 500 6552 Email: lindmeierch@who.int Yemi Lufadeju UNICEF New York Telephone: +1 917 213 4034 Email: glufadeju@unicef.org Rita Wallace UNICEF New York Telephone: +1 917 909 9542 Email: rwallace@unicef.org
Governments commit to reduce suffering and deaths from noncommunicable diseases:::::Governments commit to reduce suffering and deaths from noncommunicable diseases 18 October 2017 | Montevideo - Heads of State and Government and ministers from around the world today committed to new and bold action to reduce suffering and death from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), primarily heart and lung diseases, cancers and diabetes, the worlds leading killers.Governments endorsed the Montevideo Roadmap 2018-2030 on NCDs as a Sustainable Development Priority at the opening of the three-day Global Conference on Noncommunicable Diseases in Montevideo, hosted by WHO and the Presidency of Uruguay.The pledge follows agreement by world leaders to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030 as part of the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development.Today, NCDs kill 40 million annually, more than any other cause of death.Of these deaths, 15 million occur prematurely among people aged 30-70 years, and 7 million in low- and low-middle income countries.It is shocking to see the growing toll that diseases like cancer and diabetes are taking on the people who can least afford healthcare, said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Ad-hanom Ghebreyesus.Governments must act on pledges to prevent these diseases in the first place, and to en-sure that people can obtain services to treat them, he added.Failure do to this imposes massive costs on individuals and communities.It totally contradicts global commitments to sustainable development.Co-conference organizer, President of Uruguay Dr Tabar Vzquez, said the Montevideo Roadmap represented a bold commitment by governments to intensify action to protect people from the harms of NCDs.Governments should be fully committed to reducing the toll from NCDs, as the human and economic costs are far too great to ignore, said Dr Vzquez.This places a heavy responsi-bility on governments to act.But by taking determined action to protect people from the main risks causing NCDs, we will make it easier for people to enjoy healthier lives, while supporting communities and countries to grow and develop strongly.The Montevideo Roadmap highlights the need for coordinated and coherent action from all sectors and the whole of society, as many of the main drivers of ill health lie outside the control of health ministries, systems and professionals.Non-State actors, including civil so-ciety and industry, have important roles to play.It also points out that the bulk of NCD deaths could have been prevented by action against tobacco, air pollution, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol as well as by improved disease detection and treatment.Dr Vzquez added: Beating NCDs, and promoting health, are issues for everyone and across every area of government.Finance ministries save lives by taxing tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks, by cutting consumption and raising revenues to treat NCDs.Trade and investment agreements should not be used as an excuse to look the other way, wash our hands and not protect the public health of our citizens.Education ministries need to ensure our youth are well informed and taught how to make the healthy choice, that schools make available healthy food and provide opportunities for play and recreation.The Montevideo Roadmap identifies a range of challenges, including: uneven and insufficient progress to reduce premature deaths from NCDs; influence of the private sector on governments to prioritize trade over public health goals; lack of high-level political leadership to ensure that health promotion and NCD pre-vention and control are part of all areas of government policy.Dr Tedros, who last week announced the launch of a new WHO high-level commission on NCDs, added: This conference is a critical opportunity to accelerate efforts to get ahead of noncommunicable diseases.We must be prepared to have some tough conversations, and to take brave action.One vital step is for all countries to follow trailblazers like Uruguay that have ratified the protocol to eliminate the illicit trade in tobacco products, added Dr Tedros.Ensuring that this protocol can come into force next year is key to advancing the impact of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.The Montevideo Roadmap will guide global preparations for next years United Nations General Assembly third High-level Meeting on NCDs.The meeting will assess countries pro-gress in meeting the target of reducing premature NCD deaths by 25% by 2025 and then by a third by 2030.For further information, please contact: Paul Garwood Communications Officer Telephone: +41 22 791 1578 Mobile: +41 79 603 7294 Email: garwoodp@who.int
Suspected cases from Seychelles test negative for plague:::::Suspected cases from Seychelles test negative for plague 18 October 2017 | Victoria, Seychelles - Samples from patients in Seychelles suspected to be ill with pneumonic plague tested negative at a WHO partner laboratory in Paris, France on Tuesday, 17 October 2017.The ten samples were shipped by the Seychelles Ministry of Health and WHO to the collaborating centre for Yersinia at the Institut Pasteur to confirm the status of several suspected and one probable case a 34-year-old Seychelles national who had returned from Madagascar with plague-like symptoms.WHO is working with the Seychelles health authorities to reduce the risk of plague spreading from neighbouring Madagascar, which faces an unprecedented outbreak that has killed more than 70 people since August.No plague cases have been confirmed in the Seychelles.Alongside support for laboratory testing, WHO has deployed experts and medical supplies to the 115-island country.WHO is also providing guidance for the tracing and treatment of contacts of people who are suspected to have been infected.We are working with health authorities to reduce the risk of the spread of plague in the Seychelles by improving surveillance and preparedness, said Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergencies Director for the Africa region.WHO is advising the Government of Seychelles on the implementation of public health measures that are in line with the WHO International Health Regulations, such as enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contacts.WHO currently assesses the risk of spread of plague in the Seychelles to be low.For further information, please contact: Christian Lindmeier WHO Communications Officer Telephone: + 41 22 791 1948 Mobile: + 41 79 500 65 52 Email: lindmeierch@who.int

WHO supports the immunization of 874 000 people against yellow fever in Nigeria:::::WHO supports the immunization of 874 000 people against yellow fever in Nigeria 16 October 2017 | Geneva - The Government of Nigeria has launched a campaign to immunize 873 837 people against yellow fever in the states of Kwara and Kogi.The ten-day campaign began on Friday, 13 October 2017, and mobilizes more than 200 health workers and volunteers.It targets residents aged 9 months to 45 years old.This campaign aims to ensure that people living in high-risk areas are protected from yellow fever, and to prevent the disease from spreading to other parts of the country, said Dr. Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Nigeria Representative.WHO has been working with health authorities on its implementation in nine local government areas in Kwara State and two in Kogi State.Nigeria has requested support from the International Coordination Group (ICG) on vaccine provision for yellow fever.A global stockpile of 6 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine is available for countries to access, with the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.WHO and health partners have been supporting the Governments response to the outbreak since the first case of yellow fever was confirmed in Oke Owa Community, Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara state on 12 September.WHO has deployed experts to Nigeria to support surveillance and investigation, lab testing, public health measures, and engagement with at-risk communities.An Emergency Operations Centre has been activated in the area to coordinate the response.The last yellow fever outbreak in Nigeria was reported in 2002, with 20 cases and 11 deaths.For further information, please contact: Fadla Chaib Communications Officer Telephone: +41 22 791 3228 Mobile: +41 79 475 5556 E-mail: chaibf@who.int
Attack on vaccines sets back immunization efforts in eastern Syrian Arab Republic:::::Attack on vaccines sets back immunization efforts in eastern Syrian Arab Republic 13 October 2017 | GENEVA - WHO has received reports of an attack on medical facilities in eastern Syrian Arab Republic that has destroyed the only vaccines cold room in al-Mayadeen district, Deir Ezzor Governorate.More than 100,000 doses of measles vaccines and 35,000 doses of polio vaccines were stored in these facilities, alongside equipment, syringes, and stocks for all vaccine-preventable childhood diseases.If confirmed, this would set back the efforts of WHO and health partners to protect the children of Deir Ezzor from preventable childhood diseases, including polio.WHO and local partners have intensified efforts to respond to an outbreak of polio that has affected 48 children in the Syrian Arab Republic since March this year.WHO has made strenuous efforts in cooperation with health authorities to deliver vaccines to protect the children living in these areas from disease, said Elizabeth Hoff, WHO Representative in the Syrian Arab Republic.We unequivocally condemn these actions.Vaccines are not a legitimate target of war.Until a new cold room is built and the required cold chain equipment -- including solar fridges, cold boxes and vaccine carriers -- are delivered, this will delay the implementation of routine immunization for vulnerable children in the area, Hoff added.WHO has supported 23 polio campaigns since the first outbreak in 2013 and helped to establish 1,148 sentinel sites across the country, of which more than 35% are in hard-to-reach and besieged areas, including al-Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor Govenorate.The last polio vaccination campaign in Deir Ezzor reached 252,768 children aged 0-59 months.For further information, please contact: Fadla Chaib WHO communications officer.Mobile: +41 79 475 55 56 E-mail: chaibf@who.int

Tenfold increase in childhood and adolescent obesity in four decades: new study by Imperial College London and WHO:::::Tenfold increase in childhood and adolescent obesity in four decades: new study by Imperial College London and WHO World will have more obese children and adolescents than underweight by 2022 11 October 2017 | LONDON - The number of obese children and adolescents (aged five to 19 years) worldwide has risen tenfold in the past four decades.If current trends continue, more children and adolescents will be obese than moderately or severely underweight by 2022, according to a new study led by Imperial College London and WHO.The study was published in The Lancet ahead of World Obesity Day (11 October).It analysed weight and height measurements from nearly 130 million people aged over five years (31.5 million people aged five to 19, and 97.4 million aged 20 and older), making it the largest ever number of participants involved in an epidemiological study.More than 1000 contributors participated in the study, which looked at body mass index (BMI) and how obesity has changed worldwide from 1975 to 2016.Obesity rates in the worlds children and adolescents increased from less than 1% (equivalent to five million girls and six million boys) in 1975 to nearly 6% in girls (50 million) and nearly 8% in boys (74 million) in 2016.Combined, the number of obese five to 19 year olds rose more than tenfold globally, from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016.An additional 213 million were overweight in 2016 but fell below the threshold for obesity.Food marketing, policies, pricing behind obesity rise Lead author Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperials School of Public Health, says: Over the past four decades, obesity rates in children and adolescents have soared globally, and continue to do so in low- and middle-income countries.More recently, they have plateaued in higher income countries, although obesity levels remain unacceptably high.Professor Ezzati adds: "These worrying trends reflect the impact of food marketing and policies across the globe, with healthy nutritious foods too expensive for poor families and communities.The trend predicts a generation of children and adolescents growing up obese and at greater risk of diseases, like diabetes.We need ways to make healthy, nutritious food more available at home and school, especially in poor families and communities, and regulations and taxes to protect children from unhealthy foods."More obese than underweight 5 to 19 year olds by 2022 but underweight persists in poor regions The authors say that if post-2000 trends continue, global levels of child and adolescent obesity will surpass those for moderately and severely underweight youth from the same age group by 2022.In 2016, the global number of moderately or severely underweight girls and boys was 75 million and 117 million respectively.Nevertheless, the large number of moderately or severely underweight children and adolescents in 2016 (75 million girls and 117 million boys) still represents a major public health challenge, especially in the poorest parts of the world.This reflects the threat posed by malnutrition in all its forms, with there being underweight and overweight young people living in the same communities.Children and adolescents have rapidly transitioned from mostly underweight to mostly overweight in many middle-income countries, including in East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.The authors say this could reflect an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods, especially highly processed carbohydrates, which lead to weight gain and poor lifelong health outcomes.Dr Fiona Bull, programme coordinator for surveillance and population-based prevention of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) at WHO, says: These data highlight, remind and reinforce that overweight and obesity is a global health crisis today, and threatens to worsen in coming years unless we start taking drastic action.Solutions exist to reduce child and adolescent obesity In conjunction with the release on the new obesity estimates, WHO is publishing a summary of the Ending Childhood Obesity (ECHO) Implementation Plan.The plan gives countries clear guidance on effective actions to curb childhood and adolescent obesity.WHO has also released guidelines calling on frontline healthcare workers to actively identify and manage children who are overweight or obese.Dr Bull adds: WHO encourages countries to implement efforts to address the environments that today are increasing our childrens chance of obesity.Countries should aim particularly to reduce consumption of cheap, ultra-processed, calorie dense, nutrient poor foods.They should also reduce the time children spend on screen-based and sedentary leisure activities by promoting greater participation in physical activity through active recreation and sports.Note for Editors: The paper presents the first ever comprehensive data on underweight through to obesity for children and adolescents aged five to 19 years and provides startling findings on the increasing numbers and rates of young people being affected by obesity.The study calculated and compared body mass index (BMI) among children, adolescents and adults from 1975 to 2016, and made projections based on current trends in obesity rates.BMI is a measure of a persons weight and body fat mass for their height, and indicates whether their weight is healthy.Calculating BMI is the simplest way to assess a persons weight status, and the most common tool used to determine under-, healthy- and overweight and obesity.For children and adolescents, their BMI is adjusted for age and sex using WHOs growth reference curves.Action to curb obesity is a key element of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 commits the world to reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030, including through prevention of obesity.SDG target 2.2 commits the world to ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030, including overweight and obesity.Also, the goal of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) is to promote collaboration across all sectors and stakeholders to end malnutrition in all its forms.The findings also showed that: Global data for obesity and underweight In 2016, there were 50 million girls and 74 million boys with obesity in the world, while the global number of moderately or severely underweight girls and boys was 75 million and 117 million respectively.The number of obese adults increased from 100 million in 1975 (69 million women, 31 million men) to 671 million in 2016 (390 million women, 281 million men).Another 1.3 billion adults were overweight, but fell below the threshold for obesity.Regional/Country data for obesity, BMI and underweight Obesity: The rise in childhood and adolescent obesity rates in low and middle income countries, especially in Asia, has recently accelerated.On the other hand, the rise in childhood and adolescent obesity in high income countries has slowed and plateaued.In 2016, the obesity rate was highest in Polynesia and Micronesia in boys and girls, at 25.4% in girls and 22.4% in boys, followed by the high-income English-speaking region, which includes the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom.The areas of the world with the largest increase in the number of obese children and adolescents were East Asia, the high-income English-speaking region, and the Middle East and North Africa.Nauru was the country with the highest prevalence of obesity for girls (33.4%), and Cook Islands had the highest for boys (33.3%).In Europe, girls in Malta and boys in Greece had the highest obesity rates, comprising 11.3% and 16.7% of the population respectively.Girls and boys in Moldova had the lowest obesity rates, comprising 3.2% and 5% of the population respectively.Girls in the UK had the 73rd highest obesity rate in the world (6th in Europe); boys had the 84th highest obesity in the world (18th in Europe).Girls in the USA had the 15th highest obesity rate in the world; boys had the 12th highest obesity in the world.Among high-income countries, the United States of America had the highest obesity rates for girls and boys.BMI: The largest rise in BMI of children and adolescents during the four decades was in Polynesia and Micronesia for both boys and girls, and in central Latin America for girls.The smallest rise in the BMI of children and adolescents during the four decades covered by the study was seen in Eastern Europe.The country with the biggest rise in BMI for girls was Samoa, which rose by 5.6 kg/m2, and for boys was the Cook Islands, which rose by 4.4 kg/m2.Underweight: India had the highest prevalence of moderate and severe underweight throughout these four decades (24.4% of girls and 39.3% of boys were moderately or severely underweight in 1975, and 22.7% and 30.7% in 2016).97 million of the worlds moderately or severely underweight children and adolescents lived in India in 2016.For further information, please

WHO to establish high-level commission on noncommunicable diseases:::::WHO to establish high-level commission on noncommunicable diseases Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), announced today the establishment of a new High-level global Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs).The announcement came at the 64th Session of WHOs Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean being held in Islamabad, 9-12 October.The commissions aim is to identify innovative ways to curb the worlds biggest causes of death and extend life expectancy for millions of people.The commission will support ongoing political efforts to accelerate action on cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and respiratory disease, as well as reducing suffering from mental health issues and the impacts of violence and injuries.The High-level global Commission will be chaired by Dr Sania Nishtar, a prominent global advocate for action against NCDs, former Federal Minister of the government of Pakistan and civil society leader.Dr Nishtar has also previously served as co-chair of the WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity.NCDs kill approximately 40 million people globally each year, accounting for 70% of all deaths.About 15 million of those deaths are in people between the ages of 30 and 69.Low- and middle-income countries are particularly affected by NCDs with more than 80% of all deaths from NCDs occurring in these countries.Violence and injuries take an overwhelming toll on young people, particularly boys.In 2015, world leaders committed to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one third by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.Recent WHO reports indicate that the world will struggle to meet that target.We urgently need new approaches and action on a dramatically different scale if we are to stop people dying unnecessarily from noncommunicable diseases, said Dr Tedros.I am committed to engaging the very best people in the world to address our health challenges, he added.So, I am especially pleased that Dr Nishtar has agreed to lead this commission.I know she will bring impressive knowledge, credibility, and commitment to this effort.Later this month ministers and other health leaders from around the world will review progress in Montevideo, Uruguay at the WHO Global Conference on Noncommunicable Diseases, co-hosted by WHO and the President of Uruguay.Governments and other stakeholders will meet again at the third United Nations High-level meeting on NCDs in 2018.For further information please contact: Paul Garwood Communications Officer Telephone: +41-22-791-1578 Mobile: +41 79-603-7294 E-mail: garwoodp@who.int Fadla Chaib Communications Officer Telephone: +41 22 791 3228 Mobile: +41 794 755 556 E-mail: chaibf@who.int
WHO provides 1.2 million antibiotics to fight plague in Madagascar:::::WHO provides 1.2 million antibiotics to fight plague in Madagascar 6 October 2017 | ANTANANARIVO, MADAGASCAR - WHO has delivered nearly 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released US$1.5 million dollars in emergency funds to fight plague in Madagascar."Plague is curable if detected in time.Our teams are working to ensure that everyone at risk has access to protection and treatment.The faster we move, the more lives we save," said Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Madagascar.WHO has delivered 1 190 000 doses of antibiotics to the Ministry of Health and partners this week, and a further supply of 244 000 doses is expected in the days ahead.The different types of drugs will be used for both curative and prophylactic care.They are enough to treat up to 5000 patients and protect up to 100 000 people who may be exposed to the disease.The medicines are being distributed to health facilities and mobile health clinics across the country with the support of the Ministry of Health and partners.WHO is also filling critical shortages in disinfection materials and personal protective equipment for health professionals and safe burials.WHO and the Ministry of Health are training local health workers on how to identify and care for patients, and how to trace people who have had close contact with symptomatic patients so that they may be given protective treatment.Most of the 231 infections and 33 deaths that the Ministry of Health has reported since August are associated with pneumonic plague a more dangerous form of the disease that affects the lungs and is transmitted through coughing at close range.Both bubonic and pneumonic plague can be cured using common antibiotics if delivered early.Antibiotics can also help prevent infection among people who have been exposed to plague.WHO has rapidly released $1.5 Million from it emergency funds to allow for immediate support to the country until more substantial funds are received.WHO is appealing for US$5.5 million to effectively respond to the outbreak and save lives.For further information, please contact: Tarik Jasarevic Communciations Officer Telephone: +41 22 791 5099 Mobile: +41 79 367 6214 E-mail: jasarevict@who.int
Partners commit to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030:::::Partners commit to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030 3 October 2017 | Geneva - An ambitious new strategy to reduce deaths from cholera by 90% by 2030 will be launched tomorrow by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), a diverse network of more than 50 UN and international agencies, academic institutions, and NGOs that supports countries affected by the disease.Cholera kills an estimated 95 000 people and affects 2.9 million more every year.Urgent action is needed to protect communities, prevent transmission and control outbreaks.The GTFCCs new plan, Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030, recognizes that cholera spreads in endemic hotspots where predictable outbreaks of the disease occur year after year.The Global Roadmap aims to align resources, share best practice and strengthen partnerships between affected countries, donors and international agencies.It underscores the need for a coordinated approach to cholera control with country-level planning for early detection and response to outbreaks.By implementing the Roadmap, up to 20 affected countries could eliminate cholera by 2030."WHO is proud to be part of this new joint initiative to stop deaths from cholera.The disease takes its greatest toll on the poor and the vulnerable this is quite unacceptable.This roadmap is the best way we have to bring this to an end," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO."Every death from cholera is preventable with the tools available today, including use of the Oral Cholera Vaccine and improved access to basic safe water, sanitation and hygiene as set out in the Roadmap," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus.This is a disease of inequity that affects the poorest and most vulnerable.It is unacceptable that nearly two decades into the 21st century, cholera continues to destroy livelihoods and cripple economies.We must act together.And we must act now.Advances in the provision of water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services have made Europe and North America cholera-free for several decades.Today, although access to WASH is recognized as a basic human right by the United Nations, over 2 billion people worldwide still lack access to safe water and are potentially at risk of cholera.Weak health systems and low early detection capacity further contribute to the rapid spread of outbreaks.Cholera disproportionally impacts communities already burdened by conflict, lack of infrastructure, poor health systems, and malnutrition.Protecting these communities before cholera strikes is significantly more cost-effective than continually responding to outbreaks.The introduction of the oral cholera vaccine has been a game-changer in the battle to control cholera, bridging the gap between emergency response and longer-term control.Two WHO-approved oral cholera vaccines are now available and individuals can be fully vaccinated for just US$6 per person, protecting them from the disease for up to three years.The Global Roadmap provides an effective mechanism to synchronize the efforts of countries, donors, and technical partners.It underscores the need for a multi-sectoral approach to cholera control with country-level planning for early detection and response to outbreaks.By strengthening WASH in endemic "hotspots", cholera outbreaks can be prevented.By detecting cholera outbreaks early, and responding immediately, large-scale uncontrolled outbreaks like the one observed in Yemen can be avoided even in crisis situations.Note to editors The Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) is a network of more than 50 organizations bringing together partners involved in the fight against cholera across all sectors and providing a strong framework to support countries in intensifying efforts to control cholera.The Launch of the Global Roadmap is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Fondation Mrieux and WaterAid.For further information, please contact: Tarik Jasarevic Communciations Officer Telephone: +41 22 791 5099 Mobile: +41 79 367 6214 E-mail: jasarevict@who.int Loza Mesfin Tesfaye Tel: +41 22 791 2272 Mobile: +41 79 506 5217 E-mail: tesfayel@who.int

Trump declares opioids a U.S. public health emergency:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, stopping short of a national emergency declaration he promised months ago that would have freed up more federal money.Responding to a growing problem, particularly in rural areas, Trumps declaration will redirect federal resources and loosen regulations to combat opioid abuse, senior administration officials said.But it does not result in more money to combat the crisis.Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said the declaration was meaningless without additional funding.Republican lawmakers called the presidents declaration an important step in combating the crisis.This epidemic is a national health emergency, Trump, a Republican, said at the White House.As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.Trump, who also called the epidemic a national shame and human tragedy, was introduced by his wife, Melania, who said she had made fighting the epidemic one of her top priorities as first lady.This can happen to any of us, she said.The president also made a personal reference to addiction in his family by citing his deceased brother Fred, an alcoholic whose advice not to imbibe made an impression on Trump, who does not drink alcohol.The announcement disappointed some advocates and experts in the addiction fight, who said it was inadequate to fight a scourge that played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The death rate has kept rising, estimates show.Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, are fueling the drug overdoses.More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC.A White House commission on the drug crisis had urged Trump to declare a national emergency.On Wednesday, the president told Fox Business Network he would do so.U.S. President Donald Trump displays a presidential public health emergency declaration on the nation's opioid crisis in the East Room of the White House in Washington.REUTERS/Carlos Barria Officials told reporters on the conference call that Federal Emergency Management Agency funds that would have been released under a national emergency are already exhausted from recent storms that struck Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.The administration would have to work with Congress to help provide additional funding to address drug abuse, they added.They said they determined that a public health emergency declaration was most appropriate after an expansive review.Under Thursdays declaration, treatment would be made more accessible for abusers of prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, while ensuring fewer delays in staffing the Department of Health and Human Services to help states grapple with the crisis.BAD ACTORS Slideshow (7 Images) Trump said he would discuss stopping the flow of fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Asia next month.In his remarks, Trump said the U.S.Postal Service and Department of Homeland Security were strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China.He added he would consider bringing lawsuits against bad actors in the epidemic.Several states have sued opioid manufacturers for deceptive marketing.Congress is investigating the business practices of manufacturers.The president also said the government should focus on teaching young people not to take drugs.There is nothing desirable about drugs.Theyre bad, he said.Thursdays declaration allows the Department of Labor to issue grants to help dislocated workers affected by the crisis.HIV/AIDS health funding would also be prioritized for those who need substance abuse treatment, officials said.As a candidate, Trump promised to address the crisis, including by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to stop the flow of illicit drugs, which he touched on in his speech.Additional actions under the move would be announced in coming weeks by various agencies, officials said.
CVS makes more than $66 billion bid for Aetna: sources:::::(Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp has made an offer to acquire No.3 U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo A deal would merge one of the nations largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.Aetna shares rose more than 11 percent, or $18.48, to $178.60, while CVS shares fell 3 percent, or $2.22, to $73.31, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks earlier on Thursday.Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.But it would also subject it to more antitrust scrutiny.The deal could also help counter pressure on CVSs stock following speculation that Amazon.com Inc is preparing to enter the drug prescription market, using its vast e-commerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.CVS made the offer earlier this month, although the two companies have been in discussions about a potential deal for several months, the sources said.These talks were carried out primarily between CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, and were aimed at making executives comfortable with the idea of a merger, the sources said.CVS and Aetna started discussing terms only recently, and a deal is not expected for a few weeks, one of the sources added, cautioning that the pace of the talks could accelerate given the publication of the negotiations.The sources did not specify how much of CVS bid is cash versus stock, but given CVSs and Aetnas market capitalizations of $77 billion and $54 billion, respectively, a substantial stock component is likely in any deal.Aetna and CVS declined to comment.Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.UNCERTAIN TIMES AHEAD The deal comes after years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Acts facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement.The lack of progress - as well as Trumps executive order to bring down healthcare costs - has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.After the deal with Humana fell apart, Bertolini has said that he did not believe large deals were possible in the insurance industry.But analysts have speculated about a tighter partnership between Aetna and CVS since early in the year.CVS and Aetna have a long-term contract in which CVS has provided pharmacy benefits for Aetna customers.Aetna really makes the best sense said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Its their largest client on the PBM side.They really have similar views as to where healthcare should go, which is to the retail setting.Jonas, who owns both Aetna and CVS shares, noted the two companies were already talking about working together on Minute Clinic, on home infusion and other services.To go from that to a full merger is a big step but its not huge, he said.Last week No.2 insurer Anthem Inc. announced plans to manage its own pharmacy benefits with the help of CVS, a move that would give it a set-up similar to UnitedHealth Group Inc. and its Optum unit.Insurers want more control over the pharmaceutical component of care as they implement pricing schemes with doctors and hospitals that are based on health outcomes, not just procedures.They also want to work on driving down costs, and as a pharmacy benefit manager, would negotiate directly with drugmakers.
Billionaire Insys founder charged in U.S. opioid bribe case:::::BOSTON (Reuters) - The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc was arrested on Thursday on U.S. charges he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based cancer pain drug, marking a step by authorities to fight the opioid epidemic.The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc. John Kapoor, exits the federal court house after a bail hearing in Phoenix, Arizona , U.S., October 27, 2017.REUTERS/Conor Ralph John Kapoor, Insys majority shareholder who stepped down as chief executive in January, was charged with engaging in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston.He was added as a defendant in a case against six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich.Following a court hearing in Phoenix, Kapoor, 74, was released on a $1 million bond.Brian Kelly, Kapoors lawyer, in a statement said: My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously.Arizona-based Insys, which has been in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department, declined to comment.Its stock price fell 22.64 percent to close at $5.74 on Thursday.The charges marked a major escalation of investigations related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, an addictive synthetic opioid.They came as U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.FILE PHOTO: A box of the Fentanyl-based drug Subsys, made by Insys Therapeutics Inc, is seen in an undated photograph provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama/Handout via REUTERS Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said the charges reflected authorities commitment to combat the opioid abuse epidemic.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015.We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable - just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer, Weinreb said in a statement.Slideshow (3 Images) Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a board member, stepped down in January as Insys chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently the chairman of drugmaker Akorn Inc, which Fresenius SE & Co KGaA has agreed to buy, and president of investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises Inc.Prosecutors said beginning in 2012, Kapoor, Babich and others devised a scheme to pay speaker fees and other bribes to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys.They also sought to defraud insurers into approving payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.The other defendants include former Insys Vice Presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry; ex-national sales director Richard Simon; and former regional sales directors Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan.They have pleaded not guilty.
U.S. opioid crisis could spread to Europe, experts say:::::LISBON (Reuters) - Europe should heed the threat from opioids responsible for Americas deadliest drug epidemic in decades as both regions have seen rises in prescription rates of such medicines, which can be a gateway to dangerous derivatives, experts said.The U.S. epidemic has led to far more overdose deaths and already lasted much longer than previous drug crises, like crack cocaine in the 1980s, and health experts fear it will spread to Europe.U.S. President Donald Trump was to declare the crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, senior administration officials said.Cathy Stannard, a consultant in pain medicine, told the Lisbon Addictions 2017 conference that the undoubted public health disaster of misuse of prescription opioids in the U.S. had led to scrutiny of the risks that patients become addicted, or subsequently turn to heroin.We (in Europe) are mindful of all the facets of the U.S. conversation, but where we start on this is a very similar increase in prescription rates of opioid medicines.Christopher Jones, who works at the U.S. Department of Health researching the opioid addiction, said prescription opioids were driving the increase in U.S. deaths for many years.But weve seen stabilization in that since around 2011.Where we now see real change is in synthetic opioids, he said.Drug rings, especially from China, are producing more potent, dangerous variants of such opioids to hook new users.Between 2000 and 2015, deaths in the U.S. from synthetic opioids like fentanyl, a painkiller which is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, rose 1,125 percent.In the same period deaths from all opioids rose 294 percent.Overall drug overdose deaths in the U.S. reached about 64,000 last year, up from 52,000 in 2015, Jones said.More than half were related to opioids.Europes overdose deaths rose for the third consecutive year in 2015 to 8,441 and 81 percent of them were related to opioids, which include heroin.Europes Lisbon-based drugs monitoring agency (EMCDDA), which organized the conference, agreed there was a growing threat from synthetic opioids.We have seen in the last 18 months the rapid emergence of new highly potent synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl derivatives, said EMCDDA scientific director Paul Griffiths.Their potency means they pose a significant risk to those that consume them or are accidentally exposed to them.Jones said there was a similar trend in the U.S., where new variations of fentanyl coming from China were cropping up.There is a lack of awareness of the drugs people are using, meaning they cant protect themselves.
Americans want to see a bipartisan fix for Obamacare: Reuters/Ipsos poll:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Republican and Democratic lawmakers clash over the future of Obamacare, Americans largely are eager for a bipartisan solution to its shortcomings, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: A man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this October 2, 2013 photo illustration.REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo The Oct. 14-23 poll found that 62 percent of Americans want former President Barack Obamas healthcare law to be maintained, up from 54 percent in a January poll.About half including 51 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans want a bipartisan group rather than just members of their own parties to improve the healthcare system.Its not enough just to rip up the law, said Tim Lukasek, 45, who has insurance provided by his employer in St. Louis but likes a feature of Obamacare that allows him to cover his young adult children under his insurance policy.Lukasek described himself as more likely to vote Democrat.It should be a bipartisan mix of people hashing this out, and then everyone needs to agree on it, he said.Republican lawmakers have repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010, saying it represents government overreach into personal healthcare decisions and drives up prices for consumers.More than 20 million Americans have obtained medical coverage under Obamacare, and Democrats warn that killing the law would cut many of them off from insurance.President Donald Trump, who had promised during his 2016 election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare and has vowed to let the law implode, this month terminated subsidies paid to health insurers that help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans.Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, and Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, have proposed a short-term fix to restore the subsidies for two years to stabilize the individual insurance markets created by Obamacare until a longer-term replacement can be negotiated.There are a lot of issues, but I think (the politicians) should just put their differences aside and think about whats better for everyone else in the country, said Kadee Matthew, a veterinary technician who lives outside of Birmingham, Alabama, and identifies as a moderate Republican.Poll participants were split over who would do a better job at the repairs.Democrats were more likely to say the federal government, while Republicans were more likely to prefer that U.S. states take the lead.The majority of those surveyed believe the law has been successful at expanding health insurance coverage in the U.S.Responses were split along party lines, with most Democrats saying it was successful and most Republicans saying it was not.It was working until now, but a lot of rocks are being thrown at it, said Catherine Evans, a stay-at-home mom in Silver Spring, Maryland, who said she is more likely to vote Democratic.She noted Trumps decision to cut off billions of dollars in subsidy payments to insurers.Insurers have raised monthly premium costs for the most popular Obamacare plans by 34 percent, on average, for 2018, according to an analysis by Avalere Health.A majority of adults 56 percent said they opposed Trumps decision on subsidies, versus 29 percent who supported it.Evans said she would like to see both political parties work together to stabilize the insurance market, but I dont think right now they are capable of that.The way they are behaving is so childish and petty.Its ridiculous.Healthcare experts say that Trumps moves to undermine the law and statements declaring Obamacare as dead have created confusion among consumers who were planning to enroll, beginning next week, in health coverage for 2018.Among the people surveyed by Reuters/Ipsos, 11 percent said they believed that Obamacare had ended, versus 67 percent who said the program was still operating.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States.Some of the poll questions ran longer than others, gathering between 3,865 and 1,545 responses each.The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample, 4 percentage points for responses from Democrats and 5 percentage points for responses from Republicans.
Endo International units sue FDA over drug compounding policy:::::BOSTON (Reuters) - Endo International Plc said two units filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of ignoring key components of a law passed after a deadly 2012 meningitis outbreak linked to a compounding pharmacy.In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, the Endo subsidiaries alleged that the FDA had improperly authorized the bulk compounding of hundreds of drugs, including essentially a copy of Endos blood pressure drug Vasostrict.The lawsuit comes after FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September the agency was working on a new policy that would encourage more compounding pharmacies to register under the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013.That law was passed after a fungal meningitis outbreak linked to contaminated steroids manufactured by New England Compounding Center in 2012 that prosecutors say killed 76 people and sickened hundreds more.A federal jury in Boston on Wednesday found the former supervisory pharmacist at Massachusetts-based NECC, Glenn Chin, guilty of racketeering and fraud charges, while clearing him of second-degree murder.Matthew Maletta, Endos chief legal officer, said in a statement that Endo welcomed Gottliebs efforts to develop a new policy but decided to sue because we believe the status quo is unlawful.The FDA declined to comment.Traditionally, pharmacists who compounded medications mixed tailored doses for individual patients in response to a specific prescription.By the time of the meningitis outbreak, the practice had mushroomed, with some pharmacies selling thousands of doses of regularly used mixtures without prescriptions for physicians to keep for future use.The 2013 law created a category of outsourcing facilities that could register with the FDA, allowing them to sell products in bulk without prescriptions for individual patients while following federal manufacturing standards.Endo said the law also required the FDA to determine that bulk compounding using a particular drug substance was necessary to satisfy an unmet clinical need and to include those substances on a list.Endo said the FDA instead established a different system that authorized bulk compounding without the legally mandated scrutiny, while ignoring a prohibition on compounding copies of FDA-approved drugs.In particular, Endo said the FDA had in July authorized the large-scale production of Vasostricts active ingredient, vasopressin, after an outsourcing facility, QuVa Pharma, nominated it for inclusion on the list.Endos Par Pharmaceutical unit is separately suing QuVa, saying it misappropriated trade secrets related to Vasostrict.QuVas lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Even with Obamacare, childhood cancer survivors may face high costs:::::(Reuters Health) - Even though the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped more childhood cancer survivors obtain health insurance, these patients may still face higher out-of-pocket costs than other people, a recent study suggests.More than 375,000 adults in the U.S. are survivors of childhood cancers, and their ranks are swelling as treatment advances make more of these tumors a chronic illness rather than a death sentence, researchers note in JAMA Internal Medicine.Researchers examined data on insurance coverage and access to care one year after the enactment of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, for 698 childhood cancer survivors and 210 of their siblings who didnt experience malignancies as kids.Overall, about 10 percent of survivors and 8 percent of their siblings were uninsured, the study found.But survivors reported higher annual average out-of-pocket costs: $2,362 versus $1,568 for their siblings.Annual out-of-pocket costs were also higher on average for survivors with insurance: $2,487 versus $1,293 without benefits.I think there could be many reasons for these findings, said lead study author Elyse Park, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Survivorship Program in Boston.It is possible that survivors simply are accessing more care; it is also possible that survivors premiums are higher; or that the care survivors access is less likely to be covered by their plans, Park said by email.Survivors had lower rates of employer-sponsored health insurance, higher rates of coverage through Medicaid, greater difficulty obtaining coverage and higher rates of being denied coverage, the study found.However, just 14.9 percent of survivors and 11.5 percent of siblings rated their health insurance coverage as fair to poor.Survivors were 84 percent more likely than siblings to borrow money because of medical expenses.They were also 80 percent more likely to worry about being unable to pay for a needed treatment and 74 percent more likely to worry they wouldnt be able to afford to fill a prescription.Compared to insured survivors, survivors without benefits were more than three times as likely to borrow money because of medical expenses.Uninsured survivors were also more than six times as likely to worry about being unable to pay medical bills, 12 times more likely to report lacking a primary care provider, and more than eight times as likely to postpone preventive care or skip a needed medical test or follow-up appointment.Without insurance, survivors were also more than three times as likely to skip filling a prescription, the study also found.One limitation of the study is that it looked at access and costs at a single point in time, the authors note.Even so, the findings add to the evidence that cancer survivors and other people with serious health problems can face higher bills and cost-related problems with access to care, said Echo Warner, a researcher at the University of Utah College of Nursing in Salt Lake City who wasnt involved in the study.Given their higher risk for health problems even decades after their cancer diagnosis, it seems unlikely that survivors would experience similar out-of-pocket costs compared to healthy individuals who also had bare-bones or no insurance and limited income, Warner said by email.I suspect that individuals who were diagnosed with other severe illnesses as children may demonstrate similar out of pocket costs to childhood cancer survivors, Warner added.This study really underscores the importance of childhood cancer survivors obtaining health insurance to help manage the costs of their necessary healthcare, and emphasizes the immediate need for healthcare policy, like the ACA, that continues to protect the most vulnerable patients, including survivors of childhood cancer.SOURCE: bit.ly/2gM5XD5 JAMA Internal Medicine, online September 25, 2017.
Young diabetics may check sugar more when money’s at stake:::::(Reuters Health) - Teens and young adults with diabetes may do a better job of checking their blood sugar when they get daily financial incentives than when theres no cash on the line, a recent experiment suggests.FILE PHOTO: A paramedic (R) checks the blood sugar level of a patient at SS Diabetes Care clinic in Jakarta, Indonesia, April 22, 2016.REUTERS/Beawiharta Researchers tested out the potential for money to motivate young people to test blood sugar daily by offering $60 a month up front and then subtracting $2 for each day a participant didnt follow through on required testing.For three months, researchers randomly selected 90 teens and young adults to get these cash incentives or no reward at all.Overall, the youth with money at stake met their daily blood sugar testing goals half of the time, while without rewards, participants only met their testing goals 19 percent of the time.The young people felt motivated and empowered to find ways to check their glucoses more with money on the line, said lead study author Dr. Charlene Wong of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.They were especially motivated by the increasing losses if they missed the goal multiple days in a row, Wong said by email.All of the study participants had whats known as type 1 diabetes.This chronic condition, typically diagnosed in children and young adults, occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow blood sugar, or glucose, to enter the bodys cells.People with type 1 diabetes typically have to test their own blood sugar levels throughout the day and inject insulin to manage it.Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to cardiovascular disease, kidney complications and death.While young children typically manage their blood sugar with a lot of help and supervision from their parents, daily blood sugar monitoring often gets worse in adolescence as children start to take over responsibility for their own care, researchers note in JAMA Pediatrics.To see if cash could help improve the odds of teens doing these daily tests, researchers turned to whats known as behavioral economics to see if the threat of losing prize money might be a more powerful motivator than the promise of winning money.Study participants were 16 years old on average, and most of them were full-time students living at home.All of them were given daily blood sugar monitoring goals of testing at least four times a day with at least one result within a safe or normal range.The teens who could get cash did better at testing during the three months when the financial incentives were offered.But when researchers followed participants for an extra three months without any cash on the line, the differences between the groups disappeared.There also wasnt a meaningful difference in blood sugar levels based on whether or not the youth could receive cash rewards, either at three months or at six months.The intervention was designed for the teenage brain, as it provided short-term monetary rewards for health behaviors, said Dr. Joyce Lee, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.However, the study did not necessarily translate to better controlled blood sugar in the long-term, Lee said by email.Checking blood sugars is important for diabetes care, but taking insulin is also really important and the study did not incentivize behavior related to insulin dosing.That doesnt mean there is no place for behavioral economics in trying to motivate teens to take charge of their health, Lee said.The idea of loss aversion, or offering a prize that can go away, may have potential to get youth to meet testing goals.This study shows that there are new opportunities to nudge healthy behaviors teens with in type 1 diabetes using connected diabetes devices and mobile technology, Lee added.But I would caution parents that we need more studies to determine the long-term efficacy of these behavioral economics interventions.SOURCE: bit.ly/2iBcZLD and bit.ly/2ySU9Wt JAMA Pediatrics, online October 23, 2017.
Disabilities tied to worse access to care, poorer health:::::(Reuters Health) - People with disabilities may have less access to care and worse health outcomes than individuals without physical or mental challenges, two recent studies suggest.One study found that people with disabilities in the UK have worse access to care largely due to struggles with transportation, costs and long waiting lists for appointments.The other study was done in the U.S. state of Ohio and found people with disabilities were more likely to have unmet medical needs and less likely than others to have a primary care physician.We expected to find disparities, but we anticipated that they would not be too wide, said co-author of the UK study Dr. Dikaios Sakellariou, a researcher at Cardiff University.It was also surprising that cost appeared to have such a big impact on peoples access to care, especially in England, Sakellariou said by email.Thats because the British National Health Service (NHS) generally provides free care, except for medication, he said.Roughly one in five people in the UK live with a disability, researchers note in BMJ Open.To see how disability influences access to care, researchers examined survey data on access to care for 12,840 people over the age of 16 who didnt live in institutional settings like nursing homes.This included 5,236 people with disabilities.The most common obstacle for all people - whether they had a disability or not - was long waits for treatment, the study found.This was more common, however, for individuals with disabilities and impacted more than one in four people with severe disabilities.Researchers also found that people with severe disabilities were more than four times as likely to lack treatment for mental health problems as individuals without disabilities.In addition, women with disabilities were more than seven times more likely to have unmet health needs due to the cost of care or medication than men without disabilities.This might be due in part to women having lower incomes than men, or more hurdles like the lack of transportation or insufficient time to seek care due to responsibilities caring for kids or other relatives, Sakellariou said.For the Ohio study, researchers examined survey data on almost 43,000 adults and more than 10,000 children with and without developmental disabilities.Overall, they found that 14 percent of children aged 18 and younger with disabilities had problems receiving needed care, compared to 2 percent of kids without disabilities.Among adults 65 and older, half of people with disabilities and 17 percent of individuals without disabilities reported having one or more unmet healthcare needs, researchers report in the Annals of Family Medicine.Adults with disabilities were also less likely to have a primary care physician that spends enough time with them or to have clinicians who explained things well.Neither study was a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how disabilities may influence access to care.But previous research has documented significant health disparities for people with disabilities, and the findings suggest that lack of access is one reason why, researchers involved with both studies said.A lack of training for healthcare providers is another problem, said Susan Havercamp, a co-author of the U.S. study and researcher at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Centers Nisonger Center in Columbus.Healthcare training programs have not changed much in the past 100 years, Havercamp said by email.In contrast, the lives of people with developmental disabilities have changed a great deal, she said.A century ago, babies born with developmental disabilities were not expected to survive childhood.Now, many of these babies will grow up and require lifelong care thats tailored to their specific physical and mental health challenges.The best way to reduce health and healthcare disparities in people with developmental disabilities is to include disability training in all healthcare training programs, Havercamp added.SOURCE: bit.ly/2gFXpdo BMJ Open and bit.ly/2zSpIha Annals of Family Medicine, online September 11, 2017.
Global measles deaths fall, but elimination goals far off:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Annual deaths from measles dropped below 100,000 worldwide last year for the first time, to 90,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international agencies said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: A student receives a measles vaccine injection at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Ecublens near Lausanne March 23, 2009.REUTERS/Valentin Flauraud Reporting an 84 percent drop in 16 years, to 90,000 deaths in 2016 from more than 550,000 in 2000, the Measles and Rubella Initiative (M&RI) said more children getting vaccinations was the main reason for the decline.The report warned, though, that the world is still far from eliminating measles.Coverage with the first of two required doses of measles vaccine has stalled around 85 percent since 2009, it said, short of the 95 percent needed.Coverage with the second dose was only 64 percent in 2016.We must strive to reach zero measles cases, said Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, the director of the WHOs immunization department.Measles elimination will only be reached if measles vaccines reach every child, everywhere.M&RI is a partnership of the American Red Cross, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, the UNICEF childrens fund, and the WHO.Its report said that since 2000, an estimated 5.5 billion doses of measles vaccine have been provided to children in routine immunization services and mass vaccination campaigns.It added, however, that some 20.8 million children are still missing their first measles vaccine dose.More than half of these unvaccinated children live in six countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.It said large outbreaks of measles continue to occur in those countries as well as others in Europe and North America, putting children at risk of severe health complications such as pneumonia, diarrhea, encephalitis, blindness, and death.Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI global vaccine alliance, welcomed the decline in measles deaths.But he added but added: We cannot afford to be complacent.Too many children are still missing out on lifesaving vaccines.To reach these children and set ourselves on a realistic road to measles elimination we need to dramatically improve routine immunization backed by strong health systems.
'This is skid row': What two current heroin addicts want you to know:::::Atlanta (CNN) We hear about those who've kicked addictions, inspiring hope.We shake our heads in sadness and despair when we learn about those who've lost the battle and instead found early graves.Our hearts ache when surviving family members and friends share their pain in hopes of saving others.But what about those who are deep in with no expectation of seeing their way out?Offering a rarely heard perspective, two heroin addicts in Atlanta opened up to CNN recently to tell their stories straight.They want their stark realities to serve as warnings.'Not what you want to do' Heroin was a birthday present given to her, when she turned 14, by a close relative.Today, for this onetime teen beauty pageant competitor, it's her $200-a-day habit.At 46, Allie says she looks two decades older.She's weathered, too thin; her teeth are gone.The black tights she wears bear images of skulls and crossbones.On a bookshelf near where she sits in her dingy room, there is a Bible.She spends her days getting high but also buying the drug and selling it to others for a profit."It's so easy to get," she says."I get a gram for $60 and sell it for $110."Her regulars include waiters and waitresses, engineers, an anesthesiologist and a pilot: "Normal people," she says, "functioning addicts, which is more dangerous because nobody has any idea."They come by most mornings and often on their way home to their spouses and children.Her eyes well up when she thinks about how young she was when she entered this hell, and the tears fall when she talks about the young people she sells to, whom she'd rather scare off.People like the "girl with everything going for her": a penthouse apartment, a new car, access to schools and supportive parents.She hates that she even knows her."Believe it or not, I tell them, 'Honey, this is not what you want to do,' " she says."It's the end of the line.This is skid row....This shit will kill you."She warns girls and young women that the power of heroin will drive them to sleep with men they never would have imagined even talking to.And guys, even those who openly "gay bash," she says, will give men oral sex for fixes -- because that's how this world works.Allie had kids of her own but walked away for this life.The last time she saw them, they were 13 and 11.That was half their lifetimes ago.Parents need to wake up, especially if their children are behaving differently or blowing through money, she says.They need to look into their children's eyes.If the pupils are constricted and exceedingly small, "unless they're looking right into a ... spotlight, your kid is on heroin or some type of opioid."Once upon a time, she glorified this lifestyle.She capitalized on being cute and felt powerful with her pockets full of cash.Today, she's no better than most junkies who wake up covered in their own vomit or not knowing what -- or whom -- they've done."This is not a road you want to go down," she says, as she continues to cry."It's evil.Nothing good can come of this."But then she pushes the needle into a vein in the back of her hand.As the heroin takes hold, she scratches her head and neck.She begins to slur her words as she explains how her body tingles and her heart beats out of her chest."I may have done a little too much," she mumbles as her eyes grow heavy, her head nods forward and her limbs go temporarily limp.'Chasing something that ain't real' He sleeps in a graveyard at night and shoots up in a crypt.It's not that he wants to die, but If the heroin happens to kill him, he says, "I'm right where I'm supposed to be."Johnny, also 46, started using heroin at 15 because his heroes in the music world did.He played guitar and went on to rehearse and sing with a band right down the street from where he now sits on a tombstone.He says he was married to a stripper, and his life was "heaven," an existence steeped in "sex, drugs and rock 'n roll."Now, the drug owns him."When I do a shot of heroin, it's almost like being back in my mama's womb," he says."I feel safe.I'm warm.I don't have to worry about anything.Nobody's going to hurt me."That's how he feels, he says, even though he knows it's not true.Even though he says he's dashed his hopes and dreams "chasing something that ain't real."His body sways, and his words come out sluggish, signs of his current high, as he talks about those new to the heroin itch.He watches kids who glamorize this drug like he once did and wishes he could stop them.He suggests they go home but knows some don't have good homes to go to.He wonders if, in heroin, they've found a place where they can belong.Johnny sees them as they wait for the same dealer.He once sat beside one who shot up and then died.He thinks about the redhead who reminds him of his own daughter -- "so clean and pure," he says -- and what she's become."Now, she's a heroin addict, and I'm slowly watching this girl turn into a junkie," he says."I just want to whisper in her ear and tell her to run."It's the loneliness that really gets to him, he says, that feeling that you have nothing."There's always that one person that always has hope in you, and when that last person gives up on you," he says, before trailing off."I don't think that person realizes how that little bit of hope they had for you helps keep you alive."Pain pills were, still are, the entry point for many, he says.Those who've had surgeries, suffer from severe back pain or have been injured in an accident, once the prescriptions that hook them run out and doctors refuse to refill them, they turn to what's cheaper: heroin.He's seen it happen time and again and says he's buried five friends since last year.Along the way, he's tasted what it's like to witness someone full of promise lose it all to drugs.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."I've always been the one everybody's watched deteriorate.I finally got to see somebody close to me kind of deteriorate," he says."It's scary watching somebody turn into something and then not be able to stop it."For anyone thinking about trying heroin, he'd like to be an example, a wise teacher who's learned from experience."I don't have to lecture them," he says."I just point to myself."He wants them to look at him and see what they never want to be.Journalist Sally Holst contributed to this report.
Opioid epidemic: Emergency declaration is key to curbing it, experts say:::::(CNN) President Donald Trump's declaration of the opioid epidemic as a public health emergency Thursday is a key step in curbing the problem, as it helps redirect funds and ease state laws for those fighting on the front lines, according to public health experts and medical professionals."In practical terms, I believe this declaration of public health emergency will unify the country and our leadership in a nonpartisan way around finding solutions to this growing problem in the US," said Dr. Halena Gazelka, an anesthesiologist who chairs the Mayo Clinic's Opioid Stewardship Program."As state, federal and private funds are directed at curbing the primary issues (of) supply and demand, hopefully we'll see a rapid decrease in the overdose deaths and related health issues."Although the emergency declaration doesn't change guidelines for doctors, Gazelka said she hopes the declaration will empower providers to write "only the right amount of opioid for the right patient.""No longer should patients be able to request and receive opioids 'easily,' and they should receive them only when truly warranted by medical diagnosis," Gazelka said."No longer should providers freely write prescriptions without care and consideration to who is truly going to use those medications and for what purpose.""In the last several years, US life expectancy has actually declined, not because of cardiac disease or cancer or an incurable new virus but because of opioid overdose," Gazelka said."This is incredibly tragic and wasteful and must be halted with that trend in life expectancy reversed."Lainie Rutkow, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has studied public health emergencies, said Thursday's measure could lead to increased grant funding for states to address opioid use disorders."The availability of additional funds, particularly for the states, to address opioid use disorders will be critical," Rutkow said.Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen said she was glad the president was focusing on the issue, but she expressed disappointment he didn't declare it a national state of emergency."Right now, the announcement today calls for repurposing of existing funding, instead of new funding -- and that's what we desperately need."Michael Fraser, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a consortium of senior public health officials from all 50 states, US territories and the District of Columbia, applauded the measure because it puts pressure on Congress and federal agencies to make the opioid crisis a priority."It means a lot for the President to make a statement," Fraser said."Words matter.He's the President, and this means this is a national priority."He said he hopes that the politics of Washington don't get in the way and that appropriate funds for states get approved."It would be awful if the opioid emergency funding got caught up in the year-end budget," he said.Jessica Hulsey Nickel, the president and chief executive of the Addiction Policy Forum, a nonprofit organization that works to raise awareness of the opioid epidemic, called Trump's announcement "an important step toward preventing and treating substance use disorders.""Prioritizing this national crisis will bring much-needed resources to communities, improve access to services and facilitate better coordination among government agencies," she said."In particular, I am heartened by the decision to bring all federal government agencies to the table to play a unique role."Impact of a health emergency declaration It is not often that a public health emergency is declared.The US Department of Health and Human Services declared one in Puerto Rico last year after more than 10,000 Zika cases were reported there.Before that, the last emergency declaration unrelated to a natural disaster was during the 2009-10 flu season, when there was widespread concern over a potential pandemic.Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California-Berkeley, worked with the World Health Organization on providing advice during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.The crucial thing an emergency declaration does, he said, is mobilize resources and bring much-needed attention to the problem, especially in getting politicians, leaders and the public on the same page."Typically, humans don't get motivated until there's actually a problem," Reingold said."In this case, this is a problem that has been festering for some time -- and now we're finally paying attention to it."Dr. Alberto de la Vega at the University of Puerto Rico who evaluated over 1,000 pregnant patients with Zika said the public health emergency declaration last year "definitely helped."It brought attention and forced resources from federal agencies to work toward bringing an end to the epidemic, he said.Puerto Rico's health department poured a lot of money into the effort, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."We definitely received a benefit from the classification and receiving more funds.There's no question about it," de la Vega said."But the bureaucracy, in making those allocation of funds reach us, always comes later than we wish."'The fight must go on' In an interim report in late July , the president's commission examining the opioid epidemic recommended that Trump declare a public health emergency.The commission, led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, recommended rapidly increasing treatment capacity for those who need substance abuse help; establishing and funding better access to medication-assisted treatment programs; and making sure that health care providers are aware of the potential for misuse and abuse of prescription opioids by enhancing prevention efforts at medical and dental schools.Reports in recent days had suggested dysfunction and chaos within the commission.On Wednesday, commission member Patrick Kennedy said he wanted to see action."We don't want any more visits to rehab centers and photo ops, saying how courageous we are.Enough already.We want to save lives," said Kennedy, a former House representative from Rhode Island who has spoken about his own recovery from drug and alcohol addiction On Thursday, surrounded by members of families affected by the opioid crisis, first responders and members of Congress, Trump hailed the emergency declaration as means of stopping the epidemic.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction," he said."We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.We can do it."Experts on the front lines are now waiting to see the measure turned into action."After the razzle dazzle and public interest dies down -- and after politicians have ceased to make a name for themselves and moved on to other pressing concerns -- the fight must go on," Gazelka said.
Can the kratom plant help fix the opioid crisis?:::::(CNN) Multiple surgeries couldn't help Lisa Vinson with the chronic abdominal pain stemming from endometriosis, a condition in which tissue begins to grow outside the uterus.Her doctors' answer was pills and more pills."It makes you feel better for a little while, but then after a little while, it doesn't help as much, " said Vinson, 41, of Crystal River, Florida, who has been coping with pain for most of the past decade.Like many opioid users, Vinson built up a tolerance to the doses of painkillers she was prescribed."Every month, (the doctors) say, 'How are you?'I say, 'Well, it's not really helping as much.I'm still in a lot of pain.'" To give her some relief, her doctors would say, "OK, well, add this to it.This pill and then this patch."Eventually, she was on 12 prescriptions, some to manage her pain and others to manage the side effects of the pills she was taking for the pain.She didn't want to be on the pills, but without them, she couldn't function at all."I was torn between not being able to care for my family or (taking) care of them if I just take some more pills.Which shame do I choose?"Vinson said.The stigma of pain Despite more meds, her pain persisted.About a year ago, she was back in the hospital, begging for relief.A surgeon was called over."I thought he was going to come and save the day, and he's going to agree to do the surgery," she recalled, Instead, she said, she was judged.She remembers being told, "You don't have a surgery problem.You have a drug problem."Vinson felt stigmatized for asking for help and decided she would take matters into her own hands: She stopped taking the pills.But not only did the pain come back even stronger, the withdrawal symptoms weren't manageable.She began researching natural remedies to treat pain and came across kratom.In Malaysia, kratom leaves are traditionally crushed and made into a tea.According to Darshan Singh Mahinder, a professor at the Centre for Drug Research at the University of Science Malaysia , throughout Malaysia, the leaves of the kratom plant are traditionally crushed and made into a tea.It's used to "self-treat heroin/morphine dependence, or to reduce opiate withdrawal among illicit drug users," he said.It can also be used for pain relief.But in the United States, it's sold as a supplement, usually in the form of powder, pills, capsules or even energy drinks, and loosely regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.Vinson was dubious at first."If this is so good, why isn't it the first thing I see?Why haven't I read about it?"she asked.After having no luck with other home remedies such as magnesium and Imodium A-D, potassium and Benadryl, she decided to try kratom."I need this to stop.Clearly, I don't have what it takes to get through this withdrawal.As strong as I think I am, I'm not.I can't," she recalled.She left the house and bought some kratom capsules.Within several hours of her first dose, she was able to start working around the kitchen.She had a full night's sleep for the first time in years.She was convinced.'Kratom saved my life' On online forums such as Reddit or Bluelight, there are thousands of posts about kratom.People like Vinson testify about personal miracles."Kratom saved my life by getting me through the hardest thing I've ever had to do.""Hooked on Oxy, Hydro and Aderrall for over a year.Kratom helped me kick the habit.""Was using norcos and tramadol ... for pain management though they weren't much help.I found kratom back in November and within weeks I was completely free of both.... Its not perfect but it has definitely changed my life.""There's a huge wealth of anecdotal evidence, and some scientific, that there is definite medical potential for this plant.If it's not in the treatment of mild and moderate pain, it's definitely in the treatment of potential opioid withdrawal," said McCurdy, a medicinal chemist at the University of Florida and director of the UF Translational Drug Development Core .He is one of few scientists in the country who's examined kratom closely.He believes that the success of the plant may lie in its two principal alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.These chemicals can bond to the body's opioid receptors and act very much like opioids do, providing some pain relief and causing a release of dopamine, but at a much more toned-down level than prescription pills or heroin.Users say there are mild, if any, withdrawal symptoms.Kratom, or Mitragyna speciosa, is an everygreen plant native to Southeast Asia.McCurdy pointed out that his studies indicate that 7-hydroxymitragynine may have some addictive qualities, but when looked at in the entire plant, the ratio of that element is so little that the plant has very low abuse potential, one he likened to coffee.And unlike opiods, McCurdy said, kratom doesn't slow breathing.And that's key.When people overdose on opioids, whether it is a legally prescribed oxycodone or illicit heroin, their body's respiratory system completely stops."We've never seen respiratory depression in the animal studies that we've conducted, and we've never seen or heard reports of respiratory depression in the human population that's been using.And this is something that's really amazing when you start thinking about a potential treatment for opioid addiction or opioid withdrawal."A devastating epidemic McCurdy believes it boils down to money."There's no financial incentive for any drug company to really pursue developing this into a drug."Developing kratom into a therapy would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.On top of that, patenting a plant it is nearly impossible."There's no profit incentive for a pharmaceutical to spend millions of dollars -- to do the studies the FDA requires ... to get approval," said Jag Davies of the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance.Davies said it is an issue that faces many botanical drugs, including marijuana."The FDA approval (process) is only geared toward single novel (or) single compound drugs," he said.In turn, without much interest from pharmaceutical companies, there isn't much research into this plant.A search of PubMed, the US National Library of Medicine archive, found just a handful of studies of the plant in its entire canon.Turning kratom into a therapy is something McCurdy is working on: isolating the plant to the essential molecules he believes have potential."If we can come up with some sort of standardized, modified, unique and proprietary formulation, then there's a way to gain some patent stance around that, and then there might be a way to entice a pharmaceutical company into pursuing this as a potential treatment option," he explained.But until then, the cost-benefit is just too high for a pharmaceutical company, he said, adding that he will keep doing the heavy lifting of trying to create a standard drug.The FDA provided guidance for the development of botanical drugs in 2004, but since then, according to the agency, there have been only two botanical drugs approved: Veregen, for warts, and Mytesi, an anti-diarrheal for HIV patients on antiretrovirals.The FDA doesn't keep track of how many drugs have been submitted that were unsuccessful in gaining approval.The Wild West of supplements In the meantime, kratom has found a home on the poorly regulated supplements market.It's now sold in head shops and gas stations, and there is no clear standard as to what passes for kratom.Though the kratom plant itself can grow only in Southeast Asia, American distributors are buying leaves to dry and make into powders and pills.Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration considered designating kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, the same category as heroin and LSD.According to the DEA, Schedule 1 compounds have "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."The DEA says there were 15 deaths related to the plant between 2014 and 2016.In addition, the CDC found over five years a tenfold increase in calls about kratom to poison control centers, from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015.However, while 7% of the calls were for serious side effects, including one death, most of the calls reported minimal to moderate side effects.McCurdy has analyzed samples of kratom from emergency room patients and found that they frequently aren't what they claim to be."We've unfortunately seen them spiked with morphine in some cases, and we've also seen ones that have been spiked with oxycodone."He's also seen them spiked with increased concentrations of 7-hydroxymitragynine, the more addictive of the plant's naturally occurring alkaloids."We're in a totally unregulated environment," McCurdy said, a "buyer-beware marketplace."As he sees it, this is the extreme opposite of the DEA's consideration "to put it into the most restricted class of scheduled substances.And then we make it very difficult to find out if that medical potential is really there."Since the DEA's public comment period about regulating kratom ended in December, it has not made any announcements about the herb."Right now, the kratom industry is trying to self-regulate," Davies said.And that means people like Vinson are left to having to reach out to Internet boards and rely on the word of mouth from other users."You don't know," Vinson said."The best thing for me personally, I only buy from one person that I trust very much."'I'll never go back' Vinson believes in the plant so much that she's introduced kratom to her older sister, Patrica Coleman Slevin.Slevin began using narcotics about five years ago to help with chronic pain, she said.Within months, she was dependent.Two years after getting her first prescriptions for pain medication, she was alternating between high dosages of Dilaudid and oxycodone daily.Her body needed higher doses to get rid of the pain and manage the withdrawal."Everything hurts.You're sick.You're nauseous.You're throwing up.Diarrhea.Your will to live is gone because you can't, it's just the most unfathomable feeling.Everything, everything is just broke," explained Slevin, 45, of Live Oak, Florida.When she couldn't get more pills, she turned to heroin.Her husband also began using.Coleman eventually lost her job as a server.They lost their home."It takes no time for the bottom to fall out," Slevin said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Last year, she was caught shoplifting and ended up in jail.When she got out, she called her sister.Vinson remembers picking up the phone and saying, "I will not send you money for drugs ... but I will buy you kratom."In November, Slevin and her husband moved in with her parents, and she hasn't touched heroin since.Will kratom keep her off heroin for the rest of her life?"It's a powerful, powerful, powerful drug, but I think as long as I have kratom, as long as I can get it, me personally, I'll never go back."
Opioid addiction and the most controversial bathroom in New York:::::(CNN) Of all the provocative strategies to reduce harm from opioid addiction, the one that I am about to describe is near the top.Over the past several months, hardly anyone I spoke to about the abuse of opioids in the United States, including pain pills and heroin, had a neutral point of view about what is happening in a small but important corner of the larger epidemic.The place is where a former security guard named Hector Mata became an expert at reversing overdoses and probably saved 25 lives in the process.It is not a hospital or a clinic.Mata's infirmary is the Corner Project, a syringe exchange program that began operating in the New York neighborhood of Washington Heights, which houses a bathroom where drug users can more safely inject heroin.On first glance, there is not much that is special about this bathroom except that there is someone checking in on an intercom every three minutes to make sure the user is still conscious."A moral obligation" If a user doesn't respond on the check-in, Mata, or someone similarly trained, will press a button to unlock the door and rush in, armed with a syringe full of naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, and hopefully reverse the effects of the opioid drugs.After seven years and at least 25 overdoses, he says he has never failed.While to some people, this sounds like a "consumption room," or a safe injection site, the staff here say it is simply a bathroom.After all, injection sites aren't legal under US law.I sat down with the Corner Project's director, Liz Evans, and asked her just how a place like this legally exists.She told me that public bathrooms are the frontline of the opioid epidemic."People are dying in those bathrooms, and so there's an acknowledgment that as a syringe exchange provider, we have a moral obligation to make sure that people don't die in our building."And so, the Corner Project has implemented a safety net to make sure that people don't die from overdoses in the bathroom in their building.Everything in this story is a murky gray.Perhaps the story of the Corner Project could have been predicted.A heroin addict goes to a needle exchange, obtains clean needles and immediately heads to the bathroom to inject drugs.After all, according to recent studies in New York City, nearly two-thirds of drug users visit places like abandoned buildings, cars, and public bathrooms to inject drugs.The Corner Project started out as a street based community outreach group in 2005.In 2009, when the Corner Project moved to its current brick and mortar location, the bathroom was just a matter of convenience for clients.Within a short time, however, there was an overdose in the bathroom, followed by another and so on.Without a system in place, the workers at Corner Project would hear a characteristic thud from someone passing out in the bathroom, make a mad scramble for the keys and then work to revive the person.Though they were mostly successful, it was always frightening.The Corner Project could have simply closed the bathroom or searched people before they used the facility, but the workers chose to do neither.Instead, they kept it open and put in safety measures, like an intercom system, timers, and naloxone to help prevent overdoses.They stayed open knowing that if they closed their doors addicts would simply find another public restroom to use their drugs, far from the people who might be able to save them.And with that, the Corner Project pushed the limits of harm reduction in the United States.Since last year, the New York State Department of Health has followed the Corner Project's lead and instituted regulations and recommended procedures on how to best prevent overdoses in the places where users are likely to use: syringe exchange bathrooms.Criminalization vs. rehabilitation In the great debate of criminalization versus rehabilitation, many commonly held assumptions have been torn to shreds.For example, some believed the legalization of drugs like marijuana would lead to increased use.Yet in Colorado, which legalized recreational pot, teen marijuana use has dropped.When it comes to opioids, the number of people who overdose and die from legal prescription painkillers is about equal to the number of people who die from illicit drugs like heroin.Another commonly held belief is that a safe injection site would implicitly condone the use of drugs and lead to increased use.And yet we now know that theory starts to fray when we look at what has happened at the Corner Project and at a place called InSite in Vancouver, Canada, which Liz Evans also helped found.InSite started as a pilot project in 2003 and was the first legal supervised drug injection site in North America.To help manage the opioid crisis in Canada, Health Canada has approved more sites in recent months.Though the centers don't provide any illicit drugs, the medical staff are there to provide first aid, including naloxone for overdoses, addiction counseling and mental health assistance.InSite has seen more than 3 million people since it opened, treated over 6,000 overdoses and not had a single person die.a 35% reduction in overdose deaths from the two and a half years before it opened, compared with a 9% drop in the rest of Vancouver.Although it is unclear the impact of InSite on decreasing the total number of drugs users, it has led to increased admissions for addiction treatment and detoxification.Furthermore, a 2011 Lancet study revealed that in the neighborhoods surrounding InSite, in the two years after it opened, there wasa 35% reduction in overdose deaths from the two and a half years before it opened, compared with a 9% drop in the rest of Vancouver.Although it is unclear the impact of InSite on decreasing the total number of drugs users, it has led to increased admissions for addiction treatment and detoxification.And that also means cleaner communities.Streets and public restrooms aren't littered with needles and other drug paraphernalia.In fact, a recent survey of drug users from an undisclosed safe injection site in the United States found that if they hadn't used the site's facilities, over 90% of the users would be using in public bathrooms or out on the street These statistics are now the subject of dozens of studies in medical journals and were also recited to me as Mata showed me around the Corner Project's bathroom.But he emphasized again, "It's not a safe injection site," he told me.He points out that unlike InSite, the Corner Project doesn't have actual medical professionals monitoring the bathroom.In fact, if a doctor or nurse were to actually supervise its bathrooms, he or she could lose their license.He also doesn't care for the term "consumption room," which has been around in Western Europe since the 1990s.Instead, Mata insists I just call it a bathroom.Because unlike Canada or some countries in Europe, what I witnessed isn't actually legal in the United States.At the front desk, a staff member monitored the clock and the intercom, checking to see whether any help was necessary.Considering the number of lives nearly lost in its bathroom, the mood in the Corner Project was calm and controlled.The soft music, brightly colored walls and chalkboards, and chestnut-colored tables with staff members casually engaged in small talk gave it the feel of a neighborhood coffee shop, more than a place where overdoses are prevented.A self-inflicted wound Mata said my tour needed to be quick because the bathroom is in use almost all the time, and there is a waiting list that often lasts more than an hour.One of the men in line was Taylor Prince, 35.Mata gave him a hug and then told me, "Taylor is a frequent flier."I found out later that Mata saved Prince's life on three occasions.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.We find ourselves in the middle of an opioid epidemic that is the worst drug crisis in American history.It is a self-inflicted wound and one that is predominantly made in America, as we consume more than 80% of the world's supply of opioid pain pills, even though we are less than 5% of the world's population.Many of those prescriptions have led to heroin use; three out of four new heroin users started with prescription narcotics.And there is no single strategy, as provocative or revolutionary as it may be, that is going to be the answer to turning those numbers completely around.Not even a controversial bathroom in the Washington Heights Corner Project could possibly do that, but in the meantime, Mata and others will work on saving as many lives as possible.
This is fentanyl: A visual guide:::::(CNN) Of all the painkillers being used and abused, a single one -- fentanyl -- has been called by public health officials and even members of Congress the "third wave" of the opioid epidemic.It's a synthetic opioid, similar to heroin, but physicians can prescribe it legally.It is most frequently is prescribed for patients dealing with severe chronic pain, but over the past few years, increasing amounts of fentanyl derivatives have been manufactured illicitly and sold on the street.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that of the more than 64,000 US overdose deathslast year from any drug, more than 20,000 were attributed to synthetic opioids, many of them related to fentanyl and its variations.A drug more powerful than heroin Pharmaceutical fentanyl is an opiate drug that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.It is usually administered to patients in severe pain through injection, a patch or a lozenge.Most of the fentanyl that people are buying on the street isn't diverted from pharmacies or hospitals but rather illegally made in clandestine labs, much of it chemical variations of legal fentanyl.chemical difference between fentanyl and carfentanil is just a few molecules.But the difference in potency is significant: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, but carfentanil is up to 10,000 times more powerful than morphine.Carfentanil is used as a tranquilizer for large animals like elephants and has been blamed in fatal drug overdose outbreaks in For example, thechemicaldifference between fentanyl and carfentanil is just a few molecules.But the difference in potency is significant: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, but carfentanil is up to 10,000 times more powerful than morphine.Carfentanil is used as a tranquilizer for large animals like elephants and has been blamed in fatal drug overdose outbreaks in Ohio and West Virginia.Illicit drug makers change compositions so that if they are caught with the drug, they technically have a different chemical compound from fentanyl or some other already regulated compound.The idea is to get around the law.So the Drug Enforcement Administration is constantly adding new variations to its list of controlled substances.It's a cat and mouse game.Deadly dose Why add these fentanyl variations into the mix?Because they are so potent that it just a little bit can be cut and mixed into other drugs such as heroin or pills, stretching out the supply.Consider that you can buy about a kilogram of black-market fentanyl or a derivative online for about $8,000.That can be used to cut 1 million pills, and on the street, those pills can bring in a total of $20 million to $30 million.But that potency can also be very deadly.An amount you can't even see can kill you.There's also no real quality control over the final drug.One batch may have the fentanyl evenly distributed throughout, while another may have some pills with much higher concentrations of fentanyl than others.Made in China According to US law enforcement, most illicit fentanyl is coming from China, where weak regulations and poor monitoring have created an environment ripe for underground labs to thrive.Illegal fentanyl and the chemicals to make it can be easily bought on the internet.Most are shipped into Mexico, where they are further processed before they are smuggled over the border.Sometimes, these drugs are shipped directly into the US.US Customs and Border Protection agents.In fact, according to the agency, it has had to change its drug testing protocols to prevent accidental overdose from inhalation or absorption through the skin.Of the are actually handling fentanyl.It's a major challenge forUS Customs and Border Protectionagents.In fact, according to the agency, it has had to change its drug testing protocols to prevent accidental overdose from inhalation or absorption through the skin.Of the 328 air, land and sea entry points into the US that the agency oversees, at least 15 locations , including some along the US-Mexico border, now have naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote, in case of accidental overdose.However, not all offices are equipped with the field testing equipment needed to determine whether agentsare actually handlingfentanyl.Special delivery But there's another route that drug smugglers have also found to be effective: the US Postal Service.Some drug dealers are even buying from China directly into the United States.Considering that the Postal Service handles about 154 billion pieces of mail every year, it's the proverbial needle in the haystack.Working with Customs and Border Protection, the Postal Service uses a range of tools, such as dogs, X-rays and an their intrinsic ability to spot something that just seems out of the ordinary.Law enforcement officials say that at the moment, the government can't effectively identify which packages to inspect because so little tracking information accompanies international mail bound for the United States.
After Harvey Weinstein, a focus on online sexual harassment:::::Kelly Wallace is a CNN digital correspondent and editor-at-large.Read her other columns and follow her reports on Twitter.It's been a stunning few weeks of sexual harassment allegations against extremely powerful men.Women, trying to claim some of their own power, responded in droves on social media using the hashtag #MeToo, often sharing stories of when they've been sexually harassed at work.But sexual harassment is not limited to the workplace.Sue Scheff, author of the recently released book "Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate," which includes a foreword by Monica Lewinsky, says that in the digital age, sexual harassment is prevalent online, as well."In 'Shame Nation,' we're giving a voice to the women that have been sexually harassed online," said Scheff, a family Internet safety advocate who was herself the victim of online shaming in 2003."We're letting you know that these people are just as emotionally ... in pain" as women who are sexually harassed by a boss or colleague.Twenty-one percent of women ages 18 to 29 said they have been sexually harassed online, more than twice the number of men in the same age group who say they have experienced it, according to a Pew Research Center survey released in July.The survey found that overall, men are more likely than women to experience any form of online harassment, which includes physical threats and name-calling, but women expressed more concern about it, according to the survey.Seventy-percent of women -- and 83% of women 18 to 29 -- believe online harassment is a major problem, the survey found, versus 54% of men -- and 55% of young men.'Who saw me?'Annmarie Chiarini, a mother of two and a college English professor who was interviewed for "Shame Nation," knows firsthand how painful online sexual harassment can be.When she was going through the worst of it, she says, she was afraid to leave her house."I was at my son's soccer practice, and I was looking around at all the fathers there, and I kept thinking, 'Who saw me?'" said Chiarini, whose revealing photos were posted online without her consent, in an interview."When you are a victim of online harassment, no place is truly safe."Annmarie Chiarini, a victim of revenge porn, now works to help other victims of online sexual harassment.Chiarini's experience began with a Facebook request from an old high school boyfriend in 2009, which ultimately led to a romantic relationship.At some point, her boyfriend started begging her for nude photos."I was never comfortable with it for a lot of reasons, but ... finally I relented," she said, deciding to share some seminude shots with him.The relationship started to deteriorate after she says he became extremely possessive and jealous, wanting to know who she was with at all times and accusing her of cheating, so she decided to end it.But her ex wasn't happy and fired off threats: Either she would take him back, or he would put nude photos of her up for auction on eBay.During a call, she says, he told her he would destroy her and then hung up the phone.The next day, Chiarini said, he followed through on his threat and posted the auction featuring photos of her on eBay.He reposted the photos as quickly as she could request that eBay take them down, she said."The first thing I felt really was just, I was embarrassed.I was just embarrassed.I never, just the thought of my sexuality, my body, my privacy being available to others, that was just awful," she said.She hoped no one would see the pictures, but she would learn that a couple of her students and two of her colleagues saw them."I didn't have time to feel angry at him.I didn't have time to feel betrayed.I was panicked.I just wanted it over.I had no one to turn to for help," she said.She went to the police, who did nothing, she said, telling her that no crime had been committed.At the time, there were no laws in place to protect against this type of online behavior.She remembers the panic of not knowing where to look to make sure the photos hadn't been shared somewhere else and waking up in the middle of the night on a regular basis to scour the Internet."Three a.m. was my witching hour, and for some reason, that's when I would pop awake, and I would have to search Facebook.I would have to search eBay.I would have to google my name.I would have to check all my email accounts," she said.A year later, she learned that an online profile was created using her seminude images and inviting men to come to her home for sex.She reached out to state police and the FBI for help, and she even contemplated suicide."Online abuse is very abstract," she said."It's the thundering footsteps of an invisible pursuer.You hear it.It's there.It's present.It's 24/7.It's nonstop.It comes at you from all angles, but you don't know, I didn't know who it was."The site was viewed 3,000 times before a friend figured out how to help her get the photos removed."I was so lucky.The average victim who is posted is typically on a minimum of a thousand websites," she said."There are close to 4,000 websites dedicated to nonconsensual pornography."After her experiences, she decided to turn her attention to making changes and helped lobby for a new law now in effect in Maryland, making the release of nonconsenual pornographic images a criminal offense."I wanted something on the books that would serve as a deterrent with the message that there are consequences for this behavior.This behavior is unacceptable.If you choose to engage in it, there will be consequences," she said.Many forms of online sexual harassment Online sexual harassment can take many forms, and Scheff provides numerous examples in "Shame Nation."Those include the case of Jessica Valenti, a columnist with The Guardian who writes about feminism.She announced that she was taking a break from Twitter in 2016 after receiving "a rape and death threat" against her 5-year-old daughter.At the time, she wrote, "I am sick of this shit.Sick of saying over and over how scary this is, sick of being told to suck it up."I am sick of this shit.Sick of saying over and over how scary this is, sick of being told to suck it up.Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) July 27, 2016 Scheff also mentions the experience of actress Ashley Judd.The University of Kentucky basketball fan shared via Twitter in March 2015 how she was called a host of sexual and derogatory names after she accused another team of "playing dirty" during the NCAA Tournament.She wrote that when she expressed a "stout" opinion during March Madness, she was called "a whore, c---, threatened with sexual violence."She added, "Not okay.'" When when I express a stout opinion during #MarchMadness I am called a whore, c---, threatened with sexual violence.Not okay.ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) March 15, 2015 In an op-ed for Mic.com, she wrote that what happened to her is the "devastating social norm experienced by millions of girls and women on the Internet.""Online harassers use the slightest excuse (or no excuse at all) to dismember our personhood.My tweet was simply the convenient delivery system for a rage toward women that lurks perpetually.I know this experience is universal."Sue Scheff is the author of "Shame Nation."Scheff was the victim of online shaming in 2003.As an education consultant who worked with families of troubled teens, she was attacked online by what she calls a "disgruntled client" who she says tried to ruin her career and destroyed her emotional well-being."When you are being attacked online, you just go into this deep dark place," Scheff said.The woman started calling her a "crook" and "con artist" and said that she kidnapped kids and exploited families, Scheff said.Trolls started to pile on, and sexual innuendo began, with people posting that they had red panties that belonged to Scheff and asking others to bid on those panties, she said."It was so humiliating.It was horrifying," said Scheff, a mother of two.She didn't take any action until she learned from a psychologist who recommended families to her that they weren't going to see Scheff because of what they found when they googled her name."What happens is, they always keep coming back, and they keep saying, 'Do you realize who you are referring us to?Do you know what Google is saying about her?'" Scheff recounted the psychologist telling her.The implications for her were real: a loss of future clients."If you are being sexually harassed online or if you have any type of shaming online, your employer, your college admissions (officer), anyone, they're not going to take a moment to decide whether it's Internet fact or Internet fiction," she said."They're moving on to that next applicant."Scheff ended up suing the person who attacked her online and won a landmark case in 2006 for Internet defamation.She told her story in the book "Google Bomb: The Untold Story of the $11.3M Verdict That Changed the Way We Use the Internet."She was motivated to write "Shame Nation" after hearing about the tragedies connected to online bullying and harassment, such as the case of Tyler Clementi , a college student who committed suicide after a sexual encounter with a man was streamed online."I remembered that dark place that I felt, that place of hopelessness, that place of 'should I end my life?'which I never would," she said."Being 40-something years old, I had the maturity to know that, you know what, it's going to get better, so this is the importance of a book like 'Shame Nation' to let people know that you can survive it, there are ways to prevent it, and the best part about it is you can overcome it.You redefine your life after you've been shamed."Advice if you've been harassed online Her advice to anyone who has faced online sexual harassment or any other online shaming is to report the harasser to the platform and flag it as abusive.Many women are afraid to report it because they may feel embarrassed or humiliated, or wonder if they brought it on themselves."I mean, I know initially ...I was like, 'Oh, my God.Did I do something wrong?What did I do?'... You're thinking, 'Oh, my God, will the authorities think that this was my fault?'And that is sometimes enough to prevent you from wanting to report it, and that's how this escalates, and this is how men or a perpetrator can get away with it," Scheff said.Samantha Silverberg is a licensed professional counselor who works with Online SOS, a nonprofit that provides confidential and professional support to people experiencing online harassment.In "Shame Nation," she tells Scheff that the most important thing she can do to help victims is make sure that they realize they didn't do anything to deserve it."There's a lot of negative self-talk that comes up with you experiencing something like this.I challenge them with evidence.... People think, 'This only happens to me, and it's something about me,' " Silverberg said.Chiarini, the victim of revenge porn, also encourages people to collect evidence, which includes taking screen shots and printing out everything related to the abuse.She also says they should research the laws in the state where they live and where their perpetrator resides.There are also online resources such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative , which has a guide on how to remove photos that were posted against a person's will, and groups like Online SOS, which provides counseling support.Scheff says victims should tell a friend, because they won't be able to tackle this on their own."A lot of people try to go at this alone and I did it.For months, I didn't tell anybody.I felt embarrassed.You feel humiliated but tell a friend."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."Definitely, definitely, definitely talk to someone," Chiarini agreed.She said that her therapist was her lifeline and that as she talked to more people about it, she realized she was not alone."Reach out to people.Anybody who's been through this, anybody who works for these nonprofits ... we will stop what we are doing and help you because we know what it's like," she said."People are so afraid to reach out and to share their story."
Beware these Halloween safety ghouls:::::(CNN) Halloween is usually full of fun and adventure -- and candy -- making it a favorite holiday for many.Cloee Cooper, a research analyst in Boston, remembers it that way."You get to dress up as someone else, walk all over town, attend haunted house parties and celebrations at school," she said.But Cooper says that when she was growing up in Mount Shasta, California, her parents had a few rules: "Don't go inside a person's house unless you know them.Don't take unwrapped candies, and I had to be back home by a certain time."Before you hit the sidewalks on Halloween, make sure that your family gets the most out of the day by playing it safe.Cosmetic caution Face paint might seem simple enough, but the national Campaign for Safe Cosmetics released studies in 2009 and 2016 that found toxic chemicals in them."We found lead in nearly 20% of the Halloween face paints tested.Cadmium in nearly 30%," said last year's report, citing research on dozens of products."Lead is strongly associated with learning disabilities and developmental problems.Cadmium is linked to breast, kidney, lung and prostate cancer."The coalition recommends picking costumes that do not require face paint.Colored contact lenses are another Halloween staple, enhancing the scary look.Dr. Thomas Steinemann, clinical spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, recommends buying only lenses that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and sold by an FDA-approved vendor."The legal and safe way to wear color lenses is to have a qualified eye care professional measure the dimensions of your eyes, try on the lenses and make sure it fits," he said.Many lenses sold online and in stores are not FDA-approved, he said."Such lenses may be contaminated and can cause terrible infection."Colored lenses should not be worn continuously, as they interfere with oxygen transmission to the cornea.The wearer should know the rules for safe wear and care."If experiencing pain, poor vision or red eye, take the lenses out immediately and consult an ophthalmologist," Steinemann said."The colored lenses have to be disinfected every time it is worn, just like ordinary lenses."Maybe you're considering a wide-eyed, doll-like look.But the FDA has not approved "anime or circle lenses" and warns against buying them.And whether you're buying your costumes or sewing them at home, the FDA recommends flame-retardant materials like polyester or nylon.Consider using flashlights or battery-powered tea lights in carved pumpkins instead of candles or other open flames, said Dr. Elaine B. Josephson, spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians.Eyes on the road Pedestrian injuries to children are the most common injuries during Halloween, said Dr. Sarah Denny, a member of the American Association of Pediatrics' Council on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on average, children are up to four times as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than on any other day of the year.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 47 people in the US died between 6 p.m. October 31, 2016, and 5:59 a.m. the next day.Almost one-third of the Halloween crash fatalities were pedestrians, compared with 16% on an average day.And from 2012 to 2016, 22% of pedestrian fatalities on Halloween night involved a drunken driver."My advice is to wear glow-in-the-dark necklaces or bracelets, stay on sidewalks, cross streets together using crosswalks and not cross between parked cars," Denny said.The CDC recommends fastening reflective tape to clothing and carrying a flashlight to help motorists spot trick-or-treaters on the road.The American College of Emergency Physicians cautions against ill-fitting clothes and masks that may obstruct vision.Careful with the candy Halloween is incomplete without candy.And with a lot of candy comes a lot of responsibility -- toward teeth.Dr. Mary Hayes, spokeswoman for the American Dental Association and a pediatric dentist, said parents must emphasize to children that they should not end up with cavities and brush their teeth and floss twice a day.She hands out toothbrushes along with treats to encourage children to brush after eating candy."Chocolate is a better treat than sugar candies," she added."It has some oils which are detrimental to the growth of bacteria."That bag full of candy can be tempting, but eating too much at once could also make children sick.Mickey Silverstein, a public school teacher in Wilmette, Illinois, recalled one Halloween when her 6-year-old son, who's now an adult, ate all his treats in one sitting."He threw up a mountain of chocolate," she said."That never happened again."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."For the next day, specially in the pediatric population, there is a potential for candy-induced diarrhea from ingesting an unusually large amount of sorbitol-containing candy," Dr. David Toro, an assistant clinical professor of clinical emergency medicine at Indiana University, wrote in an email.Parents should prevent children from eating too much candy, he said.But if they develop diarrhea, he recommends drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated, such as fruit juice or soup, but not sugary drinks, sports drinks or bottled juice.If the diarrhea is severe, he advises visiting the emergency room.The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to carefully inspect candy for signs of tampering and then allocate portions to be eaten in the weeks after Halloween.
Ancient skull may belong to earliest tsunami victim:::::(CNN) An ancient skull dating back more than 6,000 years may have belonged to the earliest known human victim of a tsunami, scientists say.The Aitape skull -- named after a small coastal town in the north of Papua New Guinea, where it was found -- was discovered in 1929 by Australian geologist Paul S. Hossfeld.Since then, archaeologists and anthropologists have been trying to unravel the circumstances that resulted in it ending up there.The most recent study, published Wednesday, suggests the skull may have belonged to a human who drowned in a tsunami or had his or her grave displaced by the tsunami's waves.Tracing ancient shorelines When Gossfield stumbled upon the skull in 1929, he mistakenly believed it belonged to Homo erectus, a prehistoric species of humans originating in Africa.But radiocarbon dating has shown it is, in fact, much younger, dating back 5,000 to 6,000 years.The area around Papua New Guinea is prone to tectonic disturbances, and often affected by natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes.More than 3,000 people died in 1998 when a tsunami struck the region near Aitape.Because sea levels were higher thousands of years ago, the remains probably originated from the area behind what would then have been the shoreline.The field team in Aitape, led by Ethan Cochrane and Mark Golitko In 2014, Ethan Cochrane and Mark Golitko led a team of researchers back to the location where Gossfield had found the skull more than 90 years ago."We have now been able to confirm what we have long suspected," said James Goff, the study's lead author."The geological similarities between the sediments at the place where the skull was found and sediments laid down during the 1998 tsunami that hit this same coastline have made us realize that human populations in this area have been affected by these massive inundations for thousands of years."Balancing risk and reward The discovery will help anthropologists understand how people adapt and thrive in coastal areas that are subject to these natural hazards, and why they chose to move into such areas and remain there despite the environmental dangers."It might be because the New Guinea north coast is also very productive at this time in terms of food resources," explained Cochrane, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland ."So perhaps people are balancing risk and food reward."Understanding these kind of adaptive tradeoffs will be key to mitigating risk and ensuring the livelihoods of coastal populations today," he added.The Papua New Guinea region is vulnerable to techtonic disturbances.A 7.9-magnitude quake struck the area in 2016.The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE , adds to a trail of research that has seen contributions by scientists from France, the UK, Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand."If we are right about how this person had died ... we have dramatic proof that living by the sea isn't always a life of beautiful golden sunsets and great surfing conditions," said its co-author John Terrell, Regenstein curator of Pacific anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago.Terrell, who has conducted extensive research in Papua New Guinea, also noted that the skull might help convince skeptics "that all of us on earth must take climate change and rising sea levels seriously."
Undocumented special-needs girl in federal custody after emergency surgery:::::(CNN) An undocumented 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy was taken into US Customs and Border Protection custody shortly after emergency gallbladder surgery in Texas in a case that advocates say shows the harmful extent of the President's hard line on immigration policies.On Tuesday, Rosa Maria Hernandez and her adult cousin, a US citizen, had to go through an interior Border Patrol checkpoint while in an ambulance to get from Laredo, Texas, to a Corpus Christi hospital for emergency gallbladder surgery, family attorney Leticia Gonzalez said Thursday.Customs and Border Protection runs checkpoints along major thoroughfares leading away from the border in the Southwest, where travelers and vehicles are checked for legal authorization to enter the United States.Border patrol agents determined that Rosa Maria was undocumented and followed the pair to the hospital, where the girl underwent surgery.The agents remained at the hospital until she was discharged into their custody, according to Gonzalez.In a statement, the agency said agents "escorted" the pair to the hospital.Rosa Maria is now in a shelter run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services, as is customary with undocumented, unaccompanied minors.The child remains without her parents, and it's unclear when she'll be released or what will happen to her, according to Gonzalez.The family and their supporters characterized the apprehension as cruel and unnecessary, though immigration officials say the procedures were routine enforcement of the nation's immigration laws.10 year old Maria Rosa is at a hospital & @CustomsBorder is right outside her room waiting to deport her Sign&Share https://t.co/IYVjAkF37w pic.twitter.com/bIkRJzYwSa DreamActivist (@DreamAct) October 25, 2017 A child with special needs Rosa Maria came to the United States from Mexico when she was 3 months old.She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has the mental capacity of a child half her age, according to her mother, Felipa De La Cruz, who said her daughter doesn't understand what's happening."I told her she was only there because she was recovering and when she was recovered that she could come with me," she said Thursday."I start to think about her, and I want to start crying, and I become desperate."De La Cruz was able to video chat with her daughter in the children's home, but she still doesn't know whether Rosa Maria will ever return home to Laredo.While she was recovering in the hospital, up to four federal agents were stationed outside her open hospital room door, Gonzalez said.The agents did not allow Rosa Maria's cousin to close the door for privacy.After Gonzalez arrived and demanded privacy, citing attorney-client privilege, it was eventually allowed, she said."Anywhere the child went, even within the hospital, for studies to surgery, the agents followed," Gonzalez said.In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said it was committed to enforcing the nation's immigration laws."Due to the juvenile's medical condition, border patrol agents escorted her and her cousin to a Corpus Christi hospital where she could receive appropriate medical care.Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly.The Mexican Consulate has been advised of the situation by Laredo Sector Border Patrol," the agency said.Health and Human Services said in a statement that it "does not identify individual (unaccompanied alien children) and will not comment on specific cases."Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, lambasted the Trump administration, saying that too many people who pose no threat to national security are being deported.The Department of Homeland Security "claims to be prioritizing its apprehension but Rosa Maria is not a threat to anyone's safety.(Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has the discretion to release Rosa Maria anytime and they are choosing not to do so," the congressman said, though the girl is not in that agency's custody."This is just one story but this administration's immigration policies are affecting families across Texas and across the nation."An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the agency had no involvement in this specific case.However, it has a "sensitive location" policy that prohibits routine enforcement arrests in hospitals, schools and churches, but that policy is distinct from Customs and Border Protection's enforcement at checkpoints, where travelers must show documentation.ICE doesn't make arrests at sensitive locations like hospitals, schools, or churches except in the case of a serious public safety threat pic.twitter.com/Yudor4ed7S ICE (@ICEgov) October 26, 2017 A family in distress Rosa Maria remains in Health and Human Services custody, as virtually all undocumented unaccompanied minors are in immigration cases, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said.The child's 85-year-old grandfather -- a legal permanent resident for 45 years -- petitioned Customs and Border Protection for custody of his granddaughter.His request was denied, Gonzalez said.The Office of Refugee Resettlement has procedures for finding sponsors and guardians to whom they can release minors in its custody.The hospital discharge papers indicate that due to Rosa Maria's diminished mental capacity, she needs to be cared for by people she knows and is comfortable with, her attorney said.Typically in these types of cases, the office will find a sponsor for the minor, and then the notice to appear -- which triggers immigration court proceedings -- will be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's local Enforcement and Removal Operations field office, the official said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.That notice to appear usually comes from Customs and Border Protection once they encounter and process the individual.Enforcement and Removal Operations will file the notice with the immigration court, and a court date will be scheduled to begin removal proceedings.An immigration judge makes the final ruling on whether to provide some sort of relief for the individual or could issue a final removal order, clearing the way for deportation, the official said.JUST WATCHED Meet the guardian to over 800 children Replay More Videos ...

Pharmacist acquitted of murder in 2012 meningitis outbreak:::::Story highlights Pharmacist was cleared of the most serious charges against him Prosecutors says he was callous; defense says he did not commit murder (CNN) A Boston jury found former supervisory pharmacist Glenn Chin not guilty of murder in the deaths of 25 people during a 2012 meningitis outbreak, but convicted him of other charges.Chin, who worked at the New England Compounding Center, or NECC, was convicted Wednesday of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and false labeling.He was acquitted of second-degree murder.Glenn Chin leaves a Boston federal court during his trial.The deaths were allegedly caused by contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, a steroid manufactured by the compounding pharmacy."Mr. Chin ran NECC's clean room operations with depraved disregard for human lives," said acting US Attorney William D. Weinreb in a statement."As a licensed pharmacist, Mr. Chin took an oath to protect patients, but instead deliberately violated safety regulations, causing the largest public health crisis caused by a pharmaceutical drug in US history."Read More
Pesticides: How 'bout washing them apples?:::::(CNN) Perhaps you run an apple under water for a moment before chomping down.Perhaps you give it a good rub on your shirt, or maybe you don't even remove the sticker before taking a bite.But chances are, that apple was treated with pesticides to protect it from threats like insects and fungi.Pesticides can boost harvests, but some can be toxic to humans in high concentrations, according to the World Health Organization.Fruits and vegetables do get washed before they hit the shelves -- for example, with bleach solutions But some researchers have wondered whether that wash was enough."We want to see whether or not the factory level (of washing) is already effective" at removing pesticides, said Lili He , a food scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.On Wednesday, He published a study comparing bleach, tap water and baking soda in removing two pesticide residues: phosmet and thiabendazole.In the new study, baking soda came out on top.The authors say this is because the pesticides degrade faster in baking soda, making them easier to physically remove by washing.She said this could be accomplished by mixing roughly a teaspoon of baking soda into two cups of water, though the measurement "doesn't have to be that strict."Bleach, on other hand, is primarily meant to kill bacteria and other germs that might build up, He said.In He's study, no method was 100% effective in removing pesticides from the apples, which were not taken directly from orchards but rather coated with pesticides in the lab.This is partly because thiabendazole is a "systemic" pesticide, meaning it penetrates below the surface.He's team estimated that 80% of thiabendazole residues were removed by the baking soda solution, versus over 95% of phosmet."The further the pesticides got penetrated in, the harder it was to wash away," He said.Her study did not test any other home cleaning methods, like vinegar, nor did she include the full panoply of pesticide residues that might be found on apples.For this reason, "I wouldn't be too concerned about which is the best way," said Dr. Motoko Mukai , a toxicologist in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who was not involved in the study.Mukai said different pesticides may degrade -- or not degrade -- in the presence of baking soda or other compounds."It all depends on the chemical properties of the pesticide, so it's not one fit for all," said Mukai, who generally uses tap water alone to wash her fruits and vegetables.She added that research has shown that washing produce is effective at reducing pesticide residues, but there is "not a clear winner."Other types of cooking or food processing, like blanching or juicing, can also lower residue levels.You can also buy organic, Mukai said, but "it's not entirely pesticide-free.I would still wash before consuming it."Another option is peeling fruit, "although that reduces the nutritional content, so that's a tradeoff," Mukai said.Some experts say that pesticide levels are too low to be harmful to humans, while others warn that long-term low-level exposure could still have damaging effects -- particularly on agricultural workers and their kids."Produce has been tested ... to make sure that pesticides are below threshold of what we consider to be toxic to humans," Mukai said.for each pesticide between 1994 and 2015.Of the two pesticides that He tested, the USDA's Pesticide Data Program shows only three presumed violations for thiabendazole and none for phosmet.For the USDA database, over 7,000 samples of apples were testedfor each pesticide between 1994 and 2015.Phosmet is an insecticide, and thiabendazole is an antifungal that can prevent different types of molds and rots.Thiabendazole can also be used in humans to treat parasites such as roundworms, but in much greater doses than might be found on a storebought apple, according to the EPA.Environmental officials have "determined the extremely low levels of those residues are not a food safety risk, and the presence of such residues does not pose a safety concern," according to the USDA."We have pretty good control of pesticide amount," He said."That doesn't ensure that there's no risk at all.""What we really can do is reduce the risk" by washing, she added.Experts say the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables far outweigh any potential pesticide risk.The FDA recommends washing all produce under running water, even if you don't plan to eat the skin.Firm fruits and veggies, like apples and cucumbers, should be scrubbed with a produce brush before drying with a clean towel, the agency says.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.When it comes to buying organic, the jury is still out as to whether there are solid health benefits.According to one study, "our findings do not indicate that substituting organic ... commodities for conventional forms will lead to any measurable consumer health benefit.As for He, she prefers to play it safe for her two children, ages 3 and 7."For my kids, I'm going to wash longer.Maybe I'll add a little bit of baking soda in there," He said."If it's just me, I'll probably just wash it a few seconds."She did not eat the apples after her experiment.
Missouri college requires students to attend patriotism class:::::(CNN) The College of the Ozarks, a private, Christian college near Branson, Missouri, has a new mandatory course that it unveiled this week called Patriotic Education and Fitness.The school said it's designed to encourage students' understanding of America's heritage, the nation's civic responsibilities, love of country and willingness to defend it."This is about understanding the military.We will require everyone to take the class, and everyone will benefit from their exposure to military science, in and out of the classroom," school president Jerry C. Davis said in a statement ."We have seen a decrease in the understanding of our military and the important role it plays in our democracy.We will do our part to correct this."The four-credit hour course involves more than just reading about America's values or learning basic flag protocol.It also teaches military skills like pistol and rifle marksmanship, map reading and land navigation -- even Army rappelling techniques.
Venezuela: A child's life cut short amid country's crisis:::::(CNN) Deivis Perez didn't say how much pain he was in.His tears and splitting skin spelled it out.The teenager needed dialysis treatments for his failing kidneys.But instead of aid, Deivis contracted a deadly bacterial infection called sepsis at a children's hospital in Venezuela, a nation grappling with severe shortages of medicine and proper equipment amid a wider array of crises.The water that the hospital used for Deivis' dialysis machine wasn't properly kept and filtered, doctors say, allowing bacteria to enter his bloodstream.Deivis lost 22 pounds in his first two months in the hospital after starting his dialysis treatment.An ulcer in his throat made it too painful to eat solid food.A severe outbreak of dark spots covered his upper body, which created a burning sensation.His 14-year-old body shrank to that of a 7- or 8-year old.When CNN met with Deivis and his mother, Sandra Galindez, in late July, he cried and buried his head in his hands."I want everyone to see what's happening with us here.It's not just what you're seeing on TV: the protests, the clashes.We are in the hospital suffering," said Galindez, a single mother with two other young adult children.Galindez gave up her job to take care of Deivis.He couldn't sleep through most nights, so she often got only three to four hours rest at a time.Deivis suffered for three more weeks before dying the night of August 17 after going into respiratory shock.After his death, Galindez was overwhelmed with "sadness, anger, an enormous emptiness in my heart, in my soul.""It really hurts knowing that you bring your son (to the hospital) for one thing, he gets worse from others, then you get him back in a box," she said.Deivis Perez's 14-year-old body shrank to that of younger child.Venezuela is in its own crisis.Skyrocketing inflation has created extreme shortages of food, medicine and other essentials.A political crisis peaked in July when President Nicolas Maduro replaced the opposition-controlled legislature with an entirely new legislature filled only with his supporters.Several governments, including that of the United States, have labeled Maduro's regime a dictatorship.Deivis was one of eight children to die this year just in the dialysis ward at the public children's hospital.Last year, only three children died in the dialysis unit at Hospital de Nios J.M.de los Rios in Caracas.Deivis wasn't the only child infected by the bacterial outbreak in the dialysis unit at this hospital.At least four children died as a direct result of the infection, according to the head of the nephrology unit, Dr. Belen Arteaga.The other four died from complications related to their renal illness.The quality of the care Deivis received is a point of contention between Arteaga and Galindez.Arteaga says that the hospital isolated the infected children and stopped the outbreak's spread and that Deivis' bacterial infection was stabilized.She says the hospital had blood for a transfusion to give him and even had the right catheter.But the hospital didn't have a functioning operating room where the catheter could be replaced.Arteaga noted that Deivis' body didn't respond well to the transfusions he received early in his hospital stay.After his death, Deivis' mother felt "an enormous emptiness in my heart, in my soul."Galindez blames the hospital and Venezuela's health ministry, which oversees public hospitals.She says neither did anything as she alerted hospital staff that Deivis' condition was deteriorating.Venezuela's health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Arteaga acknowledges that the hospital lacks even the basics: gloves, masks, antibiotics and resources for certain operations, such as replacing a catheter for a blood transfusion.Most of its medicines and supplies come from foreign nongovernmental organizations and foundations.Venezuela's health ministry hasn't responded to many of the hospital's requests for supplies, Arteaga says."If we don't offer everything that they truly need to get better, the mortality rate will undoubtedly go up," she said."We don't even have emergency surgical rooms."Galindez says she found a matching kidney for Deivis last summer.But it was a futile search: Kidney replacements for children haven't happened since April because the hospital doesn't have the resources to perform the operation.Functional filters for dialysis machines are also hard to come by.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Sadly, Deivis' death is one of many in Venezuela's spiraling humanitarian crisis.Malaria cases soared to 240,000 in 2016, a 76% increase over 2015, according to a rare release in May of records from the health ministry.That's telling: Venezuela eradicated malaria in its most populated states by 1961, according to the World Health Organization.Maternal deaths in Venezuela rose 66% last year to 756.Infant deaths shot up to 11,466, a 30% jump.Maduro has both rejected foreign aid and called for medical relief, though the situation on the ground shows no signs of changing.Some outside experts speculate that if the government accepted the aid, it would be acknowledging that it can't solve its crises on its own.What Galindez would say to Maduro after losing her son: "Resolve all the crises in the country -- and if he doesn't feel prepared to do that, then simply hand over power."
The alarming story of a woman who sweats blood from her palms and her face:::::(CNN) Sweating blood from her face and the palms of her hands, a 21-year-old woman was admitted to an Italian hospital.Drs.Roberto Maglie and Marzia Caproni, both dermatologists at the University of Florence, reported the case Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.The patient, whose identity remains anonymous as is customary in case studies, had no signs of scratches or wounds.Her spontaneous bleeding episodes had no obvious trigger and each instance lasted anywhere from one to five minutes and then ended on its own.Sometimes the bleeding occurred while the young woman was sleeping, at other times, while she was exercising or physically active.The patient had endured the condition for three years.Embarrassed by the ghoulishness of her symptoms, the young woman had socially isolated herself and experienced symptoms of major depression, as well as panic disorder.Analysis of her skin where the bleeding had occurred showed nothing unusual.Tests of her blood revealed no coagulation issues or other problems.Maglie did not respond to a request for comment.According to the journal, Maglie and Caproni diagnosed hematohidrosis, a rare disease marked by spontaneous discharge of "blood sweat" through intact skin.The doctors first treated her depression and panic symptoms with an antidepressant, paroxetine, and an anti-anxiety medication, clonazepam.Next, they prescribed propranolol, a beta blocker prescribed to patients with heart conditions, a drug which had been used in similar cases in the past.This treatment reduced her bleeding, but did not end it.Though Duffin did not treat or write about the patient, she explored the history of sweating blood cases and this particular case in an "I believe the case is real," said Dr. Jacalyn Duffin, a retired hematologist, and a medical historian and professor at Queen's University in Ontario.Though Duffin did not treat or write about the patient, she explored the history of sweating blood cases and this particular case in an editorial published this week in the same journal.Skepticism overcome by facts Duffin traced the earliest mention of sweating blood back to Aristotle's writing in the third century B.C.In two instances, the Greek scientist and philosopher described sweat that either looked like, or really was, blood.Reading about "lots of cases all around the world," Duffin said they shared surprising similarities in the way they occurred and how they happened."The more research I did historically, the more I realized these people didn't know each other ... and so they couldn't be inspired by each other," said Duffin.These individual cases, then, could not be attributed to copycat behavior.In the accounts she read, the most common sites for sweating blood were the forehead, scalp, face, eyes and ears."Some of them have had it on their trunk, some on their limbs -- it appears it can be anywhere," said Duffin.Pain or tingling preceded some instances of sweating blood, while several patients experienced headaches or hypertension.Sweating blood is not exclusive to females, but most patients were women."Although it's horrible to look at and horrible to suffer, it seems not to be associated with negative [health] outcomes," said Duffin, adding that none of the patients reported in modern times had died of it.Most patients, like the Italian woman, experience distress.A couple of the patients Duffin read about were infants."I'm not sure that the infants experienced distress, but certainly their parents do," she said."It's terribly embarrassing and when nobody seems to know what causes it, it's very frightening to have it," said Duffin."Doctors are perplexed and yet it's so obvious and scary looking."The medical confusion is not for a lack of trying to understand this condition and its cause.Multiple causes?"In all the cases that were published, the blood was tested and there was no coagulation problem -- including in the case today," said Duffin."Because the first thing you think is, 'Oh, they're a bleeder, they have a bleeding disorder.'There was nothing wrong with their blood, so that implies there's something wrong with their skin."There, too, the evidence was inconclusive.In some cases, blood appears in the sweat ducts, yet the ducts of other patients remain clean of blood.Skin biopsies appear normal.While theories abound, none have been proven, said Duffin.An unrelated case study of sweating blood was reported from Hospital General Universitario de Alicante in Spain."It could be that this phenomenon of having blood appear on your face could have multiple different causes," she said, having speculated herself on the condition's physiological origins.In some cases, she noted, patients have experienced a terrible fright before the bleeding starts."Suddenly your adrenaline goes up and if your adrenaline goes up, maybe it does something to the microvasculature -- your tiny capillaries -- in your skin that causes them to shrink or explode," suggested Duffin.This unproven scenario could be one cause of bleeding skin."Or perhaps it's an inherited fragility of the blood vessels in the skin," said Duffin."Or maybe it's triggered by some chemical we don't know about.""What we learned from the cases I reviewed in the literature, it can spontaneously remit -- in other words it can just vanish with no explanation," said Duffin."It comes with no explanation and it goes with no explanation."This lack of explanation leads others to turn to religion.Christian overtones "A lot of the medical literature that we're familiar with in the West is written through the lens of Christianity," said Duffin.So many of the doctors who write about sweating blood refer to the description of Christ sweating blood before the crucifixion."The religious authors and the medical authors both seem to be citing each other," said Duffin, referring to this as "mutual reinforcement and endorsement."Yet, religion is non-scientific by definition.Perhaps it is this religious aspect that has caused medicine "to steer away from it," Duffin suggested.Whether they are believers or not, religion is something doctors "want to be respectful of and not treat in a cavalier way," she said.She also noted that cases have been reported around the globe, yet this is the first case study appearing in a North American journal.Meanwhile, "blood sweat" is extremely rare.Duffin completed her research by consulting older hematologists yet none had ever seen a case for themselves.She said, "it's not there in the books so it's like it doesn't exist, and that raises the question: How do new diseases ever get recognized?"Overall, the many cases over time convinced Duffin that patients' symptoms were true, unexplained phenomenon.And babies certainly would not be faking it, she said, though when children have unusual, unexplained symptoms, doctors "think the mother is faking it -- doing that to her child."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."If somebody knows that it's false and how this falseness can be produced, I would be fascinated to learn," she said.There's enough cases in the scientific literature now that it's really hard to believe all these doctors were duped."There comes a point where you have to say, 'Hmm this looks like something real.'And now it befalls the rest of us to figure out what it might be," she said."I

CDC recommends new shingles vaccine to replace older one:::::On the heels of Friday's Food and Drug Administration approval of Shingrix , a new vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline for the prevention of shingles, a federal committee of immunization experts voted Wednesday to recommend Shingrix for all Americans 50 and older.Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body and can last for two to four weeks.One in three Americans will develop shingles in their lifetime, with the risk increasing to half of adults over 85, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the CDC on vaccine usage, also recommended that adults who received Zostavax, a shingles vaccine made by Merck, be revaccinated with Shingrix.Additionally, the committee expressed its preference for Shingrix over Zostavax.GlaxoSmithKline says Shingrix will be available "shortly."Zostavax was licensed and recommended by the committee in 2006 for people 60 and older, including those who have had an episode of shingles.Until now, it has been the only approved vaccine to protect against the virus.Vaccine differences Vaccines "teach" the body's immune system how to identify and protect itself against a virus or microbe it has not come into contact with.Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.Zostavax, a live-attenuated vaccine, introduces a weaker (attenuated) version of the varicella zoster virus in order to stimulate the immune system.By comparison, Shingrix is a non-live, subunit vaccine that works by introducing only an essential subunit of the actual microbe.The intention of using part rather than the whole pathogen is to reduce the possibility of the body having an adverse reaction.Zostavax is a single-shot vaccine that is given once.Shingrix is also a one-time-only vaccine, yet two shots are given two months apart.Between 10% and 18% of patients will experience a complication known as postherpetic neuralgia, which causes pain and lasts from three months up to several years, once the shingles rash is gone.Studies presented to the committee show that Zostavax is 51% effective against shingles and 67% effective against postherpetic neuralgia.In contrast, Shingrix is 97% effective against shingles for people between the ages of 50 and 69 and 91% effective for people 70 or older.It is 91% effective against postherpetic neuralgia for people 50 and older.These rates are based on evidence presented to the committee from clinical trials with over 38,000 total participants.Both vaccines wane in effectiveness over time.Zostavax diminishes in effectiveness by 15% to 25% after the first year and shows no significant protection by the ninth year, according to research presented to the committee.Shingrix remained at or above 85% effectiveness up to four years after vaccination; longer-term effectiveness is unknown.Committee considerations About 31% of the US population age 60 and older -- about 20 million people -- has been vaccinated with Zostavax, which is considered high uptake for an adult vaccine, according to the CDC.More than one committee member suggested that familiarity with shingles -- and the serious pain it can cause -- accounts for this unusually high rate of acceptance.There are an estimated 1 million cases of shingles in the nation each year, according to the CDC.Deliberating before the vote, the committee examined the cost-effectiveness of the two vaccines by estimating the total price of each vaccine and the costs when people become ill and compared the relative economic impacts.The committee also considered possible challenges to giving adults two shots of a vaccine instead of only one.Real world data on other two-dose vaccines suggest that some people do not get both doses.With little fuss, the majority of the 15-member committee voted both to recommend Shingrix and revaccination with it.The pre-vote debate became lively, though, when considering whether to prefer Shingrix over Zostavax for the prevention of shingles and related complications."It's not so much a matter of not preferring (Shingrix); it's a matter of not preferring this vaccine at this particular moment in time," said Cynthia Pellegrini, the solo consumer representative on the committee.Though eight members voted in favor of preferring Shingrix, Pellegrini and six others voted against the motion.She would rather the committee "wait a year or two and get a little bit more data about the real-world uptake implications of this vaccine," she said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Pellegrini admitted that Shringrix has been studied "very extensively" for almost a decade.Though the clinical studies included a large number of participants, she noted that participation rates among ethnic minorities were "quite low."Different population groups, then, might have bad reactions to the vaccine not yet seen by the scientists, she said.Though outvoted on the preference issue, she voted in favor of recommending Shingrix for everyone over 50 and revaccination for those who had received Zostavax.
CDC recommends booster shot for mumps outbreaks:::::(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Wednesday to recommend the use of a third "booster" shot of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine during outbreaks of the mumps.Dr. Manisha Patel, a medical officer at the CDC, said a person who received a third dose of the MMR vaccine would have increased protection against mumps compared with someone who had received only two doses.A study at the University of Iowa "demonstrated the effectiveness of the third dose," Patel said.Other data showed that no serious adverse events were reported among more than 14,000 people who had received a third dose during a mumps outbreak.Any of the study participants' side effects were mild, such as a stomachache.An increasing number of outbreaks in recent years prompted the CDC to debate whether a third dose of the vaccine should be recommended, Patel explained.Between January 2016 and June 2017, there have been 150 mumps outbreaks with 9,200 total infections, half of them in university settings."We're actually still hearing reports of outbreaks, and it's unclear at what time at what point these will end," Patel said.The new recommendation "provides a tool for health departments and providers to protect those persons at increased risk during an outbreak."Before the official recommendation, a third dose has been given during outbreaks on a case-by-case basis.For instance, Syracuse University Health Services has offered students a third dose during its ongoing mumps outbreak; as of Monday, there have been 27 confirmed and 48 probable cases of mumps on campus.Mumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite lasting a few days.Most people will then see salivary glands swell, causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw.Third dose recommendation The MMR vaccine is 88% effective when two doses have been given.In people who receive just one shot, the vaccine is less effective.Infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner said the effectiveness of the vaccine "begins to wane slowly over 10 or 15 years."However, people who have been vaccinated "still have partial protection," said Schaffner, who is also a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical School.If you do get the mumps, you will get a milder case than if you had never been vaccinated, he explained.Most recent outbreaks have occurred among vaccinated people, according to Patel.Just before the CDC made its recommendation Wednesday, an advisory committee reviewed data from recent outbreaks, including the number of vaccinated people who became infected.In its deliberations, the panel assessed the impact of a third dose in decreasing the size and duration of outbreaks.The CDC currently recommends that children get their first dose when they are 12 to 15 months old and a second dose at 4 to 6 years.Outbreaks of mumps tend to occur in areas where there is crowding and close contact, according to Patel.Campuses are a typical site for outbreaks because of the sharing of saliva: by coughing, sneezing, kissing and sharing utensils, lipstick or cigarettes.Possible complications The incubation period for mumps ranges from 12 days to 25; symptoms last at least two and usually more than 10 days.Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.These include deafness and inflammation of the brain, ovaries, breast tissue or testicles.Since it is caused by a virus, mumps will not respond to antibiotics.Doctors generally recommend bed rest and over-the-counter pain relievers.Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks, according to the CDC.Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, the CDC received reports of 186,000 cases each year.The actual number of cases was probably much higher but not always reported since most doctors considered the mumps a typical childhood disease.Since the development of the vaccine, cases have decreased by more than 99% in the United States.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Each year, the number of mumps cases fluctuates within a range of a couple hundred to a couple thousand, according to Patel.In 2016, the United States experienced the highest number of mumps cases in a decade: more than 6,000, according to CDC preliminary reports.The number of cases is high this year, too.As of October 7, the CDC has received reports of 4,667 total mumps infections in 47 states and the District of Columbia for the year.The third booster shot should be helpful to students at Syracuse University and other places where infections are being passed from person to person."It's one way to help curtail an outbreak," Schaffner said."Although it's not a magic potion."

124 dead, nearly 1,200 infected with plague in Madagascar:::::(CNN) A plague outbreak in Madagascar has infected 1,192 people since August, with 124 deaths, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Madagascar's National Bureau of Risk Management and Disaster reported on Monday.The majority of cases, 67%, were the pneumonic form of the disease, which can spread from person to person.Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague.Symptoms include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, as well as fever, chills and coughing.Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection that can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets such as through coughing or sneezing, for example.The incubation period is short, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours.Both forms can be treated with antibiotics, making early detection a priority.Of Madagascar's 114 districts, 40 have reported cases of pneumonic plague and less than 30% of people who have had contact with cases can be traced, according to the UN office.Those who've been in contact might need treatment themselves and may pose further risk of spreading the infection.Cases have been reported in at least 10 cities, including the the larger, more populated, cities of Antananarivo and Toamasina.People stand back as a council worker sprays disinfectant during the clean-up of the market of Anosibe in the Anosibe district, one of the most unsalubrious districts of Antananarivo.But 780 individuals have been cured of their infection since August 1 and six of the affected districts have not reported new cases for 15 days, the UN report states.Despite the increase in numbers, the trend has been relatively stable, a World Health Organization representative told CNN.Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, added that about half the deaths are occurring in the community, not health centers, according to government figures, which demonstrates that more work needs to be done to help people understand that treatment is available, and they need to go to health services as quickly as possible.Plague is endemic to Madagascar, with an estimated 400 cases reported there every year, mostly the bubonic variety, but the current outbreak has affected more areas and started earlier than usual.It's also unusual for large urban areas to be affected, as they have been this year, the WHO previously told CNN.The current outbreak began after the death of a man in the central highlands of the country -- a plague-endemic area -- after which the Ministry of Public Health began investigating and tracing his contacts, according to the WHO.The epidemic has garnered national and international control efforts.Eight health centers have been designated by WHO to manage plague cases and alleviate the burden on hospitals and health clinics.Last week the International Federation of Red Cross also announced the deployment of a treatment center in the country.The federation's Secretary General Elhadj As Sy called for global support and launched an emergency appeal for around $5.5 million last week.WHO has also provided the medications to treat up to 5,000 people and protect 100,000 people who may have been in contact with infected individuals.Both organizations have trained and mobilized thousands of volunteers.Protocols are also being proposed for safe burial practices to ensure maximum safety and protection from infection.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Public schools are closed and the government has forbidden public gatherings, according to the Red Cross.The risk of further spread nationally remains very high, WHO stated in its most recent situation report , and risk of regional spread is moderate due to neighboring islands and southern and east African countries.Samples from patients in Seychelles suspected to be ill with pneumonic plague tested negative, the WHO reported Tuesday."The risk of international spread is low, because generally, people with plague are too sick to travel," Ndiaye told CNN in a previous report.She explained WHO is working closely with Madagascar's airport authorities to ensure control measures -- such as temperature checks and medical teams -- are in place at airports and ports to prevent the spread of infection outside the country.
Water-borne infections push Puerto Rico death toll higher:::::Story highlights Hurricane Maria's death toll rose to 51 in Puerto Rico A large number of residents are still without clean drinking water (CNN) More than a month since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the death toll from the storm has risen to 51, according to Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety The latest two victims died from leptospirosis, an infection that can spread after floods through contaminated water, Public Safety press officer Karixia Ortiz told CNN.The cause of death is also included in the latest list of certified deaths just released by Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety.Puerto Rico has announced at least 76 cases of suspected and confirmed leptospirosis , including several deaths, in the month after Hurricane Maria, according to Dr. Carmen Deseda, the state epidemiologist for Puerto Rico.The spiral-shaped Leptospira bacteria, which are found in the urine of rodents and other animals, can spread after floods through drinking water or infection of open wounds, according to the World Health Organization.Leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics, and many people recover on their own.But a small number may develop dire complications such as meningitis or kidney or liver failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Man dies of flesh-eating bacteria after Harvey cleanup:::::(CNN) Hurricane Harvey has claimed another victim, about two months after making landfall in Texas .A 31-year-old man died last week after being diagnosed with a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection known as necrotizing fasciitis, the Galveston County Health District announced Monday.The man has been identified as Josue Zurita, according to the Houston Chronicle , and he was helping repair several homes damaged by flooding from Harvey.Zurita went to the hospital on October 10 with a seriously infected wound on his upper left arm and was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, according to the Galveston County Health District.In an obituary on the Galveston-based Carnes Brothers Funeral Home's website , Zurita was called a "loving father and hard-working carpenter" who moved to the United States from Mexico to help his family and "remained to help with the rebuilding after hurricane Harvey."Zurita's death follows that of Nancy Reed, a 77-year-old Houston-area woman who died in September from necrotizing fasciitis related to Harvey floodwaters.J.R. Atkins, a former first responder, also contracted a flesh-eating bacterial infection but survived, according to CNN affiliate KTRK .He had been kayaking through floodwaters to check on neighbors affected by the hurricane, according to a Facebook post in September "We're surprised we saw three of them in the region, but given the exposure to all the construction and potential injuries that people would have ... it shouldn't be surprising.It's well within what we would expect given those numbers," said Dr. Philip Keiser, the Galveston County local health authority.Yet such infections as necrotizing fasciitis are very rare, Keiser said.Since 2010, about 700 to 1,100 cases occur each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention JUST WATCHED Floods pose more health risks than you may think Replay More Videos ...

What happens in a mother's brain when her baby cries:::::(CNN) Researchers are learning more and more about the relationship a mother has with her baby.Around the world, new moms appear to have a universal response both in their behaviors and in their brains when they hear their babies cry, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.In the new study, moms from 11 countries consistently picked up, held and talked to their infants when they heard their infants sob.MRI scans were also taken of mothers' brains, which revealed heightened activity in regions tied to caregiving, movement and speech.Finding such connections between the brain and behavior is in part what neuroscience is all about, said the study's lead author Marc Bornstein, chief of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's section in child and family research.Moms respond to crying babies in just '5 seconds' "As for the 'practical' side, infant cry is one of the most talked about and asked about issues for new parents.Cry also signals the health status of a child," Bornstein said.JUST WATCHED Preparing for Motherhood Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Preparing for Motherhood 03:23 "Infant cry excites some adults, mothers included, to respond with empathy and care but others with neglect or even abuse.Infant cry is a trigger to maltreatment.So understanding how mothers normally respond to cry at the behavioral and nervous systems levels is potentially telling," he said."We hope this research will spur others to study brain responses associated with non-normal variations in parenting, such as mothers who maltreat."The study involved 684 first-time healthy mothers from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, France, Kenya, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea and the United States.The researchers observed and recorded one hour of interactions between each mom and her baby, around 5 months old, while at home.The researchers found that the mothers had surprisingly consistent responses to their crying babies, "and in a very short amount of time from the start of the cry, five seconds, they preferred to pick up and hold or to talk to their infant," Bornstein said.JUST WATCHED Doctor's viral trick quiets crying babies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Doctor's viral trick quiets crying babies 01:56 Using MRI technology, the researchers also scanned the brains of a separate group of 43 healthy first-time mothers in the United States.The mothers were scanned while they heard their own infant cry or make other noises.MRI scans were also taken of yet another group of 44 healthy moms in China, who were more experienced with infants, while they heard infant cries and other sounds that came from a database.The MRI scans showed that in both groups, hearing infant cries generally activated regions in the brain tied to the intention to move, grasp and speak, the processing of auditory stimuli and caregiving.Those brain areas that were activated in the study could be described as "readiness" or "planning" areas, said Robert Froemke, a neuroscientist at New York University who was not involved in the study."There's also widespread activation of the hearing part of the brain," Froemke said."It also makes sense that there would be widespread activation because these (infant cries) are alarm cries."'New mother's brains undergo dynamic changes' Froemke has studied oxytocin , a hormone that plays an important role in mother-infant bonding, in mice, and he has examined how it helps shape a mother's brain to respond to her offspring's needs.In human mothers, such as the women in the new study, oxytocin and other brain chemicals could be at play in reinforcing the urgency of responding to a crying baby, Froemke said.her baby's cries.On separate occasions, previous studies unrelated to the new research have found associations between giving birth vaginally and breastfeeding to a mother having stronger brain responses toher baby's cries.Now, "the current study contributes to the existing literature on the human mother's brain by identifying the common brain regions that are sensitive to baby cry sounds across cultures," said Pilyoung Kim, associate professor of psychology at the University of Denver, who was not involved in the new study but led separate previous research on the neuroscience of motherhood."This is an important step toward future studies to better understand common, as well as unique responses that mothers in different cultures show to their own babies, in their brains and behaviors," she said."New mothers' brains undergo dynamic changes to help the mothers to cope with stress and support their transition to motherhood."Froemke praised the new paper for involving a cross-cultural sample of mothers, yet the study had some limitations.All of the first-time mothers from 11 countries were not necessarily representative of their entire nations, Bornstein said, so more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge in a larger sample."Also, we did not measure the brains of the same mothers for whom we measured behavior or vice versa, and so we are assuming that these brain-behavior associations hold," Bornstein said."After all, the robustness of the behavioral results across 11 countries and the fMRI results across three countries tells us at least that chance is unlikely to be operating," he said."Scientists like to be cautious about assigning causality.This was not an experiment but the coordination of two sets of observations, about behavior and brain."JUST WATCHED What's going on inside a baby's mind?Replay More Videos ...

Leptospirosis: Suspected cases on rise in Puerto Rico:::::(CNN) Puerto Rico has reported at least 76 cases of suspected and confirmed leptospirosis, including a handful of deaths, in the month after Hurricane Maria, said Dr. Carmen Deseda, the state epidemiologist for Puerto Rico.Two deaths involved leptospirosis confirmed through laboratory testing, and "several other" deaths are pending test results, Deseda said.The 76 cases, up from 74 last week , also include one patient with confirmed leptospirosis who is currently hospitalized.Spiral-shaped Leptospira bacteria, which are found in the urine of rodents and other animals, tend to spread after floods through drinking water or infection of open wounds, according to the World Health Organization.In serious cases, infection causes organ failure and can be fatal."This bacteria, like any other bacteria, can kill you," Deseda said.The island typically sees between 63 and 95 cases per year, she said.Health officials had expected that there would be a jump after the hurricane."It's neither an epidemic nor a confirmed outbreak," Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario Cortes said at a news conference Sunday."But obviously, we are making all the announcements as though it were a health emergency."Leptospirosis may be treated with antibiotics , but many people recover on their own."The majority of the lepto cases is a mild, subclinical disease with no complications," Deseda said."But one out of 10 people who have leptospirosis develop severe illness."In the first stage of leptospirosis, symptoms vary widely from fever and headache to red eyes and rashes.Some people may have no symptoms at all.But a small number will develop dire complications: meningitis, kidney and liver damage, bleeding in the lungs and even death.Doctors are required to report any potential leptospirosis cases to health authorities, Deseda said.Those cases must then be tested to confirm the bacteria, since the symptoms can be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses.After that, health officials may look for patterns or clusters and determine whether there is an outbreak.The lab tests on the suspected cases have been sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Deseda said.The turnaround time is about five or six days.Doctors on the island have expressed concerns about burgeoning health crises amid hospitals that are overwhelmed, undersupplied and sometimes burning hot.Influenza is another concern on the horizon, Deseda said.Drinking water is also hard to come by on many parts of the island.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Dr. Raul Hernandez, an internist in San Juan, told CNN that people were drinking water from whatever sources they could find, such as rivers and creeks.If that water contains urine from an infected rat, those people will be at risk, he said.Deseda said people should be discouraged from walking barefoot, drinking or swimming in potentially contaminated waters."These diseases are everywhere, and there's a way to prevent them," she said.
The science of sleep: Finding a cure for narcolepsy:::::One of my first jobs was to keep a lookout for lions.There are some occupations that are not suitable for someone with untreated narcolepsy and this is probably one of them.I was 22, a recent zoology graduate studying meerkats in the Kalahari desert in South Africa.We worked in pairs, one of us on foot, walking with meerkats, the other in the jeep scanning the horizon for signs of leonine danger.On many occasions, I awoke with the imprint of the steering wheel on my forehead, realizing that meerkats and colleague had wandered out of sight.I would look for signs of life and, as the panic grew, signs of death.I can tell this story now only because nobody got eaten.I have not always been like this.For the first 20 years of my life, I had a healthy relationship with sleep.Shortly after my 21st birthday, though, I began to experience symptoms of narcolepsy, a rare but not-so-rare disorder thought to affect around one in 2,500 people.If people know one thing about narcolepsy, it's that it involves frequent bouts of uncontrollable sleepiness.This is true, but the condition is so much more disabling, often accompanied by cataplexy (where a strong emotion causes loss of muscle tone and a ragdoll-like collapse), trippy dreams, sleep paralysis, frightening hallucinations and, paradoxically, fractured night-time sleep.There is no cure.Yet.What there is, though, is overwhelming evidence that the most common cause of narcolepsy is an autoimmune attack, where the body's immune system mishandles an upper respiratory infection and mistakenly wipes out the estimated 30,000 neurons in the center of the brain.In an organ of up to 100 billion cells, this might not sound like too much to worry about.But these are no ordinary cells.They are found in the hypothalamus, a small, evolutionarily ancient and unbelievably important structure that helps regulate many of the body's basic operations, including the daily see-saw between wakefulness and sleep.The cells in question are also the only ones in the brain that express a type of protein called orexins (also known as hypocretins) that regulate wakefulness.The answer to my problems appears to be simple -- I just need to get the orexins (or something similar) back inside my brain.So why am I still waiting?Every dog has its day In April 1972, a toy poodle in Canada produced a litter of four.Eager families were quick to snap up the cute puppies, but one of them, a silver-grey female called Monique, soon developed what her owners described as "drop attacks" when she tried to play.When vets at the University of Saskatchewan observed Monique, they suspected these were bouts of cataplexy, and hence figured this might be a case of narcolepsy with accompanying cataplexy.As luck would have it, Monique's diagnosis coincided with the arrival of a peculiar circular from William Dement, a sleep specialist at Stanford University in California.He was on the lookout for narcoleptic dogs.The Saskatchewan vets wrote back to him immediately.When Monique's owners were persuaded to relinquish their pet, Dement managed to convince an airline to fly her to California.Word began to spread, and soon Dement and his colleague Merrill Mitler were looking after Monique alongside several other narcoleptic dogs, including a Chihuahua-terrier cross, a wire-haired griffon, a Malamute, Labrador retrievers and Doberman pinschers.The fact that narcolepsy appeared to be more common in some breeds than others suggested there could be some kind of genetic basis to the disorder.Then came the breakthrough: a litter of around seven Doberman puppies, all of them with narcolepsy and cataplexy.It turned out that in Labradors and Dobermans, the disorder was inherited.Dement made the decision to focus on Dobermans and, by the end of the 1970s, he was the proud custodian of a large colony and had established that narcolepsy in this breed was caused by the transmission of a single recessive gene.By the 1980s, methods of genetic analysis had advanced just enough to contemplate an effort to hunt down the defective Doberman gene.I can never reconstruct the combination of factors that led to the onset of my own narcolepsy, but the stage was set at the moment of my conception in 1972, at around the time of Monique's birth in Saskatchewan.My one-cell self inherited a particular version of a gene, known as HLA-DQB1*0602, that forms part of a set that helps the immune system distinguish friend from foe.HLA-DQB1*0602 is pretty common -- around one in four people in Europe boasts a copy -- but it plays a key role in many cases of narcolepsy, and is present in 98 per cent of those with narcolepsy and cataplexy.On top of this genetic background, there may have been some bad timing too.People with narcolepsy are slightly but significantly more likely to be born in March (as, indeed, I was).This so-called birth effect is seen in other autoimmune disorders and is probably explained by a seasonally variable infection at a particular moment in development.In the case of narcolepsy, it seems that those of us born in March are just a little bit more vulnerable than others.While other infections during my childhood, hormonal fluctuations and emotional stress may also have played a part, it was in late 1993 that I probably encountered a key pathogen -- an influenza virus or Streptococcus perhaps.It was this that took me to an autoimmune tipping point and resulted in the rapid dismantling of my orexin system.Craig Povey, who lives with narcolepsy On the hunt Around this time, the Doberman project in Stanford was on the verge of unraveling the genetic basis of narcolepsy in this breed.The man tasked with hunting down the mutation responsible was Emmanuel Mignot, who subsequently succeeded Dement as director of the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine.Back in the 1980s, the idea of locating the gene for canine narcolepsy was off-the-scale ambitious.Breeding narcoleptic Dobermans is harder than it sounds, as the afflicted tend to topple over mid-coitus, temporarily paralyzed by a cataplectic thrill (an "orgasmolepsy" that can occur in humans too).This impracticality aside, there was also the task of locating a gene whose sequence was not known, in a genome that was, at the time, a no man's land."Most people said I was crazy," says Mignot.In a sense, they were right, because it took him more than a decade, hundreds of dogs and over $1 million.And he was nearly beaten to it.In January 1998, after more than a decade of painstaking mapping, and just as Mignot's team was closing in on the gene, a young neuroscientist called Luis de Lecea at the Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, and colleagues published a paper describing two novel brain peptides.They gave them the name "hypocretins" -- an elision of hypothalamus (where they were found) and secretin (a gut hormone with a similar structure).They appeared to be chemical messengers acting exclusively inside the brain.Just weeks later, a team led by Masashi Yanagisawa at the University of Texas independently described the exact same peptides, though called them "orexins" and added the structure of their receptors into the bargain.Back at Stanford, Mignot heard about the two papers, but there was no reason to imagine this new pathway had anything to do with narcolepsy or sleep.By the spring of 1999, however, he and his team had worked out that the recessive mutation had to lie in one of two genes.One was expressed in the foreskin."It didn't look like a candidate for narcolepsy," says Mignot.The smart money was on the other gene, which encoded one of the two orexin receptors.When he got wind that Yanagisawa had engineered a mouse lacking orexins that slept in a manner characteristic of narcolepsy, the race was on.Within weeks, Mignot and his team had submitted a paper to the journal Cell, revealing a defect in the gene encoding one of the orexin receptors."This result identifies hypocretins [orexins] as major sleep-modulating neurotransmitters and opens novel potential therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic patients," they wrote.Kahlua -- one of a litter of Dobermans all named after alcoholic beverages -- lay sprawled across the cover of the issue.Yanagisawa and colleagues added their experimental evidence to the mix just two weeks later, also in Cell.From discovery to drugs The orexin neurons are a very big deal, and not just for those like me who've lost them.Present in every major class of vertebrate, they have to be doing something seriously important.We have found out a lot, particularly thanks to optogenetics, a technique de Lecea helped pioneer.By deploying a virus, a promoter and a gene found in blue-green algae, it is possible to render a particular population of neurons sensitive to light.Using optogenetics and other methods, de Lecea has been able to show that the orexins have a powerful effect on many important neurological networks.In some settings, they act like neurotransmitters, crossing gaps in neurons to activate target neurons that release a chemical called norepinephrine throughout the brain's cortex.In other settings, the orexins act more like hormones, working further afield in the brain.This is how orexins influence other brain chemicals, including dopamine (essential for the processing of reward, in planning and for motivation), serotonin (strongly associated with mood and implicated in depression) and histamine (an important alerting signal)."In most other neural networks, there are parallel and multiple layers of security," says de Lecea, but in the case of the orexins, however, there appears to be little or no backup at all."It is a brilliant model for understanding neural networks more generally," says de Lecea.Within just 15 years of the Cell publication by Mignot and colleagues that linked a loss of orexin to narcolepsy, Merck had received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for suvorexant (or Belsomra as it's known in the trade), a small molecule capable of getting through the blood--brain barrier and blocking orexin receptors.A drug that promoted sleepiness was not the application that most people with narcolepsy were looking for.By preventing the orexins from binding to their receptors, Belsomra effectively creates an acute case of narcolepsy, but where the fog, ideally, will have started to lift by the morning.However, the millions of us with narcolepsy are still hoping for a drug that could work in the brain to rouse rather than silence the orexin system.This has been a long-term project for Masashi Yanagisawa, who was in the race with Mignot to link the orexins with narcolepsy 20 years ago.But designing and synthesizing a compound that will make it through the gut intact, that has what it takes to find its way from blood to brain, and that boasts the perfect configuration to activate one or both of the orexin receptors is "a very, very high challenge" he says, one that is "significantly" greater than finding a compound to interfere with the receptor as Belsomra does.Earlier this year, Yanagisawa and his colleagues published data on the most potent such compound to date, a small molecule called YNT-185.Although the affinity of YNT-185 (how strongly it binds to the orexin receptor) is not great enough to warrant a clinical trial, Yanagisawa's team has already hit upon several other potential candidates."The best one is almost 1,000 times stronger than YNT-185," he says.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.There is a widespread perception that narcolepsy is a rare disorder with a small market, so any pharmaceutical research and development in this area would be unlikely to reap a significant return.This ignores the fact that narcolepsy is probably undiagnosed in many people, and that someone who develops narcolepsy in their teens and lives into their 80s would need some 25,000 doses over their lifetime.Even more compellingly perhaps, the orchestrating role that the orexins play in the brain suggests the market for such a drug would go far beyond narcolepsy.Something that tickled up the orexins would be useful for any condition where excessive daytime sleepiness is an issue, not to mention the myriad other situations where low levels of these messengers may play a role, including obesity, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and dementia.There is, I believe, one other reason why this story has not yet reached its conclusion.For too long, sleep has been undervalued, seen as an inconvenient distraction from wakefulness.With this mindset, research into the neuroscience of sleep does not seem like it should be a priority.Nothing could be further from the truth.There is now abundant evidence that poor sleep can have devastating consequences for physical, mental and psychological health.Sleep is not incidental.It is fundamental, a matter of serious public health.Investing in sleep research is not just about the few with demonstrable sleep disorders.It is about everyone.
Listeria triggers major recall of veggies across US and Canada:::::Story highlights Possible listeria contamination prompted a major produce supplier to recall products Certain people are at increased risk of serious infection, including pregnant women and newborns (CNN) A leading vegetable supplier in California, Mann Packing, voluntarily recalled products that might have been contaminated with a harmful bacteria called listeria, the company announced last week.The recall affects packaged produce at multiple supermarkets across the United States and Canada including Walmart, Whole Foods , Trader Joe's, Meijer, Albertson's and Safeway."Mann Packing is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution," the company said in a statement, adding that it is cooperating with US and Canadian health officials to recall the products.No illnesses have been linked to the products, the company said.The contamination risk was picked up by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency through random sampling.The affected items were listed as "best if used by" October 11 to October 20.Customers should not consume these items but should discard them or return them to the place of purchase.
Global study reveals 72 gene mutations that lead to breast cancer:::::Researchers from 300 institutions around the world combined forces to discover 72 previously unknown gene mutations that lead to the development of breast cancer.Two studies describing their work published Monday in the journals Nature and Nature Genetics The teams found that 65 of the newly identified genetic variants are common among women with breast cancer.The remaining seven mutations predispose women to developing a type of breast cancer known as estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, which doesn't respond to hormonal therapies, such as the drug tamoxifen.The new discoveries add to previous research bringing the total number of known variants associated with breast cancer to nearly 180.Beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2 The international team of 550 researchers across six continents, known as the OncoArray Consortium, included professor Doug Easton of the University of Cambridge, who led the investigation."Essentially, we used blood samples from a very large number of women (nearly 300,000), about half of whom had had breast cancer," Easton explained in an email.Next, the researchers used the DNA from the samples to look for genetic mutations."Think of a gene as a very long strand of DNA," said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society , who was not involved in the research.DNA is made up of nucleic acids, and when a nucleic acid is incorrectly placed along the strand, this is referred to as a genetic mutation, noted Brawley.Take BRCA1 and BRCA2, two well-known genes that confer a high risk of breast cancer when they contain mutations.There are 125,950 base pairs in the BRCA 1 mutation, noted Brawley."Think of it as a 125,950 letter word," said Brawley."A mutation is a misspelling such that the gene cannot code the proper protein."A gene that cannot code the proper protein leads to disease.According to the National Cancer Institute , 55% to 65% of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and around 45% of women who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70.However, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 risk mutations, which are present in less than 1% of women, explain only a fraction of all inherited breast cancers.The consortium came together, then, to discover the other causes of breast cancer susceptibility -- the additional genetic mutations that can lead to this form of cancer.Finding the other mutations The researchers measured DNA at over 10 million sites across the genome, said professor Peter Kraft of Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health, a study author."At each of these sites, we asked whether the DNA sequence in women with breast cancer was different than that in women without," said Kraft."Because our study was so large, we could detect subtle differences between these two groups of women and be sure these differences were not due to chance."According to Jacques Simard, a study author and professor and researcher at Universit Laval, Quebec City, the newly discovered mutations only slightly -- by anywhere from 5% to 10% -- increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.But even though, individually, these mutations don't have as big as an effect as BRCA1 and BRCA2 defects, there are many of them, so their "overall contribution is larger," said Easton.An individual woman, then, may have two or more of these common smaller risk gene mutations, and so her risk for developing breast cancer increases due to their combined effects.Kraft noted that "taken together, these risk variants may identify a small proportion of women who are at 3-times increased risk of breast cancer."Women found to have a number of these smaller risk genetic mutations, then, would likely benefit from earlier mammography screening.Simard agreed, noting that it may be time to "adapt" breast cancer screening guidelines based on this information instead of basing mammography guidelines on age alone.By doing so, Simard said, "we will detect a higher number of breast cancers."Quantifying cancer risk Brawley described the new research as "not earth-shattering."It is "most important for us nerds," he said, but less so for the general public.These types of studies help experts identify mutations that "help us quantify the risk," said Brawley."It helps us figure out that a non-patient, often a relative of a cancer patient, is at risk and helps us quantify that risk."Normal lifetime risk of breast cancer is 12.5% for women in the US, said Brawley.Lisa Schlager, vice president of community affairs & public policy for the nonprofit FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered), said past studies and evidence indicate that about 10% of breast cancers are hereditary."This new information may mean that that estimate is low," said Schlager.It is important for patients to know whether their cancer is due to an inherited genetic mutation because they may be at increased risk of other cancers or their treatment recommendations may differ based on that fact, said Schlager."And their family members may be affected with the same mutation," said Schlager.Enabling personalized medicine For the promise of personalized medicine to be realized, our government and health system need to "embrace the ability to use genetic information to tailor health care by providing affordable access to the needed screening and preventive interventions," said Schlager.As it stands now, men with BRCA mutations as well as some women may not be covered for screening by their insurance in the US.Brawley said "this type of genome wide screening has and is being used to identify genes that are associated with increased risk of a number of diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, stroke and heart disease.""The same methodology can be used for other cancers," said Easton.The screening method used by the consortium, the OncoArray, was designed to be used in many other cancer types, including prostate, ovary, colorectal and lung cancer, he said.Simard added that the cost of the genetic screen is "quite cheap," at less than $50 per individual."We can use just a blood sample or saliva sample.It's not difficult to obtain the material for a genetic analysis," he added.Kraft said it was important to keep in mind that the study was conducted primarily among women of European ancestry.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."For sure we have missed some variants associated with cancers that are common in some non-European populations but rare in Europeans," said Kraft.To find these, cancer genetic studies in Africans, African Americans, Latinas, Chinese and other populations are ongoing, he added.Easton commented that most of the newly identified variants "are in regions of the genome that regulate nearby genes."These may someday serve as targets for new therapies or drugs to cure the disease.In the end, the most important lesson here is the fact that this research has been a collaborative effort, said Simard."Scientists are not in competition against each other," he said."We are really working together to expedite and to accelerate the discovery."
You don't need a permit to buy a gun in Nevada:::::(CNN) Before the shock and horror subside after a mass shooting, a long-simmering debate inevitably heats up over gun control.The shooting on October 1 in Las Vegas, in which at least 58 people were killed and at least 515 were injured , will no doubt focus a spotlight on Nevada's gun laws, some of which are among the nation's least restrictive.Authorities have not revealed the specific type of gun or guns used by the shooter, although they believe he purchased them legally.Some facts about gun laws in the Silver State: The right to bear arms is enshrined in the first article of Nevada's constitution: "Every citizen has the right to keep and bear arms for security and defense, for lawful hunting and recreational use and for other lawful purposes."
Toxic tensions in the heart of 'Cancer Alley':::::LaPlace, Louisiana (CNN) Geraldine Watkins sits at the kitchen table in her ranch home, rattling off the names of friends and relatives in her small Louisiana town who've died of cancer over the last 40 years.Her grandchildren suffer an array of ailments, from skin conditions to breathing problems.Her 7-year-old great-grandson's breathing is so labored, she says, "you can feel his heart trying to jump out of his chest."Watkins lives in the shadow of a plant that spews chloroprene -- a chemical so toxic the Environmental Protection Agency says nearby residents face the highest risk in the country of developing cancer from air toxins."You gotta live here to try to breathe the air, drink the water, see the children so sick and watch people die," Watkins says."Industry is wonderful to have, but if it's killing the people in the area that they live in, what good is industry?"Watkins is a worthy advocate, a 76-year-old great-grandmother challenging those in power.Her words are often punctuated by folksy aphorisms: "Nothing beats a failure but a try," she says.And try she will.A town wants answers The town of LaPlace, Louisiana, lies along the Mississippi River, a stone's throw from Lake Pontchartrain and the Maurepas Swamp.It sits in the heart of an area that's become known by locals as "Cancer Alley," a vast industrial stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge where dozens of petrochemical plants dot the landscape.One sign posted by a local advocacy group warns the town's 29,000 residents that they are "more likely to get cancer due to chloroprene air emissions."The warning refers to the Denka Performance Elastomer plant at the edge of town, where a vast network of pipes and valves stand testament to industry.The facility looms over Fifth Ward Elementary School, where children run around the playground oblivious to the toxic emissions in the air.The Denka plant is the nation's sole producer of neoprene, the synthetic rubber used in everything from wetsuits to automotive hoses.It's also at the center of a battle over its emissions.The plant, formerly operated by DuPont, employs more than 200 workers and has been in this spot for nearly 50 years.The facility plays a vital manufacturing role as the nation's only producer of neoprene, a synthetic rubber that's found in everything from gaskets and hoses to fishing waders and wetsuits.But it also emits 99% of the nation's chloroprene pollution, according to the EPA .Chloroprene is the main chemical used in the production of neoprene.In 2010, the EPA determined that chloroprene is "likely carcinogenic to humans," meaning studies showed it likely causes cancer in people.The EPA has not set a legal limit for chloroprene emissions.But according to a May 2016 memo, federal regulators said the "upper limit of acceptability" for cancer risk was an annual average of 0.2 micrograms of chloroprene per cubic meter.Anything more than that would increase the risk of developing cancer, the EPA determined.Residents say they were largely unaware of the 2010 EPA finding.But in December 2015, the EPA updated its National Air Toxics Assessment map, which showed an elevated risk of cancer around the plant -- prompting Denka to enter into an agreement with the state of Louisiana to voluntarily reduce chloroprene emissions by 85% Tensions in the community mounted after Denka representatives and state environmental officials briefed the public on the agreement.The town hall meetings may have been intended to reassure residents, but they only seemed to create more questions: Residents wondered why they weren't warned years before and said their complaints have been ignored.While Denka agreed to the voluntary 85% reduction, it disputes the EPA's 0.2 recommendation and insists its own research shows no connection between chloroprene and cancer.Denka is a Japanese chemical company that bought the plant from DuPont in 2015.Denka officials say the EPA based its cancer estimate on faulty science and have demanded that the EPA issue a correction.The company commissioned and submitted a study that argued chloroprene's classification should be changed from "likely carcinogenic to humans" to "possibly carcinogenic" -- and that the 0.2 guideline should be changed to 31.2, more than 150 times the EPA's recommendation.An EPA spokesman told CNN the agency is reviewing the company's complaint but indicated the science behind the agency's findings was solid.In the spring of 2016, the EPA installed six canisters near the plant -- including at the hospital, levee and two local schools -- to collect air samples.Every three days, the air quality is tested.The daily readings have been jarring -- 10 times, 50 times and 100 times the EPA's "upper limit of acceptability" for cancer risk.On one occasion last November, the reading spiked at the levee and tested 700 times the recommended cancer risk, according the EPA data.At the elementary school, the average concentration from May 2016 to August 2017 was more than 34 times the EPA's recommendation."Our primary concern is with exposures over a lifetime," the EPA's spokesman wrote CNN in an email."If the concentrations were to persist at current levels for a lifetime, there is potential for adverse health effects.This is why EPA and the state are working with Denka to reduce emissions."Residents aren't satisfied with the 85% solution.They've rallied together to form the Concerned Citizens of St. John the Baptist Parish.Many wear T-shirts that read: "Only 0.2 will do."In June, 13 residents filed a class-action lawsuit against the plant, aimed at forcing the company to reduce emissions to meet the 0.2 EPA risk recommendation.Pollution from the facility, the suit alleges, is "sufficient to cause physical discomfort and annoyance to plaintiffs, who must often confine themselves indoors to escape the excess concentration of chloroprene emission.""In addition, the excess concentrations of chloroprene emissions lead to a reasonable and justified fear of cancer," the suit says.Plant manager: There is no cancer risk Sitting inside the facility, Denka plant manager Jorge Lavastida said the company is sensitive to the concerns of residents about air quality."We want to be a part of this community.We want to be admired by this community.We want to have employees from this community," he told CNN.But he disputed the EPA on almost every point, citing the plant's own study and emphasizing the company voluntarily committed to the 85% emissions reduction plan at a cost of nearly $18 million."It's our No.1 priority," he said.The company has already finished two of the four projects included in the reduction plan.He said the company hopes to complete the other two by year's end, although the work is months behind due to unexpected complications."We are fully committed and fully resourced to the projects," he said.Denka plant manager Jorge Lavastida says the company doesn't believe chloroprene causes cancer, but it committed to a plan to reduce emissions by 85%.Citing the company's own study, Lavastida added this about the safety of the chloroprene being emitted: "There is no relationship between chloroprene and cancer."Asked if that means the company believes chloroprene does not cause cancer, he said simply, "That is correct."He added he is "optimistic" the EPA will revise its 0.2 guideline soon.Lavastida said one of the projects already completed has reduced chloroprene emissions by 62%."We know they're working," he said.The company maintains six air quality monitors of its own in and around the plant, separate from the EPA's.However, EPA data provided by the state to CNN showed something completely different: The air quality has worsened, not improved, at five of the six government testing sites over the last year.Asked about those readings, Lavistida said, "I don't know if I can explain that."Short-term health effects of being exposed to high doses of chloroprene range from headaches and hair loss to irritability and a rapid heartbeat, according to the EPA.It may also affect the liver, lungs, kidneys and the immune system.Long-term exposure can lead to respiratory problems, skin issues, chest pains and neurological problems, in addition to an increased likelihood of cancer, the EPA says.Statewide cancer rates are not specific enough to capture whether the incidence is higher in the areas around the plant.That's because cancer rates are calculated for entire parishes, not at a more local level.The current data for the parish doesn't show a higher rate of cancer among the parish's 44,000 residents; in fact, it has one of the lowest rates in the state -- a figure that company and state officials use to defend their efforts.But more precise data may soon be available.A new state law requires the Louisiana Tumor Registry to track cancer cases by ZIP codes and census tracts to help determine whether certain areas within parishes are more prone to cancer.'Filling us up with poison' Robert Taylor III grew up near the plant and was in and out of the hospital with kidney problems throughout his youth.He moved away after high school and had no problems for more than 20 years.But six months after moving back, Taylor says, his kidneys failed.Sitting at his kitchen table, he points across the street: "Husband and wife died from cancer."Then, he waves his hand toward another home: "Husband died of cancer.Both of his sons got cancer.""These people are filling us up with this poison," he says of the plant.Long-time resident Robert Taylor has suffered an array of kidney problems since youth.His daughter, Nayve Love, needs an oxygen machine to help breathe several times a week.Taylor is part of the class-action lawsuit against Denka.He joined on behalf of himself and his daughter, Nayve Love, who suffers breathing problems and needs to use an oxygen machine several times a week.His father, who founded the Concerned Citizens of St. John the Baptist Parish, is also a plaintiff."We're not just going to sit around and let them push us around," Taylor said."They don't have any compassion for human life.My little girl is 10 years old.She's innocent."Wilma Subra is a chemist and long-time environmental activist in Louisiana.She's been keeping close tabs on the Denka plant and has helped advise the citizens' group.She said she's appalled at how state officials have seemingly turned a blind eye to the pollution."They have dismissed the issues and concerns of their citizens here in St. John the Baptist Parish," she said."Meanwhile, the citizens are continuing to breathe the air with chloroprene every single day.""If we do not continue to push the company to put on (additional) control technologies to reduce the chloroprene levels," she said, "the people will continue to be exposed."State environmental boss: Ignore EPA figure Chuck Carr Brown, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of Environmental Quality, says he tries to straddle the line between industry and the people he's committed to serving.His agency's mission, according to its website, is "to promote and protect health, safety and welfare while considering sound policies regarding employment and economic development."At a heated public meeting last December, he told residents that much of the cancer concerns were overblown and the situation wasn't anything comparable to the lead-contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan "It's not like there's a smoking gun somewhere in St. John Parish," he said.Brown praised the plant's commitment to reducing emissions by 85% with what he called the "best available control technology.""We're going to monitor for at least another year, and we should start seeing these numbers start trending downward," he said.During the meeting, he dismissed the EPA's 0.2 cancer guideline on chloroprene emissions."That's not a standard," he said."That's just a guidance."Adding to the tensions between residents and his agency, Brown called vocal residents around the plant "fear-mongers."In an interview with CNN, he said, "I don't want to repeat that.""I'm not going to say I regret using the term.I just felt like I could've used a different term," Brown said.He also expressed frustration that "everybody seems to ignore" data put out by his agency."At this point, there is no reason to believe that there is any undue risk or exposure to the folks in St. John Parish," Brown said."If that changes, then we'll be the first ones to take immediate action."He again dismissed the EPA's 0.2 guideline."It never was an enforceable standard," he said, "and it's still not an enforceable standard."He said his agency hopes to use the new technology being installed at the plant to set a standard for chloroprene emissions -- and not be hamstrung by the 0.2 EPA guideline.As head of the state's environmental organization, he said, "I wanted to enter a working relationship with the company in order to install what we call the best available control technology.""That's why I've tried to tell everyone: Detach yourself from that number and let's work toward a solution that involves the best available control technology.""But if that's the guidance," CNN asked Brown, "why not be guided by it?"Brown stood his ground, saying the new technology would be used to set the standard, not the EPA's 0.2 figure."To artificially target a number that you can't legally enforce," he said, "it actually makes no sense."He rejected suggestions he was following the company's lead."That's not what we're doing," he said."It's not like you just turn a valve or are working with LEGO pieces.We're talking about large piping, large tubing, rerouting and engineering."CNN asked Brown why tests of the air quality have shown more toxins this year, rather than dropping as he pledged back at the December meeting."We'll show you some data that refutes that," he said."You'll get a spike.But when you start looking at the average over a month, it's really trending downward."His detractors, he said, should look at the data provided by his agency to "see the real facts."He paused and spelled out the word, "F-A-C-T," adding that "everything else is just somebody's theory."CNN did look at the facts provided by Brown's office after the interview, and it confirmed what we already knew: That the toxicity in the air recorded by the EPA was worse in June 2017 at five of the six testing sites than it was in June 2016 despite the improvements at the plant.In her humble ranch home a little over a mile from the plant, Geraldine Watkins bites her tongue when told of Brown's comments.She says some words aren't meant to be repeated.Geraldine Watkins says the plant needs to change its ways: "You gotta live here to try to breathe the air, drink the water, see the children so sick and watch people die.""My tongue gets blue, but I can control it," she says.She was at the December meeting when Brown addressed the crowd.His comments back then filled her with rage: "If eyes could kill, I would have cut him to death that night."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.She mulls over Brown's latest remarks, thinking about her great-grandchildren's unexplained conditions."This is horrible," says Watkins, who is not part of the class-action suit."If you don't live in the area, you can say anything and everybody is supposed to believe that."She wants clean air to breathe, for everyone in town -- and for herself."Let me live," she says."Whatever time I have left, let it be decent."
Why Type A people often struggle with weight loss programs:::::These qualities also mean they can get frustrated with mainstream diets and workout programs when they don't work.The problem is that weight loss programs have a one-size-fits-all structure to appeal to the masses.So for Type As committed to a program and following it diligently but frustrated by failure, it may be the program that's a failure, not them.But you can also harness the psychology of a Type A personality to turn diets and workout frustrations and failures into successes.Consider three areas of opportunity.The all-or-nothing approach This is a classic mindset for Type A personalities: You're either all in, or you're all out.If you're getting sick or feeling tired, you'll work out no matter what, because that's what the program says.If you're on a strict diet but it's your birthday, you'll avoid cake at all costs.But the problem with this approach is that you'll feel ultra-restricted and be more likely to go overboard next time.Therefore, you need to build some flexibility into the rules.Are a few bites of cake really going to derail your diet?No.So instead of feeling like one little misstep will derail you, build confidence that you know what's best for you and that your diet is simply an outline, not the law.If you are intensely committed to exercise and don't leave room for feeling sick or tired or wanting to change the workout you had scheduled, it can lead to burnout.If you're not getting enough sleep to wake early and work out, you are probably better off sleeping in a few days a week and doing fewer workouts.Really intense workouts Sometimes, a long or intense workout can seem intimidating.However, if you've got a Type A personality and you're committed to a weight loss program, these workouts may seem non-negotiable!But sometimes, you're exhausted or your body is too sore from a previous workout.A break is needed, and it can be too taxing on the body to follow a regimented workout plan every single day.Again, leave room for flexibility and changes to your workouts.Instead of doing an intense spinning class because that's what was on the schedule, allow yourself the freedom to choose a more relaxing yoga class instead.If you run out of time to do a 45-minute workout at the gym without feeling frazzled and rushed, make a deal with yourself that you'll do a 15-minute ab routine in your living room instead.Sometimes, the commitment to intense workouts doesn't allow us room to connect with how we feel and what we know is best for our bodies, so taking a moment to assess our feelings is key to sticking to a program long-term.Avoiding social gatherings If you're following a rigid weight-loss program, going out to eat can cause a lot of anxiety.Will you be tempted by food off your plan?Will others comment about your eating habits?Will the chef cook your food correctly (light sauce, light seasoning and grilled rather than fried, please)?Although these are valid concerns when you're on a healthy eating plan, they don't have to cause you to become a hermit.Food programs can always be adapted for your own individual needs.For example, if you're going a friend's house, eat something that's on your food plan before heading over, and then pick and choose what you'd like to eat once you're there.Arriving full will decrease your likelihood to overeat foods that aren't on your plan.Similarly, when you're out to eat at a restaurant, pick foods that are on your plan, and don't stress too much about the specifics, like how the protein or veggies are cooked or what sauce is on them.You can ask for light sauce or no sauce, or to sub vegetables for mashed potatoes, for example, but avoiding eating out altogether would make anyone go crazy!Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.The benefits of having a Type A personality include finding security in the structure and rigidity of diet and workout programs, but this personality type also needs to allow room for flexibility and changes.Just because you go off the course of one particular program doesn't mean you've gone off-course altogether.Making choices that align with how you feel and what you want for yourself is a top priority and is essential to being successful while engaging with a specific and formulated weight loss program.
Families of young people with autism struggle with mental health needs:::::(CNN) Teenagers and young adults with severe autism are spending weeks or even months in emergency rooms and acute-care hospitals, sometimes sedated, restrained or confined to mesh-tented beds, a Kaiser Health News investigation shows.These young people -- who may shout for hours, bang their heads on walls or lash out violently at home -- are taken to the hospital after community social services and programs fall short and families call 911 for help, according to more than two dozen interviews with parents, advocates and physicians in states from Maine to California.There, they wait for beds in specialized programs that focus on treating people with autism and other developmental disabilities, or they return home once families recover from the crisis or find additional support.Sixteen-year-old Ben Cohen spent 304 days in the ER of Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo.His room was retrofitted so the staff could view him through a windowpane and pass a tray of food through a slot in a locked door.His mother, who felt it wasn't safe to take him home, worried that staff "were all afraid of him ... [and] not trained on his type of aggressive behaviors."The hospital "is the incredibly wrong place for these individuals to go in the beginning," said Michael Cummings, the Buffalo facility's associate medical director and a psychiatrist who worked on Ben's case."It's a balancing act of trying to do the ... least harm in a setting that is not meant for this situation."Nationally, the number of people with an autism diagnosis who were seen in hospital ERs nearly doubled from 81,628 in 2009 to 159,517 five years later, according to the latest available data from the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.The number admitted also soared, from 13,903 in 2009 to 26,811 in 2014.That same year, California's state health planning and development department recorded acute-care hospital stays of at least a month for 60 cases of patients with an autism diagnosis.The longest were 211 and 333 days.The problem parallels the issue known as psychiatric boarding, which has been an increasing concern in recent years for a range of mental illnesses.Both trace to the shortcomings of deinstitutionalization, the national movement that aimed to close large public facilities and provide care through community settings.But the resources to support that dwindled long ago, and then came the Great Recession of 2008, when local, state and federal budget woes forced sharp cuts in developmental and mental health services."As more children with autism are identified, and as the population is growing larger and older, we see a lot more mental health needs in children and adolescents with autism," explained Aaron Nayfack, a developmental pediatrician at Sutter Health's Palo Alto Medical Foundation in California who has researched the rise in lengthy hospitalizations."And we have nowhere near the resources in most communities to take care of these children in home settings."James Cordone was hospitalized for seven weeks in 2015 after his family grew unable to quell his rages.So, families struggle -- with waiting lists for programs, low pay for government-supported in-home help and backlogged or ineffective crisis support.Often they've faced some of these challenges for years.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder typically diagnosed at a young age and characterized by impaired communication, difficulty with social interaction and repetitive behaviors that fall along a spectrum of mild to severe.Adolescents and young adults with severe autism may still have the mental age of a child, and short-term care to stabilize those in crisis who are nonverbal or combative is practically nonexistent.Longer-term care can be almost as hard to find.It must be highly specialized, usually involving intensive behavioral therapy; someone with severe autism gets little benefit from traditional psychiatric services.General hospitals "are not really equipped to handle someone who is autistic," said Mark De Antonio, director of adolescent inpatient services at Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital in Los Angeles.Several times a month, he said, he hears about patients with no immediate care options being medicated and sedated as they're held."It's a huge problem."Alex Sanok spent a month in the hospital this summer.In New Hampshire this summer, 22-year-old Alex Sanok spent a month in Exeter Hospital after he became violent at home, breaking windows and hurling objects at walls.His mother called 911, and paramedics spent half an hour trying to calm him before restraining him.At the hospital, his wrists and ankles were strapped to an ER bed for the first week, and he spent several more weeks in a private room before he could be transferred, according to his mother, Ann Sanok.State agencies that handle developmental disabilities and mental health offered little help, she said.As the days passed, she said, she and her husband wondered: "What if [Alex] escalates again, what are we doing to do?We were getting no answers.Everyone seemed to kick the can down the road."Exeter Hospital said in a statement that its policy is not to use restraints unless there is an "imminent threat to patient or staff safety" and that any use is reviewed hourly.Sanok was moved in June to a special-needs residential school in Massachusetts, where his mother said he is doing well.The federal government does no routine tracking of how autism is treated in ERs, but many experts say the problem of lengthy and inappropriate stays is nationwide and growing.Kaiser Health News identified some of the more extreme cases through interviews with autism and disability advocates, physicians and families in California, New Hampshire, New York and six other states: Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Michigan and Rhode Island.Nancy Pineles, a managing attorney with the nonprofit group Disability Rights Maryland, said a group home took one young adult to a Baltimore ER earlier this year after he hit a staff member.And that's where he remained for several weeks before the hospital moved him to a room in its hospice wing, she said -- not because he was dying, but because there was nowhere else for him to go.Such cases have been "on the increase," Pineles said."People with autism and more intense behavioral needs are just being frozen out."In Connecticut, the head of the state's Office of the Child Advocate told lawmakers during a hearing on disability issues in May that the problem had reached a "crisis" level.Private-insurance data underscore the concerns.In a study published in February in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, researchers from Pennsylvania State University found that young people ages 12 to 21 with autism are four times more likely to go to the emergency room than peers without autism.Once there, they are 3 times more likely to be admitted to a hospital floor -- at which point they stay in the hospital nearly 30 percent longer.The analysis, based on a sample of 87,000 insurance claims, also showed that older adolescents with autism are in the ER more than their younger counterparts.The percentage of their visits associated with a mental health crisis almost doubled from 2005 to 2013."You're looking at an increase in unmet need," said Nayfack, who with Stanford University colleagues documented a similar trend from 1999 to 2009 in hospital admissions for young Californians with autism.By contrast, they found, hospitalization rates held steady during that decade for children and teens with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other diagnoses.Tyler Stolz, a 26-year-old woman with autism and a seizure disorder, was stabilized after a few weeks in a Sacramento hospital, yet she remained there 10 months, according to Disability Rights California, an advocacy group that described her case in its 2015 annual report.Ultimately, Mercy San Juan Medical Center went to court to demand that Stolz's public guardian move her.The court filing noted that Stolz "previously harmed hospital staff" and that "a security officer is posted to the patient's room 24/7."Although her conditions no longer required her hospitalization, they still "represent dangers to defendant and possibly to others if she were discharged to the community," the facility contended."There is no safe place for the client to go."The advocacy nonprofit helped place Stolz at a Northern California center that offered intensive behavioral therapy, recounted Katie Hornberger, its director of clients' rights.The medical center did not respond to a request for comment, but two years after an investigator found Stolz in a bed covered by a mesh tent, the case remains vivid in Hornberger's mind."I don't believe we put people in cages," she said.New York Stands Out Some of the longest hospital stays in the nation, averaging 16.5 days, occur in New York state.James Cordone, 11, spent seven weeks in a Buffalo, N.Y., children's hospital in a tent-like bed, with a hospital receptionist or instrument sterilization tech in his room at all times, his mother said.The difficulty families like hers face is "the dirty little secret no one wants to talk about."Debbie Cordone says her son, James, benefited tremendously from intensive behavioral therapy.Debbie Cordone of Cheektowaga, N.Y., was a retired police dispatcher who had raised her own children when she and her husband adopted James as a toddler.Diagnosed with autism at 3, James was a boy with a bright smile who loved to cuddle, she said.At 8, James began to grow combative.To ward off injury, the Cordones locked up their knives and forks and put away glass picture frames.But then their son started head-banging -- a problem with some children who have a severe case of autism.The Cordones' house bears the scars of his pain, including holes in the drywall and a shattered window.On his 9th birthday, in December 2014, James went into a rage, Cordone said.It took four adults to restrain him."He was trying to put his head through the window, sweating profusely," she said."He was not there.It was a blank stare."The family called 911.James was taken to the Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo, where he was sedated on and off for 13 days.He went home, but a fit of rage a few months later landed the young boy in the same hospital for seven weeks in March 2015."We couldn't ride out the storm any longer," Cordone said.Cordone said her son lived out those weeks in a "Posey Bed," which resembles a child's playpen propped on top of a hospital bed.During that time, she joined her adult children in a social media campaign to pressure her insurer to pay for intensive behavioral therapy.The family prevailed, and James went to a center in Baltimore where staff three counselors for his case alone focused on his communication skills and adjusted his medication.He now lives in a group home near the Cordone family.He is "a success story," Cordone said, albeit a rare one among children with severe autism.James Cordone damaged walls by banging his head on them."This is a crisis," she said, "and no one is recognizing it."Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo did not return calls seeking comment.Mary Cohen, who also lives in the Buffalo area, has endured a similar struggle as a single mother.Ben's 6-foot-1, 240-pound presence dwarfed her petite frame.She began locking herself in a basement room to escape his outbursts, while still monitoring him via cameras she'd installed throughout the house to make sure he was safe.As the lock-ins became more frequent, she realized, "I can't keep going like this."She found a nearby group home, covered by his disability and Medicaid payments, that could accommodate Ben.On Aug. 1, 2016, it all imploded.Medication changes and an ear infection triggered a rage, Cohen said, and Ben hurt one of the staff members.Someone called 911, he was taken to the psychiatric emergency room at Erie County Medical Center, and a waiting room there is where he lived until early this summer."Staff was on the other side of the window watching him 24 hours around the clock," Cohen said.Though a 304-day stay is a record there, cases like this have surged at the hospital, said Cummings, its executive director of behavioral health.They spurred him to launch a grant-funded home-visit program aimed at keeping families with autistic children from reaching a breaking point.He and his clinical partner have counseled nearly 400 families to help manage their youngsters' medications and find services, and their ER visits have dropped by nearly 50 percent, he said."It's money best spent now, because you're going to spend it in the end," stressed Scott Badesch, president of the Autism Society.The organization, well aware of what Badesch calls hospital "warehousing," is pushing lawmakers nationally to spend more on behavioral counseling and in-home support for families.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.A bed finally opened up for Ben at Baltimore's Kennedy Krieger Institute -- a private, highly regarded facility that offers intensive therapy, psychiatry and family coaching.Cohen held out for a placement there, hoping the staff could turn Ben's behavior around.The teen and his mother made the 360-mile trip in June by ambulance and plane."I want to do the right thing for him," Cohen said."Because one day I'm not going to be there for him."
Heel spurs and masturbation: A history of military medical exemptions:::::(CNN) Donald Trump has faced scrutiny over his multiple US military deferments during the Vietnam War but many Americans are still questioning what exactly qualifies as a draft exemption -- especially from a medical perspective.Classification records shared with CNN by the federal government's Selective Service System confirm that Trump received a student deferment and was later found "disqualified for military service" in 1968 after he underwent a physical exam.No 'habitual drunkenness' or 'masturbation' allowed Regulations determining which diseases and ailments disqualify a registered man from being drafted for military service can be traced to the Civil War, according to a digital copy of an 1863 regulation manual in the National Library of Medicine that spans 100 pages.Consider just a few of the many medical conditions that could have disqualified someone from military service, if found to be severe or detrimental, in 1863: Insanity or mania Scrofula or constitutional syphilis Cancer Habitual drunkenness Acne rosacea Masturbation may result in rejection or discharge of service Minimum stature of 5-foot-3, and possibly maximum height of 6-foot-3 A greater weight than 220 pounds, unless accompanied by corresponding height and muscular sufficiency Deafness Hernia and stomach ulcers Contagious skin diseases Club feet, splay feet, flat feet However, "a national bureaucracy for managing conscription did not emerge until after the passage of the Selective Service Act of 1917 -- although even this relied on the contributions of approximately 4,000 local draft boards, which retained the prerogative of granting exemptions," said John Hall , professor of military history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."In 1940, as European and Asian war clouds darkened America's skies, the United States implemented 'peacetime' conscription for the first time -- but the world was already at war," he said."The real break from American tradition came in 1948 when the United States for the first time employed the draft as a routine element of defense manpower policy, whether or not the United States was at war."In 1942, the list of medical conditions that could have disqualified someone from military service, if found to be severe or detrimental, looked a little different.Among dozens of other conditions, it included: Brain tumors Epilepsy Sexual perversions Stammering to such a degree that the registrant is unable to express himself clearly or repeat commands Psychopathic personalities Chronic alcoholism and drug addiction Multiple sclerosis Cerebrospinal syphilis "When Richard Nixon took office in 1969, he realized that the draft was undermining rather than sustaining the war effort in Vietnam, so he initiated a transition to an exclusive reliance on volunteers, which culminated in 1973," Hall said."Partly because of the scarring experience of Vietnam, the United States is very unlikely to resort ever again to the draft."Modern standards of health Currently, each branch of the military -- from the Navy to the Air Force -- has its own medical or fitness assessment for applicants.JUST WATCHED America: Too Fat to Fight Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH America: Too Fat to Fight 02:47 "They do have guidelines on what is disqualifying and what is qualifying and, in some cases, what can be waived and what cannot be waived," said Jim Dower, who formerly worked in both Selective Service and the military.He retired in 1994 and now resides in Sarasota, Florida."You're psychologically screened, you're physically screened in the normal things you would take a physical for, and your history is taken," Dower said."If there's any questions, they go out and get consultations for whatever is required."By then, some of the dozens of medical conditions that could disqualify someone from serving in the US Army, if found to be severe or detrimental, included: Cleft lip defects Stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding Heel spur syndrome and hammertoe result in referral to a medical evaluation board Current or history of coronary heart disease Current absence of one or both testicles Plantar flexion of the foot must meet 30 degrees Women below 58 inches or over 80 inches tall do not meet standards Men below 60 inches or over 80 inches tall do not meet standards "Although there has not been a draft in over 40 years, men 18 [years old] are still required to register with the Selective Service System .It's a law and civic duty," said Matthew Tittmann, a spokesman for the agency.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."At 26, they become too old to register, but failure to register can carry lifelong consequences, and non-registrants risk being disqualified from access to federal college loans and grants, job training programs, all federal jobs and many state and municipal jobs," he added."All documented and undocumented immigrants must register, as well.Otherwise they risk losing the aforementioned benefits and could delay their citizenship process."
Drug company founder charged with pushing powerful opioid:::::U.S. prosecutors leveled charges Thursday against the billionaire founder of an opioid medication maker that has faced increasing scrutiny from authorities across the country over allegations of pushing prescriptions of powerful painkillers amid a drug epidemic that is claiming thousands of lives each year.The fraud and racketeering case against Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor came the same day President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency.The case naming Kapoor follows indictments against the company's former CEO and other executives and managers on allegations that they provided kickbacks to doctors to prescribe a potent opioid called Subsys.In the new indictment, Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, and the other defendants are accused of offering bribes to doctors to write large numbers of prescriptions for the fentanyl-based pain medication that is meant only for cancer patients with severe pain.Most of the people who received prescriptions did not have cancer.It also alleges that they conspired to mislead and defraud insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for patients without cancer.U.S. prosecutors in Boston brought the case as they vowed to go after problem opioid makers similar to how they target "cartels or a street-level drug dealer.""In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions, Mr. Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit," said Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb in Boston.A judge set bail at $1 million for Kapoor, saying he must wear electronic monitoring and surrender his passports.Kapoor, who was arrested earlier Thursday, entered court in basketball shorts, tennis shoes and a T-shirt, his long, gray hair disheveled."He is not guilty of these charges, he intends to fight it vigorously," defense attorney Brian T. Kelly said outside court.Kelly is a high-profile Boston lawyer and former federal prosecutor who successfully tried imprisoned gangster James "Whitey" Bugler.Kapoor came to the U.S. from India to get his Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry from the University of Buffalo, where the pharmacy school is named for him and his wife to honor their longtime philanthropy.Kapoor, whose worth Forbes estimated at $1.75 billion, also founded a company that operates seven restaurants including the Japanese eatery Roka Aker in Scottsdale.In Massachusetts, former Insys CEO Michael L. Babich and five other former executives and managers are set to go to trial in October 2018 and have pleaded not guilty.The latest indictment brings new charges against Babich and others.Several former Insys employees and health care providers have pleaded guilty to felony charges around the country, including in Alabama and Connecticut.A Rhode Island doctor pleaded guilty Wednesday to accepting kickbacks in return for prescribing the highly addictive fentanyl spray.A spokesman for Arizona-based Insys said this week that the company is under new management and has replaced nearly all its original sales staff.It says it takes responsibility for the actions of its former employees."We have taken necessary and appropriate steps to prevent past mistakes from happening in the future, and are committed to conducting business according to high ethical standards and the interests of patients," the company said in a statement Wednesday."We also continue to work with relevant authorities to resolve issues related to the misdeeds of former employees."Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said evidence from a congressional probe she launched this year suggested that Insys had "gotten away with fines that amounted to a slap on the wrist for actions that helped fuel a nationwide epidemic that's claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives."Kapoor was named the drugmaker's president and CEO in November 2015 after Babich resigned without explanation.Federal authorities apparently have been investigating the company for some time.In late 2013, Insys said it received a subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services asking for documents tied to the commercialization of Subsys.Nearly a year later, it received a subpoena from U.S. prosecutors in Boston for documents connected with sales and marketing practices for the drug.In addition to the criminal charges, states have been suing Insys over its marketing practices.Meanwhile, the company has been active in politics, donating $500,000 last year to an Arizona campaign to defeat a ballot measure to legalize marijuana.The company's stock price has taken a big tumble in recent months amid the legal issues.Insys stock plunged more than 20 percent Thursday.Associated Press writers Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix and Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey contributed to this report.
Facebook fitness group helps members lose collective 4,000 pounds:::::A private Facebook group has helped its members lose a collective 4,000 pounds by offering tips, encouragement and community for men hoping to shed excess weight when they don't know where to start.Joshua LaJaunie, a self-described country boy from Louisiana, said he founded the "Missing Chins Run Club," on Facebook to give "beer-drinking, back-slapping men an avenue to health and happiness."LaJaunie said he decided to turn his life around after he weighed in at 420 pounds, and he started by just walking on a treadmill.Eventually, he started running, and has since lost 230 pounds.Joshua LaJaunie "Compared to where I was, I'm an Olympian," LaJaunie told ABC News.The private group, which now has more than 80 members who have lost over 4,000 pounds collectively, gives men a platform to share their weight loss journeys and cheer each other on."I didnt realize it was going to be so big in the beginning but I really had aspirations that we would be able to reach out," Lajaunie said today on "Good Morning America.""I had been inspired throughout my journey and I felt it important to pay it forward to the universe and to do that for other guys."He added, "To see what has come of it is just amazing."Jason Cohen, 33, of Lafayette, Louisiana, lost 125 pounds through the support he found in the Facebook group.Jason Cohen "Whenever I dont feel like getting up in the morning or running, I see somebody else post they ran four miles, Ive to go run six," Cohen said."If theyve run six, Ive got to run eight.""It keeps me motivated to get up every day, lace up my shoes and just get out there."Marcus Cook, 45, of Houston, lost 280 pounds and completed an Ironman, a long-distance triathlon.Marcus Cook "Two years ago, I was 500 pounds," Cook said."I started walking 20 minutes a day and six months ago, I did a full Ironman."Justin Lacy, of Missouri, lost close to 300 pounds.Justin Lacy He said he was inspired to lose weight after his mom suffered a stroke, and now he is the inspiration for his family."Theyre so proud of me and theyre eating plant-based too and getting healthy too and losing weight and getting off medications," Lacy said."Its a beautiful thing."Tim Kaufman, 44, of Alden, New York, lost nearly 200 pounds through the "Missing Chins Run Club."Tim Kaufman "It just keeps everybody motivated in so many different ways," Kaufman said."I think that I can speak for all of us: its not just about what weve lost, its what weve gained."Josh Turner, 39, of Thibodaux, Louisiana, said the nearly 100 pounds he lost is more than just a number.Josh Turner "It was never really about the weight, it was more about getting my Type 1 diabetes under control," he said."Thats all it is."The 'Missing Chins Run Club' founder's top-3 weight loss tips: 1.Understand the concept of "calorie density" in food "If you're looking to lose weight and you're trying to get started, it would really serve you well to understand ... the subject of 'calorie density,'" LaJaunie told ABC News of his top tip for weight loss.LaJaunie described calorie density as understanding that the same volume of two different types of food can have a vastly different number of calories.He cited the example of eating a bowl full of green leafy vegetables versus filling the same sized bowl with fried chicken, saying the latter may contain "about three or four times the amount of calories, in that same volume of food.""Understand how to still eat big meals, and enjoy yourself and be full, but at the same time you won't be overconsuming, and your body wont need to store excess calories or body fat," LaJaunie said.2.Start moving, any way you know how LaJaunie's second tip is to just go outside and get moving, even if it is just walking at first."There is no need to join a gym," LaJaunie said."You can just go outside, and lace up, and move yourself with your legs.You dont have to run but ... move your body.""Do it with some purpose and do it on purpose," he added."What were doing, more so than anything, is building muscle memory, and habits."3.Find a community Finally, LaJaunie emphasized the importance of support from others when you first embark on your weight loss journey."Go public with your goals, try to find a group to get with on social media, really build some community around these new habits," LaJaunie said."Think about how important your community is to your identity," he added, saying social media is a great place to find others who can hold you accountable and encourage you to reach or maintain your health goals.
Trump declares US opioid emergency but pledges no new money:::::In ringing and personal terms, President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged that "we will overcome addiction in America," declaring opioid abuse a national public health emergency and announcing new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.Trump's declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas.But it won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 people a day."As Americans we cannot allow this to continue," Trump said in a speech at the White House, where he bemoaned an epidemic he said had spared no segment of society, affecting rural areas and cities, rich and poor and both the elderly and newborns."It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction," he said."We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic."Deaths have surged from opioids, which include some prescribed painkillers, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, often sold on the nation's streets.Administration officials said they also would urge Congress, during end-of-the year budget negotiations, to add new cash to a public health emergency fund that Congress hasn't replenished for years and contains just $57,000.But critics said Thursday's words weren't enough."How can you say it's an emergency if we're not going to put a new nickel in it?"said Dr. Joseph Parks, medical director of the nonprofit National Council for Behavioral Health, which advocates for addiction treatment providers."As far as moving the money around," he added, "that's like robbing Peter to pay Paul."Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said, "Show me the money."Trump's audience Thursday included parents who have lost children to drug overdoses, people who have struggled with addiction, first responders and lawmakers.Trump also spoke personally about his own family's experience with addiction: His older brother, Fred Jr., died after struggling with alcoholism.It's the reason the president does not drink.Trump described his brother as a "great guy, best looking guy," with a personality "much better than mine.""But he had a problem, he had a problem with alcohol," the president said."I learned because of Fred."Trump said he hoped a massive advertising campaign, which sounded reminiscent of the 1980s "Just Say No" campaign, might have a similar impact."If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it's really, really easy not to take 'em," he said.It's a path taken by previous presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.Bush, all of whom tried to rally the nation to confront drug abuse but fell short of solving the problem.Some people have become hooked on opioids after being prescribed prescription pain killers by doctors after injuries or surgery.As a presidential candidate, Trump had pledged to make fighting addiction a priority.Once in office, Trump assembled a commission, led by Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study the problem.The commission's interim report argued an emergency declaration would free additional money and resources, but some in Trump's administration disagreed."What the president did today was historic and it is an extraordinary beginning set of steps to dealing with this problem," Christie told reporters at the White House after the speech.Some also faulted the White House for not issuing a wider emergency declaration to deal with the crisis.Rob Brandt, an Ohio man who lost his 20-year-old son to a heroin overdose in 2011, called Trump's public health emergency order a "good incremental step" but urged greater focus on prevention and long-term treatment."The federal government has lagged behind in truly decisive action," said Brandt, who opened an opioid recovery center in Medina, Ohio this year, run on private donations and grants."We lost 64,000 Americans last year," he said, "and if you look at, if we were to have a foreign country attack us and kill 60,000 Americans or a terrorist attack that killed 60,000 Americans, we would print money to combat that."As a result of Trump's declaration, officials will be able to expand access to telemedicine services, including substance abuse treatment for people living in rural and remote areas.Officials will also be able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure Department of Labor grants for the unemployed, and shift funding for HIV and AIDs programs to provide more substance abuse treatment for people already eligible for those programs.Trump said his administration would also be working to reduce regulatory barriers, such as one that bars Medicaid from paying for addiction treatment in residential rehab facilities larger than 16 beds.He spoke of ongoing efforts to require opioid prescribers to undergo special training, the Justice Department's targeting of opioid dealers and efforts to develop a non-addictive painkiller.Trump said one specific prescription opioid, which he described as "truly evil," would be withdrawn immediately from the market.White House spokesman Hogan Gildey later said he was referring to the painkiller Opana ER.That drug was pulled from the market in July at the Food and Drug Administration's request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Trump's effort falls far short of what is needed and will divert staff and resources from other vital public health initiatives."Families in Connecticut suffering from the opioid epidemic deserve better than half measures and empty rhetoric offered seemingly as an afterthought," he said in a statement.He argued, "An emergency of this magnitude must be met with sustained, robust funding and comprehensive treatment programs."Democrats also criticized Trump's efforts to repeal and replace the "Obamacare" health law.Its Medicaid expansion has been crucial in confronting the opioid epidemic.Adopted by 31 states, the Medicaid expansion provides coverage to low-income adults previously not eligible.Many are in their 20s and 30s, a demographic hit hard by the epidemic.Medicaid pays for detox and long-term treatment.Trump, meanwhile, tempered expectations even as he projected hope."Our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better.But get better it will," he said."It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency."Working together," he said, "we will defeat this opioid epidemic.... We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse.And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America."AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson reported from Chicago.Associated Press writers Dake Kang in Cleveland and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Lauran Neergaard and Catherine Lucey In Washington contributed to this report.This story has been corrected to delete 4th paragraph quote, which was from Melania Trump, not the president.
The Latest: HHS follows Trump in declaring health emergency:::::The Latest on President Donald Trump and his speech on the opioid crisis (all times local): 4:20 p.m.The acting health and human services secretary has officially declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency, as requested by President Donald Trump.Eric D. Hargan says in a statement that Trump "has made this national crisis a top priority since he took office in January."And: "we are proud to be leading in this effort at HHS."The declaration does not provide any additional money to fight the opioid epidemic, but it does allow agencies to redirect resources.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 140 Americans die every day from drug overdoses including 91 specifically from opioids.3:20 p.m. President Donald Trump recalled his brother's struggles with alcohol as he announced new efforts to combat opioid addiction.Speaking at the White House Thursday, Trump said his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., was a "great guy," but that "he had a problem with alcohol."Trump said: "He would constantly tell me, 'Don't drink.'"As a result, Trump says, he has never had a drink of alcohol or smoked a cigarette.Trump has spoken before about his brother, an alcoholic who died at 42.He said Thursday that he "had a very, very tough life because of alcohol."3:05 p.m. President Donald Trump is vowing that the nation's opioid crisis "will be defeated" as he winds up his speech on drug addiction.Trump was surrounded by people touched by addiction when he signed an order to make the problem a national public health emergency.The president allows that the problem may "get worse before it gets better" but is vowing that it will ultimately get better.Trump adds: "We will win, right?"Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999.3 p.m. President Donald Trump is outlining "aggressive steps" to address the nation's addiction to opioids.Trump says it's the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.Speaking in the East Room of the White House, the president says he is directing federal agencies to do everything in their power to combat the crisis.Trump says that includes a "massive advertising campaign" reaching out to young people to avoid prescription drugs.Trump also says his administration will soon provide "relief" for state governments looking to access Medicaid funding for drug treatment centers with more than 16 beds.Trump is also promising more research funding for opioid alternatives.He says the administration will be "spending lots of money coming up with a nonaddictive solution."2:40 p.m. President Donald Trump is declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency, and says it's sparing "no part" of the United States.Trump has made that announcement at the White House and he says the scourge affects rural areas and cities, rich people and the poor, and the elderly and newborns.Trump says it all amounts to "a national health emergency" that's ripping "the nation apart."The president had campaigned on an effort to combat the crisis and has

some advocates worry even that won't make enough difference.
Premiums rising 34 percent for most popular health plan:::::Premiums for the most popular "Obamacare" plans are going up an average of 34 percent, according to a study Wednesday that confirms dire predictions about the impact of political turmoil on consumers.Window-shopping on HealthCare.gov went live Wednesday, so across the country consumers going online can see the consequences themselves ahead of the Nov. 1 start of sign-up season for 2018.The consulting firm Avalere Health crunched newly released government data and found that the Trump administration's actions are contributing to the price hikes by adding instability to the underlying problems of the health law's marketplaces.President Donald Trump puts the blame squarely on "Obamacare" saying the program is imploding, while ignoring warnings that his administration's actions could make things worse.The Avalere analysis is for the 39 states using HealthCare.gov.Along with the increase for silver plans, premiums also are going up by double digits for different levels of coverage, including bronze (18 percent), gold (16 percent), and platinum (24 percent).Many states had higher increases.Avalere found that average plan silver premiums will go up by 49 percent in Florida, 43 percent in Missouri, and 65 percent in Wyoming.Consumers eligible for income-based tax credits will be protected from rising premiums but those who pay full-cost face a second consecutive year of sharp premium increases.Only three states will see declines Alaska, Arizona, and North Dakota.Avalere said market instability is driven by Trump's recent decision to end subsidy payments to insurers, the continued debate over "Obamacare" repeal and replace, and a presidential executive order that could open a path for lower cost plans outside of the Obama-era law."You put all that together, and there are a lot of additional forces on top of market forces driving high premium increases for 2018," said Chris Sloan, a senior manager with the health industry consulting firm.Significant increases also are expected in states that run their own health insurance websites.Starting Nov. 1, new customers can submit applications, and returning ones can make changes to their coverage.Open enrollment will end early, on Dec. 15, about half the time allotted under Barack Obama's administration.Sign-up season comes after the president abruptly pulled the plug on federal payments that reimburse insurers for reduced copays and deductibles they're required to provide to people of modest means.That exposes insurers to a potential $1 billion loss for the remainder of this year.A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday denied a request by state attorney's general to order the payments immediately restored.Administration officials say the payments were not properly approved by Congress and Trump is following the U.S. Constitution by denying them.Bipartisan legislation to resolve the problem is pending, and the Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday said the bill would reduce federal deficits and have no major impact on coverage.But the legislation by Sens.Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. faces an uncertain future.Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he would support it.Restoring the funds may have little immediate impact on 2018 premiums, but the bill calls for insurers to rebate money to the government and consumers if they collect too much.Avalere's Sloan said that consumers who receive subsidized premiums would generally be protected from premium increases.That's not the case, however, for an estimated 7 million unsubsidized customers, most of whom buy individual plans outside the government markets."There is a danger that middle-class people who don't get government help in paying their premiums could be increasingly priced out of the market," said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.About 10 million people currently have private health insurance through government-sponsored markets like HealthCare.gov.More than 8 in 10 customers receive tax credits to help pay their premiums, and that aid is still available despite the political turmoil.Unlike the Obama years, the Trump administration has set no enrollment goal for 2018."We are really focused on having a smooth consumer experience," said Randy Pate, director of the HHS office that oversees the program."That is our target for this year."Administration officials say they have made a series of improvements to the sign-up process unheeded in the acrimonious political debate over health care.Online - https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/
Man convicted of poisoning wife: Her liver proves otherwise:::::A former University of Pittsburgh medical researcher deserves a new trial in the death of his wife because her donated liver suggests she wasn't poisoned with cyanide as prosecutors contend, his attorney argued Wednesday.Robert Ferrante's attorney asked a three-judge Superior Court panel to grant a new trial in the April 2013 death of Dr.Autumn Klein or, at least, allow for an evidentiary hearing at which the liver recipient could testify."In these four years, I am still feeling great," the unnamed recipient of Klein's liver wrote in a letter quoted by attorney Chris Rand Eyster in an appeal filing before Wednesday's arguments in Pittsburgh.Eyster argued Klein's liver would have been irreparably damaged and unable to be donated had she been poisoned.The 69-year-old researcher's appeal centers on attacking post-mortem tests done by Quest Diagnostics that found toxic levels of cyanide in the 41-year-old physician's blood after an autopsy failed to detect the poison.Ferrante is serving life in prison without parole after being convicted of first-degree murder in November 2014.Allegheny County prosecutors contend Ferrante killed Klein by putting cyanide in her energy drink, which text messages show he urged her to drink to enhance her fertility.Klein collapsed and fell suddenly ill on April 17, 2013, when she could be heard gasping for air in the background as Ferrante called 911 for an ambulance.She died three days later.Eyster contends the prosecutor's office didn't reveal before trial that a Quest subsidiary, the Nichols Institute, paid a $40 million fine for a 2009 federal misbranding conviction and $241 million more to settle related litigation.In that case, federal prosecutors contend Quest/Nichols sold to various laboratories misbranded tests that were unreliable in measuring parathyroid hormone levels in patients.Allegheny County prosecutors contend the sanctions are irrelevant, but Eyster contends they could have been used to try to convince the jury the Quest blood test results were unreliable.Ferrante and his trial attorneys argued Klein suffered cardiac arrhythmia or some kind of brain abnormality relating to headaches and fainting spells she had experienced in the previous months.Ferrante acknowledged ordering cyanide in the weeks before Klein's death but said that was related to his well-known research into Lou Gehrig's disease.The poison was used to mimic the disease's symptoms in lab animals, Ferrante said.The appellate panel isn't expected to rule for months.Quest Diagnostics Inc. has said it conducts its business with the highest standards of quality and integrity.It said in 2009 the settlement resolved the government investigation and "puts it behind us."
Walgreens to offer drug naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses:::::In more than 8,000 pharmacies across the U.S., anyone will now be able to walk in and buy the most successful emergency overdose treatment available.Interested in Opioid Epidemic?Add Opioid Epidemic as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Opioid Epidemic news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The Walgreens chain will carry a form of naloxone, a drug that can quickly reverse opioid overdoses, the company announced Tuesday.Known commercially as Narcan, the drug is administered through a nasal spray and is an FDA-approved form of naxolone.Drew Angerer/Getty Images This is an incredibly safe and effective medication, ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton said today on Good Morning America.Weve been using it in the hospital for decades, usually with a needle, intravenous or in a muscle.Narcan works to counteract respiratory depression, in which a large dose of opioid stops the bodys signals to continue breathing.Overdoses from prescription painkillers, heroin and its derivatives cause this frequent cause of overdose death.AmerisourceBergen, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, has distributed Narcan demonstration devices for free to Walgreens pharmacists so they can instruct patients on how to administer the medication, Walgreens said in a statement.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The drug will be available to patients and caregivers without a prescription in 45 states.Walgreens said it is "eager and willing" to work with more states to make naloxone easier to obtain.As a pharmacy we are committed to making Narcan more accessible in the communities we serve, the statement added.Ashton spoke about the risks and benefits of making Narcan so widely available.I think the risk here," she said, "is that people could say, Will this give people a false sense of security and have them use opioids more if they know that they can use this immediate antidote?But the benefits of making Narcan available on a wider basis, Ashton said, are incredibly important.This drug saves lives," she said."Think of this maybe as defibrillator, EpiPen, another piece of lifesaving medical equipment that probably is going to be pretty widespread now.The announcement that Walgreens will carry naloxone comes as experts agree the opioid epidemic has become a critical emergency on a national scale.Tom Kelley/Getty Images In Connecticut, the Milford School District is making Narcan available in all of its 14 public schools, including eight elementary schools, a district spokeswoman told ABC News.President Donald Trump has called the opioid crisis a "national emergency" and said he will officially declare it as such.Two months after his inauguration, he signed an Executive Order launching a commission to explore ways to curb opioid abuse and overdoses, led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie.The number of overdose deaths involving opioids has quadrupled since 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).The agency reported that 91 Americans die every day from an opioid overdoses.Ashton said the move by Walgreens shows the U.S. is in a "critical and unstable condition" battling the opioid crisis."We have to tackle this at the prescriber level, at the dispensing level and at the user level, and thats what this is," she said.
AP Exclusive: Doctors clash over euthanasia for mentally ill:::::After struggling with mental illness for years, Cornelia Geerts was so desperate to die that she asked her psychiatrist to kill her.Her sister worried that Geerts' judgment was compromised.The 59-year-old was taking more than 20 pills a day, including antidepressants, an opioid, a tranquilizer, and two medicines often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.But about a year later, on October 7, 2014, Geerts received a lethal dose of drugs from her doctor."I know it was Cornelia's wish, but I said to the psychiatrist that it was a shame that someone in treatment for years could just be brought to the other side with a simple injection," said her sister, Adriana Geerts, who believes society should try harder to accommodate the mentally ill. Cases like Geerts' reveal how difficult it can be to navigate the boundary between individual freedom and protecting vulnerable patients when it comes to euthanasia.According to confidential documents obtained by the Associated Press, such cases have fueled a clash between leading euthanasia practitioners that suggests doctors may have failed to meet certain legal requirements in some euthanasia cases although there is no implication that patients were killed improperly.Aside from Belgium, euthanasia is also legal in Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Only Belgium and the Netherlands allow it for people with mental illness.In most cases, euthanasia is performed on people with a fatal illness like cancer who have only weeks to live.Euthanasia is not permitted in the U.S., but six states and Washington D.C. allow assisted suicide, where doctors provide people with a deadly dose of medication.People must be terminally ill and the procedure is forbidden for psychological suffering."I always regret that we couldn't do something else," said Dr. Lieve Thienpont, one of the psychiatrists who signed off on Geerts' death."At the same time, I'm part of the relief for the patient."Like many in Belgium, Thienpont believes that when modern medicine can't relieve pain, euthanasia when doctors actively kill patients should be an option.But Thienpont appears more inclined than most to approve euthanasia, some colleagues say.According to figures that she has published, some doctors believe Thienpont and colleagues at her clinic may have been responsible for up to 40 percent of euthanasia deaths among psychiatric patients in Belgium from 2007 to 2011.Of the approximately 2,000 euthanasia deaths every year, about 40 are psychiatric patients.The way she manages her euthanasia requests led to a rift earlier this year with Dr. Wim Distelmans, chairman of Belgium's euthanasia review commission.Internal correspondence provided to the AP show Distelmans and his fellow practitioners said they were being used as a rubber stamp to approve patients referred by Thienpont.Belgium requires that people seeking euthanasia for psychiatric reasons get an independent consultation from at least two other doctors.The doctors don't have to agree; the law only says that the objective assessments must be sought."We found several times that you had already made promises to patients that were referred to us," Distelmans and colleagues wrote, complaining that such "promises" undermined their own attempts to engage with patients and determine if euthanasia was justifiable."We want to distance ourselves from this way of working," Distelmans wrote, adding they would no longer accept patients from Thienpont.Thienpont said the letter raised problems only about how patients were referred, not how she and colleagues were practicing euthanasia.She also blamed the patients for not describing events accurately."These patients are very desperate, stressed," she said."They say things that are not always correct."Some experts said the split between Thienpont and Distelmans raises alarms about euthanasia in Belgium, especially since the dispute has not been publicly disclosed by the commission overseeing it."That suggests some cases of euthanasia have proceeded that have not met the statutory, legal requirements," said Penney Lewis, co-director of the Centre of Medical Law and Ethics at King's College London."The idea that this is happening behind closed doors is very worrying."Distelmans did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.Mental health experts say balancing the finality of euthanasia with the transient nature of many psychiatric illnesses is extraordinarily difficult."I'm convinced that in Belgium, people have died where there were still treatment options and where there was still a chance for years and even decades of (quality) life," said Dr. Joris Vandenberghe, a psychiatrist at the University of Leuven, who is working on new euthanasia guidance for the Flemish Psychiatric Association.Some patients, though, say that euthanasia can save lives.Amy De Schutter, who endured years of failed treatment at psychiatric institutions, spent months deliberating the best way to kill herself.She had already picked the day of her suicide, but one month before her intended death last year, she was approved for euthanasia."It felt like 10,000 kilos was just (lifted)," De Schutter said.Being cleared to legally die at home was comforting enough that De Schutter didn't set an immediate date for euthanasia.But for some bereaved relatives, the loss of their loved one is compounded by a belief that doctors should have focused on keeping patients alive."I think if the doctors had tried to help (my sister) more or proposed other things, she might have felt there was another solution," said Adriana Geerts, who accompanied her sister to the euthanasia clinic despite her own misgivings."I wish there had been another way," Geerts said.

Class action lawsuits could take aim at diet soda makers Video:::::Transcript for Class action lawsuits could take aim at diet soda makers Now to major lawsuits targeting three of the biggest diet soda brands accusing them of misleading marketing and saying that artificial sweeteners they used may cause weight gain.Paula Faris is here with the story.Good morning, Paula.Reporter: Good morning, Michael.These lawsuits which are filed just last week center on the use of aspartame and its controversial nature citing a recent report that shows a link between artificial sweeteners and type 2 diabetes and heart disease.This morning diet soda is under fire.Coca coal lay, Pepsi and Dr. Pepper, the three largest U.S. Makers of carb natured beverages are facing proposed class action lawsuits alleging the marketing of their sodas are false, M misleading and deceiving shoppers into thinking the beverages will help them manage or lose weight.Products marketed as diet products should be helpful in helping people lose weight and these products are not helpful in losing weight.They may, in fact, do the opposite.Reporter: The suits also claim aspartame, the artificial sweetener used in the sodas is likely to cause weight gain rather than to help in weight loss or healthy weight management.There's no question this is deend accept tiff advertising.Reporter: Although the studies don't show conclusively aspartame directly cautions weight gain several do show a correlation between diet soda consumption and obesity, the calorie control council whose members include manufacturers of artificial sweeters like aspartame and diet sodas say reduced-calorie products are an important tool in helping consumers improve their diet and lose weight.The lawsuits are interesting.Aren't seeking any specific dollar amount but want the jury and for these beverages to stop being marketed as diet.The American beverage association reps the three calls these meritless.Thank you, Paula.We'll be joined by Dr. Jennifer Ashton and, doc, you're board certified in obesity medicine.What is the science behind this claim?Do they have a case.Obesity is a complex disorder.Multiple factors go into it, genetic, behavior, what are you drinking, eeling, some medications and environment.While drinking a zero calorie beverage has some benefits there is no clear date that that aspartame directly leads to weight loss.Now, regardless if they are healthy or not, they are sugar-free.Right.The pros outweigh the cons?That's a complex question, right?There is extensive data linking them to obesity, cardiovascular disease.You have to weigh the risks versus the benefits versus alternatives and when you talk about them, you need to remember our bodies are 60% water.Not 60% sweetened beverage.Good point.Got to watch what you put into your body.That was the story behind the story.As we -- as I said you don't order the large fries and the large -- the Big Mac, large fries and a diet soda.Doesn't work that way.We move to a frightening This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Study sheds light on youth football head hits Video:::::Transcript for Study sheds light on youth football head hits alert now.It's actually a very troubling new report on youth football and details the force of those hits which players -- which players are most at risk.The game may be pee-wee, but the hits can be major.And this morning, a new study released overnight is warning just how dangerously hard those impacts can be in youth football.When this study focuses on is where that exposure to head impact occurs.Reporter: Researchers at Virginia tech followed 45 youth football players ages 9 to 12 attaching sensors though their helmets to measure how much force is hitting them.Hits considered high magnitude are ones that strike with 40 times the force of gravity or more.Researchers found that of the more than 7,500 hits youth players in the study experienced, 8% of them were high magnitude and found that those most dangerous hits were most likely experienced by players in positions like quarterback, running back and linebacker and that players also experienced greater high magnitude head impacts while playing in an actual game as opposed to practices.Understanding head impact exposures is an important part in reducing the incidence of concussion so if we identify high-risk situation we can make recommendations that maybe that shouldn't be part of youth football.Reporter: 44 million kids play youth sports in the U.S. With concussions for those under 18 hitting as high as 1.9 million.Then senior quarterback Brett Kramer falling victim to that staggering statistic.My head was ringing.Reporter: Researchers say they hope the study brings a better understanding of what causes concussions in kids to help prevent injury and to eliminate certain drills and plays that increase risk to young players.Well, there's still a lot to learn.This study was small.We only looked at two teams and every team is different so you need a study youth football across the U.S. To understand where these impacts are coming from.Reporter: Again, just to give everyone an example, in that report we talked about helmet sensors measuring a hit at 40g or 40 types the force of graph T the author said in the study that force of impact is equal to the hardest amount of force someone can take from a car crash and still be able to walk away without any physical injuries but it's so alarming and as you heard more studies need to happen.Whoo.Got to be careful.Okay.Amy, thanks very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Drug company founder charged with pushing powerful opioid:::::U.S. prosecutors leveled charges Thursday against the billionaire founder of an opioid medication maker that has faced increasing scrutiny from authorities across the country over allegations of pushing prescriptions of powerful painkillers amid a drug epidemic that is claiming thousands of lives each year.The fraud and racketeering case against Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor came the same day President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency.The case naming Kapoor follows indictments against the company's former CEO and other executives and managers on allegations that they provided kickbacks to doctors to prescribe a potent opioid called Subsys.In the new indictment, Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, and the other defendants are accused of offering bribes to doctors to write large numbers of prescriptions for the fentanyl-based pain medication that is meant only for cancer patients with severe pain.Most of the people who received prescriptions did not have cancer.It also alleges that they conspired to mislead and defraud insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for patients without cancer.U.S. prosecutors in Boston brought the case as they vowed to go after problem opioid makers similar to how they target "cartels or a street-level drug dealer.""In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions, Mr. Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit," said Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb in Boston.A judge set bail at $1 million for Kapoor, saying he must wear electronic monitoring and surrender his passports.Kapoor, who was arrested earlier Thursday, entered court in basketball shorts, tennis shoes and a T-shirt, his long, gray hair disheveled."He is not guilty of these charges, he intends to fight it vigorously," defense attorney Brian T. Kelly said outside court.Kelly is a high-profile Boston lawyer and former federal prosecutor who successfully tried imprisoned gangster James "Whitey" Bugler.Kapoor came to the U.S. from India to get his Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry from the University of Buffalo, where the pharmacy school is named for him and his wife to honor their longtime philanthropy.Kapoor, whose worth Forbes estimated at $1.75 billion, also founded a company that operates seven restaurants including the Japanese eatery Roka Aker in Scottsdale.In Massachusetts, former Insys CEO Michael L. Babich and five other former executives and managers are set to go to trial in October 2018 and have pleaded not guilty.The latest indictment brings new charges against Babich and others.Several former Insys employees and health care providers have pleaded guilty to felony charges around the country, including in Alabama and Connecticut.A Rhode Island doctor pleaded guilty Wednesday to accepting kickbacks in return for prescribing the highly addictive fentanyl spray.A spokesman for Arizona-based Insys said this week that the company is under new management and has replaced nearly all its original sales staff.It says it takes responsibility for the actions of its former employees."We have taken necessary and appropriate steps to prevent past mistakes from happening in the future, and are committed to conducting business according to high ethical standards and the interests of patients," the company said in a statement Wednesday."We also continue to work with relevant authorities to resolve issues related to the misdeeds of former employees."Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said evidence from a congressional probe she launched this year suggested that Insys had "gotten away with fines that amounted to a slap on the wrist for actions that helped fuel a nationwide epidemic that's claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives."Kapoor was named the drugmaker's president and CEO in November 2015 after Babich resigned without explanation.Federal authorities apparently have been investigating the company for some time.In late 2013, Insys said it received a subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services asking for documents tied to the commercialization of Subsys.Nearly a year later, it received a subpoena from U.S. prosecutors in Boston for documents connected with sales and marketing practices for the drug.In addition to the criminal charges, states have been suing Insys over its marketing practices.Meanwhile, the company has been active in politics, donating $500,000 last year to an Arizona campaign to defeat a ballot measure to legalize marijuana.The company's stock price has taken a big tumble in recent months amid the legal issues.Insys stock plunged more than 20 percent Thursday.Associated Press writers Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix and Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey contributed to this report.
EPA: Michigan should boost water safety in Flint, statewide:::::Staff and funding shortages and poor data management are preventing Michigan environmental regulators from making sure that state residents have safe drinking water, federal officials said Thursday.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said deficiencies in Michigan's drinking water operations aren't limited to Flint, notorious for lead contamination of its system for 18 months starting in spring 2014.Investigations primarily blamed the state Department of Environmental Quality, which failed to require anti-corrosion pipeline treatments when the city changed its water source.In its newly released report, the EPA evaluated the statewide effectiveness of Michigan's safe drinking water program.The study was based largely on examination of the state environmental department's files from October 2013 through September 2015, when the Flint crisis was at its height.The review "revealed a number of significant challenges," the report said.Among them: too little money, too few people, and inadequate reporting and management of electronic data."Staff departures and retirements have caused a significant loss in expertise and technical knowledge ... which presents a threat to the future implementation of an effective program," the report said, adding that the department "must focus on obtaining long-term sources of funding."Water data management is "inefficient and antiquated," the report said, and efforts to fix the problem have been hampered by concentration of information technology staff into "a broad agency department without drinking water expertise.""Laboratory reporting is very inefficient," it said, urging the department to make better use of electronic data systems.The department also failed to require full compliance with its lead and copper pollution rule and sometimes did not report instances when lead content exceeded standards, the report said.State officials must make sure violation notices are issued and the public informed, it said.Tiffany Brown, spokeswoman for the Michigan department, said the audit raised issues that were two years old, many of which have been addressed.But the department "will use the recommendations indicated in the report to further improve the Drinking Water Program to better ensure the public's health and safety," Brown said.Michigan is among the states that have their own drinking water rules, which must be at least as stringent as the federal government's.EPA periodically assesses how well the states are performing.Agency officials visited the state department's Lansing office in April 2016.Their report was based on a review of documents for 25 of more than 10,000 regulated public water systems in Michigan, including Flint's.It echoed previous findings that the Flint crisis resulted partly from the state department's "failure to properly oversee and manage" the city's switch from the Detroit water system to the Flint River in April 2014.The river water was not treated to prevent corrosion, enabling lead to leach from old pipes and fixtures.The contamination caused elevated lead levels in children's blood and left residents to use filtered or bottled water for drinking and bathing.Water quality has greatly improved since the city resumed using Detroit water in 2015, experts said.Follow John Flesher on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/johnflesher
The Latest: HHS follows Trump in declaring health emergency:::::The Latest on President Donald Trump and his speech on the opioid crisis (all times local): 4:20 p.m.The acting health and human services secretary has officially declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency, as requested by President Donald Trump.Eric D. Hargan says in a statement that Trump "has made this national crisis a top priority since he took office in January."And: "we are proud to be leading in this effort at HHS."The declaration does not provide any additional money to fight the opioid epidemic, but it does allow agencies to redirect resources.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 140 Americans die every day from drug overdoses including 91 specifically from opioids.3:20 p.m. President Donald Trump recalled his brother's struggles with alcohol as he announced new efforts to combat opioid addiction.Speaking at the White House Thursday, Trump said his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., was a "great guy," but that "he had a problem with alcohol."Trump said: "He would constantly tell me, 'Don't drink.'"As a result, Trump says, he has never had a drink of alcohol or smoked a cigarette.Trump has spoken before about his brother, an alcoholic who died at 42.He said Thursday that he "had a very, very tough life because of alcohol."3:05 p.m. President Donald Trump is vowing that the nation's opioid crisis "will be defeated" as he winds up his speech on drug addiction.Trump was surrounded by people touched by addiction when he signed an order to make the problem a national public health emergency.The president allows that the problem may "get worse before it gets better" but is vowing that it will ultimately get better.Trump adds: "We will win, right?"Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999.3 p.m. President Donald Trump is outlining "aggressive steps" to address the nation's addiction to opioids.Trump says it's the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.Speaking in the East Room of the White House, the president says he is directing federal agencies to do everything in their power to combat the crisis.Trump says that includes a "massive advertising campaign" reaching out to young people to avoid prescription drugs.Trump also says his administration will soon provide "relief" for state governments looking to access Medicaid funding for drug treatment centers with more than 16 beds.Trump is also promising more research funding for opioid alternatives.He says the administration will be "spending lots of money coming up with a nonaddictive solution."2:40 p.m. President Donald Trump is declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency, and says it's sparing "no part" of the United States.Trump has made that announcement at the White House and he says the scourge affects rural areas and cities, rich people and the poor, and the elderly and newborns.Trump says it all amounts to "a national health emergency" that's ripping "the nation apart."The president had campaigned on an effort to combat the crisis and has taken criticism for being slow to act.2:30 p.m. Melania Trump says drug addiction "can happen to any of us."The first lady offered opening remarks Thursday before President Donald Trump gave a speech on opioid addiction.The president plans to declare the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency.Melania Trump said she has recently taken a "larger interest in what I can do to fight this epidemic."She said she has been participating in meetings and listening sessions.She acknowledged the audience, which included parents whose children died and people who have struggled with addiction.The first lady says: "We are here today because of your courage."1 p.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says her reaction to President Donald Trump's declaration of an opioids emergency is: "Show me the money."The California Democrat told reporters Thursday that Trump has proposed cuts in programs aimed at opioids abuse like Medicaid.She says everyone agrees Congress must pay attention to the problem, but adds that the president's statements are "words without the money."Trump was planning an afternoon speech to announce his action.White House officials said Trump's declaration wouldn't provide new funds but would do things like expand access some rural areas have to medical services.They say they will press lawmakers to use end-of-year budget negotiations to add money to a public health emergency fund.8:45 a.m. President Donald Trump will direct his Department of Health and Human Services to declare the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency under the Public Health Service Act.That's according to senior White House officials, who were not authorized to publicly discuss plans before the announcement and briefed journalists on condition of anonymity.The declaration does not come with specific funding.But officials say it will allow changes such as expended access to medical services in rural areas.Trump will deliver a speech Thursday on fighting the opioid crisis.He's said an emergency designation will give his administration the "power to do things that you can't do right now."Trump pledged during his campaign to make fighting addiction a top priority at rallies in some of the hardest-hit states in the 3:36 a.m. President Donald Trump is poised to deliver a major speech Thursday on fighting the opioid epidemic, which now kills tens of thousands of Americans every year.During his campaign, Trump had pledged to make fighting addiction a top priority at rallies in some of the hardest-hit states in the nation.Once in office, Trump convened a commission to study the problem, chaired by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie.And he has pledged to declare the crisis an emergency, freeing up additional money and resources.But some advocates worry even that won't make enough difference.
The Latest: Bail set at $1 million for drug company founder:::::The Latest on charges against the billionaire founder of an opioid medication maker (all times local): 5:10 p.m. A judge has set bail at $1 million for the billionaire founder of an opioid medication maker that has faced increasing scrutiny from authorities across the U.S. over allegations of pushing painkiller prescriptions.Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor was arrested earlier Thursday in Phoenix.Kapoor and other defendants in the fraud and racketeering case are accused of offering bribes to doctors to write large numbers of prescriptions for a fentanyl-based pain medication meant only for cancer patients with severe pain.Most people who received prescriptions did not have cancer.U.S. Magistrate Michelle Burns said Kapoor must wear electronic monitoring and surrender his passports if he posts bail.Defense attorney Brian T. Kelly said after the hearing that his client is not guilty and will fight the charges.10:10 a.m. U.S. authorities say the founder of an Arizona-based pharmaceutical company has been arrested and charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to bribe doctors to prescribe a powerful opioid pain medication.The U.S. Attorney's Office for Massachusetts said Wednesday that John Kapoor of Insys Therapeutics Inc. and former executives and managers are charged with racketeering and other crimes in a new indictment.Amid a national opioid addiction crisis, Kapoor of Phoenix and the other defendants are accused of offering kickbacks to doctors to write large numbers of prescriptions for a fentanyl-based pain medication that's meant for cancer patients.Most of those who received the prescriptions weren't cancer patients.Kapoor is to appear Thursday in federal court in Phoenix.Online court records don't list an attorney for him.The indictment adds new allegations to an ongoing case.The former executives and managers have pleaded not guilty.
Trump declares US opioid emergency but pledges no new money:::::In ringing and personal terms, President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged that "we will overcome addiction in America," declaring opioid abuse a national public health emergency and announcing new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.Trump's declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas.But it won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 people a day."As Americans we cannot allow this to continue," Trump said in a speech at the White House, where he bemoaned an epidemic he said had spared no segment of society, affecting rural areas and cities, rich and poor and both the elderly and newborns."It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction," he said."We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic."Deaths have surged from opioids, which include some prescribed painkillers, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, often sold on the nation's streets.Administration officials said they also would urge Congress, during end-of-the year budget negotiations, to add new cash to a public health emergency fund that Congress hasn't replenished for years and contains just $57,000.But critics said Thursday's words weren't enough."How can you say it's an emergency if we're not going to put a new nickel in it?"said Dr. Joseph Parks, medical director of the nonprofit National Council for Behavioral Health, which advocates for addiction treatment providers."As far as moving the money around," he added, "that's like robbing Peter to pay Paul."Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said, "Show me the money."Trump's audience Thursday included parents who have lost children to drug overdoses, people who have struggled with addiction, first responders and lawmakers.Trump also spoke personally about his own family's experience with addiction: His older brother, Fred Jr., died after struggling with alcoholism.It's the reason the president does not drink.Trump described his brother as a "great guy, best looking guy," with a personality "much better than mine.""But he had a problem, he had a problem with alcohol," the president said."I learned because of Fred."Trump said he hoped a massive advertising campaign, which sounded reminiscent of the 1980s "Just Say No" campaign, might have a similar impact."If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it's really, really easy not to take 'em," he said.It's a path taken by previous presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.Bush, all of whom tried to rally the nation to confront drug abuse but fell short of solving the problem.Some people have become hooked on opioids after being prescribed prescription pain killers by doctors after injuries or surgery.As a presidential candidate, Trump had pledged to make fighting addiction a priority.Once in office, Trump assembled a commission, led by Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study the problem.The commission's interim report argued an emergency declaration would free additional money and resources, but some in Trump's administration disagreed."What the president did today was historic and it is an extraordinary beginning set of steps to dealing with this problem," Christie told reporters at the White House after the speech.Some also faulted the White House for not issuing a wider emergency declaration to deal with the crisis.Rob Brandt, an Ohio man who lost his 20-year-old son to a heroin overdose in 2011, called Trump's public health emergency order a "good incremental step" but urged greater focus on prevention and long-term treatment."The federal government has lagged behind in truly decisive action," said Brandt, who opened an opioid recovery center in Medina, Ohio this year, run on private donations and grants."We lost 64,000 Americans last year," he said, "and if you look at, if we were to have a foreign country attack us and kill 60,000 Americans or a terrorist attack that killed 60,000 Americans, we would print money to combat that."As a result of Trump's declaration, officials will be able to expand access to telemedicine services, including substance abuse treatment for people living in rural and remote areas.Officials will also be able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure Department of Labor grants for the unemployed, and shift funding for HIV and AIDs programs to provide more substance abuse treatment for people already eligible for those programs.Trump said his administration would also be working to reduce regulatory barriers, such as one that bars Medicaid from paying for addiction treatment in residential rehab facilities larger than 16 beds.He spoke of ongoing efforts to require opioid prescribers to undergo special training, the Justice Department's targeting of opioid dealers and efforts to develop a non-addictive painkiller.Trump said one specific prescription opioid, which he described as "truly evil," would be withdrawn immediately from the market.White House spokesman Hogan Gildey later said he was referring to the painkiller Opana ER.That drug was pulled from the market in July at the Food and Drug Administration's request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Trump's effort falls far short of what is needed and will divert staff and resources from other vital public health initiatives."Families in Connecticut suffering from the opioid epidemic deserve better than half measures and empty rhetoric offered seemingly as an afterthought," he said in a statement.He argued, "An emergency of this magnitude must be met with sustained, robust funding and comprehensive treatment programs."Democrats also criticized Trump's efforts to repeal and replace the "Obamacare" health law.Its Medicaid expansion has been crucial in confronting the opioid epidemic.Adopted by 31 states, the Medicaid expansion provides coverage to low-income adults previously not eligible.Many are in their 20s and 30s, a demographic hit hard by the epidemic.Medicaid pays for detox and long-term treatment.Trump, meanwhile, tempered expectations even as he projected hope."Our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better.But get better it will," he said."It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency."Working together," he said, "we will defeat this opioid epidemic.... We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse.And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America."AP Medical Writer Carla K.

NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now "get their act together".WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to 230 ($300).The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said."Before 12 May 2017, the Department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is ransomware?Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients.how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.His "kill switch" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' The NAO said the NHS "has accepted that there are lessons to learn" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.WannaCry was "a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice," said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO."There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."Keith McNeil, chief clinical information officer for health and care at NHS England, said emergency plans were activated quickly and staff "went the extra mile" to provide care.Image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts.When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS.Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem.And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.
Heart surgery survival chances 'better in the afternoon':::::Image copyright Getty Images Open heart surgery appears to be safer in the afternoon because of the body's internal clock, scientists have said.The body clock - or circadian rhythm - is the reason we want to sleep at night, but it also drives huge changes in the way our bodies work.The research, published in the Lancet, suggests the heart is stronger and better able to withstand surgery in the afternoon than the morning.And it says the difference is not down to surgeons being tired in the morning.Doctors need to stop the heart to perform operations including heart valve replacements.This puts the organ under stress as the flow of oxygen to the heart tissue is reduced.The doctors and researchers looked for complications including heart attacks, heart failure or death after surgery.They found: 54 out of 298 morning patients had adverse events 28 out of 298 afternoon patients had adverse events Afternoon patients had around half the risk of complications One major event would be avoided for every 11 patients operated on in the afternoon One of those involved in the research, Prof Bart Staels, from the Institut Pasteur de Lille, told the BBC News website: "We don't want to frighten people from having surgery - it's life saving."He also said it would be impossible for hospitals to conduct surgery only after lunch.But Prof Staels added: "If we can identify patients at highest risk, they will definitely benefit from being pushed into the afternoon and that would be reasonable."Obesity and type 2 diabetes have been shown to increase the risk of complications after surgery.Heart health is already known to fluctuate over the course of a day.The risk of a heart attack or stroke is highest first thing in the morning, while the heart and lungs work at their peak in the afternoon.Dr John O'Neill, from the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said: "Scientifically it is not hugely surprising, because just like every other cell in the body, heart cells have circadian rhythms that orchestrate their activity."Our cardiovascular system has the greatest output around mid/late-afternoon, which explains why professional athletes usually record their best performances around this time."Other possible explanations for the findings included surgeons being tired in the morning or their own body clock affecting their surgical skill, particularly if they are not "morning people".But Prof Staels said the researchers had gone to great lengths to show that the difference in survival rates was not down to the surgeons.The French team also experimented on cardiac tissue samples from patients and showed they beat more readily in the afternoon.And an analysis of the DNA in the samples found 287 genes whose activity showed a circadian rhythm - waxing and waning during the day.They then moved into mice and used experimental drugs to alter the activity of one of those genes and seemed to be able to reduce the risk of death.Prof Staels said: "We believe we have identified a potential way to circumvent the disturbing observation that operations in the morning lead to more complications."However, that will require more research to confirm.The researchers are also investigating whether circadian rhythms have an impact on survival in other types of surgery.Dr Mike Knapton, from the British Heart Foundation, said: "Thousands of people now have open heart surgery in the UK.If this finding can be replicated in other hospitals this could be helpful to surgeons planning their operating list, for non-urgent heart surgery.Follow James on Twitter.
Young people 'not receiving mental health care they need':::::Image copyright Alice Gibbs Image caption Alice Gibbs was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 12 Young people are facing long waiting times and unequal access to mental health services, a review by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has said.The commissioner said this could be "putting young people's lives at risk".The review found nearly 40% of specialist child and adolescent services needed improvement.Alice Gibbs, who was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 12, said a lack of access to specialised services had had a long-term effect on her recovery.She waited six months to see a mental health professional."Knowing that we had to wait for that help and things were only getting worse was scary," she says.She received treatment in Leicester for several years, but it was later recommended that she get specialist treatment.At the time, the nearest specialist unit for eating disorders was in London."It's a complete postcode lottery," she says."I was 16 years old, and apart from being really physically unwell, I was mentally unwell.I didn't want to be away from my family."How long are young people waiting?The CQC's Dr Paul Lelliott said the "system's complexity and fragmentation must be overcome"."There are many people out there working to make sure that children and young people who experience mental health issues are offered caring support.Their dedication is to be celebrated."However, we must also address those times when a child or young person feels let down or not listened to and make sure the same level of support is available."While the report could not specify exactly how long young people were waiting, an investigation by the BBC's World at One programme using Freedom of Information requests found children were waiting up to 22 months to see a mental health professional.Of the nine trusts that replied, the worst was Cambridgeshire & Peterborough, which had an average wait of 16 weeks in 2016-2017.The review's findings echo issues raised by NHS England in its Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, published in February.Problems identified included long waiting times, inequalities in access to services and a lack of support while young people were waiting for care.Dr Andrew Molodynski from the British Medical Association said: "Gaining access to necessary specialist care remains a serious concern in places.It is a need the government must address as a priority."'It defined my teenage life' Alice Gibbs made the hard decision to stay in Leicester for non-specialist treatment.Now 22, she says she's a lot better.But she is still receiving mental health care and thinks this may not have been the case if she had received better, more specialised care as a teenager."I'm lucky because I have had all of that support but it's frustrating to think that realistically it could be a lot better than this," she says.Alice says she has learned how to manage her eating disorder "rather than fix it"."With eating disorders, it feels like it's defining you.And it definitely has with me - it defined all of my teenage life."
Women in Scotland allowed abortion pill at home:::::Image caption Misoprostol is sold under the brand name Cytotec among others Women in Scotland are the first in the UK to be allowed to take the abortion pill at home.Scotland's Chief Medical Officer has written to all health boards to say the drug misoprostol can be taken by women outside of a clinical setting.The change brings Scotland in line with other countries such as Sweden and France.The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) has been lobbying to change the law in the UK for years.Two tablets There were 12,063 terminations of pregnancy in Scotland in 2016 and almost three-quarters (73.5%) were carried out at less than nine weeks gestation.The vast majority of these early terminations (89.4%) were medical rather than surgical procedures.The medical treatment involves taking two different medicines.The first tablet, called Mifepristone, blocks the action of the hormone progesterone, which is needed to maintain the pregnancy.The second tablet, called Misoprostol, can be given on the same day, or 24, 48 or 72 hours apart.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The tablet will be given out at a clinic but can be taken at home Not all women are suitable for a medical abortion, although they may still be suitable for a surgical abortion.The change in Scotland would mean the second tablet Misoprostol - would be administered in a clinical setting but could be taken by women at home.Within an hour of taking misoprostol women often experience heavy bleeding - usually on the way home from the clinic.This is a particular concern for women in Scotland who often have to travel long distances to access abortion and maternity services.The Scottish government said it was making the changes under existing abortion powers.Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: "Abortion can be an emotive subject - however I am proud this government is working hard to ensure women are always able to access clinically safe services."Scotland is now the only part of the UK to offer women the opportunity to take misoprostol at home when this is clinically appropriate, a decision that allows women to be in control of their treatment and as comfortable as possible during this procedure."Privacy of home Ann Furedi, chief executive of the BPAS, welcomed the decision.She said: "This will spare women not only the difficulties associated with having to make more than one clinic visit - childcare, transport, time off work - but it will also spare women from the risk of symptoms on their way home, having taken the medication in a clinic.""It is simply perverse that a woman arriving at a BPAS clinic in England and Wales with an incomplete miscarriage can be given the medication to take in the comfort and privacy of her own home, while a woman seeking an abortion must take that same medication on site."We hope that the government will follow Scotland's lead and roll out this important policy change across the rest of Great Britain."However, John Deighan, chief executive of the Society for the protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) Scotland, said the change would mark "a return to the days of back street abortions with no medical oversight".He added: "The reality is that this will have many vulnerable women who may be desperate about the situation they are in, pushed towards what is seen as the easy option of being handed some drugs and sent home to stop being a problem for society."
Superbug 'sleuthing' finds secret outbreaks:::::Image copyright Getty Images A feat of "genomic sleuthing" has uncovered 173 secret outbreaks of the superbug MRSA, a study shows.They were found in the east of England over the course of just one year, according to the details published in Science Translational Medicine.The researchers say their approach could transform the way we tackle MRSA and other superbugs.Detecting outbreaks that are happening under our noses should cut the number of people infected.MRSA - or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - is a bacterial infection that is resistant to a number of widely-used antibiotics - is a bacterial infection that is resistant to a number of widely-used antibiotics It can cause life-threatening infections if the bug breaches the skin, such as through a surgical wound Detective work Hospitals in the UK have become very good at catching outbreaks of MRSA, especially when they happen in the same place at the same time - such as in one hospital ward.But MRSA also spreads outside of hospitals, in people's homes, in care homes; and patients and staff also move around from place to place.Doctors will see the individual cases, but cannot always spot the bigger picture and catch the outbreak.Prof Sharon Peacock, one of the researchers, told the BBC: "Patients move around wards very quickly and you don't always spot the links Sherlock Holmes might detect, but the genomics does it for you."The team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genetic code of every single MRSA sample that came through three hospitals and 75 GP surgeries.They then pieced together the clues in a feat of genetic genealogy.By looking at the genetic code, the researchers could work out which samples were closely related and therefore part of the same outbreak.Surprise They found 173, ranging from outbreaks affecting two patients up to 44."I was surprised by how many we detected," Prof Peacock said.She added: "This could reverse the way we do infection control to be much more targeted, efficient and effective."This strategy cannot prevent an outbreak from occurring, but it can nip it in the bud.It is possible to get rid of MRSA, which mostly lives up the nose or on skin, using creams and antiseptic baths.A smaller scale version of this study managed to track down the carrier of MRSA and bring an outbreak in a baby unit to an end.Huge advances in DNA sequencing mean the whole genome of a bacterium can be worked out in a day for around 120.The researchers are about to start a trial investigating the cost-effectiveness of introducing genomic detective-work into the NHS.Dr Jonathan Pearce, the head of infections and immunity at the UK's Medical Research Council, said: "This study sheds light on MRSA transmission within and between hospitals and the community, which could help strengthen infection prevention and control measures."Follow James on Twitter.
'Depression lost me my job': How mental health costs up to 300,000 jobs a year:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption James Tringham, who has bipolar disorder, explains that being at work has a "normalising effect" Hayley Smith says her manager encouraged her to apply for other jobs when she told her she had depression.The news about her illness spread across the office."It was horrible - I felt really exposed," she says.After a few anxious, unhappy months, she left.Hayley is one of up to 300,000 people with mental health problems who leave their jobs each year, a report says.The report by mental health experts also says poor mental health costs the UK economy up to 99bn each year.Paul Farmer, co-author of the Thriving At Work report, said mental health was a taboo subject in many workplaces.Mr Farmer, who is chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: "Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need."In many instances, employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support."The review makes 40 recommendations for how to support employees to remain at work, including creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy.Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports.Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report said.Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it showed "we need to take action".The civil service has agreed to take on the report's recommendations.Image copyright Hayley Smith Image caption Hayley Smith lost her job when she told her employer about her depression One employer the report praised is the insurer, Aviva.James Tringham, who has worked for the company for seven years, said it helped him get his life back on track after suffering with bipolar disorder."In 2009, I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor," he says."I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine."Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre."They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up."Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back."There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help.And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Footballer Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support The review says employers should: Create a mental health at work plan Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible Encourage open conversations Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff Routinely monitor employee mental health The review said that people with long-term mental health problems were leaving jobs at twice the rate of colleagues with no such issues, although it did say that some people may be counted twice - if they left one job, returned to work elsewhere after a break but were then unable to continue in their new post.The report also pointed out the cost to employers, estimating they were losing 42bn each year because of staff suffering from mental health problems.Mrs May said: "It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being."What is mental health?For Hayley Smith, support from her employer could have made her chronic depression more bearable.After leaving her job, she started her own company.Five years on, she now employs others."In the long term, it's given me awareness of mental health," she says."And the awareness to make sure I was never going to make people feel the way I was made to feel."
Patients face 'distressing readmissions':::::Image copyright Siri Stafford The number of patients in England being readmitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge has risen by nearly a quarter in the last four years, a watchdog has said.Figures compiled by Healthwatch suggest one in five of these potentially distressing readmissions happen 48 hours after being sent home.The watchdog warns patients may be being rushed out early.NHS England says it is impossible to know the reasons for the readmissions.An emergency readmission occurs when a patient needs to go back into hospital unexpectedly for further treatment, within 30 days of having been discharged.Readmissions in such a short space of time raise concerns about patients being discharged unsafely, and about the pressure on hospitals to free up beds.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.Healthwatch was prompted to look at the issue as none of the official national NHS bodies collects data on readmissions.It asked hospital trusts to provide information under the Freedom of Information Act.There were some differences in the way the data was collected, but it received comparable data from 72 hospital trusts, just over half the total in England.The results showed: In 2016/17 there were 529,318 emergency readmissions reported by 84 hospital trusts The number of emergency readmissions had risen by 23% over the past four years to 457,880 One in five of the readmissions were with 48 hours of discharge There was a 29% rise in people being readmitted within 24 hours The rise in the readmission rate outstrips the overall rise in hospital admissions, which stands at 9% over the period.In total, there were 16.5 million admissions last year, suggesting that close to one in 20 patients in hospital may be a readmission.Healthwatch speculated there could be a number of reasons for this, including patients being rushed out too soon or when there is insufficient support in the community to care for them.Hospitals are under pressure to bring down the number of delays in freeing up hospital beds because of rising waiting lists for operations and increasing delays in A&E.Imelda Redmond from Healthwatch England said the analysis "raises some big questions": "With health and care services being expected to each free up 1,250 beds through reducing delayed discharges, it is vital that these services also watch what is happening to the people being sent home from hospital."It's clear that health and care leaders need to take a closer look at why people are returning to hospital so quickly."But an NHS England spokesperson said: "Current data makes it impossible to distinguish between genuinely unforeseeable emergency readmissions and readmissions that would not be surprising to clinicians."We agree that it would be useful for NHS Digital to look these data more routinely - and will be asking them to consider doing so."Nigel Edwards of Nuffield Trust said it's a sign of the pressure the NHS is under, and called for improved national data to better analyse emergency readmissions.
Scottish government crackdown on unhealthy food offers:::::Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Ministers have targeted "bold" measures to make a "real, lasting difference" to Scotland's health The promotion of food and drink high in fat, sugar and salt is to be restricted in Scotland, ministers have confirmed.The Scottish government plans the move as part of its new diet and obesity strategy to help people lose weight.Ministers also want to see the broadcast of TV adverts for unhealthy food banned before the 21:00 watershed.TV chef Jamie Oliver, a prominent campaigner for healthier eating, described it as "trailblazing" and urged the UK government to follow suit.He said: "This is an amazing step towards making sure the healthiest choice is the easiest choice - for everyone."Today, Scotland has set an example to the rest of the world.It has picked up the baton that Westminster dropped last year.So, now the ball is back in the UK government's court."We need to ensure everyone in Britain has a chance to raise their children in a healthy environment."Public health minister Aileen Campbell said obesity "significantly increases" the risk of developing conditions like diabetes, heart disease and depression.Ms Campbell launched a consultation on the plans at Tynecastle Stadium in Edinburgh, where she met participants in the Football Fans in Training programme.She later told MSPs that the government was putting forward "bold" measures which would "make a real, lasting difference to the country's health".These include plans to restrict price promotions on food and drink high in fat, sugar and salt in areas around visitor attractions and on routes to schools, and 40m of investment to deliver almost 100,000 "supported weight management interventions" for people with or at risk of type two diabetes.Ms Campbell also said that if the UK government did not commit to banning TV adverts for unhealthy food before the 21:00 watershed, the Scottish government would ask for powers to be devolved so it could do so itself.Image caption Aileen Campbell launched the consultation on the obesity strategy at Tynecastle Stadium in Edinburgh The SNP MSP said: "Simply put, it's harming the people of Scotland.It also puts pressure on the NHS, other public services and our economy."That is why we need commitment and action from everyone across all sectors and at all levels including government, citizens, the public sector and businesses right across the country."Health and retail organisations broadly welcomed the consultation, alongside opposition parties.Cancer Research UK said it was "great to see a range of bold proposals" in the strategy, saying that Scotland has been "in the grip of an obesity epidemic for far too long".The British Medical Association Scotland said "ambitious" action was needed "across every part of society in Scotland if we are to successfully reduce levels of obesity in future years".The Scottish Grocers Federation said "clamping down on promotions" was "too blunt an instrument to really impact on consumer behaviour", but welcomed the consultation and said the key role retailers had to play would be reflected in their response.Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said efforts to tackle obesity "could not come soon enough", stressing the need to work across parties and portfolios to do so.Scottish Labour MSP Colin Smyth said the "obesity crisis is the single biggest public health challenge facing Scotland today", and said "bold, radical action is very much needed".The consultation on the diet and obesity strategy will run until the end of January 2018.
Southend Hospital backs off 'Airbnb beds' plan:::::Image caption Southend Hospital has distanced itself from a pilot scheme were hospital patients could be discharged to recuperate in people's spare rooms A hospital has backed down over plans for patients to recuperate in people's homes as part of an Airbnb-style trial.Southend Hospital in Essex said it has "no intention... to support the pilot at this time".The trial by healthcare start-up CareRooms involves 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms while waiting to be discharged.It had been criticised by politicians and health groups as a "ridiculous" idea.Labour's Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a "sticking plaster" for wider issues in the care sector.'Never compromise safety' The hospital had previously said "only preliminary discussions" had been held, but has since clarified the pilot would not be supported until certain criteria had been met.Deputy chief executive of Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Tom Abell, said: "While we welcome and encourage new ideas and innovation, there is no intention and there never has been for the hospital to support this pilot at this time."We will never compromise the safety and quality of care for patients and we will not support this pilot until the necessary safeguarding and quality arrangements are in place and there has been full engagement and discussion with our local communities on the proposal."Earlier, CareRooms said it would recruit "hosts" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom to create "secure care spaces for patients who are waiting to be discharged".The hosts - who would earn up to a maximum of 1,000 per month - would not need any previous care experience but would need to go through security checks to be approved for the scheme.
Scotland's health 'is not improving', auditors warn:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Scotland's health "is not improving" as the NHS faces "significant challenges", Audit Scotland has warned.The watchdog's annual report lists concerns over missed targets, longer waiting times, "stalled" improvements and growing pressure on budgets.Scottish Labour has renewed its calls for Health Secretary Shona Robison to quit in light of the report.Ms Robison insisted that "significant" improvements have been made, while stressing that there is "no quick fix".The report was the focus of much of Thursday's weekly session of questions to the first minister at Holyrood, with Nicola Sturgeon acknowledging "big challenges" for the health service.But she insisted that "against many measures" the Scottish NHS was performing better than elsewhere in the UK.The Scottish government published its "blueprint" for the future of the NHS in December 2016, aiming to treat people closer to home rather than in hospital.'Significant challenges' Audit Scotland's latest annual report stated that there was a "general consensus in Scotland that healthcare cannot continue to be provided in the same way", but concluded that "more progress needs to be made if transformational change is to happen".It found that existing challenges like "increasing costs, growing demand, and the continuing pressures on public finances" had continued to "intensify" in 2016-17.The public spending watchdog said there had been progress, but warned that "fundamental" areas still needed to be addressed."Significant concerns" flagged up in the report include: A 99% increase in the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for an outpatient appointment - "more people are waiting longer to be seen" "The majority of key national performance targets were not met in 2016-17" General practice faces "significant challenges", including recruiting and retaining GPs and "low morale" There is a "lack of financial flexibility" for health boards and a "lack of long-term planning" The overall health of Scots "continues to be poor and significant health inequalities remain" Life expectancy is "lower than in most European countries" and improvements have "stalled" Drug-related deaths have "increased significantly" with the rate "now the highest in the EU" "There are warning signs that maintaining the quality of care is becoming increasingly difficult" Image copyright Thinkstock At 12.9bn, health funding now accounts for 43% of the overall Scottish government budget.Despite an increase in the NHS budget, rising operating costs have meant health boards had to make "unprecedented" savings of almost 390m in order to break even.And while the budget for 2017-18 saw an increase in cash terms, there was actually a decrease of 0.1% in real terms from the prior year.The Audit Scotland report concluded that simply adding more funding was "no longer sufficient" to achieve the "step change" needed across the system.It said that budgeting on a year-by-year basis is "hindering development of longer-term plans for moving more care out of hospital", and said a clearer long-term financial framework was "critical".'Positive impact' However, the report did state that there is a "positive basis on which to build" for Scotland's NHS.It noted that Scotland has had "a consistent overall policy direction in health for many years" and there was "broad consensus" on goals.It said that staff "remain committed to providing high-quality care", while levels of overall patient satisfaction "continue to be high" and the Scottish public "hold the NHS in high regard".And it noted that early signs are that changes in the way services are planned and delivered are "beginning to have a positive impact", such as a reduction in delayed discharges.Image caption Caroline Gardner said there was "no simple solution" Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there was "widespread agreement" that healthcare "must be delivered differently if it is to withstand growing pressure on services".She said: "There is no simple solution, but these fundamental areas must be addressed if reform is to deliver the scale of transformation that's needed across the NHS."Involving staff, the public and bodies across the public sector will also be crucial for success."At Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of trying to sweep concerns about the health services under the carpet.She said the Scottish government was "struggling to do the basics", adding: "The SNP set their own targets to make things better but they've improved in only one in the last five years."We know there's no long term plan even though one was promised for the start of this year, that GPs are being underfunded and that we spent 171 million hiring in agency staff to plug the gaps."'Big challenges' Labour's interim leader Alex Rowley said problems with the health service were "spiralling out of control".He acknowledged that reform of the NHS was not easy, but said the government was "not doing enough and is not moving fast enough".In response, Ms Sturgeon said there were "big challenges" for the NHS - but said these existed "in every health service across the developed world".She said: "In meeting these challenges in Scotland, and they are big challenges, I think against many measures we are seeing the NHS in Scotland perform better than the NHS in any other part of the UK - and that's because of the actions we're taking."Image caption Health Secretary Shona Robison said there was "simply no quick fix" for the challenges facing the health service Labour also said the report showed that it was "time for Shona Robison to go as health secretary".Ms Robison insisted there were some "encouraging" elements to the report, highlighting high patient satisfaction and "innovative work being done".She said there had been "significant improvements in Scotland's health system" under the SNP, "driven by our clear vision for the future for the NHS", citing increased staff levels and "record investment".The Dundee MSP said: "We have long been realistic about the challenges for the NHS and the need for change."We're working to develop a medium term financial framework, within the context of the budget settlement that the Scottish government receives.This will be to outline the broad direction for the NHS and care services to meet the changing needs of the people of Scotland, including shifting the balance of care towards community health services."It's important to stress however that improving the nation's health for the long term requires more than acute care - there's simply no quick fix."She said the government had introduced a range of long term measures designed to make Scots healthier "Ultimately, our work across government will ensure the people of Scotland can continue to look forward to a healthier future," she said.
Warning over NHS Wales Brexit 'catastrophe':::::Image copyright Niyazz/Getty Images Any Brexit which means leaving the single market could be catastrophic for the NHS and particularly devastating in Wales, a health academic has warned.Nick Fahy, a health policy senior researcher at the University of Oxford said a hard or no deal Brexit could leave patients "at immediate risk".He also warned if EU staff left the UK, London could "suck in" Welsh NHS staff.The Welsh Conservatives said a key aim in talks was to ensure healthcare delivery "remains seamless".Mr Fahy outlined issues ranging from potential risks to the NHS budget, workforce shortages and uncertainty over future arrangements for research and medicines."It's going to be very hard, I don't think we should be under any illusions about that - and that's why what kind of Brexit we have really matters," he said.He is the co-author of a report in The Lancet which looks at potential consequences for the NHS from different Brexit scenarios."If we have a soft Brexit - where we remain pretty well integrated within the single market, where we continue to have an ability for EU doctors and nurses to come and work here and feel confident about their future in the country, then I think the impact can be managed and be relatively minor," he said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Fahy said a hard Brexit or 'no deal' could have a devastating impact on NHS Wales "If we have a hard or no deal Brexit, I think the impact risks being catastrophic."He said it posed a "substantial and real threat to healthcare"."We haven't got slack in the NHS; we're not coming at this from a position of strength, but from a position where each winter we breathe a sigh of relief that we managed to make it through without the NHS collapsing and that doesn't give us a situation of reserves we can draw on."Mr Fahy is a specialist adviser to the Commons health committee and has worked for both the Department of Health and European Commission.He said the UK has an "unusually high dependency" on workers from abroad.Although the picture is different in Wales - only 2% of the NHS workforce is from the EU - it could be vulnerable to workers moving elsewhere if EU workers left the south east and London.Mr Fahy said hospitals in London would have to offer more money and the risk is that in the medium term, this will "suck in" health professionals from Wales.Carol Shillabeer, chief executive of Powys health board, said there were already significant recruitment issues and it could be a particular problem for the social care sector, which was "hugely reliant" on EU workers."If we reel forward, what could happen without that workforce, we start to think about sustainability of the social care sector, particularly residential homes, the availability of surgeons; you start to see the workforce eroded even further."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hospital doctor Florin Capatana and nurse Florin Burluc, both from Romania, are asked about uncertainty Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Key among the aims in our negotiations with EU partners is to ensure that the delivery of healthcare remains seamless, and that the rights of UK and EU nationals can be guaranteed."Further to this, it is vitally important that the pharmaceutical industry maintains the confidence to continue investing in Wales, and that the regulatory environment is conducive to patients across the UK's four constituent nations having access to the latest medicines."Of course, when we end our relationship with the EU, additional monetary resources will become available for future governments to invest in our hard-pressed NHS services."The Welsh Government paid tribute to NHS workers from the EU and said Brexit posed a number of challenges."We want EU nationals currently working in the NHS in Wales, or those who wish to come here to work, to feel welcome," said a spokesperson."Despite record numbers of frontline NHS staff working in Wales, some professions and speciality fields still face recruitment challenges.Health boards, along with our support, are working to address these challenges."
'Incredible' editing of life's building blocks:::::Image copyright Getty Images Scientists have demonstrated an "incredibly powerful" ability to manipulate the building blocks of life in two separate studies.One altered the order of atoms in DNA to rewrite the human genetic code and the instructions for life.The other edited RNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA and unlocks the information in the genetic code.The studies - which could eventually treat diseases - have been described as clever, important and exciting.Cystic fibrosis, inherited blindness and other diseases caused by a single typo in the genetic code could ultimately be prevented or treated with such approaches.Both studies were performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.Base editing The first, published in the journal Nature, developed tools called base editors.DNA is built out of the four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).If a single one of them is in the wrong place, it can cause disease.Base editors alter the molecular structure of one base to convert it into another.Researchers can now manipulate the four bases.And the team used base editing to correct an inherited disease that leads to dangerously high levels of iron in the blood.Prof David Liu of the Broad Institute said: "We are hard at work trying to translate base editing technology into human therapeutics."However, he admits there are still issues around safety and implementation: "Having a machine that can make the change you want to make is only the start.You still need to do all this other work, but having the machine really helps."RNA The second study, published in the journal Science, focused on RNA, another of the molecules essential for life.DNA is the master copy of the genetic code, but in order for a cell to use the genetic instructions, it must first create an RNA copy.It is like going to a library where you cannot read any of the books, but can only use photocopies.The researchers used their RNA approach to correct an inherited form of anaemia in human cells.Feng Zhang - also of the Broad Institute - said: "The ability to correct disease-causing mutations is one of the primary goals of genome editing."This new ability to edit RNA opens up more potential opportunities to... treat many diseases, in almost any kind of cell."All of the experiments were on human cells growing in the laboratory.Dr Helen O'Neill, from UCL, said: "This is an exciting week for genetic research."These papers highlight the fast pace of the field and the continuous improvements being made in genome editing, bringing it closer and closer to the clinic."Scientific advances in genetic engineering are taking place at an incredible pace.And the same technologies work on plants, animals and micro-organisms too, posing questions for areas like agriculture.Dr Sarah Chan, a bioethicist at the University of Edinburgh, said we can no longer pretend the technology is too dangerous to contemplate.She told the BBC: "We can't hide any more."The science is moving fast in the sense it is becoming less risky, more certain, more precise and more effective."It is absolutely past time for us to engage more widely with publics on the issue of gene editing."Follow James on Twitter.
Ex-policewoman's cannabis use to relieve pain from MS:::::Image caption Sue Cox says she wants to be able to take cannabis legally Meet Sue Cox: Former police officer, grandmother... and committed cannabis user.The 64-year-old said the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis have left her dependent on the illegal drug for the pain relief she feels it gives her.Mrs Cox, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, served with Gwent Police in the late 1970s before leaving to start a family.She has now joined a group - which includes the Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Dystonia Society - calling for cannabis to be made available for medicinal purposes in Wales.The group met with AMs on Wednesday to discuss the drug's use for pain relief, although the Home Office said there was no plan to legalise cannabis and there was no evidence raw cannabis had any medicinal benefits.Image copyright Getty Images Mrs Cox is all too aware of the consequences of the illegal drug, given her former profession.She said she wants cannabis legalised for medicinal use in Wales so that she can use it without breaking the law."When I was diagnosed with MS in 2014, the doctors prescribed me with a cocktail of medicated drugs that left me so weak that on a good day I could just about manage to sit up on the edge of my bed for 20 minutes," she said."I was like a zombie and as weak as a kitten.I felt nauseous most of the time and I was concerned about the level of chemicals, especially liquid morphine, going into my body."Then a year ago, I read something on the internet about cannabis and how some MS sufferers believed it gave them pain relief.I thought 'I need to try this', but had no idea where to get hold of it."It was ironic, really, because during my days as a serving police officer, I'd been on drugs raids and actually seized cannabis."I joined the police because I believed in the rule of law.Even if I hadn't been an officer, I would still not like breaking the law but, having said that, if there is something out there that is going to relieve the pain in my muscles, I am jolly well going to use it."Getting hold of the cannabis was my biggest problem initially.I do not want to go into detail about how I have overcome that problem, other than to say that the cannabis is not bought.It is given to me by someone."The positive effects of smoking it were immediate.My brain and my muscles felt completely relaxed and, for the first time in ages, I felt nice and calm."I still take codeine (painkiller) to take the edge off my pain but it is only the cannabis that can eliminate it."The NHS warns that cannabis can harm people's mental health, fertility and lungs.Image caption Mrs Cox joined campaigners at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay Her use of the drug is something Mrs Cox has had to explain carefully to her 13-year-old grandson."I have to be sensitive to that," she said."He told me he was worried about me because he's been told drugs are dangerous.It was a difficult conversation."I told him I don't want him to go out and do it because he isn't ill. "I joke with my children and friends that I'm the poster pensioner for pot now I've joined this campaign."But there is a serious side to this.As things stand, people are having to put themselves at risk.They shouldn't have to be diving into dark corners to buy something that might be cannabis or it might be a packet of dried sage."Legal classification Cannabis is used for medicinal purposes in Germany and Switzerland - people are allowed to import it for medical use.Canada, the Netherlands, Israel and 20 US states regulate herbal cannabis for medical use, The Welsh NHS was the first in the UK to fund a cannabis-based drug for MS patients.But the Welsh Government does not have the power to legislate on drugs and a spokesman said: "Legal classification of drugs is not a devolved matter and remains a responsibility at a UK government level."We consider this to be appropriate as the legal classification of drugs should be considered on a UK-wide basis."A Home Office spokesman said the UK government had no plans to legalise cannabis."We recognise that people with chronic pain and debilitating illnesses are looking to alleviate their symptoms," a spokesman said."However there is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health, and harms individuals and communities.In its raw form, cannabis has no recognised medicinal benefits in the UK."
Typhoid vaccine set to have 'huge impact':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Typhoid is spread through dirty water and contaminated food.A new vaccine that could prevent up to nine-in-10 cases of typhoid fever has been recommended by the World Health Organization.Experts say it could have a "huge impact" on the 22 million cases, and 220,000 deaths, from typhoid each year.Crucially it works in children, who are at high-risk of the infection, unlike other typhoid vaccines.It is hoped the vaccine could eventually help countries eliminate typhoid.Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella Typhi bacteria and patients have: prolonged fever headache nausea loss of appetite constipation in one-in-100 cases it causes fatal complications The bacteria are highly contagious and spread through contaminated food or water.The infection is most common in countries with poor sanitation and a lack of clean water, particularly in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Two typhoid vaccines already approved to help reduce the number of cases, but none are licensed for children under the age of two.The decision to recommend the new conjugate typhoid vaccine was made by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (Sage).Prof Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of Sage, said: "For the first time I think we do have a very effective vaccine."Sage recommended the vaccine should be given to children aged six-months old and said catch-up campaigns focusing on children up to 15 years old should also take place.Prof Cravioto said the vaccine was vital as the world was "reaching the limit" of current treatments due to the "crazy amount" of antibiotic resistance the typhoid bacterium had acquired.'A valuable weapon' Data from a clinical trial of the vaccine, carried out by the University of Oxford, was published just last month in the Lancet medical journal.The "challenge study" gave the vaccine to 112 people and then deliberately infected (challenged) them with typhoid-causing bacteria.Such an approach gives a clear picture of a vaccine's effectiveness without having to immunise thousands of people.It showed the vaccine was up to 87% effective.Prof Andrew Pollard, who ran those trials, told the BBC News website: "It could have a huge impact."If it can be rolled out in all communities, it must be possible to prevent the majority of cases and if it also interrupts transmission, which hasn't been shown yet, then it could be eliminated from those regions."Gavi, the global body that pays for vaccines in 68 low and middle-income countries, is now considering whether to add the typhoid vaccine.Dr Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, said: "Not only could this vaccine save lives, it could also prove to be a valuable weapon in the fight against antimicrobial resistance."Before antibiotics, typhoid killed one-in-five people infected.Now there is growing levels of typhoid that is resistant to drugs.Follow James on Twitter.

Viking trade in red squirrels may have spread leprosy:::::Image copyright Graeme Hunter Image caption The Vikings traded in red squirrel pelts and meat and the animals were sometimes kept as pets Red squirrels traded by Vikings could have brought leprosy to pre-medieval England, according to archaeologists.Research has revealed that a pre-Norman skull found in Hoxne in Suffolk has a leprosy strain closely related to a type known to affect squirrels.The strain has also been found in Medieval Scandinavian skeletons.Cambridge University's Sarah Inskip said contact with the "highly-prized squirrel pelt and meat" traded by Vikings could have spread the disease.Image copyright Sarah Inskip Image caption Hoxne woman's nasal spine was destroyed by the disease and damage to the skull suggests she would have had extensive facial lesions Radiocarbon dating revealed the woman's skull, which is held at Diss Museum in Norfolk, dates to between 885 and 1015 AD.It has the same strain of leprosy as that identified in skeletal remains found in Medieval Denmark and Sweden.The research, which has been published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, cites a recent study demonstrating leprosy infection in red squirrels in Brownsea Island in Dorset.DNA sequencing of the Mycobacterium Leprae strain found in the modern animals showed it was closed related to that found in the Hoxne skull.The strain is found in nine-banded armadillos and has caused some human cases of leprosy in Florida.Image copyright Peter Trimming/Flickr Image caption Leprosy affects squirrels in much the same way as humans - with lesions on muzzles, paws and ears Dr Inskip said: "That [leprosy] may also come from squirrels is an interesting idea."King's Lynn and Yarmouth in Norfolk were "significant ports for fur imports" from Denmark and Sweden at this time, she added.The animals were also sometimes kept as pets.The leprosy strain has previously been found in the skeleton of a man from Great Chesterford near Cambridge, dating from 415 to 545 AD, suggesting it had persisted for hundreds of years in south east England.Dr Inskip said: "This new evidence, coupled with the prevalence of leper hospitals in East Anglia from the 11th Century onwards, adds weight to the idea the disease was endemic in this region earlier than other parts of the country."
Daydreaming brain network used in autopilot:::::Image copyright Getty Images The part of the brain associated with daydreaming also allows us to perform tasks on autopilot, a study has found.A collection of brain regions known as the "default mode network" (DMN) is active when we are daydreaming or thinking about the past or future.Cambridge University researchers found it also allows us to switch to autopilot once we are familiar with a task, such as driving a familiar route.There is even hope the findings can help people with mental illness.Previous research has found the DMN is more active during states of rest, and that it can behave abnormally in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).But researchers have remained unclear about its exact role.Switching to manual For the current study, 28 volunteers were asked to match a target card, such as the two of clubs, with one of four cards shown.They had to work out if the cards were supposed to be matched on colour, number or shape through trial and error.Their brain activity was monitored throughout using a scanner.While they were learning the rule, known as the acquisition stage, a part of the brain known as the dorsal attention network was more active.It has been associated with processing information that demands attention.Once they knew the rule and were applying it, the DMN was more active.They were particularly good at the task if their DMN activity was associated with activity in the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with memory.Lead author Deniz Vatansever says the DMN allows us to predict what is going to happen and reduce our need to think."It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are."So, for example, when you're driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision."When the environment changes, and no longer conforms to our expectations, Dr Vatansever said our brain enters a "manual mode" that overrides the automatic system, or DMN activity.The researchers hope their findings will help those with mental health disorders - such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder who can have automatic thought patterns that drive repeated, unpleasant behaviour.
Share of European Union staff leaving NHS rises following Brexit:::::Image copyright sturti Image caption Experts say England does not yet produce enough home-grown staff for the NHS to meet requirements without workers from abroad The proportion of EU nationals leaving jobs in the NHS is rising, while the share of those joining is shrinking.The BBC analysed NHS Digital figures, which showed the trend in England over the past two-and-a-half years.Health experts say the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June 2016 was behind the trend.The Department of Health says new language requirements for EU nurses may have played a part.The analysis comes days after the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the health system was "straining at the seams" and faced a "precarious" future, highlighting staff shortages and rising vacancy rates.What do the figures show?In the last full year before the referendum - 2015 - there were 7,535 EU nationals who left NHS Trusts, making up 5.6% of workers of all nationalities leaving their jobs.The following year, EU nationals accounted for 6.6% of all leavers, and in the first six months of this year, they made up 7.4%.The pattern was repeated in 80 NHS Trusts out of 240 across England.The proportion of EU staff joining fell over the same period.In 2015 EU nationals made up 10% of new joiners.In the first six months of 2017, they accounted for 8.2%.That trend was reflected in 62 trusts.Danny Mortimer, co-convenor of the Cavendish Coalition, which represents health and social care organisations, said: "This analysis starts to confirm anecdotal stories we are hearing from our members, especially in the South East."Our members don't feel able to recruit in big numbers."There are practical challenges like the exchange rate [between the pound and the euro] is weak - and the number of people choosing to leave is increasing."The trend was more pronounced when focussing solely on nurses.In the year before the vote, EU nurses made up 7.6% of all the nurses leaving nationally, rising to 11.5% in the first six months of 2017.Almost one in five nurses, 6,299 out of 34,595, joining the NHS in 2015 came from other EU member states.In the first six months of 2017 this had fallen to just one in 10 newly-recruited nurses.One source told the BBC of at least one NHS trust that had abandoned a recruitment fair on the continent due to poor response rates.The General Medical Council surveyed more than 2,000 doctors from the European Economic Area (EEA) in February and of the 60% who said they were thinking of leaving the UK at some point in the future, nine in 10 said the UK's decision to leave the EU was a factor in their considerations.Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "A nurse who trained in Lyon or Lisbon is as much a part of the NHS family as one trained in London.But sadly, it is no surprise that so many are leaving - few can live with the uncertainty."During the Brexit negotiations, [Prime Minister] Theresa May must reassure nurses from around Europe that they are needed and welcome in the NHS.It would not survive without their contribution."Overall, the NHS says there are around 3,200 more EU nationals working in the NHS than at the time of the referendum, as the size of the health service continues to grow.Over the same period, there has been a slight reduction of 162 nurses, which it suggests may be down to the Nursing and Midwifery Council introducing new language requirements in January 2016, making it more difficult to be eligible for employment.But our analysis shows the growth is slowing.The year-on-year percentage increase in the EU workforce dropped from 16.8% in 2015 to 2.7% in the first six months of 2017.Experts say England does not yet produce enough home-grown staff for the NHS to meet staffing requirements without workers from abroad, although the government wants to make the country "self-sufficient" in training doctors and create thousands more nursing training places to boost the domestic workforce.The Commons Health Select Committee previously began to take evidence on the implications of Brexit but postponed its inquiry when the snap General Election was called for June 2017.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had told the committee the government had stopped short of publishing its own analysis because "the publication of what might be called the worst-case scenario could itself have an impact on negotiations".Dr Andrew Dearden, the treasurer of the British Medical Association, said: "We know that Brexit has already had a huge impact on the morale of EU NHS staff working here.Our own research has shown us that more than four in ten EU NHS staff are considering leaving the UK following the EU referendum result."A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: "There are 3,193 more EU nationals working in the NHS than at the time of the referendum we have been absolutely clear that these staff play a vital role in the NHS and want to see their excellent work continue long after the UK leaves the EU."However, we recognise the NHS also needs more home-grown staff, so we'll be training an extra 1,500 doctors and 10,000 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals a year by 2020 to ensure the NHS has the workforce it needs both now and in the future."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised more training places for home-grown doctors and nurses Across the UK In Wales, the proportion of EU nationals leaving the NHS was 2.5% the year before the referendum, rising to 3.5% in 2015-16 when the vote took place.It has since returned to 3%.Neither NHS Scotland or The Department of Health in Northern Ireland records the nationality of leavers and joiners.More about this story The Shared Data Hub makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.For more information on methodology, click here.For the full dataset, click here.The figures do not include data for GPs and practice staff or Clinical Commissioning Groups, and concern headcount rather than full-time equivalent posts.
Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem:::::Image copyright Other At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital.Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected.And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that.Indeed many do.With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge.1.Problems are on the increase It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms.While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase.Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness.Why is this?Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems.Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago.But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people.Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes.2.Women are now more likely to be affected Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness.One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England.If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent.Young people are particularly susceptible.A number of theories have been put forward for this.The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder.And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying.Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking.3.But men are more likely to take their own lives Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives.In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49.Men account for three-quarters of the total figure.The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.Since the 1980s, the trend is down.There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest.Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle.4.Mental health problems tend to start early As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK.In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult.Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24.It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness.In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase.5.Mental health services are the poor relation when it comes to funding Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England.Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16.Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby.But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16.The government is adamant things will change.They have to.While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years.Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK.Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans.But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments.6.A nation of pill-poppers?The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them.The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016.They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people.Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too.But drugs are still the most common form of treatment.The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has more than doubled in the past 10 years.An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor.But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed.Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients.But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help.Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital.7.More and more people are being detained With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act.Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds.What happens then?They suffer another crisis and are detained again.So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well.8.A long way from home The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment.Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation.In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care.But that's not the point, said the report.Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was "unacceptable".Everyone knows it's a problem.Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families.Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment.And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better.In fact, it says, there's been a "startling rise" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults.One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles.9.It's not all bad news...The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves.In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted "#unacceptable" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available.That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held.But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up.In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council.The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16.10.It's Time to Change But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness.A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink.It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working.Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England.Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency.Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination.For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.
Resignation syndrome: Sweden's mystery illness:::::For nearly two decades Sweden has been battling a mysterious illness.Called Resignation Syndrome, it affects only the children of asylum-seekers, who withdraw completely, ceasing to walk or talk, or open their eyes.Eventually they recover.But why does this only seem to occur in Sweden?When her father picks her up from her wheelchair, nine-year-old Sophie is lifeless.In contrast, her hair is thick and shiny - like a healthy child's.But Sophie's eyes are closed.And under her tracksuit bottoms she wears a nappy.A transparent feeding tube runs into Sophie's nose - this is how she has been nourished for the past 20 months.Sophie and her family are asylum seekers from the former USSR.They arrived in December 2015 and live in accommodation allocated to refugees in a small town in central Sweden."Her blood pressure is quite normal," says Dr Elisabeth Hultcrantz, a volunteer with Doctors of the World."But she has a high pulse rate, so maybe she's reacting to so many people coming to visit her today."Hultcrantz tests Sophie's reflexes.Everything works normally.But the child does not stir.An ENT surgeon before she retired, Hultcrantz is worried because Sophie does not ever open her mouth.This could be dangerous, because if there were a problem with her feeding tube, Sophie could choke.Image caption Elisabeth Hultcrantz: Children disconnect the conscious part of their brain So how could a child who loved to dance become so deeply inert?"When I explain to the parents what has happened, I tell them the world has been so terrible that Sophie has gone into herself and disconnected the conscious part of her brain," says Hultcrantz.The health professionals who treat these children agree that trauma is what has caused them to withdraw from the world.The children who are most vulnerable are those who have witnessed extreme violence - often against their parents - or whose families have fled a deeply insecure environment.To our knowledge, no cases have been established outside of Sweden Karl Sallin, Paediatrician Sophie's parents have a terrifying story of extortion and persecution by a local mafia.In September 2015 their car was stopped by men in police uniform."We were dragged out.Sophie was in the car so she witnessed me and her mother being roughly beaten," remembers Sophie's father.The men let Sophie's mother go - she grabbed her daughter and ran.But Sophie's father did not escape."They took me away and then I don't remember anything," he says.Sophie's mother took her to a friend's home.The little girl was very upset.She cried, shouted "Please go and find my dad!", and beat the wall with her feet.Three days later, her father made contact, and from then on the family remained on the move, hiding in friends' homes until they left for Sweden three months later.On arrival, they were held for hours by Swedish police.Then, quite quickly, Sophie deteriorated."After a couple of days, I noticed she wasn't playing as much as she used to with her sister," says Sophie's mother, who is expecting a new baby next month.Soon afterwards, the family was informed they could not stay in Sweden.Sophie heard everything in that meeting with the Migration Board, and it was at this point that she stopped speaking and eating.Resignation Syndrome was first reported in Sweden in the late 1990s.More than 400 cases were reported in the two years from 2003-2005.As more Swedes began to worry about the consequences of immigration, these "apathetic children", as they were known, became a huge political issue.There were reports the children were faking it, and that parents were poisoning their offspring to secure residence.None of those stories were proven.Over the last decade, the number of children reported to be suffering from Resignation Syndrome has decreased.Sweden's National Board of Health recently stated there were 169 cases in 2015 and 2016.It remains the case that children from particular geographical and ethnic groups are the most vulnerable: those from the former USSR, the Balkans, Roma children, and most recently the Yazidi.Only a tiny number have been unaccompanied migrants, none have been African, and very few have been Asian.Unlike Sophie, the children affected have often been living in Sweden for years, speak the language and are well-adjusted to their new, Nordic lives.Numerous conditions resembling Resignation Syndrome have been reported before - among Nazi concentration camp inmates, for example.In the UK, a similar condition - Pervasive Refusal Syndrome - was identified in children in the early 1990s, but there have been only a tiny handful of cases, and none of them among asylum seekers."To our knowledge, no cases have been established outside of Sweden," writes Dr Karl Sallin, a paediatrician at the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, part of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.Find out more Image caption Sophie's mother, sister and father Listen to Sweden's Child Migrant Mystery on Assignment, on the BBC World Service For transmission times or to catch up online, click here So how can an illness respect national boundaries?There is no definitive answer to that question, says Sallin, who is researching Resignation Syndrome for his PhD.I can't make her better, because as doctors we don't decide if these children can stay in Sweden or not Lars Dagson, Sophie's paediatrician "The most plausible explanation is that there are some sort of socio-cultural factors that are necessary in order for this condition to develop.A certain way of reacting or responding to traumatic events seems to be legitimised in a certain context."So somehow - and we do not know the mechanism for this, and why it should happen in Sweden - the kind of symptoms displayed by the children are culturally sanctioned: this is a way the children are allowed to express their trauma.If that is the case, it raises an interesting question: could Resignation Syndrome be contagious?"That is sort of implicit in the model.That if you provide the right sort of nourishment for those kinds of behaviours in a society, you will also see more cases," says Sallin."If you look at the very first case in 1998 in the north of Sweden, as soon as that case was reported, there were other cases emerging in the same area.And there have also been cases of siblings where first one develops it and then the other.But it should be noted that researchers who proposed that model of disease, they are not certain that there needs to be direct contact between cases.It's a topic for research."Here Sallin hits on the main obstacle to understanding Resignation Syndrome - the lack of research into it.No-one has done follow-up on what happens to these children, but we do know that they survive.For Sophie's parents, that is hard to believe.They have seen no change in their daughter in 20 months.Their days are punctuated by Sophie's regime - exercises to stop her muscles wasting, attempts to engage her with music and cartoons, walks outside in a wheelchair, feeding and changing."You need to harden your heart with these cases," says Sophie's paediatrician, Dr Lars Dagson, who has seen her regularly throughout her illness."I can only keep her alive.I can't make her better, because as doctors we don't decide if these children can stay in Sweden or not."Image caption Annica Carlshamre: This sickness has to do with trauma, not asylum Dagson shares the view commonly held among doctors treating children with Resignation Syndrome, that recovery depends on them feeling secure and that it is a permanent residence permit that kick-starts that process."In some way the child will have to sense that there's hope, something to live for That's the only way I can explain why having the right to stay would, in all the cases I've seen so far, change the situation."Until recently, families with a sick child were allowed to stay.But the arrival of some 300,000 migrants in the last three years has led to a change of heart.Last year, a new temporary law came into force that limits all asylum seekers' chances of being granted permanent residence.Applicants are granted either a three-year or 13-month visa.Sophie's family have the latter, and it expires in March next year."What happens afterwards?The real issue hasn't been dealt with - it's limbo," says Dagson.He doubts Sophie will recover in 13 months."I can't say it's not possible, but it all depends how the parents sense this - are we going to stay after these 13 months?If they're not sure about that, they cannot give Sophie the sense that everything is OK." But evidence from the town of Skara in the south of Sweden suggests that there is a way of curing children with Resignation Syndrome even if the family doesn't receive permanent residence."From our point of view, this particular sickness has to do with former trauma, not asylum," says Annica Carlshamre, a senior social worker for Gryning Health, a company that runs Solsidan, a home for all kinds of troubled children.When children witness violence or threats against a parent, their most significant connection in the world is ripped apart, the carers at Solsidan believe."Then the child understands - my mother can't take care of me," Carlshamre explains."And they give up hope, because they know they are totally dependent on the parent.When that happens, to where or what can the child turn?"We have an expectation that they want to live, and all their abilities are still there Clara Ogren, Solsidan That family connection must be re-built, but first the child must begin to recover, so Solsidan's first step is to separate the children from their parents."We keep the family informed about their progress, but we don't let them talk because the child must depend on our staff.Once we have separated the child, it takes only a few days, until we see the first signs that, yes, she's still there" All conversations about the migration process are banned in front of the child.The children get up every day.They have day clothes and night clothes, and experienced staff like Clara Ogren, help them colour or draw by holding their hands to grip a pencil."We play for them until they can play on their own.And we goof around a lot and dance and listen to music.We want to bring all their senses to life.So we might take a little bit of Coca Cola, and put it in their mouth so they taste something sweet.Even if they are tube-fed, we put them in the kitchen so they smell food," she says."We have an expectation that they want to live, and all their abilities are still there, but they just forgot or lost the sense of using them.This work takes a lot of energy because we have to live for the children until they start to live on their own."The longest time it took for a child to recover was six months.Often the children will have no contact with their parents until they are able to talk to them on the phone.Of the 35 children Calshamre has met over the years, one of them got permission to stay in Sweden while still at Solsidan.The others recovered before their asylum status was assured.A book - The Way Back - has recently been published about Solsidan, but its work is not well-known.Could this kind of treatment help Sophie?Twenty months is a very long time for a child of her age to be disengaged from the world.What do her parents think will aid her recovery?"Maybe the new baby when it comes will help," says Sophie's father.Sophie's mother can only repeat what she has heard from the doctor."In order for Sophie to wake up, the doctor says she and her family should feel safe."Their biggest fear is that they will be deported back to where they came from, and that the men who drove them out will find them."They promised they will kill us.There is nothing more devastating that can happen."In order to protect the family's identity, Sophie's name has been changed Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.
Why opioids are such an American problem:::::Image copyright Getty Images When it comes to taking opioids, the United States has the dubious honour of leading the world.For every one million Americans, almost 50,000 doses of opioids are taken every day.That's four times the rate in the UK.There are often good reasons for taking opioids.Cancer patients use them for pain relief, as do patients recovering from surgery (codeine and morphine are opioids, for example).But take too many and you have a problem.And America certainly has a problem.In two years, the town of Kermit in West Virginia received almost nine million opioid pills, according to a congressional committee.Just 400 people live in Kermit.Nationally, opioids killed more than 33,000 people in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That figure includes deaths from heroin, an illegal opioid.But almost half involved a prescription opioid - that is, a painkiller available from a pharmacy with a note from a doctor.So why does America - more than any country in the world - have an opioid problem?There is more than one cause.But these are some of the most important.American doctors prescribe - a lot Unlike most European countries, the US does not have universal healthcare paid for by taxes.Instead, Americans must get their own insurance - usually via an employer or the government."Most insurance, especially for poor people, won't pay for anything but a pill," says Professor Judith Feinberg from the West Virginia University School of Medicine."Say you have a patient that's 45 years old.They have lower back pain, you examine them, they have a muscle spasm."Really the best thing is physical therapy, but no one will pay for that.So doctors get very ready to pull out the prescription pad."Even if the insurance covers physical therapy, you probably need prior authorisation (from the insurer) - which is a lot of time and paperwork."The CDC says opioid prescriptions have fallen by 18% from their peak in 2010.But the total is still three times higher than in 1999.'I saw this drug on TV' The US and New Zealand are the only countries that allow prescription drugs to be advertised on television.According to the research firm Kantar, spending on advertising by pharmaceutical companies in the US reached $6.4 billion in 2016 - a rise of 64% since 2012.None of the 10 most-advertised brands in 2016 was an opioid.But mass-marketing of drugs has an effect, says Professor Feinberg."As a clinician, people will come and say 'I saw this on TV - can you give me this drug'."Sometimes they were so confused, they were already on the drug - they were using the brand name, where I used the generic name."In 2015, the American Medical Association called for a ban on adverts for prescription drugs.It didn't happen.Three months later, the extent of America's opioid culture was seen at half-time of the Superbowl - the country's most expensive advertising slot.A 60-second ad was devoted to opioid-induced constipation.The advert - paid for by AstraZeneca - advised sufferers to visit their doctor and "ask about prescription treatment options".President Obama's chief of staff was not impressed.Gifts to doctors In the US, it is common for drug companies to court doctors, in an effort to promote their products."When you're a doctor in the US, these detailing people (salespeople) come in from the industry," says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University."They are invariably smooth, friendly, attractive, sharply dressed, adorable, they're giving out gifts to everybody.They host dinners, they sponsor conferences, they sponsor junkets."That is going to affect prescribing."For the past four years, the US government has published the amounts paid by drug and device companies to doctors and teaching hospitals.The total in 2016 was more than $8bn.More than 630,000 physicians had payment records.For example, Purdue Pharma - which makes OxyContin, a popular opioid painkiller - made almost 80,000 transactions in 2016, worth more than $7m in total.In 2016, a study looked at the link between doctors, the free meals they received from drug companies, and the medication they prescribed.The study found receiving free meals was "associated with an increased rate of prescribing the promoted brand-name medication".Pharmaceutical companies say their reps are merely sharing information with doctors.But Professor Humphreys says there is a "corrupting" influence."We need a pharma industry, it's not that it's wrong," he says."But you can't let the fox guard the hen house."I would create completely clear blue water between the people that manufacture drugs and all the training and operation of the healthcare system."Pharmaceutical companies also spend money on health care workers and organisations in other countries.In the UK in 2016, companies gave 116m ($153m) to health workers and organisations for non-research and development in 2016.But, although the UK figure is 7% higher than in 2015, it is less than 2% of the amount paid in the US.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The grandparents' burden: 'We don't resent the kids - but life's hard' Poor training Dr Richard Frank is professor of health economics at Harvard Business School, and served in the Health Department from 2009 to 2016, during President Obama's administration.He thinks medical training in the US has not been good enough."Physicians have received almost no training in pain management," he says."Until recently they have been under some pretty important misconceptions about how addictive various products are."He adds: "A couple of years ago I testified before congress when I was in government.One of the representatives, before going into congress, was a thoracic surgeon."He noted that he had gotten almost no training in pain management - and what he had learned came entirely from the nursing staff he worked with."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The heroin-ravaged city in West Virginia fighting back against drug companies Dr Frank says medical training isn't the only reason for America's opioid problem."There's plenty of blame to go round," he says.But his criticism is echoed by Professor Judith Feinberg."Doctors didn't learn anything about addiction at medical school," she says."That is now changing, but everyone who's a doctor already, didn't learn anything.I learned about opioid drugs in the part of pharmacology where we learned about anaesthesia."Probably the whole topic of anaesthesia-like drugs was two hours.People don't have much knowledge about opioids.There was no curriculum that includes addiction."Bad science?In 1980, Dr Hershel Jick wrote a short letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.It said that "despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals, the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of addiction".The claim has been debunked, and the letter now carries an online warning note.But Dr Jick's letter had a big impact.This year, Canadian researchers said the letter had been cited 600 times - usually to claim opioids weren't addictive.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis" In the late 1990s the Veterans Health Administration - which runs healthcare for military veterans - pushed for pain to be recognised as the "fifth vital sign".This gave pain equal status with blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.Then in 2001, the Joint Commission - which certifies almost 21,000 US health organisations and programmes - established standards for pain assessment and treatment.In 2016, the JC released a statement that claimed that "everyone is looking for someone to blame" for the opioid problem.It insisted that its 2001 standards did not "require the use of drugs to manage a patient's pain".But Professor Feinberg says the VHA and JC's moves meant doctors were under pressure to prescribe strong painkillers - such as opioids - when they may not have been necessary."By the time you reach middle age, it's a rare person who doesn't ache somewhere," she says.She adds that - in a country where patients rate their doctors, and low ratings can affect doctors' earnings - the score can be influenced by whether patients receive opioids.A culture of medication Some Americans, says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University, believe that life is "fixable"."I'm 51," he says."If I go to an American doctor and say 'Hey -

Abortion stories: From a 'sense of relief' to a 'broken heart':::::Image caption Many women find it hard to talk about abortion One in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime, yet it is rarely talked about.For some, making the decision can be traumatic and have a long-lasting effect.For others, it is an empowering, life-changing choice.You have been sharing your experiences of abortion with us 50 years after the 1967 Abortion Act was passed.'I felt relieved, buoyant and really happy' Louise in London: "When I was 23 I found out I was pregnant.I have never regretted having an abortion.It helped cement my views on not wanting children."At first I put my lack of period down to stress.It felt like I had really bad PMT.Then one day at work I had to lie on the floor because I was so tired.I wondered what was wrong with me, and then the penny dropped."I took a pregnancy test in my lunch hour.As soon as I saw the positive result I remember violently shaking.I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time."A colleague who'd been trying to get pregnant was beaming when I told her.When I said it wasn't a good thing for me, she was wonderful.She just gave me a hug."My partner left me to deal with everything on my own.We never had a proper conversation about the abortion.My closest friends were supportive."My GP was matter-of-fact about it.I had two phone interviews with nurses before I went ahead.At no point did they ask me if I thought I was doing the right thing.I was certain.The procedure was excruciatingly painful because I chose not to have an anaesthetic, but it was brief."When I left, the stress I'd been feeling in the run-up to the procedure was gone.I felt relieved, buoyant and really happy."'It broke my heart' Beth (not her real name) lives in England: "I was 17 when I got pregnant and I had an abortion in February."I'm pregnant again now and this time I'm going to keep it and I'm excited about it."It was one Christmas, everyone was drinking and I just kept being sick.I thought it was because we were drinking but someone joked that I was pregnant and then I found out I was."My boyfriend didn't really say anything about it and let me make the decision about what to do.My mum was very relaxed and calm and said I should do what I wanted to do."But a lot of people kept telling me that I was too young and not ready to have a baby.I felt very pressured into having an abortion.It broke my heart."I had a breakdown soon afterwards because I was so upset.I felt I'd made the wrong decision but I couldn't do anything about it."My doctor gave me medication and counselling.I have already had depression and anxiety but this just made it worse."Now that I'm pregnant again, my mum and my boyfriend think I should make up my own mind."My baby is due in April and I'm really looking forward to it."Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The stress of making a decision can be overwhelming 'There needs to be education that abortion is OK' Harriet in South West England: "It was a bad experience but you learn from these things."I was 20 when I had an abortion."When I see my friends' kids or nephews I think that I could have had a three-month-old of my own now."When I first found out I was pregnant I was happy and very protective - I thought this is my baby and no one can take it away."My best friend's mum offered to help me and said that I was part of their family but I wanted my own family to say something like that."I didn't have much choice.My dad said it was up to me but he couldn't support me financially.It was true, he was just being honest.I felt it was selfish for me to have a child.A child should have the best upbringing possible."The father didn't want anything to do with it.I feel angry at him for putting me in the position he did.It was like I was forced into a corner and not able to have this baby because I couldn't afford it."It was very upsetting waking up from the anaesthetic.I was over three months so had to have a surgical procedure.It was awful.I woke up wanting to know what had happened to my body, but also not wanting to know."I was crying all the time and now I feel this is what I've done to my first child."The NHS gave me lots of support and lots of time to reconsider.There needs to be education that abortion is OK and it's a woman's choice but there also has to be more support."There is so much stigma attached to it."Advice and information about abortion Marie Stopes UK Life British Pregnancy Advisory Service Brook Sexual health charity FPA Produced by Annie Flury and Sherie Ryder

part.I couldn't love her any more if I tried.IVF is so painful and expensive."My husband has two children from a previous marriage so we did not receive any free treatments, which I don't agree

Reality Check: How much could NHS recover from foreign patients?:::::The claim: The NHS could recover between 200m and 500m annually from foreign patients if a system of charging them in advance for non-emergency care worked perfectly.Reality Check verdict: The NHS recovered 358m in 2016-17 and 500m is the government's target for 2017-18.The NHS may struggle to meet that target, but it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be recouped by a perfect system.NHS hospitals in England now have to charge patients from overseas up front for non-emergency care if they are not entitled to free treatment.Dr Mark Porter, from the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 5 live in February 2017 that the amount that could be recovered if the charging system worked perfectly was between 200m and 500m a year.He went on to say that was not very much money in the context of NHS spending and deficits, bearing in mind that the NHS budget in England was 116.4bn in 2015-16.A report - based on 2013 figures - estimates that treating all visitors and migrants in England (not only in hospitals) costs the NHS about 2bn, although it warns there is considerable uncertainty about that figure.That includes treating tourists who become ill while on holiday and longer-term migrants who have paid surcharges on their visas to be entitled to NHS care.Not all of that 2bn could be recovered.Treatment in A&E, for example, is free for everyone up to the point when a patient is either admitted to hospital or given an outpatient appointment.The government does recoup some of the 2bn, although not as much as it would like.It has a target to recoup 500m of the cost of treating overseas visitors by 2017-18.It has made considerable progress towards that goal, increasing the amount recouped from 97m in 2013-14 to 358m in 2016-17.A big proportion of that increase, 210m of it, has come from a health surcharge that must be paid by most students and temporary migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) applying for visas to come to the UK for more than six months.Missing the target Patients from inside the EEA with EHIC cards are generally treated free, with the government applying to their home countries to cover the cost.Those from elsewhere in the world who are not covered by the health surcharge will be charged for the cost of their treatment.Trusts are now allowed to charge 150% of the cost of treatment to patients from outside the EEA.The NHS has not been particularly good at recouping the costs in the past because trusts have not been good at identifying which patients should be charged for their treatment and it is difficult to collect money from patients living outside the EEA once they have returned home.The authorities have also not been particularly good at recouping the costs of treating people from EEA countries.This report from the National Audit Office from October 2016 said that on current trends the NHS would not manage to recover 500m a year by 2017-18, although that was before the announcement of the change to the rules so that non-urgent care must be paid for upfront.The NAO estimated that trusts only manage to recover about half of the amount they invoiced overseas patients.The Department of Health estimated that in 2012-13 the potentially recoverable amount was 367m, but it excluded from that figure the estimated cost of between 100m and 300m for a combination of people who had travelled to England purely to receive urgent treatment and regular visitors who are described as "taking advantage" of the system by registering for GP services and other NHS services to which they are not entitled.All of these figures are estimates.Looking at the bottom end of the range, 200m is too low a figure as it is considerably less than is currently being collected.At the top end, 500m is the government's target - it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be collected by a perfect system.This article was originally published on 6 February 2017 and updated on 23 October 2017 with the 2016-17 figures for the amount recouped.Dr Mark Porter ended his term as chair of the BMA in June 2017.Find other Reality Checks here
Chris Kirkland: Former England goalkeeper on dealing with his anxiety:::::Media playback is not supported on this device 'I was in a very dark dark place' - Chris Kirkland on anxiety & depression "I used to think, 'How can you do that to your family?How can you leave them?'After what I have gone through, I can see how it leads to that road and it is scary."Chris Kirkland realised the ambitions of thousands of youngsters by playing in the Premier League and representing his country.But, after leaving Wigan Athletic in 2012, the former Coventry City and Liverpool goalkeeper started to struggle with crippling anxiety.Five years after his battle with depression began, Kirkland, now 36, tells BBC Sport how it affected him and his family.'They lost their husband and dad' Kirkland spent 17 seasons playing professional football, before announcing he was taking time away from the game in August 2016, shortly after joining Bury.The 6ft 6in goalkeeper is a husband to wife Leeona and father to daughter Lucy.It had gone too far.The four years, looking back now, I can't really remember a lot about it.It was just...I wasn't there for Lucy or Leeona.They lost their husband and their dad for four years, which hurts now, really hurts now.That's why I knew I had to do something because I didn't want my daughter growing up without a dad.Me and Leeona have been together for 18 years, she is a wonderful wife and mother.She is the perfect role model and luckily our daughter has taken after her mum.She is great.I knew I had to do something.The way I was going, I was worried where it was going to lead to.My wife was a rock.Until a couple of years ago, she didn't really know the extent of it.I was ashamed, not so much ashamed, but your mind takes over yourself.You are not thinking rationally.You are not really thinking.You are just in a dark cloud.Everything just goes by you.You are dismissive of everything.You don't want to go out.You try to stay in.I even stopped walking the dog, which I have always done.I just felt as though everyone was looking at me when I was out.I just wanted to stay in the house, lock the door, shut the gate and not let anyone in.I put my phone on silent.I didn't call people back.I didn't reply to texts.Normal life just wasn't there anymore for me.I was in this different place and it is not a nice place to be.'A vicious circle' Kirkland, who won his sole England cap in 2006, started his career at Coventry City, before earning a move to Liverpool and then Wigan Athletic, where he played more than 100 times for the Latics.In 2012, however, the goalkeeper signed for Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.It was after that move Kirkland says his anxiety began to take hold.I never wanted to leave Wigan.I loved it there, loved the club.It is local to me as well.I started to struggle with anxiety when I was travelling over to Sheffield Wednesday.I have always been a home person.My family lived in Leicester, Leeona's family lived in Scotland.We have always been together.When I was away from the house I started to panic and started to struggle.Andy Rhodes, the goalkeeping coach at Sheffield Wednesday, if it wasn't for him I would have walked a long time ago.I was playing, which made it a little bit easier because for 90 minutes I managed to put it to one side.Looking back now, it was hard to do it, but you just do.You get through it.I really started struggling during those three years.In the end, I had to leave.I was going to sign again.I was going to sign for another year.They wanted me to stay.I was in my training kit.I was in the gym.I was ready to go upstairs and start the first day of pre-season and just thought 'I can't do it any more'.I didn't tell them.I just told them I needed to be closer to home.I think Andy Rhodes knew, but the club were just a little bit unsure.They told me to take my time and to give it a couple of weeks.I just knew it was the right thing to do.I just wanted to get home at that point.I just wanted to be in the house and shut the door.That is unfortunately the way it went.I didn't want to do anything.I wanted to shut myself off.My head was just...I couldn't think straight.I couldn't wait to get to sleep at night to have a little bit of clear mind.But when I woke up in the morning, it all started again.It was just a vicious circle.'It all escalated - you are not thinking rationally' Kirkland spent six years at Wigan between 2006 and 2012 The night before I started thinking 'I have to be up at this time, I have to travel over, what if there is traffic, what if this and that, what if something comes up after training and we all have to go somewhere and I can't get home.If I leave after a certain time I will hit the traffic and it could take me how long to get home'.Then obviously staying over before matches, which I tried to limit as much as I could.But getting home on Fridays, everyone knows the traffic on Fridays is a nightmare.It all escalated.But you are not thinking straight.You are not being rational.Everything is blown up.It sounds silly but everything is blown up out of proportion because you are not thinking rationally.You just start overthinking everything.Worrying about everything - 'when am I going to get a day off so I can get home'.Sheffield Wednesday were unbelievable.They came up with a routine.Without Andy Rhodes I would have walked - I did initially.I signed at the back end of the 2012 season, so I had all June before pre-season.I went back pre-season and I was going to walk.I rang Andy and said I had to sort one or two things out at home.I told them I had a family issue.But then I went back and they bent over backwards for me.I am glad they did because I had a fantastic three years there, playing wise, apart from what was going on off the pitch.'How far was I from where Gary Speed was?'In November 2011, shortly before Kirkland started his own battle with depression, former Wales midfielder Gary Speed was found dead at his home at the age of 42.The way I was, I was in a bad, bad place.I started thinking how far was I from where Gary Speed was?How was he feeling?I never attempted anything, it never got to that.The most I can say is it probably got to the point where I couldn't wait to get to sleep and I didn't want to wake up in the morning because it all started again.But I don't think that means I wanted to do anything.It just means when I was asleep that was the only time... Getting to sleep was a problem but when I got to sleep you are dozing away.But waking up was not good.So when did Kirkland begin to realise he had to do something about his anxiety?It was when we lost a dear friend of the family, Callum.We had been on holiday with them before.We went to America.It was about 2012.The families were close knit.He had a blood clot on his leg and it all progressed from there.We lost him.I was driving up to York to say a final goodbye and he died when I was on the way up.I never got chance to say goodbye to him, which was hard.I didn't realise just how good a friend he was until he was gone.But it was too late.Seeing the way his family struggled with losing him made me wake up and realise that I didn't want my daughter and my wife to have to go through that.'I rang one night crying my eyes out on the bed' Kirkland turned down an offer to stay at Sheffield Wednesday after three years with the club After a spell at Preston, Kirkland joined Bury in June 2016 on a one-year contract.Things came to a head when the club were away in Portugal for pre-season.I just had to get home.My wife had a hospital appointment.It was nothing serious, I didn't need to be there, but we used it as an excuse to get me home.I just rang one night crying my eyes out on the bed where we were staying saying 'I need to get home'.The manager Dave Flitcroft and Bury were brilliant.The club were fantastic.They gave me a couple of weeks.I wanted to give it a go so I went back.After the third day, I have said it, we were in a little five-a-side and I just wasn't there.I wasn't bothered.I didn't even try, I was that low.I went in and said I need a break, I need to get away.I need help.'I can see light now' That is when I met Simon Barker at the PFA and he put me in touch with Micky Bennett, the PFA's head of player welfare, and it all started from there.Now things are good.It is still an ongoing process but I can see light now.You have got to speak, you have got to talk.Whether it is to the PFA or someone at your club.We are here to try and get more people into clubs to help players.But you have to talk.There are a lot of players, that is why we are doing it.I am sure there is a lot we don't know about as well.It is not just sportspeople, it is people in general.You have got to talk because we have seen what can happen unfortunately, with people taking their own lives.I have seen how it leads to that.Before, 10 or 15 years ago, I used to think 'how can you do that to your family?How can you leave them?'After what I have gone through, I can see how it leads to that road and it is scary.'Once I started talking things seemed a lot clearer' It's ok to talk, don't be ashamed, don't be embarrassed.You'll always get some people who mock you but those people are cowards and should be ashamed of themselves.Make sure you talk.Once I started talking things seemed a lot clearer and there are people there who will help you.I think football realised they have a massive problem on their hands.Enough wasn't being done before, no.The PFA have admitted that.But now they are putting measures in place to make sure the help is there for players.They know they have a big, big problem in the game and they're doing their best now to sort it out.Having seen the positive reaction Kirkland has had to his own story, does he wish he had spoken out sooner?Absolutely, yes.But you are not thinking straight, your mind is not your own.It needed that something to click in.But until it does click in, you are not functioning right at all.You are not living.
Check NHS cancer, A&E and operations targets in your area:::::The NHS is under unprecedented pressure.Rising numbers of patients need hospital care - whether in an accident and emergency department, for cancer treatment or for planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements.For each there are strict targets local services are expected to meet across the UK.But what are the chances of being seen in time where you live?Use our interactive tracker to find out.Sorry, your browser is unable to display this content.Please upgrade to a more recent browser.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search Inspection rating: 1.A&E Target hit Target not hit 2.Cancer care Target hit Target not hit 3.Planned ops & care Target hit Target not hit Figures are assessed against targets before rounding Other Trusts When was the target last hit?Other Trusts When was the target last hit?Other Trusts When was the target last hit?If you can't see the tracker, click or tap here.Waits for cancer care, A&E and ops worsen How the NHS Tracker works This guide uses the latest published data on performance against three key NHS waiting-time measures: A&E treatment cancer care planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements This data is currently published either monthly or quarterly depending on where you live in the UK, and there are differences between how the targets are measured in each part of the UK.See below for data sources.The A&E target The way the A&E target is measured is almost identical.In each case services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat and discharge or admit or transfer a patient.They are all expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved.There are also slight differences in the way the start time is measured.The cancer target There are similarities in the way cancer care is measured.Each expects patients to be treated within 62 days of an urgent referral.In Scotland this can be following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route.So for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the area to focus on as this is the most common route.Again the thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.The planned operations and care target The one that varies the most is for planned hospital care, which is also known as non-emergency treatment.In England, Wales and Scotland the target measures the point at which you get a referral from your GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole patient journey.In Scotland and England services have 18 weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient journey.The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when that treatment starts.It therefore does not include the tests and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks or even months.Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to achieve this target.The thresholds vary too.None is expected to achieve these goals 100% of the time.In Northern Ireland services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.How local is defined In England data is provided down to individual hospital trust level, some of these run more than one hospital.The BBC has excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children's care, women's services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused on the 135 general hospital trusts - what most people would consider their local service.Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland.They are in charge of services for a region or large city and often run more than one hospital.We have chosen these boards because while some data is provided down to individual hospital level it is not done across all three targets.How far back performance is tracked The BBC has tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target was set or to when the records allow.When a target has been missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.When targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month they were last hit.There are only two targets where it has not been possible to go back five years: in Scotland for A&E as the target threshold was reduced from 98% to 95% in October 2014 in Northern Ireland for planned operations and care because its 13-week target threshold of 55% was set only in April 2016 The full list of dates from which the performance of local services is available are: For England: A&E: June 2010 Cancer: January 2009 Planned operations: April 2012 For Northern Ireland: A&E: April 2008 Cancer: April 2009 Planned operations: April-June 2016 For Scotland: A&E: October 2014 Cancer: January 2012 Planned operations: January 2011 For Wales: A&E: October 2009 Cancer: October-December 2009 Planned operations: September 2011 Research by the BBC data team, Ransome Mpini, John Walton, Christine Jeavans, Nick Triggle and William Dahlgreen.Design by Sumi Senthinathan.Development by Chris Ashton, Evisa Terziu, Becky Rush and Alvin Ourrad.Data sources
'I spent my savings rather than wait for the NHS':::::Hospital services are facing mounting pressure.Staff shortages, rising demand and a squeeze on budgets mean waiting times are rising in many places.And while the health service still sees most patients quickly - whether they turn up at an accident and emergency unit, need cancer treatment or have to have an operation - growing numbers are having to wait longer than they should.So what is it like for those caught up in the system?'I waited so long I gave up and spent most of my life savings' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Christine Moon, pictured here with her partner, Geoff, waited for months for a coronary bypass on the NHS Christine Moon, 66, was on holiday in Bali in 2015 when she started feeling chest pains.When she returned to her home in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, she went to see her GP and ended up in hospital having all number of tests on heart."Eventually, they said, 'I'm very sorry, but we've decided you have a 90% block in your coronary artery,'" she told BBC News.This was in August last year.She then waited until November to see a consultant, who said she needed a coronary bypass but there would be an additional 18-week wait.So, 18 weeks later, she rang the hospital."I was told they were way behind and they had absolutely no idea where I was on the waiting list," Ms Moon told BBC News."No-one at the hospital could tell me when I was likely to have my operation."Every week, patients in more critical need of a bypass were being referred to the hospital, effectively bumping her further down the queue, she said."I couldn't do any housework, I couldn't do stuff that I normally did.My symptoms were getting worse, but I wasn't going to have a heart attack."In April this year, 32 weeks after being diagnosed, she gave up on waiting and paid 16,000 to have the operation privately."I had to think long and hard about it, but it was really hanging over me," Ms Moon told the BBC."I was more and more depressed, and just not able to get an answer out of anyone."Having the operation had given her "bags of energy" and her life back, she said.But, she is angry and has spent much of her savings.Ms Moon told the BBC: "Eighteen weeks seems to be this magic number they come out with that is just lies."Would I still be on a waiting list if I had not gone privately?I may well have been."Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.'Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Holly has had many complex health conditions since she was a child Holly Wilson was nine years old when she started seeing doctors on a regular basis.She had a condition where her white blood cells infiltrated her bowel, causing inflammation and pain.Since then, the 22 year-old, from Chichester, has been in and out of hospital."The list is endless," she said, of the number of medical conditions that cause her day-to-day pain.Her entire body is affected, including her connective tissue, joints and gut, and once she had a cyst on her ovary "the size of a grapefruit"."At one point, I was in hospital 30 times in a year," Ms Wilson told the BBC."There are a lot of problems - I'm very, very complicated.I'm always known as the difficult, complex patient."She has noticed waiting times increase, and recently had to wait more than 10 hours for a medical slip to give to her employer to allow her to return to work.Her most recent medical issue is a fast heart rate and palpitations.Doctors are trying to diagnose what is causing it, but it can take up to 18 months between being referred for tests and getting the results."The long wait for this diagnosis - it's a lot of not really knowing, which makes it stressful," Ms Wilson told the BBC."Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes.""They're trying to see so many people in such a short amount of time."But Ms Wilson's three folders of medical history do not make this easy."Doctors look at all these notes, and they're just too much for one person to take them in," she said."I don't feel the notes are being read or paid attention to as much as they should be."Ms Wilson doesn't want to "bash the NHS"."They have done a lot for me.Without them I wouldn't be alive," she said."It's just frustrating as I have been in and out of hospital since I was very small and I have noticed the change."'My wait was so long I launched a formal complaint' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Andy Goble waited almost a year for an operation that would fuse his talonavicular joint Andy Goble, 48, had painful arthritis in his feet.He had one foot operated on and then, a couple of years later, in August 2016, doctors said they needed to operate on the other."The idea of the operation is to fuse two bones in the foot to stop them grinding together and stop the pain," he told the BBC.The condition means he struggles to walk any great distance and lives in continual pain.Even though he works from his home, in Southend-on-Sea, the condition has affected his work as a web designer."I am self-employed and find it impossible to work all day," he said."I am also unable to drive much of a distance if I need to visit clients."This is starting to cause me financial problems."The father of two has also had to take painkillers, which tire him out.He waited an "absolute age" to receive a date for the operation, which was then cancelled a week later.And in May, after many phone calls, he decided to launch a formal complaint."Then, all of a sudden, everyone jumps and gets involved," Mr Goble told the BBC.The hospital had "bent over backwards" to get the surgery done, he said, scheduling operations "at weird and wonderful times", with his taking place on a Sunday morning 15 weeks ago.He can now walk again, but his foot remains very painful as it recovers."Because it's not life threatening - it's just pain-relief surgery - you come bottom of the list," he said."It's always the lowest priority.""There is knock-on pain to other joints, such as the knee, hip and back.So, while you're waiting, the condition gets worse and affects your life more and more."'I waited almost six weeks for an urgent appointment when I had late-stage cancer' It was February 2014 when Susan Down, now 65, first thought something was wrong."It was quite sinister what I found, the lump," she told the BBC."I'd had it for quite a few weeks, and it was getting worse."She saw a GP, who gave her creams for piles.A couple of weeks later, when things hadn't improved, the GP gave her a referral for an emergency appointment.Despite it being deemed urgent, her local hospital wasn't as quick to respond as she had expected."I was quite anxious.I kept calling the hospital," Ms Down told the BBC.Five and a half weeks later, she got an appointment."Then they were running around like headless chickens," she said, giving her six different tests over the next fortnight.Her daughters and partner went with her to the appointment.She was told she had stage-four anal cancer and that her tumour was 2.5cm (1in)."It hadn't metastasised, but it was very big and pushing it's way to the front," Ms Down told the BBC."If it had gotten right through to the front, I would've been poisoned."Her diagnosis caused her to retire from her job, as a support worker for adults with learning disabilities.It took a couple of months before she was fitted with a stoma, and then she had to wait a couple more months before she could get radiotherapy."The doctor said, 'Lets get on with it or else you will die,'" Ms Down told the BBC.The radiotherapy machine at her local hospital was not appropriate for her so she had to be treated in a specialist hospital in Hertfordshire, a two-hour drive from her home in Kent.She had six weeks of radiotherapy followed by two weeks of chemotherapy."At first they couldn't say it had shrunk, because it was so big," Ms Down told the BBC."But after a few months they said it as going in the right direction."Looking back I think, That was awful.'"Now, Ms Down spends half her week looking after her one-year-old granddaughter, Charlotte.She appears to be clear of cancer, but has long-term problems from the treatment.
