Child with cerebral palsy reportedly faces deportation after surgery:::::A 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, who has lived in the U.S. since she was 3 months old, is facing deportation to Mexico after being discharged from a Corpus Christi, Texas, childrens hospital where she recently underwent gallbladder surgery.Rosamaria Hernandez, who is undocumented, was transported to Driscoll Childrens Hospital on Tuesday and followed by Customs and Border Protection agents from a nearby immigration checkpoint, the Caller-Times reported.The girl's adult cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, escorted her to the hospital, the paper reported.A border patrol spokesman told the New York Daily News that the girl and her cousin approached the primary inspection lane at a border checkpoint east of Laredo, Texas.Due to her medical condition, Border patrol agents escorted her and her cousin to the hospital.The New York Times reported that the agents waited outside her hospital room until she was released.Their orders are to process her, Leticia Gonzalez, her San Antonio-based associate, told the paper.At this point, our argument to (immigration agents) is.'There is a doctors directive, why arent you following it?'The agency told the newspaper in a statement that the girl's situation does not make her exempt from enforcement of the law.The statement reportedly said, Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly.The Mexican Consulate has been advised of the situation by Laredo Sector Border Patrol.The Times reported that family members said agents took the girl to a facility in San Antonio, 150 miles away from her home.The Times reported it was rare, if not unheard-of, for a child already living in the United States to be arrested particularly one with a serious medical condition.U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said in a tweet that a sick 10-year-old girl should not be a @dhsgov priority.
J. Edgar Hoover called Oswald killing 'inexcusable':::::Longtime FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said it was "inexcusable" that suspected JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was shot and killed before he could be fully interviewed.Hoover made the comment in what appeared to be a dictated aide-memoire dated on the afternoon of Nov. 24, 1963, hours after Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby.The memo was part of a cache of 2,891 documents released by the National Archives Thursday evening."[Oswald's death] will allow, I am afraid, a lot of civil rights people to raise a lot of hell because he was handcuffed and had no weapon," Hoover said."There are bound to be some elements of our society who will holler their heads off that his civil rights were violated -- which they were."Hoover said that the FBI had warned the Dallas police of threats to Oswald's life and that the city's police chief, Jesse Curry, had assured the bureau that Oswald would be properly protected."However," Hoover's memo reads, "this was not done."Oswald was being transferred to the Dallas County Jail when he was shot by Ruby, who stepped out from a crowd of onlookers and shot Oswald in the abdomen.Oswald died hours later at the same Dallas hospital where Kennedy had been pronounced dead two days earlier.Hoover said that an FBI agent was on standby at the hospital "in the hope that [Oswald] might make some kind of a confession before he died, but he did not do so."Hoover, who headed the FBI and its predecessor agency for 48 years, added that after Oswald's death he wanted "something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin."He suggested that "instead of a Presidential Commission, we can do it with a Justice Department report based on an FBI report."Hoover's suggestion was unheeded, as President Lyndon Johnson established the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination the following week.
Menendez corruption and bribery trial: What to know:::::As the corruption and bribery trial continues in New Jersey, Sen. Bob Menendez is getting a little help from his friends.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., arrived at the Newark courthouse Thursday morning to testify as a character witness for the Democratic senator, Grahams office confirmed.He will testify about his experiences with Menendez in the Senate, unrelated to the underlying charges, his office said.Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., has also appeared in support of Menendez, who is accused of accepting donations, trips and gifts from an eye doctor friend in exchange for pressuring government officials to act in ways that would be beneficial to that friends business interests.Menendez has maintained his innocence, and his defense unsuccessfully attempted to persuade U.S. District Judge William Walls to dismiss the case based on a 2016 Supreme Court ruling which outlined a stricter definition of what an official act is.The defense argued that the allegations against Menendez do not meet that narrower definition.But Walls allowed the case to continue seen as a huge win for prosecutors.Its the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.What is Menendez accused of?Menendez, 63, accepted a plethora of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.In return, Menendez used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgens business interests, according to prosecutors.Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf.Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.Melgen also paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.NBC NEWS CALLS MENENDEZ A REPUBLICAN IN CORRUPTION CASE REPORT Federal prosecutors said that Menendez sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldnt afford.The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.What is the senators defense?Both Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.Throughout the trial thus far, defense attorneys have sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.At times emotional, Menendez has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.What has happened in the trial so far?Defense attorney Raymond Brown got into a spat with U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls at the start of the trial.Brown accused Walls of being extremely prejudicial to the defense.Walls had denied Menendezs request that the trial be recessed during critical Senate votes, stating that his job should not be treated differently from that of a construction worker or cab driver.MENENDEZ CASE MAY IMPACT VOTES The trial has also focused on a meeting former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set up with Menendez and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a nearly $9 million Medicaid billing dispute.Sebelius testified in court this week that the incident was the first time in her role in government that she was asked by a senator to take a meeting with another senator.She said that Meglen wasnt specifically mentioned in the meeting but that she assumed his case was the topic.Prosecutors didnt call Reid to testify before it rested its case on Oct. 11.Walls declined to throw the case out despite the defenses objections that the accusations against Menendez didnt fit the narrow definition of bribery that was a result of a 2016 Supreme Court decision.Booker and Graham appeared as character witnesses for Menendez Thursday in court; Booker has attended the hearing to support his colleague before."In very difficult circumstances he always keeps his word," Graham, said during his testimony."A handshake is all you need from Bob.He's a very honest, hardworking senator."Menendez was emotional when he was asked by reporters about his colleagues support.Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S. During that case, prosecutors argued that Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, robbed Medicare of as much as $105 million, according to the newspaper.His sentencing has been delayed until after this trial.WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.What happens if Menendez is convicted?If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov.Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.Vice President Mike Pence has said that it would be "altogether inappropriate and wrong" for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate.However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didn't resign.Menendez is up for reelection next year.He was selected to replace former Gov.Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005.Fox News Tara Prindiville and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump makes rare reference to late brother Fred in opioid speech:::::President Trump made a rare and personal reference to his older brother Fred Trump Jr. Thursday as he declared the opioid crisis in America a public health emergency.Fred Trump was a former pilot who suffered from alcoholism.He died in 1981 at age 43 due to complications from the disease.When describing how his administration plans to initiate a "massive" advertising campaign to try and convince younger Americans to avoid drugs, President Trump talked about how his brother told him to stay away from alcohol."I had a brother, Fred, great guy," Trump said."Best looking guy, best personality.Much better than mine.""But he had a problem," Trump continued."He had a problem with alcohol.And he would tell me don't drink.Don't drink.""I listened to him and I respected him.But he would constantly tell me don't drink.He would also add dont smoke.But he would say it over and over and over again," Trump said as families affected by the opioid crisis watched on."And to this day, I've never had a drink."Trump has rarely spoken about his older brother, who was his best man at his first wedding with Ivana.Even during the 2016 presidential race -- when the issue of addiction and the opioid epidemic was front and center on the campaign trail -- Trump would seldom mention his brother's battle with alcohol addiction.But as president, Trump has been impassioned to confront the issue of addiction, especially the opioid crisis, head on.Trump drew inspiration from his personal experience with his brother, according to a senior White House official, who said the president has also brought up his sibling when discussing the topic with senior staff.In an interview with the Daily Mail in 2015, Trump told the British publication that "it just broke my heart the way (Fred) died.It was ridiculous, if you think about it.He had so much in front of him.""This is why I don't drink, ever.I just don't do it, Trump said.Fred told me not to, and I saw what happened to him when he didn't follow his own advice.According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, nearly 90,000 Americans die each year from alcohol-related causes.
About 2,800 JFK records released, others withheld:::::The White House released 2,800 classified files related to former President John F. Kennedys assassination on Thursday, but said it would temporarily keep some "sensitive" records under wraps.The records are available at www.archives.gov.Click here to view them.A senior administration official told reporters some sensitive documents are being held for 180 days due to concerns from some intelligence agencies.Those documents, an official said, are being reviewed by the agencies to determine whether they actually affect national security."I have no choice -- today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation's security," the president wrote in a memo released by the White House on Thursday evening ahead of the release.The president said he is ordering agencies to review each and every one of those redactions over the next 180 days.At the end of that period, I will order the public disclosure of any information that the agencies cannot demonstrate meets the statutory standard for continued postponement of disclosure, Trump wrote.JFK ASSASSINATION FILES SET FOR RELEASE, BUT WHAT THEY REVEAL REMAINS A MYSTERY Under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, the government is required to release the final batch of files on the assassination, which happened in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.These secret files have long fueled rumors and speculation that gunman Lee Harvey Oswald wasnt the only person involved in Kennedys murder.A CIA spokesperson told Fox News that the agency had released all but 18,000 of its more than 87,000 documents related to the assassination and promised that the outstanding records would be made available.The spokesperson added that some of the remaining documents contained redactions that "were undertaken with the intent to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security -- including the names of CIA assets and current and former CIA officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today."Almost immediately after the Warren Commission in 1964 ruled that Oswald had been the lone gunman, conspiracy theories started to circulate over whether he had been the only shooter and whether the CIA had been involved in the Kennedy assassination.But before investigators were able to fully question Oswald, the former U.S. Marine was shot and killed on Nov. 24, 1963, by Texas nightclub owner Jack Ruby adding more fuel to the speculative fire that the U.S. government was hiding what it knew about the assassination.The subsequent report by the Warren Commission, which was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, did little to quell either the rumors that Oswald was killed to cover up a government conspiracy or the doubts that a lonely, alienated gunman could have fired such accurate and rapid shots.The 1992 act, which was signed by President George H.W.Bush and required the government to release the remaining documents within 25 years time, also stipulated that the president is the only person who can stop any of the documents from being released.Fox News Serafin Gomez, Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Where are the moderates on Capitol Hill?:::::Many of the most popular Democrats on Capitol Hill are progressives.So what happened to all the moderates?Democratic leaders believe Republicans are exploiting the district-drawing process known as gerrymandering."I think the reason that we've lost some more moderate members of the Democratic caucus is due to really unfair Republican gerrymandering," the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Spokesperson Meredith Kelly tells Fox News.As the DCCC tries to flip the House in 2018, Kelly believes Republican retirements give them an edge."There's a number of common themes with the types of people that are retiring," Kelly said of the seven Republicans who plan to retire."I'm not willing to call them moderate, but they're at least people that are pragmatic and value compromise."One of the Republicans who won't run again: Rep Charlie Dent, R-Pa. Dent believes primary voters now value candidates friendly with the Commander in Chief over candidates eager to reach across the aisle."The litmus test prior to Donald Trump was purists vs. pragmatists," Dent said."That was the litmus test.Now it's about loyalty to the President.That's what's changed."The National Republican Campaign Committee chairman, Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, dismisses any talk about Republican infighting."Everybody works well and plays well together as a team," said Stivers.Stivers is also downplaying the significance of Republican retirements, insisting most have been for "personal reasons".The once powerful "Blue Dog Coalition," of moderate Democrats has seen their membership dwindle from several dozen, to just 18 members.One member of the group in this Congress warns that extreme viewpoints are counterproductive."Every time you have extremes, you get pulled to the side and it prevents you from finding a solution," said Rep Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J.But Gottheimer has a solution to get bills moving faster through the Congress: beer."We do a bunch of meetings with just 20, 30, 40 members in the room late at night and you know, someone gets some beer and tacos and everyone relaxes and just digs in on the issue," said Gottheimer."I think that's actually how you're supposed to govern."
Fox News Poll: Changing concerns on US security:::::Americans perceptions of national security threats have changed dramatically.A new Fox News poll of voters nationwide finds: -The number that sees rogue nations like North Korea as the greatest threat to the U.S. has nearly tripled in less than a year.-Worries about a nuclear attack on the U.S. have jumped dramatically.-The perceived danger posed by terrorist groups has dropped significantly.READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS.Here are more details on the poll, released Thursday: The largest number of voters, 33 percent, says rogue nations like North Korea and Iran pose the biggest threat to national security.Thats nearly three times as many who felt that way in January (12 percent).At that time, a majority said the greatest threat was terrorist groups like ISIS.But the number picking terrorist groups as the greatest threat has dropped by nearly half: from 51 percent to 27 percent today.Since January, North Korea has conducted nearly 40 missile tests or launches and fired off a long-range missile, while President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have traded insults.At the same time, Trump has threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement, while major progress was made in defeating the terrorist group ISIS in Raqqa.Opinion has also shifted on which type of attack poses the most immediate threat to the countrys security.Today, 38 percent say cyberattacks, 26 percent terrorist attacks, and 17 percent nuclear attacks.The number citing cyberattacks is up 3 points since January, and those pointing to nuclear attacks increased by 7 points.But the percentage saying terrorist attacks dropped 17 points.Meanwhile, when asked which poses a bigger threat here in the United States, 53 percent of voters say a shooting by an American citizen, while 27 percent say a terrorist attack by an Islamic terrorist.An October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left nearly 500 people injured and 58 dead happened at the hands of an American citizen whose motive is yet unknown.There have been no confirmed ISIS-inspired attacks in the United States this year.By a 23-point margin, voters give the Trump administration negative ratings for its response to the Las Vegas shooting: 34 percent excellent/good vs. 57 percent fair/poor.President Trumps ratings on handling North Korea are underwater by a 24-point margin (35 percent approve vs. 59 percent disapprove).On Iran, its a net negative by 21 points (34-55 percent).The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,005 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-24, 2017.The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.
Fox News Poll: Positive views of NFL down 18 points since 2013:::::The National Football League is taking some hits these days.A new Fox News Poll finds that since 2013, the leagues favorable rating has dropped 18 points.Today, 46 percent of voters have a positive view of the N.F.L.while 41 percent view it negatively.Four years ago (the last time the question was asked), 64 percent had a positive view of the league and 19 percent were critical.READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS.If the NFL were a political candidate, alarm bells would be going off in campaign headquarters, says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Pollster Daron Shaw.The downward shift on favorability comes mainly from Republicans (-37 points), whites (-23 points), men (-23 points), and independents (-14 points).Majorities of Democrats and nonwhites continue to have a favorable view of the N.F.L, yet theres also a drop in favorability among these groups.Positive sentiment among Democrats is down 6 points (66 percent in 2013 to 60 percent now) while among nonwhites it is down 3 (64-61 percent).N.F.L.Commissioner Roger Goodell made clear in an October 10 letter to team executives that the league thinks everyone should stand for the National Anthem.Americans, however, are increasingly more likely to think kneeling is an appropriate form of protest.Forty-four percent think kneeling during the national anthem is appropriate, up from 41 percent who felt that way last month and 32 percent who said so last September.Sill, a majority thinks it is inappropriate (52 percent).Most Republicans (88 percent inappropriate vs. 12 percent appropriate), baby boomers (61-33 percent), men (60-37 percent), and whites (60-38 percent) think kneeling during the national anthem is inappropriate.The opposite is true for Democrats (67 percent appropriate vs. 27 percent inappropriate), millennials (65-32 percent), and nonwhites (61-30 percent) who think kneeling is an apt form of protest.Women (50 percent appropriate vs. 45 percent inappropriate) and independents (46-50 percent) are more divided on the issue.Voters who have an unfavorable opinion of the N.F.L overwhelmingly think kneeling is inappropriate (78 percent), while those who view the NFL favorably think its appropriate (62 percent).The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,005 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-24, 2017.The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.
Fox News Poll: Support for Puerto Rican statehood increases in wake of Maria:::::By a narrow margin, more voters think Puerto Rico should become a state than think it should stay a territory.According to the latest Fox News Poll, 41 percent say Puerto Rico should become the 51st star on the flag.Thats an 11-point increase since the last time the question was asked in June 2007, when 30 percent opted for statehood.Some 37 percent think the island should continue as a territory, down 9 points from June 2007 (46 percent).Nine percent think Puerto Rico should declare independence.READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS.Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory for nearly 120 years.Residents of the island are officially U.S. citizens, but cannot vote for president and do not pay federal income taxes.Recent elections on the island have resulted in wins for pro-statehood advocates, but have been boycotted by those who prefer the status quo.The poll shows support for statehood is 16 points higher among Democrats (48 percent) than Republicans (32 percent).Hispanics prefer statehood over the current territorial status by 48 to 37 percent.The increase in support for statehood comes as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria.The category 4 storm hit September 20, destroying homes and critical infrastructure.President Trump visited Puerto Rico October 3, and last week graded his administrations response to the storm a 10 out of 10.But the poll finds voters are more skeptical: just 32 percent rate the administrations response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico as excellent or good.Twice as many, 64 percent, say the response was only fair or poor.The administration receives substantially better ratings for its response to hurricanes in Florida (49 percent excellent or good) and Houston (52 percent).The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,005 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-24, 2017.The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.
Sessions rails against federal judges who 'erode the rule of law' in blocking Trump policies:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday railed against federal judges for blocking Trump administration policies, arguing rulings have been driven by political views and not the interpretation of the law.The Constitution gives judges no right to veto a presidents actions because they disagree with him on policy grounds, Sessions said during a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington.Sessions, the nation's top law enforcement officer, cited a federal judge in Brooklyn who heard the arguments on a challenge to the federal governments winding down of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, immigration program.The judge, he said, called the governments position heartless.SESSIONS CLASHES WITH FRANKEN OVER RUSSIA CLAIM With respect: it is emphatically not the province or duty of courts to say whether a policy is compassionate, Sessions said.That is for the people and our elected representatives to decide.The courts role is to say what the law is.Added Sessions, A judges comments on policy like this are highly offensive, and disrespectful of the legislative and executive branches.He also spoke out against judges who issue nationwide injunctions, as has been done against the presidents travel ban.Today, more and more judges are issuing these lawless nationwide injunctions and in effect, single judges are making themselves super-legislators for the entire United States, he said.We have nearly 600 federal district judges in the United Stateseach with the ability to issue one of these overreaching nationwide orders.Sessions said the judiciary is not a superior or policy-setting branch but is co-equal.Those who ignore this duty and follow their own policy views erode the rule of law and create bad precedents and, importantly, undermine the public respect necessary for the courts to function properly, he said.Fox News Jake Gibson contributed to this report.
Trump declares the opioid epidemic a public health emergency:::::President Donald Trump on Thursday declared the nation's opioid epidemic a public health emergency, the first time since 2010 that the federal government has designated such an emergency nationwide.But the president stopped short of officially labeling the crisis -- which claimed the lives of 64,000 Americans in 2016 -- a state of national emergency."I'm officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law," Trump said at a White House event.Ending the epidemic "will require the resolve of our entire country," he said.Calling the crisis a "national shame and a human tragedy," Trump vowed to crack down on heroin imports from Mexico and fentanyl imports from China.He also pledged to use evidence-based addiction treatment, and to reduce drug use among young people through a national advertising campaign.The president also discussed his personal experience with addiction: Trump's brother, Fred Trump, died of complications from alcoholism."Fred was a great guy, and he would tell me, 'don't drink, don't drink.'He would constantly tell me this, over and over."Trump credits his brother's example with convincing him to never drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.Trump singled out China, which exports an incredibly strong opioid, fentanyl, which officials believe is responsible for thousands of deaths.Trump also said he would raise the issue of fentanyl exports with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to the country early next week.He also pledged to go after companies that produce and distribute certain opioids wholesale to "pill mill" medical practices."We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that have been hurting our communities," he said.In a move reminiscent of the war on drugs in the 1980s, Trump also said clever advertising could play a major role in discouraging young people from using drugs."Our most important thing is going to be really, really great advertising, so people don't start and don't have to go through these problems," he said.The designation of a public health emergency would expand the ways that individuals can get treatment for opioid addiction, which could particularly benefit people in rural areas.The emergency declaration would also free up public health emergency funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, and grant individual states more flexibility in how they use federal dollars, and allow them to direct more funds toward addiction treatment and prevention.Labor Department grants known as National Dislocated Worker Grants would also be available to workers who cite opiate addiction as the reason they're applying for the grants.Those grants are typically only available to victims of natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
Paul Ryan is confident he can sweeten tax reform to win over GOP holdouts:::::"The Ways and Means Committee will be putting out a specific plan very shortly, and they're going to work with all of our members to look at and consider and address these concerns," Ryan told reporters Thursday."I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with these members in particular to find a solution."Nearly all Republicans will get behind a bill to chop tax rates in an effort to spur economic growth.However, lawmakers have expressed concerns about other specific provisions in a tax framework released last month, most of which are intended to raise money.GOP leaders have called for scrapping state and local tax deductions, a popular provision that largely benefits high-tax blue states.Some lawmakers in the Northeast opposed the budget resolution, but they never truly imperiled its passage.Later Thursday, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, told reporters that a meeting with the Republicans in favor of state and local deductions did not yield a compromise."They made it clear.They need this problem solved before they vote 'yes' on tax reform," he said.Before the vote, the House Liberty Caucus, led by Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., also announced it would oppose what it called "wasteful" spending in the budget measure.The group raised concerns about deficits generated by it.The budget also allows for tax cuts to add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over a decade.Ryan on Thursday described the budget as "really important" to passing tax reform.It unlocks budget reconciliation, which allows the Senate to pass a plan with only a simple majority, or at least 50 of 52 GOP votes with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie.Ryan did not answer questions about whether the House would make other controversial tweaks to the tax code, like changing the popular 401(k) contribution benefit.He deferred specific policy questions to the House Ways and Means Committee, the chamber's chief tax-writing panel.Brady said the House will introduce a bill on Wednesday and start committee deliberations on Nov. 6.CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.
Billionaire Insys founder charged in US opioid bribe case:::::The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on charges that he participated in a scheme with other executives to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based cancer pain drug and to defraud insurers.John Kapoor, 74, who stepped down as chief executive of Insys in January, was charged with having engaged in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston.He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a previously filed case against six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, prosecutors said.Brian Kelly, Kapoor's lawyer, said in an email: "My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously."Insys, which has been in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the probe, declined to comment.Its stock price fell 4.56 percent to $7.08 in midday trading on Thursday.The charges marked a major escalation of the ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.Those probes have come amid a national opioid abuse epidemic.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015.The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a board member, stepped down in January as the company's chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently the chairman of drugmaker Akorn and president of investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises.According to the indictment, following the launch of Subsys in 2012, Kapoor and Babich grew dissatisfied with the drug's success in its initial three months on the market.It says they, with others, devised a scheme to pay bribes in the form of speaker fees and food and entertainment to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys and to increase the dosage and volume of existing prescriptions.They also sought to mislead and defraud insurers who were reluctant to approve payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.
New sanctions on North Korea announced by the Treasury Department:::::"Today's sanctions target the North Korean military and regime officials engaged in flagrant abuses of human rights.We also are targeting North Korean financial facilitators who attempt to keep the regime afloat with foreign currency earned through forced labor operations."The newly sanctioned parties include North Korean diplomats, military security officers and officials with state-owned construction companies.According to the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the DPRK's Military Security Command and two of its top officials, Jo Kyong-Chol and Sin Yong Il, will be put under sanction, as will Ri Thae Chol, the country's first vice minister of the Ministry of People's Security.The diplomats being sanctioned are Ku Sung Sop the consul general in Shenyang, China and Kim Min Chol, who works at the North Korean Embassy in Vietnam.The other targeted parties are connected to a system of North Korean construction companies that export labor overseas, often to work in slave-like conditions, the U.S. said.The country's External Construction Bureau and its director, Kim Kang Jin, will be sanctioned, as will the Ch'olhyo'n Overseas Construction Company.In September, the Treasury Department announced sanctions in against eight North Korean banks and 26 people linked to the country's financial networks.The actions come as the U.S. presses the communist dictatorship to end its nuclear weapons testing and missile launchings.
House narrowly passes budget, clearing the way for tax reform:::::Among the no votes from New York were Republican Reps. Peter King, Lee Zeldin, John Faso, Elise Stefanik and John Katko; noes from New Jersey included Reps. Frank LoBiondo, Tom MacArthur and Leonard Lance.These members hoped that by stalling the tax-reform process, they might gain enough leverage to protect a popular deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT write-off.The current GOP tax framework calls for eliminating the SALT deduction to help pay for the tax cuts.But this would likely have a disproportionate impact on middle-income taxpayers in places like New York, New Jersey and California, and as of late Wednesday, it was still unclear how many of the 30 Republicans who represent high-tax states would vote against the budget."Why should I vote for something that would end up decimating my district?"King told Reuters on Wednesday.Also among the no votes were some of the most fiscally conservative members of the House Republican caucus, who were concerned that the budget contained too much spending.Shortly before the vote, the House Liberty Caucus released a statement opposing the budget.With the budget vote out of the way, Republicans must now move on to the brass tacks phase of reforming the tax code.Shortly after the vote on Thursday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Calif., announced that a tax reform bill would be formally introduced on Wednesday, with a markup in his committee slated to begin Nov. 6."Today is a historic day, and we are ready to deliver tax relief that improves the lives of middle income Americans and struggling families who have been left behind in our slow-growing economy," Brady said in a statement.
The Fed chair contest is Trump's version of 'The Bachelor':::::Like pretty much every big personnel call in this White House, President Donald Trump has turned his selection of a Federal Reserve chair into a version of "The Bachelor" with everyone feverishly guessing who will get the role of leading the world's most important central bank.Trump has gone so far as to solicit advice from Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs in a televised interview."Tell me who your preference is," Trump asked Dobbs."I'd love to hear it.You could even cut it out if you want.You don't have to I would love to hear you.I only want that from people I respect."Dobbs went on to suggest keeping Janet Yellen, something that I'm told is at least somewhat attractive to Trump given that markets love the current chair and would likely react favorably to her status quo renomination.But a source who talks to the president regularly about the Fed and other economic matters tells me that while Trump does like Yellen, he is not going to renominate her because he wants to put his own mark on the central bank something the president also suggested to Dobbs.Just after this conversation, another senior source close to the Fed nomination process cautioned me not to rule Yellen or anyone else out."He changes his mind about it every day," this person said.But a consensus among people close to the process has emerged that the race is likely down to either current Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell or Stanford economist John Taylor.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh sparked increasing speculation after a meeting last week with Vice President Mike Pence.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing against Warsh and in favor of Powell, whom he got to know in recent months working on financial reform issues.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn has been mostly out of the running for weeks now both because of his clash with Trump over the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and because the president wants the former Goldman Sachs president to keep working on the high-stakes tax cut push.An announcement on the Fed chair pick could come any day, but sources close to the matter say it will most likely happen next week before the president departs for a 12-day trip to Asia.Even that is not assured, however.If Trump can't make up his mind, the announcement could wait until he gets back.The Senate needs to have hearings before the Banking Committee and a full vote prior to Yellen's term expiring on Feb. 3.Ideally, the process of sending up the next nominee would start soon.The Senate can move quickly when it wants to it's basically up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell so next week is really not a hard deadline for the president.The arguments favoring a Powell chairmanship include that it would allow Trump to install his own pick while also likely continuing the very modest approach to rate normalization and balance sheet drawdown initiated by the Yellen Fed.Taylor, while much more beloved by conservatives on the Hill and places like The Wall Street Journal editorial board, would present at least something more of a hawkish risk that might spark jitters on Wall Street.Some conservatives on Capitol Hill have led a behind-the-scenes campaign against Powell and in favor of Taylor or Warsh.But it's not clear that those efforts will produce results, especially given that Trump generally does whatever he wants with limited regard for what Republicans in Congress say.And Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is among the few on record arguing against Powell.Taylor won a straw poll when Trump met with Senate Republicans earlier this week and quizzed them on their Fed preference, but there is very little chance many would vote "no" if Trump actually sends up a Powell nomination.And Powell is a former banker rather than a wonky economist like Taylor, a style Trump tends to prefer in his nominees.So the betting line remains on Powell for chair and perhaps Taylor for vice chair, if he is willing.Heavy caveats continue to apply.Trump could change his mind at the last minute and turn the process on its head, possibly even electing to simply stick with Yellen, though that remains unlikely.The rose is still up for grabs.Ben White is Politico's chief economic correspondent and a CNBC contributor.He also authors the daily tip sheet Politico Morning Money [politico.com/morningmoney].Follow him on Twitter @morningmoneyben.
Trump apparently is having a hard time making up his mind for Fed chair:::::'Nobody has been ruled out' for Fed chair -Senior administration official 3:42 PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 02:58 The race to see who will lead the Federal Reserve in 2018 and beyond is becoming a process of elimination, with two and perhaps three candidates remaining.President Donald Trump apparently has solidified his thinking and is now choosing between Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor.However, several twists have been interjected into the equation."Trump changes his mind about it everyday," a source told Politico, according to a report posted Thursday.The site speculated that current Chair Janet Yellen remains in the mix because Trump is worried that removing her might disrupt the hardy stock market rally that has taken place since his election.The Dow industrials have surged more than 30 percent from the low just a couple days before the Nov. 8 election.However, one source reportedly close to Trump did tell Politico that Yellen was out of the race completely.The report adds further detail on how the process has unfolded.Former Governor Kevin Warsh, once considered a favorite for the job, has fallen out of favor, perhaps because of a long-simmering feud he has had with recently appointed Governor Randal Quarles, according to a Bloomberg report that Politico cited.Meanwhile, Keith Hennessey, a former advisor to President George W. Bush, is backing Warsh.Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, also has been ruled out in a number of reports, though an administration official told CNBC otherwise.And Trump added to the strangeness of the process when he asked Lou Dobbs, a host on Fox Business, whom he thought the president should appoint.That comes just a few days after Trump asked members of the GOP leadership for a show of hands on what they thought he should do.Dobbs said he thought Yellen was worth considering for reappointment."We're obviously doing very well together if you look at the markets," Trump said on the show.CNBC has reached out to those involved for comment.Read the full Politico report here.
Corker: Some items in tax bill are just buying off special interests:::::Some of the items in the GOP tax reform discussion are just "buying off" special interests and serve no other purpose, Republican Sen. Bob Corker told CNBC on Thursday."Some of the things we're doing, I'm sorry, are ridiculous," Corker told "Squawk Box," though he did not mention any specifics."I'm sorry, but we live in a political world," said Corker, a member on the Senate Budget and Banking committees.Those things are "not going to drive 1 ounce of economic growth.But it's what you have to do to pass a tax bill."Corker described some efforts to pass tax reform as "unfortunate.""It's buying off of people to pass tax reform," Corker said."We could take a lot of this off in the trash can and make it easier and actually do something that grows our economy and increases our wages," he said.President Donald Trump and the GOP have been pushing for a major overhaul to the U.S. tax code.They believe tax relief would give the current economy a boost.House Republicans on Thursday narrowly approved a budget deal, a crucial step toward passing tax cuts later this year.Corker, who has been highly critical of Trump, told CNBC that despite his war of words with the president he's "all in" on tax reform.Corker is not seeking reelection.The Tennessee Republican said he wants to "go out with afterburners trying to make things happen."
Sen. Bob Corker: Criticism of Trump will 'absolutely not' affect my tax-reform vote:::::Sen. Bob Corker: Some of the 'ridiculous' things in tax reform are just 'buying off' lawmakers to pass it 11 Hours Ago | 00:50 Sen. Bob Corker told CNBC on Thursday his sharp criticism of President Donald Trump's fitness for office will "absolutely not" influence his vote on tax reform.The Tennessee Republican described himself as "all in" on the GOP effort to overhaul the tax system, regardless of his feelings on the president's competence."This tax reform is our agenda, it's the Republican Senate agenda," Corker said in a "Squawk Box" interview."It would be like somebody in your listening audience representing their company, sitting across the table from someone they may have a low regard for, but are they going do something that's going to damage their company because of that?Absolutely not."The spat between Corker and Trump erupted anew on Tuesday, when Trump unleashed a blistering string of tweets following the senator's assertion that the White House should "step aside" and let Congress handle writing the tax bill.Later responding to Trump, Corker said the claims in the president's tweets were untrue.He said Trump "debases our country" and will not "rise to the occasion as president."
Trump to declare public health emergency for opioids, a partial measure to fight drug epidemic:::::WASHINGTON President Trump will order his health secretary to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency Thursday but will stop short of declaring a more sweeping state of national emergency, aides said.In an address from the White House, Trump will also try to rally the nation to a growing epidemic that claimed 64,000 American lives last year, and will advocate for a sustained national effort to end to the addiction crisis."Drug demand and opioid misuse is the crisis next door," said Kellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to the president, previewing the tone of Trump's speech Wednesday."This is no longer someone else's co-worker, someone else's community, someone else's kid.Drug use knows no geographic boundaries or demographic differences."More from USA Today: FDA chief supports opioid prescription limits, regrets agency's prior inaction Trump says he'll declare opioid crisis a national emergency.Here's what that could mean As he chairs Trump's opioid commission, Christie champions his home-state drug companies To respond to that crisis, Trump will sign a presidential memorandum ordering Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan to waive regulations and give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds, said four senior officials responsible for crafting the administration's new opioid policy.The officials previewed the action to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak ahead of the president's announcement.Trump first promised to declare a national emergency to combat the crisis on Aug. 10, and repeated that pledge last week.Speaking to reporters on the south lawn of the White House Wednesday, Trump touted a "big meeting" on opioids, and said a national emergency "gives us power to do things that you can't do right now."But there's a legal distinction between a public health emergency, which the secretary of Health can declare under the Public Health Services Act, and a presidential emergency under the National Emergencies Act.The latter is what the president's own opioid commission recommended in July.Declaring a state of national emergency would give the president even more power to waive privacy laws and Medicare regulations to increase the number of beds available to treat substance abuse.Those facilities are now limited to 16 beds.James Hodge, a law professor at Arizona State University, said a "dual declaration" using both laws would make a larger difference, but that any emergency would be a welcome response to the crisis.Trump's decision to go with a more measured response, a public health emergency, demonstrates the complexity of an opioid crisis that continues to grow through an ever-evolving cycle of addiction, from prescription pain pills to illegal heroin to the lethal fentanyl.But the legal powers Trump is invoking were designed for a short-term emergencies like disasters and infectious diseases.
New screenings begins for passengers on US-bound flights:::::New security screenings for all passengers on U.S.-bound flights began on Thursday, with airlines worldwide questioning flyers about their trip and their luggage in the latest Trump administration decision affecting global travel.However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities.The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.At Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from.Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday.On Wednesday, it said it would conduct "passenger pre-screening interviews" for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly.In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a "demand" about the new U.S. regulations and planned "to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.""We're not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers' documents on the ground," he said, without elaborating.An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn't have immediate details on what her company was doing.An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: "We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks."Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.At Air China, the country's flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply."We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release," he said.South Korea's Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country's two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul's Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to "undergo enhanced security measures" including inspection of personal electronic devices "as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding," the carrier said on its website.Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany's Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked."They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from," said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.Some showed displeasure."It's a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside," passenger Gavin Lai said."I don't want to wait on people to interview me like that.So it's a little annoying."U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules.Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security.United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them.The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S.Some also increasingly swab passengers' hands to check for explosive residue.The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have hurt Mideast airlines.Emirates, the region's biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.
Final trove of documents to offer new details on JFK assassination:::::More than half a century after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was struck down by an assassin's bullet in Dallas, Texas, the United States is due on Thursday to release the final files on the investigation into the killing that rattled a nation.Academics who have studied Kennedy's slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected the final batch of files to offer no major new details on why Lee Harvey Oswald gunned down the first and only Irish-American Roman Catholic to hold the office.They also feared that the final batch of more than 5 million total pages on the Kennedy assassination held in the National Archives will do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old president's killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy's assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy.None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was shot dead a day after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, though they retain a powerful cultural currency."My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin," said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College."It's hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history.But that's where the evidence is."In 1992, Congress ordered that all records relating to the investigation into Kennedy's death should be open to the public, and set a final deadline of Oct. 26, 2017, for the entire set to be made public.President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that he would allow the documents to be made public.The documents to be released on Thursday will likely focus on efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine what contact Oswald had with spies from Cuba and the former Soviet Union on a trip to Mexico City in September 1963, experts said."There was a real concern that Oswald was maybe in league with the Soviet Union," Maney said.Kennedy's assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s.He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.
Republican tax fight complicates plan to pass budget in House:::::A budget plan crucial to President Donald Trump's hopes for large-scale tax cuts looked set for a close vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after some Republicans vowed opposition in an effort to protect a popular tax break.The rebellious faction is resisting a proposal to eliminate a federal deduction for state and local income taxes, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.The idea is one of several that have been floated as Republicans craft a tax-cut plan.The budget blueprint, which has already been approved by the Senate, is central to their efforts to push tax legislation through Congress in the face of staunch opposition from Democrats.The proposal "is obviously an issue of concern to a group of members, and the shared goal is to work together to address the issue and move forward," an aide to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise said on Wednesday.With the clock ticking toward a vote, the impasse had yet to be settled.Republican lawmakers had planned to meet in House Speaker Paul Ryan's office at 9 p.m. to try to hammer out a resolution, but the meeting was postponed until after the budget vote, which was set for 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT).Republican Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey told reporters it was possible there were enough votes to block the budget plan."It's got to be close," he said.Scalise predicted victory."We're going to get it done," he told Fox News Channel.Republicans have sketched out a tax package that independent analysts say would cut taxes for businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, but detailed legislation is not expected to be unveiled until next week.If Congress approves a tax-cut plan, it would hand Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January."I am urging Republicans who have questions about SALT (the state and local tax deduction) to vote no tomorrow and keep voting no until we get some compromise we can live with," Republican Representative Peter King of New York told Reuters.An aide to Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said there was discussion of a compromise that would call for a tax credit up to a certain income amount to replace the deduction, and that he would support it.Republican Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey told Reuters he was not interested in a compromise at this time, and instead wanted the repeal provision taken off the table."I will be voting no on the budget tomorrow," he said.
Trump says Russia is hurting US efforts on North Korea nuclear issue:::::President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Russia was hurting U.S. efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons while China had been helpful.In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump said it would be easier to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue if the United States had a better relationship with Russia."China is helping us and maybe Russia's going through the other way and hurting what we're getting," Trump said of the North Korea situation.A series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have ratcheted up tensions.
Commerce Sec. Ross explains how GOP could strike a deal on taxes:::::Disagreements over controversial pieces of the Republican tax proposal threaten to trip up the party's efforts to approve a tax overhaul this year.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday at the NetNet event outlined a possible compromise for lawmakers.The House hopes to pass a budget on Thursday and move one step closer to approving a tax plan.If House Republicans can clear a budget resolution already passed by the Senate, they hope to release a tax bill next week and pass it by Thanksgiving.Already, sticking points in the plan have emerged, threatening the loss of votes for a party that holds only a narrow majority in the Senate.Ross identified multiple "hard" questions facing the GOP as it aims to broadly chop tax rates for individuals and businesses.Republicans have to decide whether to add a fourth, highest income tax rate on the wealthy above the top 35 percent outlined in a framework last month.They also have to consider how to handle several popular deductions like state and local tax deductions.Republican lawmakers in the high-tax blue states that benefit from the provisions already have fought back against a proposal to scrap them.Ross suggested a cap on the income levels at which the deductions could be used.The income cap could also apply to popular provisions like the charitable deduction, he said.Doing so "saves some of the money but doesn't do away with the concept," Ross said.While the White House has given input on the tax plan, like President Donald Trump did when he urged Congress not to change a retirement savings benefit, the congressional tax-writing committees will ultimately decide the bill's shape.The tax writers sought to get rid of some deductions to offset the deficits created by the tax cuts.A major deficit increase could put off some GOP lawmakers concerned about fiscal discipline.On the timeline for passing a tax plan, Ross echoed Trump and GOP congressional leaders in saying he wants a bill approved this year.He added: "I think what's more important is to get it done and get it done properly and to endorse the directional guidance the president has given."However, Ross said that taking longer to pass a tax proposal could create "indecision" or "paralysis" when businesses or individuals plan financial moves at the end of the year.While Ross is a top economic advisor to Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief economic advisor Gary Cohn have led the White House effort on taxes.Ross added that he believes the U.S. will ultimately reach a deal with Canada and Mexico on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement.Negotiations on reworking the deal will go into next year.
Most popular Obamacare plans cost average of 34 percent more for 2018:::::The average price of the most popular types of Obamacare health plans sold on the federal insurance marketplace will be at least 34 percent higher in 2018, according to an analysis released Wednesday.The Avalere Health analysis also found lower but still double-digit average price hikes for the other types of Obamacare plans, which go on sale Nov. 1.Continued uncertainty in Obamacare markets, and the Trump administration's threats and eventual decision to cut off key payments to insurers are fueling the higher prices, Avalere said.Many Obamacare customers will be insulated from those sharply higher rates because their premiums are subsidized by the federal government.The subsidies can significantly reduce what a customer directly pays in premiums, with many subsidized customers being able to find a plan for $100 per month or less.More than 80 percent of Obamacare customers who buy plans on government marketplaces get such subsidies, in the form of tax credits, because they have low or moderate incomes.But customers who do not qualify for subsidies will get hit with the full impact of the price hikes.In many states, nonsubsidized customers will have to shell out more than $100 per month more than what they currently pay for their plans.About 18 million people who do not get health coverage through a job, Medicare or Medicaid are covered by the types of individual health plans whose prices Avalere analyzed.And about 11 million of those people buy coverage through a government-run exchange.Avalere's analysis came on the same day that prices for 2018 insurance plans were posted for public view on HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange that sells individual plans in 36 states.
Judge rejects request to order Trump to resume Obamacare payments:::::A federal judge Wednesday rejected a request that he order the Trump administration to immediately resume paying Obamacare insurers key subsidies that the government cut off in recent days.Judge Vince Chhabria's decision came after a coalition of more than a dozen states last week asked for an emergency order blocking the administration's move to cease paying the insurers.Chhabria denied that bid two days after holding a hearing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and hearing arguments from lawyers for the states and for the Trump administration.However, the case by the states will continue in that court.And it could ultimately lead to restoration of the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments.At the same time, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators is pushing a bill that would restore the payments to insurers."Although the case is at an early stage, and although it's a close question, it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument," Chhabria wrote in his decision.He pointedly noted that despite the claims by the plaintiffs, most states have taken steps that will protect many consumers from the termination of the payments, in the short term.Those steps will, in many cases, lead to consumers either not paying any more for their health plans next year than they now do, or to actually paying less.Chhabria was appointed to his seat by President Barack Obama, who had pushed for passage of the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is formally known.At issue are billions of dollars in federal payments that health insurers had received to compensate them for discounts given low-income Obamacare customers for their out-of-pocket health costs.The discounts are mandated by law and will continue, despite the loss of the reimbursements to insurers for them.The Trump administration on Oct. 12 said it was cutting off those payments, effective last Friday, because the money for them had not been separately appropriated by Congress.President Donald Trump for months had threatened to end the payments, which had been made by the Obama administration since 2014, when Obamacare health plans first took effect.The House in 2014 sued the Obama administration, claiming the reimbursements were illegal given the lack of congressional appropriation.A federal judge ruled in the House's favor last year, but her decision was stayed by an appeal of her ruling.The coalition of 18 states and the District of Columbia that sued the Trump administration in an effort to restore the payments has argued that the Affordable Care Act itself authorizes the payments to be made by the government.
Top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn reportedly revives idea of hiking gas tax:::::Top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn reportedly raised the prospect of hiking the federal gasoline tax on Wednesday, reviving the idea after President Donald Trump raised the issue earlier this year.Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, told a group of moderate Democrats and Republicans they would have the opportunity to vote to increase the gas tax when Congress considers an infrastructure package early next year, Politico reported.Cohn made the remark while discussing elements of the administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut with the Problem Solvers Caucus, according to Politico.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.The U.S. government currently applies a charge of 18.4 cents per gallon on retail gasoline.Revenue from the levy goes to the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for road construction and mass transportation.The tax has not changed since 1993.In May, Trump said he was open to raising the gas tax in order to underwrite improvements to the nation's infrastructure.Then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later clarified that Trump was not endorsing a hike but was considering it.He said an undisclosed group of truckers had asked Trump to consider raising the tax and use the funds to patch up roads.Shortly after Trump's remarks, White House infrastructure advisor and LeFrak Organization CEO Richard LeFrak told CNBC the president deserved credit for broaching what has historically been "the third rail of politics."He noted that several states have recently raised their own gas taxes.The average national gas price stands at $2.45 a gallon.The cost at the pump has remained relatively low since an oil price downturn in 2014.
Trump: Flake and Corker will 'do the right thing' and vote for tax cuts:::::Trump on Sen. Flake: He did the right thing in leaving 1:28 PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 01:13 President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he is confident that two senators who recently criticized him still plan to vote in favor of a major Republican tax reform bill."I believe he's going to do the right thing for the country and vote for tax cuts," Trump said of Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., during an impromptu press conference on the South Lawn of the White House.Flake announced on Tuesday that he would retire from the Senate because he said the nation's politics had become too toxic, and he blamed Trump for the "undermining of our democratic norms and ideals."Asked about another of his critics, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., Trump said he believed that Corker, like Flake, would vote for the sweeping tax-reform package."I really believe that Bob Corker is going to do the right thing for the country," Trump said, repeating his phrase verbatim for Corker as he did for Flake.Corker also made headlines on Wednesday by criticizing the president.The retiring chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called Trump an "utterly untruthful" person and predicted that Trump's legacy would be "the debasement" of the United States.Following Corker's remarks, Trump used Twitter to attack Corker for the rest of the day.Trump's optimism about the tax-reform package Wednesday even extended to Democrats, some of whom Trump said would vote for the reforms because "if they don't vote for these massive tax cuts, they're going to lose" re-election in 2018.So far, there are no Democrats signaling that they might support the tax-cut package, which includes a number of provisions like elimination of the estate tax that would benefit only the ultra-rich.However, one Democrat, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, attended an event with Trump earlier this year in her home state, where the president touted the benefits of his plan to cut taxes.
Top House tax writer suggests 401(k) changes could still happen, contradicting Trump:::::The top House tax writer on Wednesday signaled that Congress could still propose changes to a popular retirement savings plan in its tax bill, contradicting an assurance made by President Donald Trump.At a Christian Science Monitor event, Rep. Kevin Brady said Republicans are "exploring a number of ideas" to "create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner."The House is "continuing discussions with the president" in that area, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman said."I do have a worry.Not enough Americans are saving," Brady said at a separate Yahoo Finance conference later in the day.Brady said Republicans have "asked for ideas how Americans (can) save more and save earlier in their lives."On Monday, Trump emphatically tweeted that "there will be NO change to your 401(k)."He called the 401(k) tax benefit a "great and popular middle class tax break that works."Brady did not specify the possible changes the GOP is considering.Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Trump appeared to back off of his Monday tweet.He called 401(k) plans "very important" and said he did not want a proposal to change them to "go too far."However, the president said he could use 401(k) changes as a negotiating tool, adding that Brady "knows how important" the retirement plans are.Brady said at the Yahoo event that he is not bothered by Trump's stance."I'm certainly listening to President Trump," he said, adding that Trump has been "incredibly helpful" in putting together the tax reform bill "At the end of the day, we're looking at encouraging people to save more and save early," Brady said."We're looking through a number of ideas.No decisions have been made.At the end of the day, retirement will be strengthened or it will remain as it is."
Nearly 1 in 4 Americans believe  wrongly  that Obamacare is partially repealed:::::Twenty-four percent of American voters mistakenly believe Obamacare has been partially repealed, according to a poll released Wednesday.And another 15 percent of voters incorrectly believe Obamacare has either been fully repealed, or repealed and replaced with a new health-care law, according to the Morning Consult/Politico survey.The findings come less a week before open enrollment begins Nov. 1 in Obamacare individual health insurance plans.Customers on Wednesday could begin window-shopping for those plans, checking out the prices of coverage in their region.Obamacare advocates have expressed concern that confusion over the law's status, and other factors, will decrease the number of people signing up for health plans that take effect Jan. 1 Part of that confusion stems from efforts since the beginning of 2017 by Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump to repeal key parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a new law.Those efforts have repeatedly failed, despite the fact that the GOP, which has promised repeal of Obamacare since it became law in 2010, holds majorities in the Senate and the House."We've been campaigning on it for seven years," Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told the Morning Consult for a report on the poll's results."So I think some people believe that we've executed better than we have," said Meadows, who is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative House members.The poll, which questioned 1,988 registered voters from last Thursday through Monday, has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.The Affordable Care Act continues to require most Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a tax penalty.The IRS last week said, for the first time, that it will not accept electronically filed income tax returns that do not disclose if the filer had complied with the ACA's mandate to have health coverage.The agency also said it will suspend processing paper-filed returns that lack that disclosure.The Morning Consult/Politico poll also found that a broad majority of American voters say that former President Barack Obama not Trump is responsible for the current state of Obamacare, and of the U.S health-care system generally.Only 20 percent of voters said Trump is responsible for the current state of the Affordable Care Act, the health-care law championed by Obama.And just 28 percent say Trump is responsible for the state of the American health-care system generally.In contrast, 67 percent of voters said Obama is responsible for the state of Obamacare.And 50 percent of them said Obama is responsible for the state of U.S. health care.Trump last week said that Obamacare price hikes for plans that take effect next year are "the fault of the Democrats" like Obama.The poll also asked voters their opinions of Trump's decision to cut off billions of dollars of government reimbursement payments to Obamacare insurers.Those payments compensate insurers for discounts granted to low-income customers for their out-of-pocket health costs.Obamacare premiums are projected to sharply rise due to cut off of the reimbursements, because insurers still must, by law, offer the discounts to customers even though they are no longer getting the money from the government.A total of 46 percent of voters in the Morning Consult/Politico survey said they disapproved of Trump's move to end the subsidies.Another 39 percent approved of the decision.Only 25 percent of respondents said the cutoff of payments would have a positive effect on themselves or their family.And 39 percent said it would have a negative impact.
White House wants Congress to boost disaster aid, cut spending elsewhere:::::The White House plans to ask the U.S. Congress for a third round of disaster aid in mid-November as the costs continue to pour in for helping rebuild after hurricanes, but Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has told lawmakers he wants to see spending cuts elsewhere.Mulvaney said the federal government is assessing how much it will cost to help Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands rebuild after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused massive damages in August and September.Mulvaney expects the damages to add up to "several tens of billions of dollars," he said in a letter to Senate Leader Mitch McConnell dated Tuesday."As we move toward the longer-term issue of rebuilding the impacted areas of our nation, we believe that it is appropriate that the Congress consider reducing spending elsewhere in order to offset what will, again, be a significant amount of unbudgeted spending," Mulvaney said in the letter.President Donald Trump is slated to receive a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts later on Wednesday in Dallas, where he is attending fundraising events.The Office of Management and Budget has drawn up a preliminary list of more than $5.5 billion in unspent funds that could be cut, Mulvaney said in a separate letter to lawmakers on Senate and House appropriations committees.The list includes $4.3 billion from an Energy Department loan program for advanced technology vehicle manufacturing and almost $730 million in funds no longer needed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for projects related to Hurricane Sandy recovery, Mulvaney said.
Sen. Schumer calls Treasury Secretary Mnuchin a liar and a suck up to Trump:::::Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is not a fan of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Schumer directly attacked Mnuchin's claims the Republican tax reform plan will reduce the country's budget deficit."I don't know if the man's deliberately lying, but it seems so," Schumer said in a "Politico Money" podcast interview."His statements are outlandish, and he seems just to want to, I don't know if I'm allowed to use this word, I think I am, suck up to Trump, flatter Trump.This man cannot be believed.And if he used these kinds of arguments at Goldman Sachs, they would have fired him."Schumer also rejected Mnuchin's prediction of a "significant" market drop if tax reform doesn't pass."It's absurd.No one believes Steven Mnuchin," he said."He has lost his credibility because of statements like that.Wall Street was doing great, it was going up at a dramatic rate before the president even took office.And it's doing fine now, because the economy's doing well, because corporate profits are way up."The S&P 500 has rallied 20 percent since the Nov. 8 election through Tuesday.A Treasury spokesperson sent the following statement in response to a request for comment: "We are surprised to hear the Minority Leader express these comments about the Secretary.The Secretary is committed to delivering a major middle class tax cut, more competitive business taxes that create jobs and wage growth and a fairer tax system.This would be a good time for Senator Schumer to stop the obstruction and help hard working Americans get meaningful tax relief."Read the full Politico story here.
Senate Obamacare fix would cut deficit, not reduce number with health insurance: CBO:::::A bipartisan Senate bill that seeks to restore key federal payments to Obamacare insurers "would not substantially change" the number of Americans with health insurance, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.The Alexander-Murray bill also would cut the federal deficit by $3.8 billion over the next decade, the CBO said in a report analyzing effects of the bill.And it would result in "slightly lower premiums" that currently projected for many Obamacare plans, according to the CBO, a nonpartisan agency.The bill was introduced in the Senate on the heels of the Oct. 12 decision by the Trump administration to terminate payments known as cost-sharing reduction reimbursements to Obamacare insurers.The billions of dollars worth of payments compensate insurance plans for discounts that they must by law offer low-income Obamacare customers for their out-of-pocket health costs.The CBO earlier projected that killing those payments would lead Obamacare plan premium prices to be 25 percent higher in 2020 than they would have been if the payments continued.Prices for next year are estimated to be about 20 percent higher than they otherwise would have been because of President Donald Trump's threats since early 2017 to end the CSR payments.The CBO also had earlier estimated that ending the payments would actually increase the federal deficit by almost $200 billion over the next decade.
NAACP warns African-Americans against travel on American Air:::::The NAACP is warning African-Americans that if they fly on American Airlines they could be subject to discrimination or even unsafe conditions.American said Wednesday that it was disappointed by the announcement and will invite the civil rights group to meet and talk about the airline.The NAACP said that for several months it has watched a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African-American passengers.Among them was activist Tamika Mallory's claim last week that she was a victim of racial bias when a pilot ordered her off a flight after a dispute with another airline employee over her seat.The NAACP said that and other recent incidents involving African-Americans "suggest a corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias on the part of American Airlines."In a statement, American Airlines spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said, "We are disappointed to hear about this travel advisory as our team members - a diverse community of gate agents, pilots, and flight attendants - are proud to serve customers of all backgrounds.Every day American is committed to providing a positive, safe travel experience for everyone who flies with us."Gibson said American will invite NAACP representatives to meet at the company's headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, for "a meaningful dialogue" about the airline.The NAACP highlighted four recent incidents in which African-American passengers said they were treated in a discriminatory way.The one that attracted the most media attention involved Mallory, an organizer of the Women's March on Washington in January.Mallory had changed her seat at an airport kiosk, only to be told at the gate that the seat had been assigned to another customer.Mallory said she was treated disrespectfully by the gate agent another African-American woman and was outraged when a white male pilot asked if she could control herself while on the flight.After being told she was being kicked off the plane, Mallory called the pilot a racist in a profanity-laced exchange.She took a later flight home to New York on American, then held a press conference two days later and threatened to take legal action against the airline.American is the world's largest airline.The NAACP describes itself as the nation's oldest and largest nonpartisan civil rights organization.
The GOP created Trump, but now more Republicans regret that victory:::::Five years ago, political scholars Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann published an article with this bracing conclusion: "Let's just say it: The Republicans are the Problem."That conclusion angered Republican politicians.It came during their furious 2012 campaign to recapture the U.S. Senate, defeat President Barack Obama and put Mitt Romney in the White House.Today, Republicans have won both houses of Congress, made Donald Trump president and created an all-GOP government.The stunning result: More and more Republicans themselves voice the same conclusions as Ornstein and Mann about what their party has become.On Tuesday, it was Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who won re-election in that 2012 campaign.Now chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Corker characterized the Republican president as a danger to U.S. national security.Hours later, Sen. Jeff Flake accused Trump of leading Americans toward a future as "fearful, backward-looking people."The Arizona senator, who won his seat in 2012 and won't run again, challenged GOP colleagues to resist indecency and dishonesty from the White House.Last week, the previous Republican president, George W. Bush, condemned Trump-era "bigotry conspiracy theories and outright fabrication."The 2008 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain, ripped a "half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems."Two months ago, Romney, who lost to incumbent Obama in 2012, called on Trump to apologize for remarks about a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.He said the Republican president had "caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn."Instead of apologizing, Trump repeated his remarks.The seeds of what those Republican leaders denounced were planted decades ago.Beginning in the 1960s, Republicans seized on turmoil over civil rights, cultural ferment and the Vietnam War to draw conservative whites in the South and elsewhere into a national majority coalition.Since then, the party has grown increasingly homogeneous as the country has grown more diverse.Diversity and rising social tolerance among younger and better-educated voters helped Democrats win presidential elections again, with Bill Clinton and Obama.At the same time, Republicans have grown dependent on older, blue-collar white conservatives aggrieved by declining economic prospects and cultural change.Before those voters propelled Trump to the Republican nomination, they pushed lawmakers toward the behavior that Ornstein and Mann described when they foreshadowed today's GOP crisis."The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics," they wrote in "It's Even Worse Than It Looks," the book from which their 2012 article was drawn."It is ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition."They concluded, "When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country's challenges."This year's failure of an all-GOP government to fulfill promises to repeal and replace Obamacare demonstrated the point.The irony is that, as more Republicans speak out in agreement, Ornstein and Mann see signs of change.In their new book with liberal commentator E.J.Dionne Jr., they cite growing resistance to Trump across the political spectrum.It can lead, they argue, "to rebuilding the more responsible, forward-looking center-right party that the country needs.""The popular mobilization and national soul-searching he has aroused could be the occasion for an era of democratic renewal," they write in "One Nation After Trump."Flake offered a hint on Wednesday after his dramatic speech on the Senate floor.In an interview on MSNBC, he repeated a formulation Obama used when he struggled with bitter and implacable Republican opposition."At some point," the Republican senator said, "this fever will break."
Sen. Rob Portman: Flake and Corker will support tax reform despite blasting Trump:::::Sen.Rob Portman told CNBC on Wednesday that fellow Republicans will vote to approve tax reform despite any issues they may have with President Donald Trump.Portman said he's friends with GOP Sens.Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, and they said they intend to support a bill that would change the U.S. tax code.Flake and Corker both of whom won't be seeking re-election next year took their public feuds with Trump to the next level Tuesday even as they joined their GOP Senate colleagues for lunch with the president."Both of them are for tax reform," Portman said in a "Squawk Box" interview on Wednesday."The notion I've heard this morning that they're somehow going to vote the other way because of their views about the president is crazy," the Ohio Republican continued."They're going to do what's best for the people they represent."Meanwhile, Trump baited Flake and Corker in a series of tweets Wednesday morning.Instead of focusing on the president's tweets, lawmakers need to work toward cutting taxes and lowering health-care costs, said Portman, who had been discussed as a possible vice presidential pick for Trump during the campaign."We shouldn't allow Twitter to distract us from the work we're supposed to be doing.""You have to work with the president," he added, saying he even worked with Democrat Barack Obama when he was president."Our job is to put our head down and start legislating."Portman said he's not a rubber stamp for Trump, saying he does speak up when he disagrees with the president.
US House speaker says tax plan unlikely to swell deficit: Reuters interview:::::The U.S. Republican tax cut plan that President Donald Trump wants passed by the end of the year is unlikely to trigger a big deficit expansion because it will spur more investment and job growth, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday."We believe that we'll get faster economic growth," Ryan said."We don't anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.... Those things combined, we believe, will give us faster growth and a more resilient tax code."Democrats have painted the tax plan as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled.One of the key elements of the plan is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Ryan said the plan would help U.S. growth."The reason we're trying to do it with this timeline is we want to get a 3 percent economy.We're sort of limping along, growing between 1 and 2 percent, and that is so far underneath our potential as a country," he said.Ryan previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.Securing passage by Congress of his tax plan is important to Trump, who has yet to score a major legislative win since taking office in January amid a steady stream of distractions and Republican infighting.Ryan predicted that Democratic lawmakers would eventually back the tax plan."At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing," Ryan said."It's hard for me to see why no matter what party you're from you'd want to vote against this."
Senate kills CFPB rule on arbitration, class-action lawsuits:::::Senate narrowly kills a rule that would've allowed more lawsuits against financial firms 1:25 PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 00:56 Banks, credit card issuers and other financial companies will be able to block customers from banding together to sue over disputes, after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly killed a rule banning the firms from using "forced arbitration" clauses.Republican Vice President Mike Pence appeared on the Senate floor at 10:11 p.m. EDT (0211 GMT) to cast the tie-breaking vote as the chamber's president and approve the most significant roll-back of Obama-era financial policy since President Donald Trump took office vowing to loosen the leash on Wall Street.The final count was 51 to 50.The Republican-dominated House of Representatives has already passed the resolution repealing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule released in July.The resolution also bars regulators from instituting a similar ban in the future.After a signature from Trump, expected soon, the resolution will abruptly end a years-long fight that has included multiple federal regulators, consumer advocacy groups, and financial lobbyists.CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed by former President Barack Obama, rarely comments on congressional action but on Tuesday night said, "Wall Street won and ordinary people lost.""This vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company," he added.Customers must agree to the clauses as a condition of opening accounts, saying they will take any disputes to closed-door arbitration instead of joining class-action lawsuits, where complainants band together to share litigation costs.The clauses are used for nearly every U.S. consumer product and service since the Supreme Court ruled them legal in 2011.Victims of the Equifax hack were outraged last month when the company included forced arbitration fine print in offering them free credit monitoring.The company later removed the clauses.At the same time, Wells Fargo customers whose identities were used in last year's phony accounts scandal have had difficulty sueing the bank because they are bound by arbitration clauses in contracts they signed for legitimate accounts.The CFPB rule, set to go into effect next spring, was not retroactive and would not have helped Equifax or Wells customers.Members of Trump's administration have relentlessly assailed the regulation, and on Monday the Treasury Department laid out arguments against it in a special report.Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Norieka said on Tuesday the Senate's action stopped a rule "that would have likely increased the cost of credit for hardworking Americans and made it more difficult for small community banks to resolve differences with their customers."Meanwhile, major bank lobbying groups who sued last month to block the rule cheered the resolution's passage.One of the groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Congress had reined in the "overgrown and unaccountable" CFPB, an independent agency created to protect individuals' finances that conservatives say consistently reaches beyond its authority in its rulemaking.Critics of the rule had said class actions only benefit trial lawyers and arbitration generally wins larger settlement awards for customers.Supporters said forced arbitration harms customers by putting companies in control of the process and taking away the right to sue enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.The CFPB created its rule after conducting a five-year study that found customers struggle to have banks open arbitration cases about their complaints, but that those few cases have led to slightly higher individual awards than class actions."The Senate today prevented a cash grab that would have transferred wealth from consumers to the pockets of wealthy attorneys," said Ted Frank, director of the center for class-action fairness at the free-market group Competitive Enterprise Institute.Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, meanwhile, said Tuesday's vote "will make the rich richer, and the powerful more powerful."
Airlines get ready for new US security rules that take effect Thursday:::::Airlines get ready for new US security rules 8:57 AM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 00:40 New security measures including stricter passenger screening take effect on Thursday on all U.S.-bound flights to comply with government requirements designed to avoid an in-cabin ban on laptops, airlines said.Airlines contacted by Reuters said the new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, sparking concerns over flight delays and extended processing time.They will affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries.The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to unspecified security threats.Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening.The 120-day deadline is Thursday.Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing."We see this as a big issue for China Airlines," Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.Korean Airlines, South Korea's flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures."We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ...It's just inconvenient for the passengers," President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei.Lufthansa said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.Economy passengers on Lufthansa's Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.Cathay Pacific Airways said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States.The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure.Singapore Airlines said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding.Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes "are complex security measures" but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules.Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case, the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before changing the rules."What we have seen is very strange," he told reporters in Taipei."Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing."At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat."Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences," said the members.AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers."The risk is other countries make similar demands," AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said.U.S. authorities in June also increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart.A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokeswoman declined to discuss the specific changes but said, "the United States continues to work with our partners to raise the baseline of global aviation security and keep the entire traveling public safe."The TSA said in July it was imposing new security rules requiring U.S. domestic airline travelers to remove all electronic items larger than mobile phones such as tablets, e-readers and video game consoles from carry-on baggage for screening.
House Passes Budget Blueprint, Clearing Path for Tax Overhaul:::::Democrats were swift to criticize the approach, saying it was an attempt to hide tax changes that will hurt, not help, middle-class families.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be a bunch of false promises to the middle class.Republicans, he said, know the details the specifics of what theyre really about will be hard to argue in the sunlight.Lawmakers and committee staff members must still resolve some of the thorniest issues before they can release a bill, including where to draw income lines for tax brackets, how high to set the top personal income tax rate and how to ensure that major changes to the way that multinational corporations are taxed do not encourage them to shift more money overseas.The biggest question is how to offset enough tax revenue that will be lost from cutting rates to remain within the rules of the Senate budget reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster.The budget measure approved on Thursday would allow for a tax bill that adds as much as $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, at a time when the federal governments debt has already topped $20 trillion.The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.The outline of the tax plan unveiled in September would cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent; collapse individual income tax brackets from seven to three or four, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, and possibly one higher; and nearly double the standard deduction, to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly.The budget measure passed over the loud protests of House members from New York and New Jersey, who worry that the blueprint will doom the current deduction for state and local taxes a benefit of great importance to taxpayers in their states.Eleven of the 20 Republicans who voted no were from those two states.This isnt over, one of those lawmakers, Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, a Republican, said after the vote.I am confident well reach an agreement.And if we dont, then I dont see how we can move forward.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Mr. Brady told reporters later in the day that while no such agreement had yet been reached, it would eventually be resolved, since families in New York and New Jersey needed to be better off after a tax bill passes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is a serious issue, and were taking it seriously, Mr. Brady said.Republican lawmakers from those states made it clear they need this problem solved before they vote yes on tax reform, he added.Democrats were quick to seize on the discord.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had put his partys control of the House at even greater risk through his foolish decision to force his most vulnerable members to walk the plank on a toxic tax increase.Anybody who votes for this thing should have their head examined if they live where we do, said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York.In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, President Trump and Mr. Brady have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate matter.House Republicans, over Mr. Trumps public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year.On Thursday, Mr. Brady hinted that the bill may raise the limit on the total amount Americans can save in tax-preferred accounts but shift the tax preference to the back end, so that a larger share of those contributions are taxed up front, instead of when they are withdrawn, as is the case with 401(k) plans.Such a change would produce more tax revenues in the short term, at the expense of the long run, which would help Republicans make their tax math work.One possible reason to consider that change would be to offset revenues lost from a deal to preserve some of the state and local deduction for individuals.A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts.In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the Houses plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings.The Houses plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit.But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.House Republicans were asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobodys read, Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome, but she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly, she said.And while Republicans expressed cautious optimism that they could resolve their differences, avoid lobbying pitfalls and deliver the bill to Mr. Trump for his signature in December, Democrats warned that the ride could be rough.Its easy to understand why they want to rush a bill like this through, because the more people see it, the less theyll like it, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat.Itll be a lot tougher for them to get it done than they think.
Pitched as Calming Force, John Kelly Instead Mirrors Bosss Priorities:::::He is a Marine first and foremost, Mr. Panetta said.In addition to being a Marine, he was born and raised in Boston among blue-collar families with traditional views about God and country.You combine those two and you realize that he shares some of these deep values, some of which Trump himself has tried to talk about.As tall and commanding in a suit as he was in a uniform, Mr. Kelly has become a central figure in Mr. Trumps orbit.After six months in the cabinet as secretary of homeland security, Mr. Kelly took over a turbulent and tribal White House last summer and by most accounts imposed more order on the building and staff, if not the Twitter-obsessed president himself.Mr. Kellys focus on improving information flow and decision making in the West Wing gave the impression of a good soldier mainly concerned with process.But that obscured a player who expresses his own sharp views in selected areas, most notably immigration, where he shares Mr. Trumps commitment to toughening the border and deporting many in the country illegally.His views were forged in part by his time heading the United States Southern Command, which oversees American military operations and security in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.Mr. Kelly not only expressed willingness to curb refugees coming into the country in the end, Mr. Trump lowered the cap to 45,000 he embraced Mr. Trumps various attempts to close the border to visitors from a group of predominantly Muslim countries.He aggressively turned up the heat on internal immigration enforcement, stepping up deportation of undocumented immigrants, even those without serious criminal records, reversing an Obama administration policy.Under Mr. Kellys leadership, the Department of Homeland Security also went after undocumented parents who bring their children into the country.He directed immigration officials to lodge smuggling charges against the parents, saying they were putting children in danger.Kelly has been an enabler of Trumps mission, said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant homeland security secretary under Mr. Obama.Judge him that way.His image as a steady, nonideological figure trying to restore order in the White House in the face of a radical president, she added, was not true.Mr. Kelly, she said, was not the savior or the hostage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Other Democrats have expressed alarm at Mr. Kellys views on immigration.At a dinner including Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Kelly gave an extended critique of Mexico, calling it a third-world country in danger of collapsing the way Venezuela has and arguing that the United States needed to guard itself against that, according to people informed about the conversation.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who recommended Mr. Kelly to Mr. Trump last winter, said the retired generals background gave him an understanding of the dangers and drawbacks of unfettered immigration.He knows a lot of the challenges that we face south of the border, Mr. Cotton said, adding that the issue is something that hes lived on a firsthand basis for years.Like Mr. Panetta, he pointed to Mr. Kellys upbringing.I think he appreciates the struggles of Americas working class the blue-collar workers over the last 30, 40 years, the kind of people who have to take a shower after they get off work, not before they go to work and the impact that mass unskilled and low-skilled immigration has had on working-class wages in our society, Mr. Cotton said.As a cabinet officer, Mr. Kelly frequently lashed out at critics.In March, during a meeting with members of Arab and Muslim communities in Dearborn, Mich., Mr. Kelly threatened to walk out after being posed hard questions about the travel ban and what participants saw as the targeting of Muslim Americans at ports of entry, according to people in attendance.During a speech in April, Mr. Kelly rebuked members of Congress who complained about what they called overly aggressive immigration enforcement.If lawmakers do not like the laws theyve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws, Mr. Kelly said defiantly.Otherwise, they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.That drew a rebuke from Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas.I dont think its correct for you to tell members of Congress to shut up, he said.Mr. Kelly has also engaged in testy public debates with Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California.During a June meeting, Ms. Harris and Mr. Kelly engaged in a contentious back-and-forth as she questioned him about Trump administration threats to cut off funding for so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.All of that foreshadowed his attack last week on Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, who publicly accused Mr. Trump of insensitivity when he called the widow of Sgt.La David T. Johnson, who was killed this month in Niger.Mr. Kelly called her an empty barrel and told an unflattering story about her that was proved untrue by videotape of the event he mentioned.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Kelly decided himself to head out to the White House briefing room to defend the president, colleagues said, and most of his remarks reflected on his own experience as the father of a slain Marine and the nature of military service.He brought tears to the eyes of other White House aides, who afterward traded emails expressing admiration for Mr. Kellys passionate defense of Mr. Trump.It was only afterward that they began to see how the attack on Ms. Wilson came to overshadow the emotion of the first part of his speech.Mr. Kelly was surprised by the criticism of his speech, colleagues said, but he has not apologized to Ms. Wilson for making false statements about her.White House officials said they opted against it to avoid extending the story.Mr. Panetta said Mr. Kellys attack on a congresswoman reflected his lack of experience in high-level politics.He knows where the land mines are in the Marines, but he doesnt know where the land mines are in politics, Mr. Panetta said.And hell make mistakes as a result, and he certainly made mistakes last week in going after people in that news conference.But, he said, it was authentic: As somebody who worked with this guy, a lot of what he got up to say is a reflection of who John Kelly is.
As G.O.P. Bends Toward Trump, Critics Either Give In or Give Up:::::Mr. Strauss dash for the exits followed the retirement announcements of Mr. Flake, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Dave Reichert of Washington State all members of the Republican establishment.Many of those who remain will have to accommodate the president to survive primaries from the pro-Trump right.Already, in the high-profile campaigns of 2017 governor races in Virginia and New Jersey and a special Senate race in Alabama Republican candidates are mirroring Mr. Trumps racially tinged campaign tactics.And Republican officials are putting up with the sort of incendiary candidacy that a party more devoted to nurturing a tolerant image might have rejected.The reason?Many of their voters prefer the Trump way.Were not an element, said Laura Ingraham, a pro-Trump talk show host.Were the party.Ms. Ingraham, the author of a new book, Billionaire at the Barricades, on the populist uprising that helped elect Mr. Trump, said the conservatism of market-oriented internationalism simply has little mass appeal.Theres no constituency for open borders, endless war and these international trade deals that are skewed against the United States, she said.As for the limited government pitch that defined Mr. Flakes career, Stephen K. Bannon, the presidents former chief strategist, scoffed.This thing theyve got today doesnt work, it doesnt move with urgency, said Mr. Bannon, who is now orchestrating an effort to defeat Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trumps agenda.Its very nice.But its a theoretical exercise.It cant win national elections.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even some of the presidents detractors on the right believe that the party base will stick with him because they like his agenda.We have a leader who has a personality disorder, said former Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, but hes done what he actually told the people he was going to do, and theyre not going to abandon him.This grass-roots loyalty is why no prominent Republicans on the ballot next year have broken with Mr. Trump only lame-duck lawmakers and Republicans out of office, such as former President George W. Bush, have been harshly critical of him.At the moment, congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are trying to make common cause of an overhaul of the tax code because they see it as something of a temporary cure-all.A bill-signing ceremony on taxes would hand lawmakers something to run on next year and the president a much-needed accomplishment.It stops the bleeding, said Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina.But even that holds risks.A tax cut that skews heavily toward corporations and the rich would hardly dislodge the populist view of a Republican establishment beholden to its donors.I dont think the rank-and-file Republican believes that corporations are people, said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to the Trump campaign who has also worked with Mr. Bannon.He was mimicking a Mitt Romney quote that earned Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, ridicule for being out of touch.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump painted a rosy picture of the party.We have, actually, great unity in the Republican Party, he told reporters before leaving for a fund-raiser in Texas.But even as Mr. Trump won repeated standing ovations from Senate Republicans on Tuesday when he visited their weekly lunch at the Capitol, the partys lingering tensions were also on display.Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, a longtime member of the Agriculture Committee, expressed concern about whether Mr. Trump would pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a Republican present at the luncheon.Photo Less than an hour after Mr. Trump left the Capitol, Mr. Flake was on the Senate floor delivering a 17-minute excoriation of the Trump era.Advertisement Continue reading the main story How aggressively the president pursues his platform on trade and immigration restrictionism could test how strong his grip is on Congress.For now, though, the vision for a more populist-nationalist party sketched out by Mr. Bannon is being won as much through intimidation as through actual purges in Republican primaries.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.What Mr. Bannon is trying to do and what Mr. Flakes retirement could further is strike fear in the hearts of Republicans who do not display enough enthusiasm for the nationalism that Mr. Trump ran on.This should be a warning shot to any other Never Trumper in the Senate today: Your time is up, Mr. Surabian said.That is playing out not only in the examples of Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.In Nevada and Mississippi, Senators Dean Heller and Roger Wicker have responded to Trump-inspired primary threats by taking steps to emphasize their fealty to Mr. Trump.On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No.2 Republican in the Senate, endorsed former Judge Roy S. Moore in the Alabama Senate race, praising Mr. Moore, a caustic social conservative, as a tireless advocate led by principle rather than politics.Mr. Cornyn is the highest ranking Republican to formally back Mr. Moore.But accommodation is not giving pause to would-be rivals.Danny Tarkanian, Mr. Hellers Republican challenger, said the conversation among activists was no longer dominated by finding the most conservative candidates.The talk I hear is, Hey, whos going to support Trumps America First policies, said Mr. Tarkanian, citing trade, military intervention and what he described as worrying more about refugees from other countries than our own people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the House, some lawmakers who have previously spoken out against Mr. Trump, such as Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, are now working to repair their relationship with the White House.The message theyre sending is: The way to survive is by accommodating him, changing their tone and professing loyalty to Trump, said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard and a vociferous Trump critic.The two governors races this year also illustrate Mr. Trumps influence in the party.In Virginia and New Jersey, the establishment-aligned Republican nominees for governor, Ed Gillespie and Kim Guadagno, are airing controversial ads on immigration to both stir their base and win over some independents concerned about crimes committed by those in the country illegally.Mr. Gillespie, a veteran Washington lobbyist who served in George W. Bushs White House, is also running ads extolling his support for Confederate statues.In the Senate, Republicans have made clear that they will welcome Mr. Moore of Alabama who has a decades-long history of making inflammatory comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims to their ranks should he win the special election in December to fill the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general.A handful of conservative writers have expressed concern about the message that tolerating Mr. Moore sends, but no high-profile lawmaker has followed suit, and a pair of Republican senators are even hosting a fund-raiser for him next month in Washington.And in Colorado, former Representative Tom Tancredo, who was shunned by the Bush-era Republican Party for his harsh anti-immigration views, is considering a comeback bid for governor in 2018.Whether Mr. Trump permanently realigns the party around his style and platform may depend on how much he remains true to what could be called Trumpism.Mr. Graham believes that the president is not as wedded to some of his nationalist policies as his supporters want to believe.The best thing that could happen to Trump and the future of the Republican Party is for Trump to fix a broken immigration system, Mr. Graham said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By calling last week to offer his support to a handful of Republican senators that Mr. Bannon had named as potential targets, the president demonstrated he would not blindly follow his former adviser.Establishment Republicans are attempting to convince Mr. Trump that if you join with Bannon, you cut your own throat, Mr. Graham said, because it could lead to an impeachment effort by a Democratic-controlled Congress.But these arguments cause the early Trump enthusiasts only to roll their eyes.The party establishment, these Trump backers say, wants to govern as if the election never happened.They still think the election was about Trumps personality, Ms. Ingraham said.It wasnt.It was his ideas.
Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together:::::To me, the only way to stop this is to defeat the budget tomorrow, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said on Wednesday.Once the budget passes, they hold all the cards.Theyre asking us to vote on the budget for a tax bill they havent shown us on a promise that somehow its going to be fair, even though theyre talking about knocking out SALT, Mr. King said.I dont see how anyone from those districts can vote for the budget under that, even if they promise us something.The challenge facing Republicans is trying to mitigate the revenue-losing effects of cutting tax rates, particularly Mr. Trumps push to reduce the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, which the White House says is nonnegotiable.The budget resolution that is supposed to win final approval on Thursday would allow for $1.5 trillion in additional deficits from tax cuts over the next decade, but the proposed tax cuts already revealed would cost well over $2 trillion.Photo Cutting rates unifies Republicans.Finding offsets, either by eliminating tax deductions or employing accounting tricks, divides them.On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged a long list of still-unresolved issues in the Houses draft bill, which is to be released Nov. 1.They included where to place the income limits for various tax brackets, whether to maintain or cut tax rates on top earners, and the fate of several critical components of the revamped corporate code.Two issues in dispute flared up publicly: changes to retirement savings and to individuals ability to deduct their state and local taxes.Mr. Brady seemed to defend a proposal to drastically lower the cap on tax-free retirement account contributions.He indicated that there were better ways to encourage the bulk of workers to save, even after Mr. Trump declared on Monday that there will be NO change to your 401(k).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Right now, we are not a nation of savers, Mr. Brady said at a breakfast convened by The Christian Science Monitor, adding: We think in tax reform we can create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.Privately, though, a member of House leadership assured lobbyists on Wednesday that retirement account limits would not be touched in the draft bill.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.House Republicans have been considering sharply reducing the amount that Americans are allowed to save, before taxes, in 401(k) retirement plans to $2,400 a year, from the current $18,000, or $24,000 for workers who are over 50.Lowering the cap would be unlikely to encourage more savings, research suggests, but it would amount to an accounting maneuver that would help Republicans make up some of the lost revenue from large cuts to business tax rates.Money in such retirement accounts is taxed when it is withdrawn.By taxing most deposits immediately, Republicans would push future tax revenue into the 10-year budget window they are now working in.Mr. Trump was not giving up.He told reporters that he wanted to quickly end speculation because 401(k)s, to me, are very important.Asked whether he might negotiate over the changes, he replied, maybe well use it as negotiating, then added that Mr. Brady knew how critical the retirement accounts were.Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said the issue of tax rules for retirement savings was far more complicated than Mr. Trumps declaration.Photo Were the ones writing the bill, Mr. Schweikert said.At some point, he gets to agree or veto.And ultimately, we have to make the math work.Mr. Brady also said Republican leaders were seeking a deal on the state and local tax deduction, which they had targeted for elimination.Mr. Brady seemed to suggest the deal could focus on maintaining deductions for property taxes, but not for income or sales taxes.That would reduce the savings from eliminating the deduction to about $1.3 trillion over 10 years, from an estimated $1.9 trillion over 10 years for eliminating the deduction entirely, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.But it may be the key to passing the budget resolution, which appears in jeopardy if Republicans from high-tax states are not pacified.A protracted fight over taxes would be particularly rough on a Republican Party already fraying on the edges.Mr. Trump is feuding with two Republican senators who plan to retire, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, as part of a growing rift between old-guard conservatives and Mr. Trumps new-wave populists in Washington.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the face of those divides, Republican leaders aim to deliver a completed tax bill to Mr. Trumps desk by Christmas.The stakes are rising by the day, as Republican donors and voters worry about the party advancing the legislative priorities it has long espoused.A failure on taxes, after the Republicans did not succeed in repealing the Affordable Care Act, could jeopardize its congressional majorities in the 2018 midterms.The Republicans are finally figuring out if they dont pass this, the political consequences are going to be catastrophic, said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who is advising Mr. Trump on tax policy.The attitude of the conservative base is, If they dont do this, theyre worthless.Finding common ground will only get more difficult as the effects of specific tax changes on constituents become clearer.Polling suggests Republican voters subscribe less to the tax cut philosophy than their elected representatives.A report this week from the Pew Research Center, based on polling in August, found that Republicans were not especially unified in support of tax cuts, said Carroll Doherty, the centers director of political research.A September poll from the online survey company SurveyMonkey found that three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of cutting corporate taxes, which is the centerpiece of the tax plan.But that poll, and a related one in October, found a divide: Republican voters who approve of Mr. Trump were far more likely to approve of corporate tax cuts and to say that they believe their individual taxes will fall next year than those who have turned against the president.The divisions in the party do not, at this point, appear to imperil the tax-cutting effort.Mr. Corker, an outspoken deficit hawk, gave his blessing to parliamentary language that would allow the tax bill to add $1.5 trillion to federal deficits, though he made clear he could still vote against the final legislation.And Mr. Flake diatribe on Tuesday aside is still viewed as a likely yes on whatever tax bill makes it to the Senate floor, provided it survives several weeks of political kicking and screaming.
U.S. Soldiers Were Separated From Unit in Niger Ambush, Officials Say:::::New details emerging from the militarys investigation into the ambush and interviews with military officials and lawmakers have revealed, once again, changes to the timeline in a shifting narrative that has bedeviled top Pentagon officials.It has prompted increasingly frustrated members of Congress to demand answers for how a shadowy mission in an austere region of Africa left four Americans and five Nigeriens dead, including the interpreter.The questions including the missions shifting goals, the intelligence assessment to back it up, how the soldiers were separated and the frantic search for Sergeant Johnsons body were at the forefront on Thursday when senior military officers and their civilian Pentagon bosses traveled to Capitol Hill to give separate two-hour classified briefings for members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who heads the Senate panel and who has criticized the Defense Department for failing to provide lawmakers details of the ambush, praised the briefing without divulging details.But he emphasized that he still had 100 questions that the officials could not yet answer.Pentagon officials said they would need 30 days to wrap up their inquiry, Mr. McCain said.Other senators on the committee said it could take up to 60 days.Army Maj. Gen. Roger L. Cloutier Jr., the chief of staff of the militarys Africa Command in Germany, is leading the inquiry.Its clearer, but theres still a lot of things that they dont know, said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida.Why did it take 48 hours to find Sergeant Johnson?We dont know that yet.Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said many lawmakers were surprised to learn the scope of American military missions in Africa and, in particular, the size of the military presence in Niger, where 800 United States troops conduct training missions and drone operations.I dont think Congress has been completely kept up- to date, Mr. Kaine said.The mystery of what happened that day only deepened as new details emerged from interviews with more than a half dozen military officers, Pentagon officials and lawmakers this week.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the night of Oct. 3, two groups set off in rural southwest Niger.One was a team of American, French and Nigerien commandos on a clandestine operation to kill or capture an Islamic State operative, part of a broader mission code-named Obsidian Nomad.The other group made up of about eight Army Special Forces, three American soldiers in support roles and their interpreter, along with 30 Nigerien troops was on a separate reconnaissance patrol.At some later point, the team was asked to back up the first group if needed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Bad weather scotched the raid, intended to be launched from helicopters.But the second group remained in the region, after being asked by commanders to search further for evidence of the Islamic State jihadist, code-named Naylor Road by the military.On the morning of Oct. 4, the team swung through the village of Tongo Tongo to resupply and met with local elders out of courtesy.Villagers might have tipped off Islamic State militants in the area, Nigerien and American military officials have said.One military official, however, said on Thursday that a villager told the troops that an important Islamic State emir was in the area, possibly alerting them that the extremists were approaching.Shortly after the American soldiers, who were led by an Army captain, and the Nigerien troops left the village, heading back to base about two hours away, some 50 Islamic State militants armed with machine guns and heavy weapons ambushed the group at about 11:40 a.m. local time.Lightly armed with no heavy weapons of their own, the American and Nigerien forces tried to defend themselves.Outgunned and taking casualties, the soldiers tried to stand their ground until additional Nigerien troops rushed to the scene.It was not clear when the Nigeriens, along with French troops, arrived, but American officials indicated that they had made it to the ambush site by the time the seven Americans were evacuated.When troops from the elite Joint Special Operations Command were alerted to the situation, however, they were told that several Americans were missing.That calls into question Pentagon officials earlier assertions that either the Nigerien forces or French helicopters were with the bodies of at least three of the soldiers until they were recovered an insistence that underscores the mantra that no soldier is left behind.The U.S. military does not leave our troops behind, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Eventually, the team of American commandos originally scheduled to target the Islamic State militant the previous night were dropped near the ambush site and found the bodies of three of their comrades: Staff Sgt.Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt.Jeremiah W. Johnson and Staff Sgt.Dustin M.

Justice Department Settles With Tea Party Groups After I.R.S.

The Week Trump Won:::::Reed gives us a moment-by-moment description of what it looks like when one moral order collapses and another takes its place.In less dramatic form, were going through that now.Communism never really took off in America because we already had a secular religion, or rather religious truths rendered in secular form.Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of Britain, described that creed well in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute.He pointed out that the phrase, All men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, would have been unintelligible to Plato or Aristotle or anybody raised in a hierarchical society.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.The profound equality of every individual was an idea that flowed directly from the Hebrew Bible.The story Americans told about themselves was a biblical story an exodus story of various diverse peoples leaving oppression, crossing a wilderness and joining together to help create a promised land.The American social structure, as Sacks notes, was based on biblical categories.There was a political realm, but the heart of society was in the covenantal realm: marriages, families, congregations, communities, charities and voluntary associations.Americas Judeo-Christian ethic celebrated neighborliness over pagan combativeness; humility as the basis of good character, not narcissism.It believed in taking in the stranger because we were all strangers once.It dreamed of universal democracy as the global fulfillment of the providential plan.That biblical ethic, embraced by atheists as much as the faithful, is not in great shape these days.As Sacks notes: Today, one half of America is losing all those covenantal institutions.Its losing strong marriages and families and communities.It is losing a strong sense of the American narrative.Its even losing e pluribus unum because today everyone prefers pluribus to unum.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump and Bannon have filled the void with their own creed, which is anti-biblical.The American story they tell is not diverse people journeying toward a united future.Its a zero-sum struggle of class and ethnic conflict.The traits Trump embodies are narcissism, not humility; combativeness, not love; the sanctification of the rich and blindness toward the poor.As other relationships wither, many Americans are making partisanship the basis of their identity their main political, ethnic and moral attachment.And the polls show that if you want to win a Republican primary these days, you have to embrace the Trump narrative, and not the old biblical one.The Republican senators went to the White House and saw a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimers.But they know which way the wind is blowing.They gave him a standing ovation.Even Alexander Kerensky didnt abase himself so humiliatingly.The people who oppose Trump make a big error: Lets Get Togetherism.This is the belief that if we can only have a civil conversation between red and blue, then everything will be better.But you cant destroy a moral vision with a process.You need a counter-moral vision.The people who reluctantly collaborate with Trump make a different error: economism.This is the belief that Trumps behavior is tolerable because at least Republicans can pass a tax cut.People who believe that value money more than morals.Trumpism is not just economic, and it cant be thwarted by passing a bit of economic policy.This is like 1917, a clash of political, moral, economic and social ideologies all rolled into one.Frankly, I think Americas traditional biblical ethic is still lurking somewhere in the national DNA.But there has to be a leader who can restore it to life.
National Archives Release Files on John F. Kennedys Assassination:::::As a new trove of documents about the killing is released, Peter Baker of The New York Times walks us through whos who in this American tragedy.An infamous mystery meets a president who dabbles in conspiracy theories.Few seem as excited about the release of the final batch of secret documents as the current occupant of the Oval Office.Surely, then, it was just a coincidence that Mr. Trump posted that message while on Air Force One heading to, of all places, Dallas.Or was it?Fifty-three years and 11 months after the event that gave rise to a thousand conspiracy theories, the president even landed at Dallas Love Field Airport, where Kennedys body was brought for the final flight home, and his motorcade came within a few miles of Dealey Plaza, where the fateful shots rang out.Somehow it feels only appropriate that the remaining papers from one of historys most infamous mysteries would be made public by the administration of a president who dabbles in conspiracy theories himself.After all, it was Mr. Trump who during last years campaign suggested that the father of his Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the Kennedy assassination.And one of his longtime advisers, Roger J.Stone Jr., wrote a book blaming the killing on Lyndon B.

Trumps $700 Billion Gift to Wealthy Foreigners:::::There are, in reality, multiple reasons not to believe much of this account, ranging from the fact that a lot of the corporate income we tax represents monopoly profits which wont be competed away even if foreign money comes flooding in to the sheer size of the U.S. economy, which cant pull in lots of foreign capital without driving up interest rates worldwide.Also, to the extent that the story makes any sense at all, its a story about the very long run.In the short run, drawing in foreign money by cutting taxes on profits would lead to a stronger dollar, which would slow the pace of foreign investment by making U.S. assets look expensive.So were talking about a process that would take many years if not decades.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Oh, and the stronger dollar would also mean much bigger trade deficits a consequence of tax cuts that Republicans, strange to say, havent advertised, even though the same thing happened during the Reagan years.Realistically, then, the benefits from cutting corporate taxes would overwhelmingly flow into after-tax profits rather than wages, especially in the first few years and probably for a decade or more.And this in turn means that the main beneficiaries would be stockholders, not workers.So who are these stockholders, exactly?You can guess part of the answer: Were talking mainly about the very affluent.Even if we count indirect holdings in retirement accounts and mutual funds, the richest 10 percent of U.S. residents account for about 80 percent of American-owned stocks, and the richest 1 percent own about 40 percent.So were talking, as always when it comes to Republican plans, about tax cuts heavily tilted toward the wealthy.But thats not the whole story, either it gets worse.The whole sales pitch for the Trump tax plan rests on the claim that everything is different because were now part of a global financial market.The truth is that this makes less difference than many imagine.But one thing is true: These days theres a lot of cross-border investment.In particular, as Steven M. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center notes in a paper I found revelatory around 35 percent of U.S. equities are now owned by foreigners, triple the level during the Reagan years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What this means is that around 35 percent of a tax cut from an administration that proudly uses the slogan America first $700 billion over the next decade wouldnt even go to Americans.Instead, it would be a windfall to wealthy foreigners, who would probably gain a lot more from the tax cut than U.S. workers.Oh, and it makes all that talk about allies not paying their fair share sound kind of silly, doesnt it?And meanwhile, the result would be a huge hole in the budget, which Republicans would try to close at the expense of the poor and middle class.The budget resolution the House and Senate passed over the last week called for cuts of $1 trillion in Medicaid and almost half a trillion in Medicare.The resolution doesnt have the force of law, but its a pretty clear indication of whats next if the big tax cuts pass.Now, it may sound extreme to say that Trump and his allies want to take away health care from millions largely so that they can give wealthy foreigners a $700 billion gift.But however it may sound, its also the literal truth.
Tom Mathews, Promoter of Liberal Causes and Candidates, Dies at 96:::::Mr. Mathews was also involved in Daniel Patrick Moynihans first campaign for public office, an unsuccessful bid in 1965 for the Democratic nomination for New York City Council president (that position is now called public advocate).Mr. Mathewss underdog candidates often lost, but he relished the good fight.To the press corps traveling with Mr. Anderson he was known as Sancho, a nod to what reporters considered the candidates quixotic campaign.In Quest for the Presidency: The 1988 Campaign, a book written by a team of Newsweek reporters including Peter Goldman and Mr. Mathewss son Tom Jr., the authors described him as an idealist in a cynics profession, a stumpy, iron-gray man who actually believed that the new techno-politics could be put to work toward ends larger than winning an election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mathews and his business partner Roger Craver dreamed for years of finding the perfect citizen-candidate, the authors wrote, a man or woman of the center-left with a feel for issues, a history of independence, a winning television manner and, most important of all, a center a core of beliefs more important to him or her than getting elected.For the presidency, besides Mr. Anderson, they pinned their hopes ultimately dashed on John Gardner, a former cabinet secretary in the Johnson administration who founded Common Cause, one of the first so-called citizens lobbies; Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Jimmy Carter in 1976; and Bill Moyers, the journalist and former White House secretary, who said he was not prepared to run for president in 1988.Thomas Richard Mathews was born on Aug. 1, 1921, in Salt Lake City.His father was Wesley Chase Mathews, a railroad worker and a lapsed Mormon descendant of Welsh immigrant coal miners.His mother, the former Edith Alm, was a secretary.The first member of his family to attend college, Mr. Mathews graduated in 1942 from the University of Utah, where he met Bonnie Johnson, who became his wife.Their marriage ended in divorce.In addition to their son Thomas, Mr. Mathews is survived by another son, Colin, and a daughter, Anne; his second wife, the former Ann Anderson; a stepson, Michael Anderson; a stepdaughter, Laura Anderson; 10 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.After serving in the Army Air Forces in Europe during World War II, Mr. Mathews was a reporter and editor for The Salt Lake City Tribune and a feature writer for The San Francisco Chronicle.Pierre Salinger, the incoming White House press secretary in 1960 and a former colleague at The Chronicle, recruited Mr. Mathews to the Kennedy administration.

last-minute campaign by intelligence agencies to redact certain documents.Grudgingly, he gave the agencies until April 26 to go through the remaining papers again and make their case.I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted, Mr. Trump said in a memo to the agencies.Given their objections, he said, I have no choice today but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nations security.But he ordered the agencies to be extremely circumspect, noting that the rationale for secrecy has only grown weaker with the passage of time.For conspiracy theorists, the Kennedy assassination has been the holy grail, one that has produced an endless string of books, reports, lectures, articles, websites, documentaries and big-screen Hollywood movies.It was the first murder of an American president in the television age, touching off a wave of global grief for a charismatic young leader while also spawning a cottage industry of skeptical questioning of the official version of events.Every government authority that has examined the investigation of his death, from the Warren Commission to congressional investigators, concluded that Kennedy was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, who fired three shots with a mail-order rifle from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository when the presidential motorcade passed by on Nov. 22, 1963.But that has never satisfied the doubters, and polls have consistently shown that most Americans still believe that someone other than Oswald must have been involved.While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said in a 1979 report that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy but did not identify who those conspirators might have been.It ruled out the Soviet and Cuban governments, organized Cubans opposing Fidel Castro, the Mafia, the F.B.I., C.I.A.and the Secret Service, although it said it could not preclude that individuals affiliated with some of those groups might have been involved.Among the doubters have been Mr. Trump, who last year alleged that the father of his Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the assassination.The presidents longtime friend and adviser, Roger J.Stone Jr., authored a book accusing Johnson of being responsible for the shooting that elevated him to the presidency.Video As it happened, Mr. Trumps deferral to the C.I.A.and F.B.I.invariably will lead to suspicions that the government is still protecting sensational secrets about the case.Administration officials said there was no cover-up, just an effort to avoid compromising national security, law enforcement or intelligence gathering methods.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The C.I.A., which has borne the brunt of suspicions from amateur assassination theorists for years, went out of its way on Thursday to try to dispel concerns that it was hiding important evidence.The agency issued a statement noting that the vast majority of assassination-related records have been released, and that redactions were intended to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security including the names of C.I.A.assets and current and former C.I.A.officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The release of the documents owes as much to the moviemaker Oliver Stone as anyone else.After his 1991 conspiracy theory movie, J.F.K., stoked renewed interest, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which was signed into law by President George Bush on Oct. 26, 1992.The act mandated that all assassination records be released no later than 25 years from that date, which was Thursday, unless the president authorized further withholding for national security reasons.In the years since the law was passed, the National Archives and Records Administration has released 88 percent of those documents in full and an additional 11 percent with portions redacted.Until Thursday, just 1 percent had been withheld in full.Of the 2,891 documents released on Thursday, just 53 had never been disclosed by the archives; the rest had been made public with redactions.The papers range widely and while many are not directly related to the assassination, others add context.One recounted the reaction of the Soviet Union to the killing, reporting that some in Moscow assumed it was a coup by the ultraright that would be blamed on the Soviet Union.An unnamed informant told American spies that the K.G.B.had proof that President Johnson was responsible for the assassination.An F.B.I.cable from April 1964 reconstructed Oswalds bus trip to Mexico weeks before the assassination, including the names of the people sitting around him and even what he was wearing: a short-sleeved light colored sport shirt and no coat.In Hoovers memo two days after the assassination, he expressed anxiety that Oswalds killing would generate doubts among Americans.The thing I am concerned about, he wrote, is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.The F.B.I.director also fretted that discoveries that Oswald contacted the Cuban embassy in Mexico City and sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington could complicate our foreign relations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He called the Oswald killing inexcusable in light of our warnings to the Dallas Police Department and hinted at Rubys mob connections, which would soon spawn an industry of research and speculation.We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago, Hoover wrote.The documents will not end the debate or speculation and a few may add to the questions.In a 1975 deposition, for example, Richard Helms, the former C.I.A.director, was asked: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an agen But the document ends there, and Mr. Helmss answer is missing.
Border Wall Prototypes Are Unveiled, but Trumps Vision Still Faces Obstacles:::::For one, Congress has not appropriated funds; the Homeland Security Department used money from other programs to pay for the prototypes.The House Homeland Security Committee voted to approve a bill that provides $10 billion for a border wall, but Senate Democrats have vowed to block attempts to provide funding for it.The government would also have to seize land from private landowners, primarily in Texas, where more than 1,200 miles of the 1,900-mile border are.About 95 percent of the land in Texas is privately owned, and by some estimates, hundreds of parcels would need to be taken to construct a wall.In 2008, when Homeland Security tried to build a border wall in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, more than 300 cases in which the government sought to take private land to build the wall ended up in court, records show.Dozens are still pending.In deep-red Texas, where private property is considered sacrosanct, nearly the entire congressional delegation, including most Republicans, has voiced its opposition to such a wall.Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas and one of the partys most outspoken critics of the effort, called it the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.We should be using the money we spend on border walls to invest in technologies such as sensors, camera, and other things, which are a fraction of the cost, Mr. Hurd said.But groups like the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter limits on immigration, see the wall as a key element in the governments efforts to secure the border and said it would most likely stem the flow of illegal drugs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That position echoes statements by Mr. Trump, who has also said the wall would stop illegal immigrants and criminal organizations like the MS-13 gang.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.But homeland security and migration experts say that a border wall is unlikely to stop either.They say the support for a wall ignores the changing dynamics of illegal immigration and the advances in technologies used by the Border Patrol and immigration officials.We have a much better picture of whats happening on the border now more than we ever have, said Doris Meissner, the top immigration official in the Clinton administration and a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.While a wall or barrier in some areas would be useful, trying to build one along the entire border would be wasteful because of all the technology we have and how illegal migration has changed.Most people who are in the country illegally simply overstayed their visas, rather than entering the United States illegally, immigration data show.Visa overstays accounted for 66 percent of the undocumented population in 2014, according to the most recent data available, published in March by the Center for Migration Studies in New York.Immigration experts also note that large numbers of people apprehended at the border were not captured by Border Patrol officers or trying to evade border security; they simply walked up to agents and gave themselves up, asking for asylum.To put it most simply, border barriers will never stop illegal immigration because a wall or fence cannot apprehend crossers, said David J. Bier, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute.Obviously, any obstacle to passage will reduce entries at the margin.But would other options work better and cost less than a $20 billion wall?And according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the vast majority of drugs are smuggled into the country through ports of entry hidden in vehicles or carried by individuals.Current and former officials at Customs and Border Protection acknowledged that a border wall alone would not stop illegal immigration or drugs.But they say it is a critical component of a layered approach to securing the border, along with patrol officers and technology including drones, sensors and cameras.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A wall standing by itself is not going to do the job, said David V. Aguilar, a former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under President George W. Bush.But it is an essential part of a properly designed and deployed border security system.The walls and other types of structures impede illegal crossings and give Border Patrol additional time to react before the border crossers disappear into a waiting vehicle or a city, Mr. Vitello said.Them needing to scale a barrier or choosing that place at the border to cross may change their calculations, and it gives our agents time to make an arrest, he said.The use of border walls has grown around the world, according to research by Elisabeth Vallet, the director of Center for Geopolitical Studies at the University of Quebec at Montreal.The number of border walls has increased to nearly 70, from fewer than 20 in 2005.Since 2015, countries as diverse as Austria, Hungary, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia have announced or begun work on such barriers.But their effectiveness, relative to other technologies, is mixed, according to a review by the Migration Policy Institute.A report by the Government Accountability Office this year found that Customs and Border Protection had not developed a system to determine how border fencing or walls contributed to security.The accountability office noted that although apprehensions of border crossers decreased in areas that had barriers, other factors including terrain, demographics, geography, technology and the number of Border Patrol officers most likely contributed to the drop in traffic as well.While border walls do not stop illegal immigration, they push people into more remote and dangerous areas such as mountains or deserts, said Reece Jones, a professor of geography at the University of Hawaii who has studied border walls around the world.A wall is a powerful symbol, Mr. Jones said.All the other things on the border are hard to see.A wall symbolizes action whether or not it actually does anything.It shows that politicians are doing something to address what they have identified as a threat.
Trump Administration Sends Congress List of Possible Russia Sanctions:::::Under the law, persons who knowingly engage in a significant transaction with these entities could be subjected to sanctions as soon as Jan. 29.Officials said they intended to work with individuals and the United States allies to help them avoid sanctionable activity.The list reads like a whos who of the Russian defense and intelligence sectors.It includes the United Aircraft Corporation, which makes Sukhoi jets and Tupolev passenger airliners; Kalashnikov Concern, which makes the famed assault weapon used around the world; and Rosoboronexport, which is the chief state-owned arms exporter in the country.Democrats and several powerful Senate Republicans, led by Mr. McCain and Mr. Cardin, had grown frustrated in recent days over the delay.Mr. McCain, a fierce critic of Russia, threatened to use his position as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee to try to force the Trump administration to comply.We passed the law.They should execute it, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said earlier on Thursday, before the list was shared with lawmakers.They say they are struggling to identify the companies to sanction.My answer is, sanction the ones you already know and keep adding to the list.The administration answered those criticisms with assurances that it was working to draw up a list of targets, but that with minimal staff in place in the State Department and given the complexity of the legislation, it was taking longer than the law allowed for.A State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said on Thursday that the department was notifying American companies and foreign allies before it would officially release the list.Its complex, its complicated and industry needs to know what will happen if they engage in certain activities, she said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.In a joint statement, Mr. McCain and Mr. Cardin said that the administrations announcement is a step in the right direction.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By issuing guidance for the implementation of the sanctions legislation, the administration is slowly but surely carrying out the law that Congress passed overwhelmingly this summer, the statement said, adding, Congress will continue to conduct oversight of each step to ensure the administration is following both the letter and the spirit of the law.Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that he had spoken with John J. Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, about the matter on Thursday.Congress, Mr. Corker said, will expect thorough and timely consultation until full implementation is complete.The Russia measures were part of a larger sanctions package approved with near unanimous support by the House and Senate and signed by Mr. Trump in early August.The legislation also included sanctions on Iran and North Korea, but it was the Russia sanctions, as well as a provision limiting Mr. Trumps authority to lift them, that most irked the president.The sanctions were seen as a rebuke by lawmakers of both parties of Mr. Trumps friendly posture toward President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and an effort to punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea, its military intervention in Ukraine and its meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Critics of the president have accused Mr. Trump of failing to be aggressive enough toward one of the United States biggest adversaries even as people connected to his administration are being investigated for collusion with Russians during last years race.The United States spy agencies have concluded that the Russian interference began as an effort to hurt Hillary Clintons candidacy, but later tried to explicitly help Mr. Trump.Three congressional committees and a Justice Department special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, continue to investigate how the campaign was carried out and whether Mr. Trumps associates were involved.
Benghazi on Steroids? Niger Claims Range From Premature to Conspiratorial:::::The ambush was not the direct result of Chads inclusion in the travel ban.An image widely shared on Facebook and Twitter states: Trump arbitrarily bans Chad with travel ban.Chad withdraws troops fighting ISIS from Niger.ISIS promptly returns to Niger when Chad leaves.Four Green Berets die as a direct result.But the facts do not support this.Two of the four soldiers killed in the ambush Staff Sgt.Dustin M. Wright and Staff Sgt.Bryan C. Black were Green Berets.The two others were Staff Sgt.Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt.La David T. Johnson.Chad was added to Mr. Trumps updated travel ban in late September.In October around the same time as the ambush Chad withdrew troops from the Diffa region of Niger.But these troops were fighting Boko Haram in the east, while the American soldiers were fighting a different Islamic militant group in Tongo Tongo, a village hundreds of miles to the west.These are two completely different conflicts, said Laura Seay, a professor of African politics at Colby College.Geography aside, she said, there is little evidence that the militants operating in the west were emboldened by Chads withdrawal in the east as they were carrying out attacks pretty regularly before the Oct. 4 ambush.Its too early to conclude whether there was misconduct by the Trump administration.Viral social media posts have called the Niger attack Benghazi on steroids, pointing to alleged misconduct by the Trump administration.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.For example, one post that claims the journalist Dan Rather said that the Trump Pentagon gave these men bad intel, no support, outsourced rescue people.But there is no evidence that Mr. Rather made these remarks, and many details about the Niger ambush have yet to emerge.The Pentagon and F.B.I.are investigating the operation, including discrepancies between American and Nigerien troops accounts about what prompted the attack.Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a news conference on Monday that officials on the ground believed that contact with the enemy was unlikely before American forces set out with a Nigerien unit on a routine reconnaissance mission on Oct. 3.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We owe you more information, General Dunford said, including whether forces had adequate intelligence, equipment and training and whether the pre-mission assessment of the threat in the area was accurate.The viral posts are correct that a contractor evacuated the bodies of three soldiers killed in action, while the French flew out the wounded.Asked why American troops relied on a contractor for evacuation, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the director of the Joint Staff, said last week that the United States relied on contract support around the world, but declined to give specifics about the ambush.But it is inaccurate to suggest American troops played no role at all in the rescue mission.They, alongside French and Nigerien troops, searched for Sergeant Johnson until his body was recovered two nights later, General Dunford said.Responses to the tragedies have differed.Beyond the allegations about the causes of the deaths, observers like Daily Kos and the conservative commentator S.E.Cupp have pointed to the disparity between the two administrations responses to Niger and Benghazi.The Trump administration has been more tight-lipped about the Niger attack than the Obama administration was about Benghazi, though some of the Obama administrations initial claims turned out to be incomplete.In September 2012, militants linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Shariah attacked the United States diplomatic mission and a C.I.A.installation in Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.Obama administration officials initially rejected the notion of a premeditated terrorist attack and, in the immediate days that followed, made repeated references to an anti-Muslim video as causing the unrest a rationale soon revealed to be not entirely accurate.Trump officials, on the other hand, have been largely silent in the three weeks since the Niger ambush.Beyond defending his remarks to Sergeant Johnsons widow, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday afternoon that he did not specifically order the Niger mission, though he gave generals the authority to do whats right so that we win.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, has repeatedly declined to give details about the raid during news conferences.As for inquiries, the F.B.I.began an investigation two days after the Benghazi attacks, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing about a month after.Congress conducted eight investigations of the circumstances surrounding the violence in Benghazi, the last of which concluded last year.In the end, lawmakers broadly chided the State Department for being inadequately prepared but did not find any clear misconduct that caused the deaths.The Pentagon said the Niger incident was under investigation six days after the deadly attack.Lawmakers in both the House and Senate were briefed by two senior Pentagon officials about the details of the attack in a classified session on Thursday, and appeared divided along party lines as to whether the deaths could have been avoided.But senators from both parties agreed that their questions have not been answered.They owe us more information, and I think well get it, Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, told CNN.
Mark Halperin, a Top Political Journalist, Faces Multiple Claims of Harassment:::::In a statement, Mr. Halperin denied any nonconsensual contact with the women who spoke to CNN, but he apologized for his behavior with his ABC News colleagues.During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me, Mr. Halperin said through a spokesman.I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain.For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.Under the circumstances, Im going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.Mr. Halperin left ABC News 10 years ago, and a network spokesman said on Thursday that no complaints had been filed about him during his tenure.The speed with which Mr. Halperin lost major television and book projects his account of the 2016 election was among the most anticipated publishing releases of next year reflected a growing national discussion about the misbehavior of powerful men.Mr. Halperins role as a chronicler of the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

Trump Declares Opioid Crisis a Health Emergency but Requests No Funds:::::This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs, Mr. Trump said, its really, really easy not to take them.He shared the story of his brother Fred, who he said had struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life and implored Mr. Trump never to take a drink advice the president said he had heeded.We are going to overcome addiction in America, the president said.The designation of a public health crisis, formally made by Eric D. Hargan, the acting health secretary, would allow for some grant money to be used to combat opioid abuse, permit the hiring of specialists to tackle the crisis, and expand the use of telemedicine services to treat people in rural areas ravaged by opioid use, where doctors are often in short supply.Mr. Trump said his plan would include a requirement that federally employed prescribers be trained in safe practices for opioid prescriptions, and a new federal initiative to develop nonaddictive painkillers, as well as intensified efforts to block shipments of fentanyl, a cheap and extremely potent synthetic opioid manufactured in China, into the United States.Photo He also said he would act to suspend a rule that currently prevents Medicaid from funding many drug rehabilitation facilities.We cannot allow this to continue, Mr. Trump said.It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.Congressional Republicans as well as law enforcement and physicians groups said the presidents announcement was a crucial first step in building awareness about the opioid crisis and confronting its causes and devastating effects.In a statement, Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the American Medical Associations opioid task force, described it as a move that will offer needed flexibility and help direct attention to opioid-ravaged communities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is plenty of work ahead, Dr. Harris added, and the emergency declaration adds further urgency to this epidemic.But Democrats criticized Mr. Trump for what they characterized as a tepid response to an urgent calamity, arguing that his failure to request funding for the effort revealed a lack of seriousness about addressing the issue.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet, said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.Instead of a commitment to emergency funding for our states and communities, President Trump offered empty words and half-measures.Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, said that no emergency declaration would do much to alleviate the impact of opioids without a substantial commitment of federal money and a clear strategy for overhauling the way the country treats addiction.What we need is for the president to seek an appropriation from Congress, I believe in the billions, so that we can rapidly expand access for effective outpatient opioid addiction treatments, Dr. Kolodny said in an interview.Until those treatments are easier to access than heroin or fentanyl, overdose deaths will remain at record-high levels.Mr. Trumps campaign promise to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to a crucial victory in New Hampshires primary last year.As president, he appointed an opioid commission in March, installing Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race, as chairman.In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.Although Mr. Trump called the opioid crisis a national emergency over the next month, he did not sign a formal declaration of the designation, and the idea ran into stiff resistance in his administration to making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with an issue that has shown no signs of abating.Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue.They said the White House would soon send Congress a request for money to combat opioids, with the goal of including it in a year-end spending package.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Christie praised the president on Thursday for what he called bold action to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out.That includes a drug czar to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of health and human services who would tailor policies and identify sources of funding.Among the questions left unanswered by the presidents announcement is whether the Department of Health and Human Services will use its authority under the public health declaration to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses.Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.Jim Hood, a founder and the chief executive of Facing Addiction, who lost his 20-year-old son, Austin, to an accidental overdose five years to the day before Mr. Trumps announcement, said he was grateful that the president took the time to talk about a crisis that had too often been ignored, but worried that his message missed the mark.That undercurrent that if all of you just decided not to do this, wed be in a better place I can tell you, my son did not decide that he wanted to become addicted, much less die, Mr.Hood said.We might have been much better served by framing this as a very serious illness, a very serious health issue.
The Party of Lincoln Is Now the Party of Trump:::::The nomination of an untraditional candidate from outside the partys mainstream turned the 2016 election into a stress test for Republican partisanship, and it passed with flying colors, Theodoridis wrote.Republicans identify, at a deep psychological level, more strongly with their party than do Democrats, according to Theodoridis: The evidence is rather clear that the modern hyper-polarization is far more characterized by tribal division than by ideological distance.The real story seems to be the growing us-versus-them, in-group/out-group dynamic.If you look at what we call thermometer scores, which have respondents rate their feelings about groups from cold to warm, zero degrees to 100 degrees, the average rating of the other party has dropped from nearly 50 degrees in the early 1980s to temperatures in the 30s today.Theodoridis summed up the conclusions he and his colleagues reached in a blog post in Scientific American in November 2016: Partisanship for many Americans today takes the form of a visceral, even subconscious, attachment to a party group.Our party becomes a part of our self-concept in deep and meaningful ways.In other words, the assumption that many Republican voters would be repelled by Donald Trump turned out to be wrong; instead party loyalty a visceral, even subconscious, attachment takes precedence.In fact, as the political scientists Leonie Huddy, Lilliana Mason and Lene Aare argue in an article in American Political Science Review, the most powerful form of partisanship is not principled, ideological commitment to conservative or liberal policies, but expressive partisanship, which is more of a gut commitment: A subjective sense of belonging to a group that is internalized to varying degrees, resulting in individual differences in identity strength, a desire to positively distinguish the group from others, and the development of ingroup bias.Moreover, once identified with a group or, in this instance, a political party, members are motivated to protect and advance the partys status and electoral dominance as a way to maintain their partys positive distinctiveness.Traditionally, political scientists have measured partisanship by asking voters the following questions: Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?Those who say Republican or Democrat are then asked Would you call yourself a strong Republican/Democrat or a not very strong Republican/Democrat?Independents are asked Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or Democratic Party?Respondents are then ranked on a seven point scale from strong Democrat to strong Republican.Political scientists measure expressive partisanship by looking at responses to more subjective questions, including How important is being a Democrat or Republican to you?, How well does the term Democrat or Republican describe you?and When talking about Democrats or Republicans, how often do you use we instead of they?It turns out, according to Huddy, Mason and Aare, that those who are strong partisans on the basis of emotional and expressive links to their parties feel angrier when threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of victory.In contrast, those who hold a strong and ideologically consistent position on issues are no more aroused emotionally than others by party threats or reassurances.These expressive partisans also feel increased schadenfreude, a complex positive emotion, when they read about bad things happening to or reflecting poorly on a political candidate of the other party.They even feel this positive emotion in reaction to events that are clearly negative.Three other political scientists Shanto Iyengar, Gaurav Sood and Yphtach Lelkes reached a similar conclusion in a 2012 paper, Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.They argue that instead of treating polarization in the general electorate as a conflict over competing policies, the better measure is affective polarization, which is their term for the way voters not only increasingly dislike the opposing party, but are also willing to impute negative traits to the rank-and-file of the out-party.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Iyengar and his co-authors contend that affective polarization has permeated judgments about interpersonal relations, exceeds polarization based on other prominent social cleavages, and that levels of partisan affect are significantly higher in America.In a 2017 paper, All in the Eye of the Beholder: Asymmetry in Ideological Accountability, Iyengar and Sood provide further insight into how so many Republicans found their way to voting for Trump.They demonstrate that partisan voters approval of their partys leaders bears little relationship with their ideological extremity.Because of this, candidates like Trump enjoy considerable leeway to stake out positions at odds with the preferences of their supporters.Iyengar and Sood buttress their analysis by pointing out that from December 2008 to August 2010, Sarah Palins support never once slipped below 69% among Republicans, even though her positions were well to the right of the average Republican voter and she was subjected to brutal ridicule in the liberal media.The growing strength of the kind of partisanship that is widespread today whether you call it visceral, expressive, affective or tribal undermines the workings of democratic governance.Not only are Republicans willing to support Trump, but both Democrats and Republicans are inclined to demonize the leadership of the opposing party.Iyengar and Sood describe this as the boomerang effect: The position attributed to a disliked party perceived as ideologically distant is pushed even further away from the receivers position.For instance, a Democrat who encounters a Republican campaign ad on government spending enlarges the discrepancy between herself and the Republican on the issue.While attention has focused on Trump and the Republican Party (since both are in power), Democrats are hardly exempt from tribalism.After Flake denounced Trump on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement making the point that Flake, like Corker, had waited until he was no longer seeking office to break Republican ranks: Senator Flake voted with Donald Trump 91% of the time.His retirement is a symbol of a Republican Party whose leaders allow Donald Trumps divisive politics to flourish as long as it serves their political interests, and who fail to criticize this dangerous president until its too late.Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton, tweeted: When Dems attack those GOP pols who stand up to Trump, perhaps they are the ones putting party before country, a comment picked up by Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, who added, Yes, this seems to be a case of tribal loyalties coming out at the worst possible time.Along similar lines, Theodoridis and Stephen Goggin, a political scientist at San Diego State, asked 1609 voters whether two unnamed senators were Democrats or Republicans.One of the two was described as the subject of a story headlined Senator Wins Anti-Corruption Award, the other as the subject of a story headlined Senator Admits to Lying.Democrats consistently labeled the anti-corruption senator a Democrat and the liar a Republican, while Republicans took the opposite view.Perhaps most importantly, hyperpolarization is a powerful disincentive to compromise.How can you make concessions to your mortal enemies?To even start negotiations can be viewed, in this context, as surrender.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trumps grip on his party remains firm.A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked Republican voters: Do you consider yourself to be more of a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?The answer: Trump 58, the Republican Party 38.Trumps overall favorability ratings may be terrible (39 percent positive to 56 negative), according to a RealClearPolitics average of the eight most recent surveys, but the generic Democratic advantage is a relatively modest 9.2 percentage points.In an October 15-16 Economist/YouGov survey, Democratic voters said they planned to vote for Democratic House candidates 88-3 and Republicans said they would vote for Republican House candidates 86-3.Independents favored Republican candidates 27-22.These are not the kind of numbers Democrats need to win control of the House or Senate.A number of questions present themselves to us as a nation, most notably: Where are we going?Off a cliff appears to be the answer for now, but who is going to help us climb back up?What can mitigate these developments except disaster?Over time, will we just swing back and forth between parties with no bipartisan achievements at all?What phoenix will rise from the ashes of our tribal partisanship?Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the United States.It is a worldwide problem, which is another way of extending the question.Germany, France and the Netherlands have one answer, still refusing to yield government control to right-wing populists despite the success of ethonationalist insurgencies in all three countries; Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have another answer they are all currently swerving to the far right.Which path will we take?
The Happy Hooker Conservatives:::::In 1927 the French philosopher Julien Benda wrote The Treason of the Intellectuals (La Trahison des Clercs), a short book that pointed a damning finger at the ultra-nationalist thinkers of his time.Photo Benda excoriated them for the intellectual organization of political hatreds.He condemned them for worshiping a cult of success, which says that when a will is successful that fact alone gives it a moral value, whereas the will which fails is for that reason alone deserving of contempt.He warned, prophetically, that this great betrayal of their philosophical vocation, along with their desire to abase the values of knowledge before the values of action had put mankind on the road to the greatest and most perfect war ever seen in the world.Benda is often celebrated by conservative writers for his understanding of how prone intellectuals can be to fatal political misjudgments.Think of Michel Foucaults embrace of Ayatollah Khomeini, Noam Chomskys excuses for the Khmer Rouge, or Naomi Kleins effusions for Venezuelas Hugo Chvez.The list of intellectuals making fools of themselves is long.So where are Bendas conservative disciples today, the ones I remember from panel discussions on the importance of moral character, the dangers of relativism, or the post-modern assault on the concept of truth?Its instructive to read the high-minded defenses of Trump offered by writers in Breitbart, The Washington Times, The Federalist, and the rest of the pro-Trump press.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Their chief argument for Trump is that he won and is therefore a winner.Their argument against Never Trumpers is that we failed and are therefore losers.What about Trumps character?It doesnt matter so long as the Supreme Court remains conservative.Legislative failures are always and only the fault of establishment Republicans.Boorish habits are merely a matter of taste and something of a virtue in the era of snowflakes.As for the criticisms from Flake, Bush, Corker and McCain, who needs moral instruction from those sore losers and political has-beens?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Most telling is the Trumpians inability ever to utter a whisper of criticism of their man.Even Never Trumpers will occasionally find themselves agreeing with the administration over one issue or another.Not so the Trumpians.With instincts that recall the Stalinist intelligentsia of the 1940s, they mix the logical elasticity of the sophist with the unflinching loyalty of the toady.They are never anything except always all in.All this suggests that what the media now trumpets as a looming G.O.P.civil war isnt going to happen.Corker and Flake arent stepping up; theyre bowing out.Political retirees are good for leading charities, not movements.As for the rest of the conservative movement, through its liaison with Trump it is participating in its own moral degradation in much the same way that Xaviera Hollander a Dutch consular secretary who realized she could make a much better living as a call girl and brothel operator became the notorious Happy Hooker of the 1970s.Shameless, yes.Criminal, also.But a runaway success all the same, with a memoir that sold north of 15 million copies and a movie about her starring Lynn Redgrave.The default assumption of nearly every opponent of Donald Trump is that, sooner or later, he is bound to fail, either because he will be overwhelmed by events, undermined by scandal or abandoned by his own supporters.So far, none of that has happened.In one key respect, he is the most successful president in modern times.He has ripped out the ideological foundations on which his party once stood.The Democratic Party was still recognizably itself after Bill Clinton left office.The G.O.P.will not be after Trump is done with it.Like it or not, thats a testament to his charisma and power aided and abetted by those conservative intellectuals who proved so quick to prostitute themselves on his behalf.
As Other Republican Senators Bolt, Lindsey Graham Cozies Up to Trump:::::Im going to try to stay in a position where I can have input to the president, Mr. Graham, 62, said in a lengthy interview.I can help him where I can, and he will call me up and pick my brain.Now, if youre a United States senator, thats a good place to find yourself.Hes very popular in my state, Mr. Graham continued.When I help him, it helps me back home.And I think it probably helps him to be able to do business with an old rival whos seen as a deal maker.To Republican critics of Mr. Trump, Mr. Graham is risking his reputation with such a calculus.Lindsey Graham knows better, said Peter Wehner, who advised former President George W. Bush and is a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.Deep in his heart, he must know that Donald Trump is fundamentally unfit to be president, and he has to pretend that Trump is.And when you engage in a game like that, theres often a cost to it.Mr. Graham is willing to take the risk.Twice in the last two weeks, he has been the presidents golf partner.(Mr. Trump is better, he says.)There have been one-on-one huddles in the Oval Office.And two days before the series of phone calls last week, Mr. Trump brought Mr. Graham along for a 15-minute helicopter flight from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the White House after a trip aboard Air Force One.Few people ever get to join the president on Marine One.Likely no one has been invited to fly as a guest aboard the presidential helicopter after calling the commander in chief the worlds biggest jackass, as Mr. Graham once said of Mr. Trump.(Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the White House, responded by calling Mr. Graham an idiot.)Somehow, though, a president who is famous for nursing grudges appears to have put the past behind him.And despite their differences on immigration, race relations and isolationism Mr. Trump and Mr. Graham have become Washingtons oddest odd couple, working together to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut taxes and increase military spending.We have become friends while working to get health care and tax cuts for the American people, Mr. Trump said in an email response to a question about their relationship.Senator Graham is a fighter and a good person.Photo That has not always

lashed out.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists, and people like Ms. Heyer, the president said on Twitter.Such a disgusting lie.He just cant forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!Some Republicans said they were not

senator was engaged in a delicate dance.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont give him any demerits on supporting him where they agree on policy, Mr. Murphy said.Health care has been one of those areas.Mr. Graham first opposed, then supported, the Senates unsuccessful effort to pass a narrow skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act this summer.Frustrated and unwilling to give up, Mr. Graham used a private meeting in the Oval Office to urge support for a plan that relies on block grants to states.When that plan stalled, the private meeting gave it new life, according to former Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has been helping develop the block grant proposal.We were getting nowhere until Lindsey met with Trump, and Trump said, Hey, youve got to start working with these guys, Mr. Santorum recalled.They were paying us lip service until Trump said, Hey, I want this to happen.As Lindsey got Trump more engaged, the White House got more engaged.Mr. Graham said he was trying to help Mr. Trump turn his message into legislative success, adding: I think what he sees in me is a guy that is willing to try to find a way to make something happen.Im willing to do things that sometimes other Republicans wont.But Mr. Wehner cautioned that Mr. Graham must be careful.Theres a rule of thumb when it comes to Donald Trump: Everybody who gets close to him or supportive of him in one way or another is stained by him, he said.I suspect that Lindsey Graham is going to find that out the hard way.Hell be used.The senator insists he is frank with Mr. Trump when he disagrees with him.For instance, Mr. Trump wants to do away with the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires a 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation.Mr. Graham wants to keep it.We argue about this all the time, the senator said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Looking ahead, Mr. Graham envisioned working with the president on issues as varied as an immigration overhaul Mr. Trump has credibility no one else has and a minimum-wage increase, which Mr. Graham says he intends to introduce when the Senate considers revamping the tax code.He said Mr. Trump loved the idea.Mr. Grahams Republican colleagues in the Senate, meanwhile, are keeping close watch on the newfound friendship.Lindsey and the president are the most interesting couple in Washington, said Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is Mr. Grahams co-sponsor on the health care measure.They kind of fuss with each other, and then they go play golf.Mr. Corker offered another possible reason for their bonding: Lindseys fun!Mr. Graham says much the same about the president: Hes a lot of fun.Hes just like me.Hes just a B.S.artist on the golf course.
The Madness Behind Trumps Madman Strategy:::::Kennedys conduct during the Cuban missile crisis was the opposite of the current presidents swaggering, ill-informed recklessness.In essence, Kennedy put into practice the ideas of the great civilian strategists, who counseled showing resolve through firm declarations of resistance and sober clarifications of military capacity, while leaving an adversary a palatable opportunity to back down and the diplomatic channels through which to do so.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In contrast to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon took repeated turns at playing the madman.In 1969, during negotiations with North Vietnam, he sent a squadron of 18 nuclear-armed B-52s toward Moscow and staged a worldwide nuclear readiness alert, all to appear so unbalanced that the Soviets would pressure Hanoi to give in.I want the North Vietnamese to believe Ive reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war, he told his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman.Historians continue to debate how effective Nixons maneuver was; the Soviet Union was taken aback, but then again the American role in the war lasted three and a half more years.But its also important to remember that Nixon was not in fact a madman and chose his irrational moves with precision.An old foreign-policy hand, he knew exactly whom he was dealing with in Moscow and Hanoi, and could predict with reasonable accuracy how they would react.Yet even then, the results were inconclusive.Put differently, the short history of nuclear confrontation demonstrates that effectively controlling the risks of nuclear war depends acutely on the personality of a particular president.It matters greatly that the world assumed Nixon was rational, and that many in the world harbor concerns about Mr. Trump.There is a crucial difference between playing against type to introduce new doubts and playing to type to reinforce existing ones.For example, critical to Nixons strategy was what he said to Haldeman that hed been pushed too far, implying that he would return to his senses if the Soviets and North Vietnamese gave in.But does anyone think Mr. Trump would do the same?Consider the discombobulated way his administration has approached North Korea.Some members of his national security team are apparently trying to apply the sort of approach that the Cuban missile crisis enshrined, emphasizing diplomatic and economic pressure and characterizing military measures as a last resort.But Mr. Trump himself has frustrated and undermined them, doubling down on his own wayward improvisations by belittling Mr. Kim personally and proclaiming he wont be around much longer.Meanwhile, he has undercut American diplomatic efforts on issues from the Iran nuclear deal to trade negotiations.His threats to North Korea arent a case of temporary madness; theyre standard operating procedure.Its hard to see the North Koreans backing down in hopes that Mr. Trump will return to reason and be a stable, rational negotiating partner.The real risk here is that Mr. Trump does not actually understand the scope of the challenge he faces on the Korean Peninsula and that he may in fact mean what he says in his threats.Any of the United States three basic offensive options an all-out preventive attack on North Koreas nuclear and missile facilities; a limited attack on those sites; or surgical special operations to overthrow or decapitate the regime could set off North Korean artillery barrages against the people of Seoul (and the nearly 30,000 American military personnel in South Korea) and wider war in the region, potentially up to the nuclear level.Mr. Trump may be clueless about nuclear strategy and incapable of empathizing with the South Koreans.But even he should blanch at immersing the United States in a destructive, unnecessary and ignominious war in Asia.
Trump Made the Swamp Worse. Heres How to Drain It.:::::In the financial sector, a web of regulatory subsidies sustains financial institutions unhealthy reliance on extremely high levels of debt.These subsidies, including policies that strongly encourage mortgage securitization as well as the implicit promise to bail out too big to fail institutions, swell profits in the near term while increasing the systemic risk of a catastrophic meltdown in the long run.The result is a financial sector much bigger than the economy needs, chronic misallocation of capital and the diversion of some of the countrys top talent into counterproductive work.Luring people into excessive debt, draining their savings with hidden fees, inflating the next asset bubble these and other dubious contributions by finance to the economy need to be curtailed.Intellectual property laws are supposed to encourage innovation by granting temporary monopolies to copyright and patent holders.But if those monopolies get too broad and too onerous, innovation takes a hit and that is precisely what has happened, at the urging and for the benefit of Hollywood, Big Pharma and some interests in Silicon Valley.Occupational licensing rules at the state level help explain why professionals in the United States are paid so much more than their peers in other countries.Primary care physicians, for example, make 50 percent more in the United States than in other advanced countries, and specialists do even better.State regulations protect the incomes of doctors, dentists, undertakers and optometrists not to mention makeup artists and auctioneers while also stifling innovation.Increasingly severe constraints on building in high-income coastal cities inflate the asset values of affluent homeowners, contributing significantly to rising disparities in wealth.And by making housing unaffordable, they prevent the less well-off from moving to where the good-paying jobs are, reducing geographic and social mobility.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.This regressive regulatory swamp isnt a natural landscape; it grows because of forces in our political environment.The beneficiaries of upward redistribution are always far more organized than those who pay the costs.They can divert some of their artificially high profits into lobbying and policy research that bestow a patina of the public interest on schemes that are, in practice, legalized robbery.Drugmakers, for example, portray even the most modest retrenchment of patent law as catastrophic for American innovation, while financiers warn that any restraint on subsidized risk-taking (through higher capital requirements, for example) will starve American industry of the capital it needs to invest and grow.This unequal battle for the minds of policymakers is particularly damaging at a time when the resources that Congress and the bureaucracy have for independent research have been systematically dismantled.In finance, in particular, Congress has a difficult time hiring and retaining staff with the technical knowledge and experience to assess the impact of new regulations, leaving them dependent on the abundant resources of the industry itself.In addition, many regressive regulations are made in obscure places with limited participation, such as state licensing boards and town councils in charge of approving new housing.Insiders with narrow interests, whether self-serving professional groups or Nimby neighbors, have the motivation and resources to show up at poorly attended meetings and work the system, often at odds with the general publics interest in low prices and economic opportunity.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Really draining the swamp means changing the policymaking process to shield it against insider takeover and manipulation.For starters, congressional staffs need to be expanded, upgraded and professionalized.Legislators would then be better able to make their own assessments of complex regulatory issues without having to depend on the biased expertise of industry lobbyists.Philanthropists need to put their dollars behind a network of organizations to counter the organizational presence of the forces of upward redistribution.The Ford Foundation did this in the 1970s by investing in a network of environmental law firms like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.More recently, the Eli and Edythe Broad, Walton Family, Robertson and other charitable foundations have made similar investments in educational reforms.Whatever you think of the merits of these causes, the new interest groups funded by sustained philanthropy changed the political landscape in these issue areas, forcing policymakers to recognize that there were, in fact, two sides to be considered.A network of new organizations with the resources and expertise to compete with big banks, the medical lobby and other industry groups could have a similar impact today.Activist groups could show up regularly in all the obscure places where rules are set and make sure that someone speaks up for the public interest.State and local governments need to institute regulatory review procedures that expose back-room deals to objective scrutiny.While cost-benefit analysis by the Office of Management and Budget is standard for new federal regulations, no such reviews are conducted when states propose to license new occupations or cities stymie new housing construction.Courts at all levels need to be less deferential to regulatory schemes that in contrast to environmental or labor regulation have no justification other than the protection of incumbent interests.For example, courts could force legislatures to explicitly approve expansions in the scope of occupational licensing, depriving licensing boards of the power to do so in shadowy obscurity.In the political arena, the issues of regressive regulation cut across the usual partisan and ideological battle lines, and so tend to be kept off the agenda by legislative leaders who emphasize issues that hold their caucus together.Libertarian-leaning conservatives and egalitarian liberals need to forge strange-bedfellows coalitions to tackle policies that are simultaneously bad for growth and inequality.In recent years, cross-party coalitions in the states have started to make progress on criminal justice reform.Opposition to upward redistribution can galvanize support for similar alliances on regulatory issues.The administration of Donald Trump has shown no interest in draining the real swamp that is drowning Americas economy and corrupting its politics.If public-spirited Democrats and Republicans fail to do so, trust in democracy will continue to erode.And the next demagogue who cashes in by saying he alone can fix things is likely to be more disciplined and focused than Mr. Trump and hence even more dangerous.
Will Politics Tarnish the Supreme Courts Legitimacy?:::::Although the chief justice had not, in fact, posed a question, Mr. Smith ventured an answer: It may be that you can protect the court from seeming political, but the country is going to lose faith in democracy, big time.A cogently expressed concern, cogently countered.Will Chief Justice Roberts derive comfort from the damned if you do, damned if you dont nature of the choice before the court?Not likely, but thats not my point.Its easy enough to poke a sharp stick in the chief justices late-acquired worry about the Supreme Court sullying its hands in politically fraught cases.What about Citizens United, one might ask, or Shelby County v. Holder, with the chief justices majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 dismantled the recently reenacted Voting Rights Act?Thats not my point either.Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late, Justice Felix Frankfurter once wrote.He might have said the same for the judicial modesty the chief justice seemed to be advocating when it comes to addressing gerrymanders.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Id like to take seriously the chief justices evident worry about the Supreme Courts legitimacy and play it out a bit.The concern is not a new one for John Roberts.It infused his dissenting opinion two years ago in the same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges.Last April, shortly after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice Roberts spoke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and expressed the fear that the sharply partisan confirmation process would damage the court in the publics view.It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch, he said then, adding: It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.So I can only imagine what the chief justice felt last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, stood next to President Trump and made this public declaration: The single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.And assuming, as I do, that Chief Justice Roberts is a close student of public opinion polls, I wonder what he makes of a new Gallup Poll, out last month, showing that for the first time since 2008 more Americans say the Supreme Court is too conservative rather than too liberal.The gap isnt huge 30 percent too conservative to 23 percent too liberal but the shift in public perception is sudden and significant.In 2015-16, following the same-sex marriage ruling, too liberal outstripped too conservative with a gap of 17 percent.Gallups analysis suggests that the shift may be less because of any specific cases than of public knowledge that Republicans control two branches of government and seem to be in a position to exert heavy influence on the third.In other words, the public is seeing the court and its future not in isolation but in context.The chief justice also has to know that for the first time in the courts modern history, the individual justices are ideologically aligned with the party of the president who appointed them.There are no crossovers, no William Brennan or Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, Republican-appointed justices who ended their careers as liberals, and no Byron White, appointed by President John F. Kennedy and a dissenter from the courts liberal rulings on abortion and criminal procedure.That in itself is cause for concern for a chief justice inclined to worry that people will look at Supreme Court justices and see partisans.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I assume these thoughts were not far from his mind as he mused aloud during the gerrymander argument.And Id like to suggest that rather than wringing their hands, progressives might take heart.Whatever happens with this case a harder case than many good-government types have admitted publicly or even privately there are many more political hot-button cases on their way to the Supreme Court: voter ID cases, racially discriminatory redistricting cases, even other gerrymander challenges litigated under different constitutional theories.In the recent past, Chief Justice Roberts has seemed to me a bit too openly eager to get the courts hands on these issues.Twice in the past term, the court decided against taking up highly charged political cases.It let stand lower court rulings that invalidated a voter ID requirement in Texas and that deemed discriminatory a series of voting changes in North Carolina.In each case, the chief justice, writing only for himself, issued statements to underscore that the court was bypassing the cases for essentially procedural reasons and not because the justices agreed with the lower court rulings.These solitary personal statements in the Texas and North Carolina cases served no purpose that I could discern other than to keep up the spirits of the states that would continue to defend their problematic statutes.The Texas voter ID case is highly likely to return to the court.When it does, and when similar cases arrive at the Supreme Courts door as the next redistricting cycle grows ever closer, will the chief justice take the court into the fray, or will he think back to what he said to Paul Smith and decide that the courts interests are best served by sitting it out?
The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs:::::Advertisement The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs Image The term pork barrel spending has been around for well over 100 years.It means using government funds on local projects that are primarily used to bring more money to a specific representatives district.Credit Matt Cardy/Getty Images No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions.In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million.(Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, sweeteners or pork barrel spending.The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the Frontier States provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy.In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it.But theres little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be.A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the laws passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign.But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.Thats when Section 508 was added.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospitals location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area.Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments.Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because theyre separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated.About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted.Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A.were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it.On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases high 508 recipient hospitals received a 10 percent boost.How did hospitals spend the extra money?Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients about 8 percent more per year.They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies.But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital.Over all, high 508 recipient hospitals had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have.There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.If you told me in advance that wed find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised, Mr. Cooper said.We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years.But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically.In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in, Mr. Cooper said.Its not that any single one is hugely offensive.Its their accumulation and continuation over time.Although Mr. Coopers research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent.In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the states rural hospitals.The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as rural in Massachusetts on the wealthy island of Nantucket.None of this is surprising.A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected.Passing expansive legislation like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A.is hard, especially when legislators cant point to specific benefits for their constituents.But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.You cant get upset at a snake for having fangs, Mr. Cooper told me.We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives.We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that weve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed.The same argument holds for health care.When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, its too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.Weve been close to a possible solution.The A.C.A.called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs.The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings.But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.Americas increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like.But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits if any go to a favored few.Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system.Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Dhruv Khullar , M.D., M.P.P., is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a researcher at the Weill Cornell Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.Follow him on

Democrats Lack Strong Challengers for Some Vulnerable G.O.P. House Seats:::::Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats dont have a candidate who raised $100,000.On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree.In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.Democratic Fund-Raising Lagging in Working-Class Districts Democratic share of fund-raising in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018, by white educational attainment.20% 40 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with degree Democratic share of fund-raising 20% 30 40 50 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with a college degree Democratic share of fund-raising There is still plenty of time for Democrats to find candidates in those districts.And even in working-class areas, Democrats are doing far better at recruiting and fund-raising than in recent years.They have attracted strong recruits in many competitive working-class districts, like Maines Second, New Yorks 21st and Illinoiss 12th.Democrats even have well-funded challenges in a few working-class districts that werent bound to be competitive at all, like Paul Ryans district in Wisconsin, Kentuckys Sixth or Kansas Second.And working-class districts are often in less expensive media markets, making it easier for Democrats to make a late bid.Photo The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York.Theyve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen.If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race.But theres a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the partys general election chances.Theres a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.Democrats Have Many Candidates in Well-Educated Districts Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 40 60 6 4 2 0 Number of Dems over $100k Whites with a degree Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 30 40 50 60 6 4 2 0 Pct.whites with a degree Number of Dems over $100k The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm.In these areas, theres no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to do something about Mr. Trumps presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Womens March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgias Sixth District special election.Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers.The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas.There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts.Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in Californias typically competitive 10th District in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.The good news for Democrats is that they dont need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if its a so-called wave election year.Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the G.O.P.starts from a position of strength: The Democrats path to a House majority is much more challenging than it was in 2006, or than it was for the Republicans in 2010.They cant afford to leave many districts like New Yorks 24th or Californias 21st off the board.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked:::::Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as disputed.But how effective are these measures?To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions.But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts.Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebooks interventions.Yales Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings.First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon.False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before.This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline disputed.We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting peoples beliefs.Photo In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of disputed labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate an implied truth effect.If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct there are far too many for humans to check everything).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style disputed banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed.The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as somewhat or very accurate in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook disputed banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition.It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is rated false.(We find no evidence of a large implied truth effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)Other results suggest further reason for caution.Back in April, Facebook provided users with Tips to Spot False News in an article that was linked above users news feeds.We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive.When we showed a warning reminding users to remain skeptical and think critically to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false.Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered.(A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)
A Big Test of Police Body Cameras Defies Expectations:::::After the public uprising in response to the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., advocates and many police officials turned to cameras as a way to reduce violent encounters and build trust.By 2015, 95 percent of large police departments reported they were using body cameras or had committed to doing so in the near future, according to a national survey.Photo The cameras provide an independent, if sometimes ambiguous, record of police-civilian encounters.Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect.That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts.Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras.The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.The Rialto study had a big impact in policing.Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website.A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras.(Results are due out this spring.)But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington.Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video.The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date, said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues.It was not directly involved in the research.The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more.The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost.In Washington, M.P.D.officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day.About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.Video The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations.In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place.Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures, Mr. Yu said.In cities that have weaker policies, its certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.Like other advocacy groups, the American Civil Liberties Union has supported body cameras.But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U.of D.C., should give us pause.For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras.But they admit to being surprised by the findings.I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave, said the M.P.D.chief, Peter Newsham.Why didnt the cameras change behavior?After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior.Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages.Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations and not elsewhere.One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them.But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new.(The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.)Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context.The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters.When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior, said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.Photo Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems.After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the citys police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here, Chief Newsham said.Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory.(The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.To Chief Newsham, the cameras primary benefit is to improve relations with the community.The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I dont think you can undervalue that, he said.So far, its hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said hed like to find out more through additional studies like this one.The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).We like to be very anecdotal in policing to compare this year to that year, said M.P.D.Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers.This study is a whole other thing.An updated version of this article, with more about the national implications of the Washington, D.C., study of police body cameras, can be found here.
The Fed Claims to Be Independent. Thats Mostly a Myth.:::::Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul.Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both.Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher.Congress is also more likely to act when electoral rewards are greatest.If one party controls both the White House and Congress, voters know whom to reward or blame.If the parties divide power, voters have a harder time.Congress is more likely to threaten action than to take it.Using legislative records to document lawmakers attention to the Fed, we examined all the bills introduced in the House and Senate between 1947 and 2014 that address the power, structure and governance of the central bank.Over nearly seven decades, 333 House and Senate members introduced 879 bills.Fingers Point at the Fed When the Economy Misfires Higher unemployment is correlated with the number of congressional bills between 1947 and 2014 addressing the power and governance of the Fed.1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Viewing the number of bills introduced each year (1947-2014) in the context of when the unemployment rate was above its median makes the pattern clear.When the economy hums, lawmakers leave the Fed alone.For example, congressional attention dropped markedly during Alan Greenspans Great Moderation starting in the 1980s, when the Fed tended to achieve its mandates.When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.The Fed today remains caught in the cross hairs of partisan polarization.Republican proposals to limit its discretion, for instance, would require the Fed to adopt rate-setting monetary policy rules.Others want greater transparency from the Fed, such as allowing auditors to review monetary policy deliberations.Even though the current Fed is still occupied by Obama appointees, Democrats are also critical, favoring stronger limits on emergency lending.Threats matter because they restrict Fed autonomy.Fed officials understand that responsiveness, sometimes even deference, to their congressional bosses lessens the chance that Congress and the

term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy.A decade after the financial crisis and near generational lows in unemployment, the Fed is finally unwinding its four-plus-trillion-dollar balance sheet, gradually raising interest rates and keeping an eye on inflation that has been below the desired target.This Fed seems eager to drop Mr. Bernankes crisis prescriptions.At her September news conference, however, Ms. Yellen reminded market participants that future policy makers would have a free hand to follow the Bernanke playbook the next time the country faces a financial crisis.Rates could return to zero, the balance sheet could be expanded, and so-called forward guidance could provide clear communication about future policy.Political interdependence cautions against such certainty.Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernankes unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats.And President Trumps rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Feds financial crisis response.A new Fed, backed by an expanding economy, may temporarily quiet the legislative critics.But whether in this presidential term or some later one, an inevitable economic slowdown or a more serious financial panic will surely restart the cycle of crisis, blame and reform.
Bipartisan Health Proposal Is Too Late for 2018, but a Salve for 2019:::::It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacares rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments.The draft bill would make the application process for such state innovation waivers easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with comparable affordability to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.It would allow more Americans to sign up for very high-deductible insurance plans known as catastrophic insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The current law limits those plans to customers under 30 years old, or those who have demonstrated they cannot afford other insurance options.The draft legislation would also ensure that the federal government assigns money for advertising about the Obamacare enrollment period and for hiring professionals to help customers select and sign up for plans; the money would be a portion of the fees it collects from insurers selling plans on HealthCare.gov.The Trump administration had slashed the budget for both programs in August.It does not include one of the industrys biggest requests: funding that would protect insurers from high costs associated with very expensive patients.Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums.But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves.Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, Americas Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill.But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market.Weve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable, said Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, a large for-profit insurer that offers Blue Cross plans in several states, although he praised lawmakers efforts to provide more certainty in 2019.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The deals prospects in Congress remain uncertain.Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it.In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next years health plans.Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored.(The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)For 2018, it probably wont happen in time, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely.The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and its very important for 2019.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier.This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trumps threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason.Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bills two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isnt passed far in advance.Many insurers had been hoping that the Alexander-Murray legislation would make the funding permanent.While Mr. Trump has insisted he will not support any legislation that he believes to be a bailout to the insurers, policy experts say the insurers are getting only what they are due under the law.Because the insurers set the prices for their 2017 plans assuming they would receive the federal funding, the presidents decision represents more than $1 billion in lost payments, according to a recent analysis from Avalere Health, a consulting firm.The funding has not contributed to outsize profits for the insurers selling individual policies under the law, in spite of Mr. Trumps recent tweet about the insurers who have made a fortune w/ OCare.Most insurance companies have lost money trying to pursue these exchange markets, said Dan Mendelson, Avaleres president.Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are not allowed to pocket more than 20 percent of their premium dollars for overhead and profits.If they earn more, they are required to return the excess to consumers through rebates.The insurers generally lost money in the first three years of the Obamacare market, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst for Standard & Poors, though it appears they were faring better this year, before the cancellation of government payments.It is not a market that has been profitable for them, he said.While there are exceptions, most insurers are making their money in other insurance markets like the government programs Medicare and Medicaid as well as in the much larger employer market.It gives the market some measure of predictability, Mr. Banerjee said, but he emphasized that the legislation is not a permanent solution.Much of what it does is restore the funding that already existed before President Trumps announcement that he was cutting it off.Its not a huge additional support for the market.
Democrats Think Men Have It Easier. Republicans Disagree.:::::Ninety-six percent of respondents say gender equality is important, but they disagree on whether it has been achieved.Half say the country hasnt gone far enough in giving women equal rights, about 40 percent say it has been about right, and 10 percent say it has gone too far.A Partisan Divide on the Benefits of Changing Gender Roles Changing gender roles have made it easier for: REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree Republicans Democrats Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree There really is no consensus among the public about whether changing roles have made things better or easier for families or for men and women, said Juliana Horowitz, associate director of research at Pew and an author of the report.Although there are small gender gaps, the partisan divide drives the differences in responses, she said.Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say changing gender roles had improved peoples lives.College graduates were also more likely than those without college degrees to say that changing gender roles were a good thing, and that more needed to be done.Of college graduates, 69 percent said men had it easier, compared with 27 percent of those with a high school education or less who said so.Seventy-one percent of college graduates said changing gender roles had given women more satisfying lives, compared with 49 percent of those without college degrees.Views about gender equality reflected experiences with gender discrimination, particularly at work.Women, Democrats and college graduates were much more likely to say they were discriminated against because of their gender, and more likely to think gender equality had not gone far enough.Male privilege allows men to be free to move about in public without threat of harassment, a woman, 54, told Pew, which published responses anonymously.When they speak, they are assumed to have some authority without having to prove it.They still earn more money than women.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Republican men were more likely than Democratic men to say they had experienced discrimination.And while only 10 percent of the public said the country had gone too far toward gender equality, 23 percent of men who said they experienced discrimination said so.The largest shares of both men and women who said they experienced gender discrimination said it came in hiring, pay or promotions.Ten percent of women said they had experienced harassment or catcalling.People who say women have it easier these days say women get preferential treatment in job opportunities, and those who think men have it easier say they have better pay and job opportunities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When asked how women have it easier, one respondent, a 53-year-old man, said, Lower standards for the same positions in order to get more women for those positions.Another man, 46, said: Everyone is on the prowl for perceived injustice and attempts to elevate women of all ages.Not so much for males.Explaining why men have it easier, a 29-year-old man said, You simply need to look at the percentages of male C.E.O.s and relative salaries to see there is likely a systematic advantage to being male.Women have benefited more than men from being employed and from having men doing more at home, respondents said.But even for women, fewer than half of respondents said changing gender roles had benefited them outside work.This might be because even though most women work and men do more at home, women still shoulder the bulk of the family responsibilities.When asked how its easier to be a man, one respondent, a woman, 65, said: Because most of them dont have to work outside the home and take care of the children and everything else a woman normally does.A womans work is never done.
Googles Founders Wanted to Shape a City. Toronto Is Their Chance.:::::The Sidewalk Labs proposal in the competitive bid for the project floated all kinds of technological dreams: a thermal energy grid that would be carbon neutral, sensors that separate waste from recycling, modular buildings that convert from retail to housing, monitors that track noise and pollution, self-driving transit shuttles, shared-ride taxibots, adaptive traffic lights, delivery robots, heated bike paths and sidewalks that melt snow on their own.In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together.Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, its easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as youre redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.Photo The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially.The tech industry is better known in its Silicon Valley backyard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic.And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceship designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities.Theres no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city building.Its hard to move fast and break things in government, and public funds dont allow for the failure rates that venture capital does.New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later.But you cant do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Theres also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable.They resist omniscient engineering.And past efforts at doing that whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias have invariably failed for that reason.Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it.Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we havent developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply.Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem we havent developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms.The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley.Its staffed by both technologists and government alums.Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types.And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.Photo We all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction, Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started.Good friction is serendipity, its opportunity, its diversity, its seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning.Bad friction is congestion, its pollution.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The technologists temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction.And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics.In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop thats still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.Because its looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developers parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks.But there would be no point in doing all that if there werent thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto.(Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.)The challenge now amid all the carbon-neutral, internet-enabled robot-monitor sensors will be to keep those humans in mind.
Trumps Attack on Insurer Gravy Train Could Actually Help a Lot of Consumers:::::The insurer-regulator hack will mean that navigating the Obamacare marketplace will be more complicated for consumers (more on that later).And the change will cost taxpayers more money perhaps $21 billion more in 2018 alone.But, in the end, most customers will be unharmed by the presidents decision, and a substantial fraction will be better off, able to buy plans for about the same price they pay now, yet with lower deductibles.The presidents move was to cut off a form of Obamacare funding known as the cost-sharing reduction subsidies.Those were payments the government made to health insurers to compensate them for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income customers.But he didnt cut off another, more important form of subsidy.The Affordable Care Act also includes tax credits that help low- and middle-income Americans pay their insurance premiums.Those tax credits increase in value along with the price of a certain midlevel insurance plan, known as silver.If you qualify for a subsidy, you can never be asked to pay more for that plan than a set fraction of your income.Insurers in more than 40 states have decided to compensate for the missing cost-sharing subsidies by making hefty increases to the prices of this silver plan but small or no increases to their other plans.Consumers who qualify for subsidies are still asked to pay the same fraction of their income toward a health plan, and the federal government pays the insurers the rest of the higher silver-plan premium.So consumers are no worse off, and insurers make up for the loss of the cost-sharing subsidies canceled by Mr. Trump.And for many Obamacare consumers, theres also a silver lining in these pricier silver plans.There are other kinds of plans being sold on the marketplace: high-deductible plans called bronze and low-deductible plans called gold and platinum.Consumers can use their subsidy to buy any color plan they like.And, with the price of silver plans rising faster than the other categories, most consumers with subsidies will now be able to buy a lower-deductible health plan for the same price as the silver plans that are currently most popular on the exchanges.(They can also choose to buy high-deductible bronze plans for very low prices, or in some cases get them free.)This was a backdoor, unintended way of increasing premium subsidies for some people, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.The new pricing structure is the worst for people who earn too much to qualify for a subsidy those earning more than four times the federal poverty level, or about $100,000 a year for a family of four.But most of them will also be protected from the cost increases.If they avoid silver plans sold on the Obamacare marketplaces in most states, they can find plans that dont have the special, Trump-prompted increases.That means that unsubsidized customers who want to buy silver plans will probably need to shop outside of HealthCare.gov, through a human or online broker.Or they can buy a bronze, gold or platinum plan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a convoluted kludge of a workaround, said David Anderson, a research associate at the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy, who has looked closely at how carriers are pricing their plans.But Mr. Anderson said he thought the upside was strong enough that Congress should abandon its efforts to restore the canceled subsidies.A lot of people are going to see during open enrollment that they are going to be able to afford a better plan with lower deductibles and lower premiums than they could this year, he said.There are still downsides.It is possible that insurers, worried about the lost payments and thin on trust for the federal government, will flee the markets before the enrollment period starts at the beginning of next month.But no major insurer departures have been announced since the president announced his decision on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There are a few states where insurance regulators didnt allow insurers to increase only their silver plan prices.In those states, subsidized customers will be held harmless but no one will get a cheaper gold plan, and unsubsidized customers will face price increases.There are some states where there is no individual market outside the Obamacare marketplace, and in those places, unsubsidized customers wont be able to get a good deal on a silver plan (though they can still buy another color plan).Perhaps the biggest problem: Shopping for a plan is going to be harder.Many Obamacare customers who just renew this years plan will be passing up a better deal, and many scared of initial sticker shock may not realize there are cheaper options.In addition to eliminating the cost-sharing reduction subsidies, President Trumps administration has also cut back on funds for advertising about the marketplaces and on professionals who help customers sign up.(The Alexander-Murray deal would restore much of that funding, but probably not soon enough to make a big difference.)Its hard, said Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration official and co-founder of a new nonprofit group, Get America Covered, focused on helping spread the word about Obamacare enrollment.She says she worries about growing consumer confusion: My biggest concern is really I do not believe that the administration will educate people about this, and so there is going to be an information gap.But the Congressional Budget Office, when considering the effects of ending the cost-sharing subsidies a few months ago, concluded that, over time, the strategy of raising the price of only silver plans would become widespread, and that consumers would figure it out.It estimated that, by 2020, a world with no cost-sharing reductions would be a world with fewer uninsured Americans.The increased subsidies would make purchasing nongroup insurance more attractive for some people, increasing sign-ups, the report said.Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murrays newly announced proposal would fund the payments for two years, increase advertising for the marketplaces and make it easier for states to experiment on how they run their insurance markets.Mr. Trump has indicated that he might sign such a bill.But the deal, even if it does pass Congress, comes too late to affect insurance prices for next year.In 2018, at least, we will be living in a world of high-priced silver plans.Luckily for those who need insurance, that may not turn out as badly as many people had feared.
How a Healthy Economy Can Shorten Life Spans:::::Its a different story with agricultural economies.The Cutler, Huang and Lleras-Muney study, published as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, found that mortality rates fall when such economies are growing.Before 1945, when agriculture was more dominant in the United States economy, growth was not associated with rising mortality either.Photo Other research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis.In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, Jos Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution.In countries where the recession was more severe the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.Other factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions.Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work.Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too.Both are associated with higher death rates.Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.During recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully.One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet.On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years.This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution.Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.Its also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be, Mr. Cutler said.Other analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it.Japans economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example.Serious and lengthy downturns like the Great Depression are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.Wealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations.People in their formative years children and teenagers are particularly sensitive to the economic environment.Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects.Graduating from college during a recession can depress ones earnings for a decade.People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health.These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.In total, theres little question that long-term economic growth broadly improves the human condition.But not everyone enjoys the gains equally.In the short run, economic expansions can cut short the lives of some.
Is Uber Helping or Hurting Mass Transit?:::::In new survey data, though, there are some provocative patterns.Researchers at the U.C.Davis Institute of Transportation Studies surveyed 2,000 people about their travel behavior in seven major metro areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and including people who live in their suburbs and those who dont use these services.Photo The results suggest that ride-hailing draws people away from public transit.And the authors, Regina Clewlow and Gouri Shankar Mishra, estimate that 49 percent to 61 percent of ride-hailing trips either wouldnt have been made at all if these apps didnt exist, or would have been made by foot, biking or transit.All of those trips, in other words, added cars to the road that otherwise wouldnt have been there.That picture implies that Uber and the like could make traffic worse.And lets further assume that many of those trips additionally require drivers to cruise around waiting for rides, and to deadhead occasionally after the rides are over (to return to, say, the airport with an empty back seat).Among people who use these apps, 3 percent said they rode heavy rail like subway systems more since starting to ride-hail.Thats consistent with the idea that apps could help you travel the last mile home from the train if you dont live near a stop, or that they could help you cobble together transportation options once you ditch your own car.But 6 percent said they rode the bus less, and 3 percent said the same of light rail.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Among the most common reasons people gave for turning away from transit: Service was too slow or unreliable.It potentially does not bode well for public transit, then, that just as these apps are growing more dominant, transit systems in cities like New York, Washington and San Francisco are facing deep problems.In New York, where other data has also suggested that ride-hailing lures riders away from public transit, officials have speculated about Ubers role in recent declining subway ridership.Austin, Tex., offers another intriguing case study.In May 2016, Uber and Lyft temporarily pulled out of the city over a new law that required the companies to submit drivers to fingerprint background checks.Their departure created a natural experiment, and afterward researchers at the University of Michigan, Texas A&M and Columbia University surveyed Austin residents about how the change affected their travel behavior.Asked about the last trip riders took with Uber and Lyft, 3 percent said they took similar trips afterward by public transit instead (Austin has much lower transit usage in general than New York).That also implies some substitution.Further complicating this picture, 9 percent said they bought a personal car as a result of the change.The bulk of the evidence so far shows that these services dont inherently make transportation more efficient at the level of an entire city, even if they have the potential to.They may make your travel more efficient, because you dont have to hunt for a parking spot or wait for the bus.But when you aggregate the behavior of many people, transportation becomes less efficient when transit riders switch to cars, when new car services entice people onto trips they wouldnt otherwise have taken, or when people who give up their cars wind up traveling even more in someone elses.Its equally not preordained that these apps will make traffic worse, or that they must come at the expense of public transit.If more people left their solo cars for car-pooled ride-hailing, rather than leaving public buses for solo Uber rides, that would reduce the number of cars on the road and the miles they travel.If transit agencies partnered with these companies, as some have begun to try doing, ride-hailing could fill niches that trains and buses dont handle well, like late-night journeys, transit for riders with disabilities, and suburban service.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres this potential opportunity for policy makers, city planners and these firms themselves to find solutions where were steering toward that future, Ms. Clewlow said.Its unlikely well get there by chance, though.
Why Surge Prices Make Us So Mad: What Springsteen, Home Depot and a Nobel Winner Know:::::Technology is making variable or dynamic pricing the same strategies that ensure a seat on an airplane, a hotel room or an Uber car are almost always available if youre willing to pay the price more plausible in areas with huge social consequences.Dynamic pricing of electricity could help bring down pollution, reduce energy costs and make renewable energy more viable.Constantly adjusting prices for access to highways and congested downtowns could make traffic jams, with all the resulting wasted time and excess emissions, a thing of the past.Any sector where supplies tend to be fixed but demand fluctuates the water supply, health care would seem like prime candidates for variable pricing.But technologists, entrepreneurs and regulators who would go down this path first need to learn a few lessons from Mr. Thaler and Mr. Springsteen.A good rule of thumb is we shouldnt impose a set of rules that will create moral outrage, even if that moral outrage seems stupid to economists, Mr. Thaler said.As it turns out, when you look at when and how dynamic pricing provokes outrage, you detect some patterns and a guidebook on getting some of the benefits of economic efficiency without fueling outrage that dooms the entire project.Musicians taking the long view The underpricing of popular concert tickets is nothing new.In an earlier era, this was visible in long lines of fans camping out to buy them.Now, the gap between fans willingness to pay and the official price drives online ticket marketplaces, and a constant cat-and-mouse game pitting concert promoters against ticket brokers.And Mr. Springsteens show is grappling with the same challenge that Hamilton, and other hot tickets on Broadway have faced: limited seating, seemingly limitless demand.Research by the economists Marie Connolly of the University of Quebec and Alan Krueger of Princeton based on a sample of major concerts in 2006 estimated that artists and promoters left about 5 percent of potential income (or around $200 million) on the table by underpricing tickets relative to the market rate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some in the music business see this as the height of irrationality.Most concert tickets are not priced to market, said Marc Geiger, a leading agent to musicians with WME Entertainment.He described showing an artist that the front-row concert tickets, priced flat at $125, were selling for $900 to $1,300 on the secondary market.I say, please, let me take some of those and price them at market, Mr. Geiger said at the Music Industry Research Association conference in August in Los Angeles.Confoundingly, he said, the same artist might chafe at discounting the back rows of an arena to ensure a sellout, for fear of appearing to give away tickets too cheaply.We are still coming out of the era of rock n roll socialism, he said.I think the concert industry is still in a bit of head-in-the-sand economics.But given that the apparent underpricing has been so widespread and so persistent, is it possible the strategy is more rational than it seems?Thats what Ms. Connolly and Mr. Krueger argue.For artists, no one show exists in a vacuum.And the things that might maximize revenue for any given night might not be the elements that matter in the longer term in developing devoted fans.Theres the issue of fairness, of course.Fans dont want to think their favorite artist is gouging.And the entire concert experience may be better if raucous superfans are in the front rows, rather than whoever is able to pay four figures for a ticket.The goal is to create an experience that makes everyone leave with a warm glow, their fandom of that artist that much deeper.If artists did raise prices sharply, theres a risk they would need to discount prices later to fill up the arena.Research shows that when people find out they overpaid for something, they buy less in the future.So one view of the Springsteen approach is that it is economically irrational.But another is that it is part of a long-term relationship between a performer and his fans.That might be a lesson for the other industries where variable pricing could make a lot of sense.Fairness helps people keep cool Those scorching days of midsummer, when every air-conditioner in a hundred-mile radius is cranking at full blast, are hard on utilities.Photo Most of the time, they can meet electricity demand with modern, efficient natural gas power plants that keep power flowing consistently at reasonable cost and with moderate carbon emissions, combined with nuclear and renewable energy plants that are pretty much always operating.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But on brutally hot days (and perhaps a few bitter cold days in the winter, too), things get trickier.To keep up with demand, utilities have to turn to old, expensive, dirty coal and oil plants.Some power plants maintain a crew year-round in order to be able to generate electricity only a few days during peak demand.As a result, the cost of energy production can be four or five times as high on a high-demand day as on a low-demand day.Yet the way most Americans buy electricity, that is all invisible.Utilities typically charge a single price per kilowatt-hour of electricity no matter when it was used.If the price of electricity varied from hour to hour as airline tickets do, it might create incentives on high-demand days for consumers to set their air-conditioners a few degrees higher or to postpone running their washer and dryer till the overnight hours.The old, inefficient plants could be mothballed, and air pollution would decrease.It sounds easy, an elegant use of markets to increase efficiency.And in some limited-scale experiments, its already happening.In Illinois Elevate Energy says that it has saved 28,000 customers 15 percent on their electricity with a system of variable electricity pricing through two utilities.In normal times, energy might cost 3 or 4 cents, while on peak days it can surge to 14 cents.But the people working on such programs are also aware of some of the problems that could emerge if they arent careful.And they come back to some of the same notions of fairness that underpin the concert pricing conundrum.Affluent people could easily decide its just not worth the effort to adapt their energy consumption to the spot price, making the programs a penalty for the poor.And some people might have trouble following constantly changing prices or knowing how to trim their usage in response.Woe betide the utility executive facing customers who are angry upon suddenly receiving a $2,000 electricity bill after a heat wave.Advertisement

tragedy.People on supplemental oxygen cant turn the machines off to save money.Im a big believer that you dont just give people a raw price signal, but provide them with support and financing to invest in the infrastructure to respond appropriately, said Daniel Esty, a Yale environmental law professor and former commissioner of Connecticuts energy and environmental protection agency.Even better over time would be a system where people dont have to think about it, where smart appliances are connected to a smart grid that would enable them to do their part in a kind of invisible-hand

pricing is in effect, and some customers are using technology involving smart thermostats so that their temperature setting adjusts automatically.This doesnt have to be something people need to monitor every day to be successful, said Sarah Gulezian, senior manager of dynamic pricing programs at Elevate Energy.Moreover, it might prove possible to create pricing structures that guarantee consumers wont pay more than they would have under traditional pricing, essentially seizing the benefits of dynamic pricing without anyone getting an unpleasant risk of sticker shock.Thats because most households see savings under the plans, and only a handful see their prices rise.Utilities and regulators, in other words, have to think a little like Mr. Springsteen: Its not just about maximizing the efficiency of the energy market on any one day, just as the Boss isnt trying to maximize his revenue from any one concert.Rather, its about maintaining a relationship in which people do not feel like they have been exploited.Some short-term inefficiency can buy long-term viability.And thats never truer than when disaster strikes, whether a heat wave, a blizzard or a hurricane barreling toward the most populous area of Florida.Home Depot and a hurricane As Hurricane Irma did just that in early September, about 150 Home Depot officials gathered in the companys Atlanta headquarters in an auditorium and a series of conference rooms that became the companys temporary command center.Logistics experts, store operations officials, corporate security staffers, human resources employees, lawyers and representatives of major suppliers were all there, in what is now a well-rehearsed exercise.Photo The first thing they did was direct all prices to be frozen in areas likely to be affected by the storm.There is no surge pricing at Home Depot stores after a disaster, in both a longstanding corporate policy and a matter of law in many states.But the company doesnt stop with that.All those logistics people and other staffers are there to ensure that the surge in demand after a disaster is matched with a higher supply of the goods people need.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As hurricane season approaches, dedicated warehouses are stocked with goods that will be needed if a major storm hits, according to the companys director of corporate communications, Stephen Holmes.And thats why, as soon as Irma passed the Miami area and the major highways were confirmed to be passable, a convoy of 41 tractor-trailers full of generators, plywood, chain saws and similar items trekked from Georgia to South Florida, escorted by the police.The key is responding to a desperate situation not by raising prices, but also not by being content with shortages of badly needed goods.Rather, emergencies are an occasion to increase supply, even if it means incurring big logistical costs to do so.That could have a lot of implications, including for your morning commute.Traffic-choked monster The Capital Beltway that encircles Washington and its near suburbs is more than just a metaphor for the alleged insularity of the people who live within it.It is often a traffic-choked monster that ruins the commutes of many who must use it.Photo But for a 14-mile stretch, there is an out if you have the money.A parallel toll road allows those willing to pay 20 cents a mile during slow periods, $1 a mile during a typical rush hour, more during times of extreme traffic to ensure it is never clogged.The toll road, a joint venture between Virginias transportation department and the Australian company Transurban, is an example of dynamic pricing as a tool to reduce traffic.Different in approach but with the same ultimate goal is congestion pricing, a fee on cars and trucks to enter a dense urban area.Congestion pricing has gone into effect in Stockholm and London but was rejected for New York in 2008 (Gov.Andrew Cuomo of New York has indicated new openness to the idea this year).In these areas, there is too much demand for space on the roads and too little supply of road, and each of these strategies tries to use pricing to bring supply and demand into balance.But paying variable prices for a good that has previously been free (most roads) or charged at some fixed rate (traditional toll roads) raises all sorts of issues.This new approach to modulating traffic may become more acceptable to voters when it is part of an increase in supply.If variable tolls or congestion charges are merely about pricing some people out of the market and letting rich people avoid the nuisance of traffic, they probably wont go over so well.But if they are part of creating more supply of road, ensuring more people over all can get where they want to go and if people are frequently reminded of that the measures may go down easier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Transurban deal with Virginia essentially makes private money available for additional road capacity the express lanes on the Capital Beltway were built from scratch.Its existence also serves to reduce the traffic on the traditional lanes.Governor Cuomo has pitched a New York congestion fee as a funding stream to improve and expand New Yorks rail system.If that happens, it could mean more capacity to get people in and out of the city.Another lesson from these pricing experiments is that they tend to be most resisted when they are new.When Stockholm experimented with a charge to enter the city center in 2006, it was highly controversial, with people in suburban towns especially viewing it as an unfair tax.But since being made permanent in 2007, opinion has shifted, said Maria Borjesson, a transportation economist at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.I think an important lesson is that the conception of what is fair changes, she said.Before the charge, the discussion was of how unfair it was and how it would be hardest for low-income people.Now when we do surveys, we find that people think it is unfair if the people who use the streets and pollute and increase congestion dont pay.Weve seen this everywhere that has implemented congestion charges, that public support increases afterward.A lesson for Uber, and all of us Peoples perceptions of what is fair and just are not set in stone; they evolve over time.But companies looking to use variable pricing have to be cognizant of how important it is to respect those perceptions.Uber has often been cast as the embodiment of excessive use of surge pricing.For example, in 2013, Jessica Seinfeld, the cookbook author and wife of the comedian Jerry Seinfeld, was outraged to face a $415 charge for a short ride in a snowstorm, and told her Instagram followers all about it.Since then, Uber has taken a range of actions to try to keep the benefits of variable pricing while reducing the outrage.It has adopted a quicker trigger finger for eliminating surge pricing entirely in emergency situations, for one thing.When Mexico City had a major earthquake on Sept. 19, an operations worker at the companys local headquarters turned off surge pricing, even while the building was still shaking.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The fact that one of our teammates had the presence of mind to turn off surge in that chaotic moment, I think, reflects the deep responsibility we all feel toward our fellow citizens and the cities we serve, said Rodrigo Arvalo, general manager for Uber in Latin America.The company also cut back on passenger complaints by giving a clear estimate of the price of a ride before a person books a car, a practice that began last year.It turns out its easier to decide whether its worth $30 for a car ride and act accordingly than it is to be told that a surge multiplier of 2.5 times is in place and that the normal rate would probably come to about $12.Restaurants have long known that charging a fee for a reservation offends peoples sensibilities but that on a big night like New Years Eve you can require everyone to eat an expensive fixed-price menu with lobster and filet.Diners will happily pay a surge price without thinking of it as such.What the successful examples of variable pricing have in common is that they treat customers desire for fairness not as some irrational rejection of economic logic to be scoffed at, but something fundamental, hard-wired into their view of the world.It is a reality that has to be respected and understood, whether youre setting the price for a highway toll, a kilowatt of power on a hot day, or a generator after a hurricane.If you treat people in a way they think is unfair, then it will come back and bite you, Mr. Thaler said.And it doesnt take a Nobel to understand that.
Not Dead Yet: Obamacare Insurers Are Hanging In There:::::But not all.While many large carriers like Centene may be willing to stay, others are nervous, and their regulators were considering options Friday.New competition from plans exempt from the A.C.A.rules and much higher rates resulting from the loss of funding are making some insurers rethink their commitment to 2018.Theyre sharpening their pencils now to see if they are going to stay in or not, said David M. Dillon, a fellow with the Society of Actuaries.In addition to cutting off the subsidies, the president signed an executive order Thursday that may pave the way for competing plans that would be subject to fewer rules and could draw healthy customers out of the Obamacare markets.The administration has also cut back on its marketplace advertising budget by 90 percent, and slashed funding to groups that help customers understand their options and sign up for insurance.Its a deliberate pattern, said Chet Burrell, the chief executive of CareFirst, which is faced with a $50 million loss in Maryland if regulators do not allow it to increase its rates to make up for the loss of funding.With active sabotage, this makes it more unstable.Mr. Burrell says CareFirst expects to continue offering coverage in the individual market regardless of what the Maryland regulator decides.But he said the administrations actions create profound instability and uncertainty for the future.Even as Mr. Trump created instability, his Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that it would take steps to help insurers stay in the market, despite the change.Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman, said the department would allow some plans to submit higher rates if their original prices had not taken account of the risk the subsidies would go away.The department is working on a case-by-case basis with those states where regulators explicitly required insurers to assume cost-sharing reduction payments would be made, she said.With or without the government payments to insurers, consumers who rely on subsidies for their premiums or their deductibles will be insulated from the changes, as long as carriers dont flee.Insurers are still required to offer discounts to eligible customers, even if they dont get reimbursed by the federal government.People who get their insurance through Medicaid will be unaffected.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But while the higher prices will keep most, if not all, insurers from exiting the markets, they will hurt customers who pay full price for their insurance.Around eight million Americans buy their own health plans and earn too much for government help.They will be footing the bill for double-digit increases linked to the increased policy uncertainty.Some may not be able to afford to keep their coverage.The cumulative effect is very damaging, said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans.How many cuts can this market and this law take before its just in smithereens?Advertisement Continue reading the main story And even Mr. Neidorff says there is little doubt about Mr. Trumps intent.The world knows what his message has been from the beginning, he said.They want to unwind the Affordable Care Act.Insurers that raised their rates and whose customers are generally eligible for subsidies are the least affected by the loss of funding, and they are likely to stay.Health Care Service Corp. which offers Blue Cross plans in several states, said its participation would be unaffected, and other large Blue Cross plans like Florida Blue said they had priced in the uncertainty.Molina Healthcare, another large player in the market, said it plans to participate in the seven states where it had filed in 2018, although the company said it will continue to evaluate our participation on a market-by-market basis.Anthem, which offers for-profit Blue Cross plans and had sharply reduced its participation in the marketplaces next year, in large part because of the turmoil in the market, declined to comment.Alex Feldvebel, the deputy insurance commissioner in New Hampshire, said his department permitted insurers there to assume that government subsidies would go unpaid in 2018 when submitting their rates this summer.The carriers havent made their final decisions about whether to stay or go, but Mr. Feldvebel said he was reassured by preliminary conversations Friday.Were feeling pretty O.K.here that this will not throw everything into a cocked hat, he said.In Washington State, where the insurance department had not allowed carriers to price for the risk but had asked them to file two sets of rates, the state insurance commissioner reversed course, telling insurers Friday they could switch to the higher rates to make up for the lost government funds.The New Jersey insurance regulator also said insurers could refile higher rate requests, as did Oregons regulator.The regulators, anxious to avoid any last-minute departures, are working closely with the insurers to make sure they stay.I am going to be doing my darnedest to reassure them, said Mike Kreidler, the insurance regulator for Washington State.But he emphasizes that the administrations actions have caused the companies to think hard about whether to stay.It just continues that drumroll of uncertainty.He said he was worried about a mass exodus of insurers.If one bolts, you could see them all bolt, Mr. Kreidler said.
Richard Thaler Talks About Silly (but Serious) Things:::::A.Yesterday was a long day and Im starting to lose my voice.Youre the last person Im going to talk to, and then Im going to the Cubs game.Since you cant finish the column, tell me something interesting.Maybe we can use it instead.For instance, how did you get going on the whole behavioral economics thing?My career started with cashews.I took a bowl and hid them in the kitchen.What's the deep meaning of cashews?You know Im a victim of all the things I talk about.Cashews?They are a self-control problem.I had roommates.We were all eating cashews too quickly.Really, there were two problems eating too much, thats self-control, plus shortsightedness.How does shortsightedness come in?Dinners coming in 20 minutes.You know that, but you cant stop eating.But I found an answer.If the cashews arent in front of you, youre less tempted to eat them.In fact, if you have to get up and walk all the way to the kitchen in this gigantic house I was living in as a graduate student in Rochester you dont end up eating so much.Some insight, huh?Ive been studying stuff like that for years.The first time I ever called you was when I read about the fly in the urinal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats what hooked you?Yes.So, remind me.Was putting that fly in the urinal part of a scientific experiment?No, there was no experiment.It was something they did in the Amsterdam airport.They just put the fly in the urinal and came up with unvalidated data.And you went for it.A lot of people did.I shouldnt have paid attention to it?Im not saying that.It was interesting.In Amsterdam, they found that when men see a fly in a urinal, theres a behavioral change.There was a reduction in, let us say, spillage.I did make the fly in the urinal famous.Cass Sunstein and I wrote about the fly in our book, Nudge.The fly may be the most famous nudge in the world.Nudges: They work because we humans arent entirely rational beings, right?Right.On Monday, when I heard I won the Nobel, I put on an old sweatshirt with the words Quasi Rational on it.What are our most important quirks?Ive made a list of the dumb stuff people do.Not all of these things were committed by me.A lot were.One big one is sunk costs.What does that mean?Sunk costs?We pay too much attention to them.Like this: A friend of mine and I, back in Rochester, were given two tickets to a basketball game that was going to take place in Buffalo.But there was a big snowstorm.My friend said to me theres no way were going to that game now, in the snowstorm, and we didnt go.But, he said, you know, if wed paid for those tickets ourselves, wed be going.It felt different because we didnt pay: We had no sunk costs.If wed paid, it wouldve been different.Thats crazy, for classical economics, but its true.So sunk costs got on my list.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What else is on there?I had a friend who got terrible hay fever when he mowed his lawn.I said why dont you hire some kid to do it for you?This was years ago.He said it would cost $10 and he wouldnt pay it.So I asked, would you mow your neighbors lawn for $20?He said, come on!Not even for $50!But to traditional economics, that makes no sense.And my friend was an economist!You know, the supply price and the demand price should be roughly the same.Youre not supposed to have two different prices.According to economists.But even my friend, an economist, didnt think the way economists are supposed to think.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.So I made this list of the funny things I saw people doing.Theres more of them in my book, Misbehaving, things that didnt make sense with traditional theory.Thats how it all started.The theory had to be changed.What was your biggest discovery?Greatest by far was discovering the work of Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky.Two great psychologists.Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel in economics in 2002.Amos Tversky had died by then.And Danny Kahneman has said that you taught him and Amos Tversky economics.Is that right?Well, in a way, yes: I taught them economics and they taught me psychology.At Stanford.And now, we have behavioral economics.In a way, yes.Its become very popular.You appeared in the movie, The Big Short, as yourself, the father of behavioral economics.And the approaches you advocate nudges, redesigning the choice architecture of things from cafeteria food displays to the design of 401(k) plans are having a big effect in the world.Where is this heading?I dont really know but the World Bank did a count.In 75 countries around the world, people are already using these ideas.Its exploding.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What are you working on now?On your column.Of course.It will be on health care.It will be brilliant.Excellent.Thank you.Aside from that?Im looking again at nudges in pension plans.Oddly, into Swedish pensions: You know, Ill be going to Sweden for the award.Unlike Bob Dylan.Which means Ive got to write a speech.It will take a lot of time.That could delay the column.You can handle it!Thank you.The Nobel money: Have you started spending it Ive made a kind of joke about that.I said Ill spend it as irrationally as possible.The Nobel Prize is going to be fun money" for an occasion, when my wife and I want a $50 bottle of wine.Fun money is another thing that makes no sense to traditional economists.Because theres just money; theres no fun money.Its all supposed to be the same.Which brings me to mental accounting.Thats probably what Im best known for.How would you explain it?The best explanation, actually, is in a YouTube video with Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman.You should use it.Ill see if we can.(We cant.It contains a word we dont publish unless a politician says it.)Help.What is mental accounting?Well, Hackman says when they were both young actors he was over at Dustin Hoffmans house and Hoffman asks him for a loan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hackman goes into the kitchen and sees all these Mason jars with labels entertainment and books and rent and they all have money in them.Except for one, the one that says food.So he says to Hoffman: You have plenty of money, why do you need money?And Hoffman says, Theres no money in the food jar.I cant touch the other money.They laugh, they go on, its funny but you know, its serious.Because we all do that.Is mental accounting putting money into different Mason jars in your head a dumb thing to do?At some level, you can think of it as dumb, as violating the economists basic assumption that money is fungible.Thats a good New York Times word.Yes.Money is money.Its all the same.So putting it into mental boxes isnt entirely dumb?Its smart.It helps.It helps to put money into a retirement basket, for example.401(k) money is much stickier than money elsewhere: It tends to stay there.It helps people save for retirement.What it comes down to is, in everyday life, we dont want to deal with a lot of math problems.People just impose rules of thumb, like, this one: I dont pay more than $30 for a bottle of wine, unless its a special occasion.Then, I use fun money.And now, Ive got a mental account for it: the Nobel money.That is kind of silly.Sure it is, Jeff.But those silly things are my lifes work.
Trump Is Trying to Gut Obamacare. Heres Why His Plan May Fail.:::::A few months ago, we called those increased prices an uncertainty tax.The uncertainty is gone now.But the conservative planning of the insurance industry means that many insurers can afford to keep offering insurance, even after the president cuts off the funding.Plans that priced for the threat will take a small haircut this year, but they can still make money, even without the payments, next year.Photo The Congressional Budget Office offered an estimate about what would happen if the president stopped making the payments, and its instructive.It estimated that, in the short term, the decision would cause instability: One million additional people would become uninsured in 2018, prices for insurance would rise by 20 to 25 percent, and insurers would drop out of some parts of the country.But, in the long run, the budget office thought that health plans and state insurance regulators would hack their way around the problem, resulting in an uninsured rate that would be even lower than it is under current law.The catch: It would end up costing the government more money in subsidies that help lower-income people pay their premiums, about $6 billion this year and $26 billion by the end of a decade.Some of that hacking has begun.In California, insurers have been instructed to impose a surcharge on just one type of plan to cover their lost subsidy payments.That arrangement means that some customers will pay a higher price, but no insurance company will lose its shirt.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In other states, things are more unsettled, because insurers and regulators didnt price ahead.In those places, the consequences of the presidents decision will be felt unevenly, with some state markets proceeding as planned, and others making last-minute exits or other adjustments.Insurers have already signed final contracts with the government for next year, though they have an out if the subsidies go unpaid.Congress can also act.The president is able to eliminate the subsidies because of the ambiguity in the language of the health law.If lawmakers vote that the subsidies should be paid, either for the coming year or indefinitely, the president will need to begin paying them again.Bipartisan negotiations in the Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions this summer had focused on just such legislation, though they got derailed in a recent effort to pass a Republican bill to replace parts of Obamacare with block grants.The bipartisan talks could resume, though passage of cost-sharing payments would require Republican support, and many G.O.P.lawmakers view them, as the president does, as a bailout of insurance companies.An unusually broad alliance of interests has urged Congress to appropriate the money, signaling just how disruptive their loss could be.A letter drafted in September was signed not just by health insurers, doctors, and hospitals, but also by the Chamber of Commerce.Eliminating cost-sharing subsidies is not the only thing the president did Thursday, however.He also signed an executive order devised to help more customers exit Obamacares markets in search of less regulated insurance options.And Thursdays actions follow a string of smaller policy choices that are likely to reduce Obamacare sign-ups.(My colleague Haeyoun Park has been keeping a helpful list of them here.)Taken together, the actions send a strong signal to insurance companies about the administrations approach to the future of the Obamacare marketplaces.That message may prove as powerful as any strict loss calculation.
House narrowly passes budget, paving way for $1.5 trillion tax cut:::::House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 26 lauded the passage of the budget as an "enormous step" toward tax reform, and said the plan would be released "very shortly."(Reuters) House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 26 lauded the passage of the budget as an "enormous step" toward tax reform, and said the plan would be released "very shortly."(Reuters) House Republicans set the stage Thursday for an intense sprint toward a landmark tax overhaul, overcoming internal dissension and Democratic opposition to move forward with legislation that could cut revenue by up to $1.5 trillion over the coming decade.Budget legislation passed Thursday will allow the GOP to pass its tax plan without Democratic help, but the close 216-to-212 House vote reflected ongoing tensions about the tax push among Republicans and many expect the qualms to grow once draft legislation is released next week.Leaders are aiming to pass tax legislation through each chamber before Thanksgiving, with the differences to then be hashed out before years end, and then send a bill to President Trump for his signature.At issue are significant changes to the individual tax code that stand to affect virtually every American taxpayer, including the elimination of personal exemptions and many popular itemized deductions, an increase in the standard deduction and a reduction in the number of tax brackets.On the corporate side, Republicans are pursuing a dramatic rate cut, from 35 percent to 20 percent, a complete overhaul of how overseas profits are taxed and a new treatment for business profits that are passed through to be taxed as individual income.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), joined by other congressional Republicans, speaks at a news conference last month at the Capitol.(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Each provision touched by the GOP plan carries the potential to generate opposition that could scuttle the whole effort, but party leaders hailed Thursdays House vote as proof that Congress would not be sidetracked by parochial concerns.It shows the strength of the willingness to get tax reform done, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).No Democrats voted for the budget Thursday, and 20 Republicans declined to support it.A key holdout bloc consisted of Republican lawmakers from states with high local tax burdens who have resisted the GOPs plan to eliminate, or at least scale back, the income-tax deduction for state and local taxes.Twelve Republicans from the high-tax states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where many voters stand to be hit hard if the deduction is eliminated, voted against the budget after no deal emerged to preserve it.[GOP leaders make last-minute push for unity on taxes ahead of critical vote] Still, House leaders were able to persuade enough of the balking lawmakers to advance the process.Every Republican member of the California and Illinois delegations, whose constituents are also subject to relatively high local taxes, supported the budget, and several New York members waited to cast their no votes until GOP leaders had obtained a majority, indicating that they were unwilling to hold up the tax bill.McCarthy said he believed that several House Republicans who opposed the budget for reasons unrelated to the tax bill ultimately will be there for tax reform.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Oct. 26 called the Republicans' budget "an assault, a ripoff, a shakedown, a looting of the middle class."(Reuters) But one leader of the pro-deduction bloc said that despite the budgets passage, the tax bill itself cannot pass until GOP leaders deal definitively with the issue.I know, and they know, that there were people that voted yes only to keep the process going forward but who disagree with the fact that we dont have a deal yet, said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who voted against the budget.Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee who has been negotiating a deal on the deduction, said Wednesday he expected an agreement to be reached in the coming week.Before the rollout of the whole tax legislation and bringing it to the floor, all those is and ts will be dotted and crossed, Reed said.Scaling back plans to eliminate the state-and-local-tax deduction is a potential land mine for the Republican tax writers.Striking the provision from the tax code entirely would generate more than $1 trillion in additional revenue that could offset the rate cuts that are integral to the GOP plan.Scaling it back could mean scaling back the rate cuts or other provisions.The effect that Im looking for on the taxpayer probably cuts that number about in half, MacArthur said.The fight over the deduction is only the most visible of many other battles that could soon break out into the open.Trump is at odds with key congressional leaders about whether tax breaks for retirement savings should be changed, for instance.Several members of the House and Senate tax-writing committees said they were open to changes that could affect the rules for tax-advantaged retirement accounts used by tens of millions of Americans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, or individual retirement accounts.But Trump and other Republicans have expressed reservations.This would be the worst time to disincentivize people from saving for their retirement, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said in a CNN interview Thursday.The sweeping changes planned for business taxation, which include the elimination of tax provisions favoring certain industries, could prove to be thorniest of all.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) warned Wednesday that hundreds of lobbyists would soon swarm Capitol Hill, hoping to preserve the tax provisions treasured by their clients.He compared the legislative effort ahead to a white-water rafting voyage.Were about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through, he said.Weve got to make sure everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river.Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)said in a statement after the budget vote that he will introduce a tax bill Nov. 1.He added that his committee would begin a markup, a meeting at which members can introduce potential changes to the bill and vote on them, on Nov. 6.Democrats have seized on the potential changes to retirement accounts and to the state-and-local-tax deduction, arguing that the GOP plan could lead to a tax increase for many middle-class households particularly in high-cost-of-living suburban areas.House Democrats campaign arm warned that support for the budget, and for the coming tax bill, would be a potent campaign-trail weapon against Republican incumbents in those districts.Polling done by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and shared with The Washington Post showed a shift in public opinion away from Republicans on taxes, eliminating the GOPs traditional advantage on the issue.With this budget, House Republicans are officially on the record supporting a middle-class tax increase something theyll be forced to defend repeatedly in the midterms, said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) urged colleagues in a letter Thursday to draw attention to what she called a monumental assault on the middle class and the future of our nation when Republicans release their tax bill next week.But Republican strategists argue that the tax overhaul will pay political dividends not only by benefiting middle-class voters but also by broadly restoring conservative voters faith in the GOPs ability to get things done.The budgets passage came after months of wrangling among various factions of the Republican Party, with adherents of supply-side economics facing off with deficit hawks, as well as with members with more parochial concerns.The House Budget Committee crafted a spending blueprint that included a pathway to cutting $200 billion in federal spending over the coming decade, while envisioning a tax overhaul that did not add to the federal deficit.But the Senate version of the budget, which the House adopted Thursday, did not provide a path for spending cuts and authorized a tax bill that would add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit.[Deficits, schmeficits: House conservatives cast aside fiscal warnings to make way for tax cuts] The House Republican leaders argue that cutting taxes will spark economic growth that will drive up federal revenue, ultimately offsetting the revenue loss.But Democrats, some rank-and-file Republicans and most economists dispute that claim.I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era of economic growth, or at least they want the American people to believe that, said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the top Democrat on the Budget Committee.But the record is clear: This approach has failed time and time again.Tory Newmyer and Ed OKeefe contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
How many Harvard law school grads does it take to make a Supreme Court?:::::United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy (left) Chief Justice John Roberts (center) and Associate Justice Stephen Breyer (center right) walk together during a procession at Harvard Law School campus on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017.The justices were at the school to open a bicentennial summit.(Steven Senne/AP) When a law school has educated one of every six justices to ever serve on the Supreme Court, and its alums make up a majority of the current court, a certain amount of gasconade to use a Harvard word is to be expected.So the audience was appreciative Thursday when Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. took the stage at Harvard Law School with one former and four current Supreme Court justices and announced: A minority of my colleagues send their regrets.The boastful gathering of justices marked the 200th anniversary of the law school: HLS in the WorldThe Harvard Bicentennial is the rather grand name of the summit.There is often concern expressed about the all-Ivy Supreme Court, sometimes even by the justices themselves.Five graduated from Harvard, three from Yale and Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the asterisk she went two years at Harvard and finished at Columbia after moving to New York with her husband.There was no such concern about exclusivity Thursday.Roberts noted it had once been observed, at a time when Harvard had only one graduate on the court, that Harvard does not need numbers to make her influence felt.He deadpanned: Now I am sure that remains true today.But why take a chance?Taking the stage with Roberts (Class of 79) were Anthony M. Kennedy (61), Steven G. Breyer (64), Elena Kagan (86 and also the schools first female dean), Neal M. Gorsuch (91) and retired Justice David H. Souter (66).They were seated just as they are on the court, with Roberts in the middle and the others distributed by seniority on either side.It was for the most part a lighthearted affair, as they urged each other to tell stories, reflected on their most-admired justices in history and named their favorite professors.Kagan should get a special apple-polisher certificate by volunteering that hers was her antitrust professor Breyer.Kennedy said the first year of law school teaches you to think about ordinary things in a formal way.Not long after starting, he said, he was at a market that advertised apples for 10 cents.Kennedy said he gave the man a dime and took two.When the owner objected that they were 10 cents each, Kennedy pointed out that the sign said Apples, plural.He said, Are you a law school guy?Kennedy said.Gorsuch recalled being scared to death when he entered law school but ended up being the luckiest man I know because he was hired as a clerk at the Supreme Court by retired Justice Byron White and ended up working extensively for Kennedy.Gorsuch is the first justice to serve on the court with a former boss, and he praised Kennedy to the skies.Quipped Kennedy: You didnt always do what I told you to do as my clerk.You better start doing it now.There was a lot of that, at the encouragement of an entertaining HLS Dean John F. Manning.Everyone wanted to hear about how Justices Breyer and Souter were often confused for each other, and when neither jumped at the chance to tell the story, as Kagan called it, Roberts stepped in.It happened when, once again, someone mistaking Souter for Breyer asked what was best about serving on the Supreme Court.The chance to serve with Justice Souter, Roberts described Souter as saying.The more serious moments were also supplied by Roberts.He said that the school is based upon the principles of the free exchange of ideas and intellectual humility.Debate and doubt, not doctrine, are what our school at its best teaches, Roberts said.What is the Socratic method, after all, but discussion designed to sow doubt in order to develop insight and understanding?He said his court practices that.We go about our business with the full reservoir of mutual respect.Manning quizzed the justices on which former justices they would have liked to have served with or have dinner with.Louis Brandeis, who served on the court from 1916 to 1939, was a popular choice, as was John Marshall, chief justice from 1801 to 1835.But Roberts said there should be no question about a dinner companion: former president and chief justice William Howard Taft, who clocked in at well over 300 pounds.You know youd get a lot of food and it would be good.In a lightning round of questions, Manning brought up little-known facts about the justices: Kennedy once worked on oil rigs in Canada and Louisiana.Roberts had a summer job in the steel mills.Souder was injured at Harvard in a mock duel, when his friends saber slashed his hand.It was a way to pass the time, Souter said.When Manning said that one person on stage had been spotted by the law schools dean at a Red Sox game the day before a big tax final, Kennedy raised his hand.It was one of his last chances to see Ted Williams play, Kennedy explained, so he and a friend took their books to the game.Kennedy heard behind him the deep voice of Dean Erwin Griswold: You dont bring the revenue code to the baseball game.Kennedy added: I dont know if he thought it was a profanation of the code or of the game.When Manning said one of those on stage had been voted by fellow law clerks as the most likely to serve on the Supreme Court, Kagan sheepishly raised her hand.That was an embarrassing fact for someone to reveal, she said, but not the worst that could have come from the game she and the other clerks played that year.It was definitely better, she said, than being voted the first person to be indicted.
Rep. Frederica Wilson skips votes in Washington as she faces racist and rude threats:::::Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) talks to reporters in Miami Gardens, Fla., on Oct. 18, 2017.(Alan Diaz/AP) Another feud amid the most acrimonious political season in modern history has sparked another round of threats against an elected official.Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) skipped votes in Washington this week amid a wave of threats against her since she sparred with President Trump over the treatment of the widow of a soldier killed in Niger.The 74-year-old lawmaker represents a Miami-area district and is now among the dozens of lawmakers to face threats this year.She was riding in a limousine with the widow of Sgt.La David T. Johnson this month when Trump called to convey his condolences.But the content and tone of the call prompted Wilson to complain to reporters, sparking a feud that has stretched into this week as Trump yet again defended his actions during the call.In the wake of her criticisms, Wilson spent this week in the district because of concerns about her safety in the aftermath of the feud that President Trump started with her, the congresswomans spokeswoman, Joyce Jones, said in a statement.Wilson is now being protected by a security detail in Miami, and U.S. Capitol Police are monitoring her office on Capitol Hill, Jones said.She declined to specify the threats against Wilson, but the calls have run the gamut from racist and rude to outright menacing.It is only because of these extraordinary circumstances that to her dismay she did not travel to Washington to vote, Jones added.The congresswoman considers her ability to vote on issues that impact the American public to be one of the most meaningful tools that she can use to represent her constituents and make their voices heard.Eva Malecki, a Capitol Police spokeswoman, declined to comment on Wilsons case, saying, We do not comment on ongoing investigations.Video of Rep. Frederica S. Wilson's (D-Fla.) speech at the dedication of the South Florida FBI field office directly contradicts White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly's account.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) An unprecedented wave of threats against public officials this year has prompted congressional security officials to review and follow up on thousands of threatening messages to members of both parties.The threats turned to violence this summer when House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)was shot and nearly killed by a gunman who showed up at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia.Wilson is at least the second black Democratic member of Congress to face threats this year for criticizing Trump.In May, Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.)criticized Trumps decision to dismiss former FBI director James B. Comey and called for the presidents impeachment.In response, Green received a wave of threats, some of which he played for constituents at a town hall meeting in Houston that month.Hey, Al Green, we got an impeachment for you.Its going to be yours, one caller said, according to a recording Green played.Was actually gonna give you a short trial before we hang your n a. Youre not going to impeach anybody, you f n. Youll be hanging from a tree, another caller said.I didnt see anybody calling for the impeachment of your n Obama when he was born in Kenya.Hes not even an American.So f you, n. Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said its members are very concerned about Congresswoman Wilsons safety.In the context of the Republican baseball practice shooting in June, the Las Vegas concert shooting this month, and increasing threats against members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is unfortunate that the President, and most recently his Chief of Staff, have contributed to this climate by saying things that are demonstrably not true.After several days of controversy surrounding Trumps and Wilsons varying accounts, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly took the extraordinary step of speaking publicly on the presidents behalf and admonishing Wilson for sharing details of the call.He also mischaracterized Wilsons involvement in the naming of an FBI building in Miami, a misstep that only added to the drama and added to accusations that Kelly, a former Marine general, has been disrespectful to black and Latino members of Congress.[A black congressman called for Trumps impeachment.Lynching threats followed, he said.]Trump on Wednesday revived the controversy over his handling of the condolence call, disputing Myeshia Johnsons claim that he did not seem to remember her husbands name and calling into question the memories of others who heard the conversation.Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said he called Army Sgt.La David Johnson who was killed in the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger that is still being investigated by his correct name right from the beginning.One of the great memories of all time, the president said, pointing at his head with his left hand.Theres no hesitation.
Breaking down the Trump dossier: What you need to know:::::President Trump departs after signing a presidential memorandum to declare the opioid crisis a national public health emergency in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) In this occasional series, we will bring you up to speed on the biggest national security stories of the week.The Trump dossier is one of the strangest documents to surface during a presidential election.At 35 pages, it was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and contains allegations suggesting that the Trump campaign had close coordination with the Kremlin.The document also includes salacious claims about President Trump himself.Many of the allegations were already known to reporters before BuzzFeed published the dossier in January, saying Americans can make up their own minds about Trump, then the president-elect.Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been corroborated, but other parts including the most salacious claims about Trumps behavior remain unverified.On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund the research that led to the dossier, intensifying the political fights that surround the ongoing special counsel probe into possible connections between Russia and Trump associates.Here is a breakdown of the basics: 1.What has been reported?In 2016, Mother Jones first reported that Democratic sources funded research efforts for the dossier.But on Tuesday, The Post went a step further, reporting that it was the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.A lawyer working on behalf of the campaign and the committee retained a Washington firm named Fusion GPS to do the research, which originally began during the Republican presidential primaries.The firms efforts were first supported by a Republican donor who had tasked the firm to look into Trumps background.That individuals identity remains unknown.This means that Steele, the dossiers author, came into the mix after Democrats retained the firm a key point that those on the political right were quick to highlight.The Posts Philip Bump noted the dossier is made up of multiple company intelligence reports and that each report has an assigned number.Bump goes on to analyze a few of them.2.What was Trumps reaction?On Wednesday, Trump told reporters it was a disgrace that Democrats helped fund the dossier, adding: Its a very sad commentary on politics in this country.Trump also called himself a victim in one of his tweets on Wednesday, attributing the quote to Fox News: Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier.The victim here is the President.@FoxNews Trump in the past has characterized the dossier as phony stuff and has demanded the Justice Department release the names of who paid for it.Meanwhile, the Democrats are keeping mum.The Post reached out to Clinton and her top aides after the story broke, but they either refused to comment or said they were unaware of the research.But Brian Fallon, the former campaign spokesman, called it money well spent, and one former campaign official was quoted as saying this is what campaigns do.3. Who were the key players?Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC.Eliass law firm retained the research firm Fusion GPS, which in turn hired Steele.Perkins Coie, the law firm.Fusion GPS approached the law firm in March 2016 to offer its services continuing the research into Trump.The law firm then engaged Fusion GPS the next month.Elias helped create the arrangement.Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer.Steele has ties with the FBI and intelligence community, and has worked on Russia-related topics.4.How much money was spent?Its unclear, but records from the Federal Election Commission show that the Clinton campaign paid the law firm more than $5.6 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016.The DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015.Its likely those legal fees include whatever Fusion GPS billed for its work.5.How does this affect the special counsel probe?As a legal matter, it doesnt.The FBI and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III have known for a long time the origins of the dossier and Fusion GPSs work.But the public knowledge that the dossier was, in essence, paid for by the Clinton campaign and the DNC could color the political debate about Trump and Russia.Republicans are seizing on the matter as further evidence that the Russia probe is flawed.Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.
Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Russia probe, thinks Americans are too savvy for Russian ads to work:::::Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein appears at the Global Cyber Security Summit in London this month.(Mary Turner/Reuters) Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein is in charge of overseeing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The U.S. intelligence community has said explicitly that it has no opinion on whether Russian interference affected the election.But Rosenstein does at least when it comes to the ads for which Russia paid.Appearing on the Target USA podcast from Washington's WTOP radio station, Rosenstein said he thought American voters were too savvy to be influenced by such ads.Here's the full quote, in context: I think what people need to keep in mind is that theres a distinction between people trying to sway American elections and succeeding in swaying American elections.I think one of our responsibilities is to make sure that people understand, you know, what the risks are, but also that they make their own determinations.You know, American citizens are pretty savvy, and they decide who to vote for.I dont think theyd be influenced by ads posted by foreign governments.I think people are more thoughtful about that in the way that they make their decisions.But, nonetheless, you know, if we have foreign countries that are seeking to interfere in our elections, I think we need to take appropriate action in response.I'm skeptical of this argument.We have just come off an election in which conspiracy theories and fake news ran through social media like viruses.And we all have that relative who passes along a dubiously spun news report claiming the other party's politician said something that they didn't really say.People are unable to distinguish fact from fiction in these cases, but they know when they are being influenced by an ad that might have been paid for by a foreign entity (and which they likely don't even realize came from a foreign entity)?As The Post reported a month ago, the 3,000 Russian-purchased Facebook ads that the social media giant turned over to Congress show a deep understanding of social divides in American society, with some ads promoting African American rights groups, including Black Lives Matter, and others suggesting that these same groups pose a rising political threat.In other words, they appeared to be relatively sophisticated and focused on issues that arouse Americans' passions.To suggest that Americans, as a whole, are too smart to be influenced by such ads is giving them a lot more credit than most political scientists or journalists or political activists would give them.That's not to say that people are stupid, but oftentimes we don't realize the factors that are influencing us.And, to put it diplomatically, there are certainly less-sophisticated consumers of political news out there.Look no further than all the people who bought into the birther conspiracy theory.The other question is why Rosenstein felt the need to offer this theory.The question wasn't really about that it was about whether Russia is interfering with anything besides American elections and Rosenstein seemed to volunteer this idea about how Russia's ads didn't work.The question of whether Russian interference actually mattered in the 2016 election wouldn't seem strictly pertinent to the investigation that Rosenstein is overseeing, so it's not as if this necessarily jeopardizes his independence.It's also completely unknowable whether Russia changed the result of the 2016 presidential race.But if there is one person who'll be glad to see these comments, it's President Trump, who has incorrectly stated that the intelligence community concluded Russia didn't affect the election.Trump has a real interest in downplaying Russia's success in interfering, because the idea that it did matter risks undermining his legitimacy as president.Whether it was his intention, Rosenstein's comments seem to bolster Trump's argument at least in one, limited case.And it's totally unclear why he even went there.
Trump rarely shows emotion, unless hes talking about his brother, Freddy:::::After declaring the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Oct. 26, President Trump told the story of his late brother Fred's struggle with alcohol addiction.(Reuters) I was interviewing TMZ founder Harvey Levin earlier this month, talking about how he gets celebrities to open up on his Fox News show, Objectified, when I asked about President Trump, who had been Levin's first guest, in November 2016, just after Election Day.You mustve gotten to know him in a way that a lot of other observers have not, I said.Levin let out a breath and said nothing for a long time.Or perhaps not, I offered.Maybe he was kind of walled-off.Levin finally arrived at this: We talked about his brothers death and his fear that he might become an alcoholic because he might have a gene.You rarely hear him describe his own fears.Indeed, the story of Freddy Trump is one of the only things that triggers a display of emotion by the president in front of reporters, anyway.It happened again on Thursday, when Trump reflected on his older brother's addiction during a ceremony at the White House, where he signed an order declaring the national opioid epidemic a public health emergency.I learned myself, Trump said, speaking to families touched by substance abuse, in front of journalists.I had a brother, Fred.Great guy.Best-looking guy.Best personality much better than mine but he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol.And he would tell me, 'Don't drink.Don't drink.'He was substantially older, and I listened to him, and I respected.He had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol, believe me, the president added, appearing misty-eyed.Very, very tough life.He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through.Trump discussed Freddy's alcoholism with People magazine, as part of a cover story in October 2015, and with the New York Times, for a front-page article in January 2016.The Times's Jason Horowitz wrote that for Mr. Trump, a presidential candidate whose appeal is predicated on an aura of toughness, personal achievement and perpetual success, the story of Freddy, a handsome, gregarious and self-destructive figure who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at the age of 43, is bleak and seldom told.Megyn Kelly, then of Fox News, asked Trump about Freddy in an interview in May 2016.When I say his name, what does that bring up for you?Kelly asked.Well, he was great, Trump replied.He was the most handsome person.He was a really smart guy, a really, really smart guy.He had everything.Later, Kelly asked, Has anyone ever hurt you, emotionally?Trump returned to Freddy.Well, I think the big thing would be, maybe, the death of my brother, he said.That was, you know, the hardest thing for me to take.That was very tough because, you know, it's unnatural.And he saw a certain potential in me.Trump appeared to choke up.Kelly tried to get Trump to name an emotional wound besides his brother's death, but the future president wouldn't go there.I can say this, he said.It would be something I could certainly think about and, you know, come back with.
The opioid crisis isnt limited to white Americans in rural pro-Trump counties:::::President Trump speaks during an event to declare the opioid crisis a national public health emergency in the East Room of the White House on Oct. 26.(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) After promising to do so this past summer and speaking about it repeatedly on the campaign trail, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency Thursday.He discussed the magnitude of the drug problem in a speech at the White House.Addressing it will require all of our effort, and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its real complexity, he said, joined by first lady Melania Trump and New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R), chairman of a presidential commission on combating the crisis.As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue, Trump said.It is time to liberate our communities from the scourge of drug addiction.We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.The current crisis is a serious one, especially in many of the rural counties populated with white working-class voters who supported Trump in the 2016 election.This recent epidemic traces some of its roots back to Washington, given how the drug industry and drug distributors pumped huge numbers of opioids into communities before working with members of Congress to pass a law that would weaken the Drug Enforcement Administration.This is not the first time disenfranchised communities have seen an opiate devastate their communities.The Washington Post's Nick Miroff wrote lesser waves of opiate abuse, especially heroin were notable in large cities during the 1970s in his piece about the history of opioid abuse in America going back to the Teddy Roosevelt administration.What's most notable to some Americans is just how differently Washington is responding to the current crisis now that the face of the current epidemic is often a white one, wrote Ekow N. Yankah, a law professor at Yeshiva University, in a New York Times op-ed.It is hard to describe the bittersweet sting that many African Americans feel witnessing this national embrace of addicts.It is heartening to see the eclipse of the generations-long failed war on drugs.But black Americans are also knowingly weary and embittered by the absence of such enlightened thinking when those in our own families were similarly wounded.When the face of addiction had dark skin, this nations police did not see sons and daughters, sister and brothers.They saw brothas, young thugs to be locked up, rather than people with a purpose in life.The heroin epidemic shows that how we respond to the crimes accompanying addiction depends on how much we care about the victims of crime and those in the grip of addiction.White heroin addicts get overdose treatment, rehabilitation and reincorporation, a system that will be there for them again and again and again.Black drug users got jail cells and Just Say No.There are some differences between what is happening now and what happened in the heroin epidemic of the 1970s, according to health-care experts.A Washington Post analysis revealed that since 2010, death rates have risen among Americans ages 25 to 44 in nearly every racial and ethnic group and almost every state.Despite how much the current conversation has centered on rural, white Americans, the impact of the drug is not limited to those spaces.Opioid addiction is more widespread ethnically and geographically than some Americans realize.Outreach workers in urban areas told PBS while funds and attention have been directed to white opioid and heroin users in suburbs, they struggle to get resources to help people of color fighting the same addiction.Our job is to help those services really make it deep into the community, said Jacqueline Robarge, founder and director of Baltimore-based Power Inside, which serves drug users who are mainly African American women.And if they arent going to arrive, we want to have an accounting that these people have been suffering for decades.It really is disingenuous if the resources are only going to be directed at the suburbs and the counties where, basically, the white folks are getting high.The death rate among African Americans has risen 4 percent, Hispanics 7 percent, whites 12 percent and Native Americans 18 percent since the beginning of the decade.The rate for Asian Americans also has increased, but at a level that is not statistically significant.[Drug crisis is pushing up death rates for almost all groups of Americans] This rise has tragic consequences.Following a century of decreases in the overall death rate for Americans in that 25 to 44 age bracket, the overall death rate for Americans in these prime years rose 8 percent between 2010 and 2015.White House officials said they plan to roll out more initiatives in the coming days and weeks.One change they expect to happen quickly is patients in Appalachia will have greater access to opioid treatment with the help of telemedicine.Many Americans are relieved Trump appears to be moving forward on a campaign promise that made him popular with so many in his base.Others are just wondering whether that investment will arrive in the urban areas he promised black and Latino voters he'd straighten out.
Trump declares opioid crisis a public health emergency; critics say plan falls short:::::President Trump speaks at the White House on Thursday before signing a presidential memorandum to declare the opioid crisis a national public health emergency.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump on Thursday called the nations opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history, saying his administration is declaring it a public health emergency and putting its full resolve into overcoming the widespread scourge.The announcement, however, fell well short of what many health advocates had urged and was roundly criticized by Democratic lawmakers, particularly for what they said is insufficient funding to truly address a crisis claiming an estimated 100 lives or more per day.As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue, Trump said during an event in the East Room of the White House, where he was joined by first lady Melania Trump, who has taken on an elevated role in highlighting the impact on families.It is time to liberate our communities from the scourge of drug addiction....We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.We can do it.With Trumps declaration, the federal government will waive some regulations, give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds and expand the use of telemedicine treatment, according to senior administration officials.But the president stopped short of declaring a more sweeping national state of emergency that would have given states access to funding from the federal Disaster Relief Fund, as they would after a tornado or hurricane.Officials who briefed reporters said that such an emergency declaration would not be a good fit for a longtime crisis and would not offer authorities that the government doesnt already have.President Trump declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency on Oct. 26.Here are the highlights from his speech.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [How the government can fight the opioid epidemic under a public health emergency] Trump first announced he would declare a national emergency in August, and his event Thursday was characterized by critics as too little, too late.America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet, said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).Todays announcement is nothing more than a dog-and-pony show in an attempt to demonstrate the Trump administration is not ignoring this crisis.Markey lambasted Trump for not requesting emergency funding from Congress and for indicating he would reallocate money from other programs.Markey was among the sponsors of a bill introduced this week that would direct $45 billion in new money toward prevention and treatment related to opioids.Even some Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who praised Trump for a significant step forward, acknowledged that more money is essential.Of course, the presidents action is just part of what must be a larger and broader national effort, Capito said, adding that she would continue pushing and advocating for much-needed resources.The presidential memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday orders Eric Hargan, the acting secretary of health and human services, to declare a nationwide public health emergency and direct all federal agencies to use any emergency authorities that they have to reduce the number of opioid overdose deaths.The last time that a national public health emergency of this scope was called was in 2009 in response to the H1N1 influenza virus.The emergency status will last 90 days but can be repeatedly renewed.Shortly after Trumps event, Hargan said he had declared the emergency and noted that in the current fiscal year his department has invested nearly $900 million in opioid-specific funding to support the efforts of state and local governments and others.As Rep. Tom Marinos Pennsylvania district was reeling from the opioid crisis, he sponsored a bill that, current and former Drug Enforcement Administration officials say, undermined the DEA's efforts to stop the flow of pain pills.(Alice Li/The Washington Post) [The drug industrys triumph over the DEA] In making his appeal, Trump who is often accused of lacking empathy invoked the story of his brother Fred Trump, who died of complications related to alcoholism.The president credited his brother for warning him of the effects of drinking and said a concerted national advertising campaign could keep people from becoming addicted to opioids and other drugs.I learned because of Fred.I learned, Trump said.He continued: I think thats going to end up being our most important thing really tough, really big, really great advertising so we get to people before they start, so they dont have to go through the problems of what people are going through.Trump spoke to an audience that the White House said included family members of those affected by the opioid crisis, along with an array of administration officials and elected leaders from across the country.We are here today because of your courage, the first lady told the audience.The opioid epidemic has affected more than 2 million Americans nationwide, and sadly the number continues to rise....No state has been spared, and no demographic has been untouched.Also on hand was New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R), chairman of a presidential commission on combating the crisis.Trump said he would carefully review the commissions final report, which is due next week, and consider other recommendations by the group.One important step authorized by Thursdays emergency declaration was the waiver of a 1970s-era policy that blocked Medicaid payments to inpatient treatment facilities with more than 16 substance-abuse beds.That should make treatment more widely available.President Trump also said the Food and Drug Administration is requiring a specific opioid, which is truly evil, be taken off the market immediately.Trump did not specify the drug, but in June the FDA successfully sought the removal of the opioid Opana ER from the market.Its manufacturer, Endo Pharmaceuticals, reformulated the drug in 2012 to make it more difficult to crush and snort, but the FDA said that move actually led to more injections and a major HIV outbreak.Trump said the Postal Service and the Department of Homeland Security are strengthening package inspections in an attempt to reduce the flow of the street drug fentanyl, much of which is synthesized in China, sent to the United States and mixed with powdered heroin by dealers.[Wave of addiction linked to fentanyl worsens as drugs, distribution, evolve] Trump also said the federal government might file suit against companies he called bad actors, presumably those in the pharmaceutical industry that have allowed painkillers to reach the black market.Private attorneys have already filed some lawsuits, and a coalition of 41 state attorneys general is investigating the role of some companies in the epidemic.Officials said that the White House is working with Congress to find additional funding for the crisis which experts say will cost tens of billions of dollars to properly address but they declined to share any exact figures.Critiques of the administrations efforts began even before Trump spoke.Leana Wen, the health commissioner in Baltimore, which has been battling a stubborn opioid epidemic for years, said she is happy that Trumps announcement is drawing attention to the drug crisis.But she pointed out that after hurricanes and other national disasters, billions of dollars in relief is quickly made available to victims.The same thing should happen when it comes to stopping an epidemic, Wen said.We should not have to depend on repurposed dollars that take away from other health priorities.The money is needed to expand treatment for people with substance-abuse disorders and to provide more of the antidote naloxone to first responders and the public, Wen said.Baltimore is currently paying $70 to $90 for a two-dose pack of naloxone, she said.Rebecca Farley David, vice president for policy and advocacy at the National Council for Behavioral Health, said Trumps call to use telemedicine to bring help to people in remote areas was encouraging.Certainly were very glad that the president has acknowledged what we already knew that this opioid crisis is a national emergency, David said.But like others, she regretted that the president did not make new funding available for treatment, the opioid antidote naloxone and other critical needs.Im really disappointed that his speech did not touch on the need for increased resources, she said.The strong overlap between mental illness and substance abuse more than 40 percent of people with substance-abuse disorders also suffer from depression, anxiety or another mental illness means treatment should address both diseases, David said.One cannot be addressed in isolation from the other, she said.Trump deviated several times Thursday from his scripted remarks, including in a description of the scope of the opioid crisis.He called it the worst drug crisis in American history, and even, if you really think about it, world history.This is all throughout the world, Trump added.The fact is this is a worldwide problem.In fact, many nations do not have a prescription opioid problem.In some poor countries, there are shortages of the drugs.
I learned because of Fred: Trump cites brothers struggle in talking about addiction:::::President Trump stood in the White Houses grandly decorated East Room on Thursday afternoon and read from a teleprompter as he explained how his administration will launch a massive advertising campaign to tell children to never try drugs.Then the teleprompter halted as the president went off script.I learned myself.I had a brother, Fred.Great guy, best-looking guy, best personality much better than mine, Trump said, as those gathered in the room, many of whom have lost loved ones to the opioid crisis, laughed at the overly confident presidents rare jab at himself.But he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol.And he would tell me: Dont drink.Dont drink.The president rarely talks about his older brother, Fred Trump, an airline pilot who struggled with alcoholism and died in 1981 when he was just 43.The two were separated by eight years and were constantly competing for their fathers attention, causing their relationship to be rocky at times.President Trump has said that he looked up to his older brother and that his death was the saddest part in what Ive been through.To this day, Ive never had a drink, Trump told the crowd.And I have no longing for it.I have no interest in it.To this day, Ive never had a cigarette....He really helped me.I had somebody that guided me.And he had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol.Believe me very, very tough, tough life.He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through.But I learned because of Fred.I learned.President Trump declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency on Oct. 26.Here are the highlights from his speech.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) In sharing his experience on Thursday afternoon, the usually boastful president briefly revealed a more reflective side of himself, trying to connect with those in the room and those watching at home across the country who have lost a loved one because of addiction.This lets them know that he is one of them, said New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R), who is leading the White Houses commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis.[Confident.Incorrigible.Bully: Little Donny was a lot like candidate Donald Trump] Fred Trumps death more than 30 years ago seems to have shaped the way the president thinks about substance abuse and addiction.His emphasis on abstinence appears rooted in what has worked for him personally but it is also rooted in the 1980s, when then-first lady Nancy Reagan urged schoolchildren to just say no.Scores of researchers since that era have concluded it doesnt work very well, however, and some advocates say the approach often deepens the stigma of addiction and suggests that those with a problem should be able to stop easily.In addition, as many people in the room Thursday know all too well, opioid addiction usually starts much differently from alcoholism.While there are young people who start experimenting with pills they find in their parents medicine cabinets, many addicts have said they got hooked when they were legally prescribed a painkiller following surgery or a serious injury.While an alcoholic can continue to legally buy alcohol, opioid addicts usually end up illegally buying prescription drugs or switching to heroin, which is sometimes laced with fentanyl, a powerful painkiller.And while severe alcoholism can eventually lead to death, an opioid overdose can quickly kill and is killing Americans at a rate of roughly 100 per day.[How the government can fight the opioid epidemic under a public health emergency] Trump said that if his administration follows through on its plans for this awareness campaign along with a handful of other initiatives announced on Thursday, including increasing the number of places where Medicaid recipients can get drug treatment then the number of drug users and the addicted will start to tumble downward over a period of years and it will be a beautiful thing to see.As Rep. Tom Marinos Pennsylvania district was reeling from the opioid crisis, he sponsored a bill that, current and former Drug Enforcement Administration officials say, undermined the DEA's efforts to stop the flow of pain pills.(Alice Li/The Washington Post) He acknowledged that millions of Americans are already addicted, and said that he has no choice but to help these people that are hooked and are suffering, so they can recover and rebuild their lives with their families.But he kept coming back to the idea of never starting in the first place a message that he and first lady Melania Trump have been preaching in recent weeks.[Trumps advice to kids: No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.]If we can teach young people not to take drugs just not to take them, the president started to say, then cutting himself off with another personal experience: When I see friends of mine that are having difficulty with not having that drink at dinner, where its literally almost impossible for them to stop, I say to myself, I cant even understand it.Why would that be difficult?But we understand why it is difficult.He continued, returning to his original thought: The fact is, if we can teach young people and people generally not to start, its really, really easy not to take them.And I think thats going to end up being our most important thing: really tough, really big, really great advertising so we get to people before they start, so they dont have to go through the problems of what people are going through.
House narrowly passes budget, paving way for $1.5 trillion tax cut:::::House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 26 lauded the passage of the budget as an "enormous step" toward tax reform, and said the plan would be released "very shortly."(Reuters) House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 26 lauded the passage of the budget as an "enormous step" toward tax reform, and said the plan would be released "very shortly."(Reuters) House Republicans set the stage Thursday for an intense sprint toward a landmark tax overhaul, overcoming internal dissension and Democratic opposition to move forward with legislation that could cut revenue by up to $1.5 trillion over the coming decade.Budget legislation passed Thursday will allow the GOP to pass its tax plan without Democratic help, but the close 216-to-212 House vote reflected ongoing tensions about the tax push among Republicans and many expect the qualms to grow once draft legislation is released next week.Leaders are aiming to pass tax legislation through each chamber before Thanksgiving, with the differences to then be hashed out before years end, and then send a bill to President Trump for his signature.At issue are significant changes to the individual tax code that stand to affect virtually every American taxpayer, including the elimination of personal exemptions and many popular itemized deductions, an increase in the standard deduction and a reduction in the number of tax brackets.On the corporate side, Republicans are pursuing a dramatic rate cut, from 35 percent to 20 percent, a complete overhaul of how overseas profits are taxed and a new treatment for business profits that are passed through to be taxed as individual income.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), joined by other congressional Republicans, speaks at a news conference last month at the Capitol.(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Each provision touched by the GOP plan carries the potential to generate opposition that could scuttle the whole effort, but party leaders hailed Thursdays House vote as proof that Congress would not be sidetracked by parochial concerns.It shows the strength of the willingness to get tax reform done, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).No Democrats voted for the budget Thursday, and 20 Republicans declined to support it.A key holdout bloc consisted of Republican lawmakers from states with high local tax burdens who have resisted the GOPs plan to eliminate, or at least scale back, the income-tax deduction for state and local taxes.Twelve Republicans from the high-tax states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where many voters stand to be hit hard if the deduction is eliminated, voted against the budget after no deal emerged to preserve it.[GOP leaders make last-minute push for unity on taxes ahead of critical vote] Still, House leaders were able to persuade enough of the balking lawmakers to advance the process.Every Republican member of the California and Illinois delegations, whose constituents are also subject to relatively high local taxes, supported the budget, and several New York members waited to cast their no votes until GOP leaders had obtained a majority, indicating that they were unwilling to hold up the tax bill.McCarthy said he believed that several House Republicans who opposed the budget for reasons unrelated to the tax bill ultimately will be there for tax reform.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Oct. 26 called the Republicans' budget "an assault, a ripoff, a shakedown, a looting of the middle class."(Reuters) But one leader of the pro-deduction bloc said that despite the budgets passage, the tax bill itself cannot pass until GOP leaders deal definitively with the issue.I know, and they know, that there were people that voted yes only to keep the process going forward but who disagree with the fact that we dont have a deal yet, said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who voted against the budget.Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee who has been negotiating a deal on the deduction, said Wednesday he expected an agreement to be reached in the coming week.Before the rollout of the whole tax legislation and bringing it to the floor, all those is and ts will be dotted and crossed, Reed said.Scaling back plans to eliminate the state-and-local-tax deduction is a potential land mine for the Republican tax writers.Striking the provision from the tax code entirely would generate more than $1 trillion in additional revenue that could offset the rate cuts that are integral to the GOP plan.Scaling it back could mean scaling back the rate cuts or other provisions.The effect that Im looking for on the taxpayer probably cuts that number about in half, MacArthur said.The fight over the deduction is only the most visible of many other battles that could soon break out into the open.Trump is at odds with key congressional leaders about whether tax breaks for retirement savings should be changed, for instance.Several members of the House and Senate tax-writing committees said they were open to changes that could affect the rules for tax-advantaged retirement accounts used by tens of millions of Americans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, or individual retirement accounts.But Trump and other Republicans have expressed reservations.This would be the worst time to disincentivize people from saving for their retirement, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said in a CNN interview Thursday.The sweeping changes planned for business taxation, which include the elimination of tax provisions favoring certain industries, could prove to be thorniest of all.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) warned Wednesday that hundreds of lobbyists would soon swarm Capitol Hill, hoping to preserve the tax provisions treasured by their clients.He compared the legislative effort ahead to a white-water rafting voyage.Were about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through, he said.Weve got to make sure everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river.Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)said in a statement after the budget vote that he will introduce a tax bill Nov. 1.He added that his committee would begin a markup, a meeting at which members can introduce potential changes to the bill and vote on them, on Nov. 6.Democrats have seized on the potential changes to retirement accounts and to the state-and-local-tax deduction, arguing that the GOP plan could lead to a tax increase for many middle-class households particularly in high-cost-of-living suburban areas.House Democrats campaign arm warned that support for the budget, and for the coming tax bill, would be a potent campaign-trail weapon against Republican incumbents in those districts.Polling done by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and shared with The Washington Post showed a shift in public opinion away from Republicans on taxes, eliminating the GOPs traditional advantage on the issue.With this budget, House Republicans are officially on the record supporting a middle-class tax increase something theyll be forced to defend repeatedly in the midterms, said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) urged colleagues in a letter Thursday to draw attention to what she called a monumental assault on the middle class and the future of our nation when Republicans release their tax bill next week.But Republican strategists argue that the tax overhaul will pay political dividends not only by benefiting middle-class voters but also by broadly restoring conservative voters faith in the GOPs ability to get things done.The budgets passage came after months of wrangling among various factions of the Republican Party, with adherents of supply-side economics facing off with deficit hawks, as well as with members with more parochial concerns.The House Budget Committee crafted a spending blueprint that included a pathway to cutting $200 billion in federal spending over the coming decade, while envisioning a tax overhaul that did not add to the federal deficit.But the Senate version of the budget, which the House adopted Thursday, did not provide a path for spending cuts and authorized a tax bill that would add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit.[Deficits, schmeficits: House conservatives cast aside fiscal warnings to make way for tax cuts] The House Republican leaders argue that cutting taxes will spark economic growth that will drive up federal revenue, ultimately offsetting the revenue loss.But Democrats, some rank-and-file Republicans and most economists dispute that claim.I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era of economic growth, or at least they want the American people to believe that, said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the top Democrat on the Budget Committee.But the record is clear: This approach has failed time and time again.Tory Newmyer and Ed OKeefe contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost

Jeff Flake, alone among Senate Republicans, refuses to back Roy Moores campaign:::::Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Oct. 26 that he will not endorse Roy Moore, the Republican candidate running for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama.(Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post) Two days after announcing his retirement and denouncing Trumpism from the Senate floor, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) set a different trend he became the sole Republican senator opposed to Roy Moores Senate bid in Alabama.Collared in the Dirksen Building by NBCs Frank Thorp, Flake, who does not do many hallway interviews, said that Moore represented exactly the politics that had ruined his party.A guy who says that a Muslim member of Congress shouldnt be able to serve?Flake said.Thats not right.Flake, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has frequently criticized religious discrimination.But he is the only Republican in the Senate to criticize it in the context of Moores campaign.Moore, the Ten Commandments judge who wrote in 2006 that Congress should refuse to seat Muslim Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), has garnered the support of Republican leaders and insurgents in the Senate.[Roy Moores disruption of Washington has already begun, and more is on the way] The movement toward Moore has contradicted conventional wisdom about his surprise win.As he marched toward victory in last months Republican primary, many GOP strategists warned that the far-right Moore would become an embarrassment to the party, much as former then-congressman Todd Akin became an albatross after his 2012 Senate nomination in Missouri.Akin did not have a President Trump to compete with.Liberal news sites have published stories about Moores views at a steady clip, but few have broken into the national news cycles.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) Republicans have taken advantage of that.This week, as first reported by Politico, the National Republican Senatorial Committee created a joint fundraising entity the Alabama 2017 Senate Victory Committee with Moore, who has sometimes struggled to raise money.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), meanwhile, endorsed Moore in a statement, then told NBC News that he could look past Moores views on Islam and gay rights.I have disagreement within my own family doesnt mean I care for them any less.So I support the nominee of my party, he said.Also this week, Moore scored the endorsements of three Republicans with libertarian leanings Sens.Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.).The endorsement from Paul was especially controversial, with the libertarian magazine Reason publishing a lengthy criticism of his move.(Disclosure: I worked for Reason from 2006 through 2008.)Moores attitudes toward homosexual citizens goes far beyond merely not wanting them to have special rights, wrote Reasons Brian Doherty, a biographer of the Paul family.Moore, as he declared from the bench in the that 2002 case, believes all American homosexuals who have a sex life in line with their preferences are for that very reason criminals.The Paul endorsement is a depressing sign of how much personal liberty Americas political class, even the supposedly freedom-oriented ones, are willing to give up in exchange for lip service to tax cuts.
The Kennedy assassination is a rarity these days: A bipartisan conspiracy theory:::::President Trump on Oct. 21 tweeted that he will release the final batch of files related to former president John F. Kennedy's assassination.(Joyce Koh/The Washington Post) Donald Trump picked up a bizarre theory from the front cover of the National Enquirer last year.It speculated that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)had been palling around with Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans before the Kennedy assassination, distributing anti-Castro literature.There was no evidence that this was true, except that Rafael Cruz was generally the right age and was of Cuban heritage and may have been in New Orleans at some point in that general time period three factors that applied to thousands of other people, too.Trumps assertion was quickly and widely excoriated.What wasnt considered odd, though, was that there would be conspiracies about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Americans broadly believe that Kennedys killing was a function of a broad-based conspiracy and not, as the governments investigation would have us believe, a result of Oswalds shots fired from the Texas School Book Depository.With new assassination documents being declassified by the government Thursday (after Trump declined to keep them confidential), its worth highlighting the rarity of the Kennedy assassination conspiracy in American thought: generally accepted, and more remarkably in this moment on a bipartisan basis.The Washington Post and our polling partners at ABC News polled Americans on the assassination in 2013, on the 50th anniversary of Kennedys death.Overall, 6 in 10 Americans believed that the president was assassinated as part of a plot involving multiple people.That same percentage held steady among Democrats, Republicans and independents.Imagine!Democrats and Republicans agreeing on something controversial that is tangentially related to politics!Fairleigh Dickinson University conducts an annual poll to evaluate Americans opinions on other controversial or speculative issues.The most recent iteration, released in April, didnt find other examples of bipartisan agreement in support of the theory.There was broadly bipartisan agreement on the debunked, false and pernicious rumor that vaccinations have some link to autism (which, again, they do not).Only about 5 percent of Americans believe theres a link (which they shouldnt, because there isnt).Republicans and independents were slightly more likely to say it was possibly true.On a series of theories related to the political moment, though, broad disagreement.Democrats broadly believe that Trumps refusing to release his tax returns because he is hiding business ties to Russia.Republicans dont.(His lawyers have reviewed his filings and say he isnt.)Most Republicans believe its certainly or possibly true that President Barack Obama is hiding details of his personal background (read: wasnt born in the United States).(He was.)Most Democrats dont.Most Republicans also believe its certainly or possibly true that supporters of Obama committed rampant voter fraud in 2012.(They didnt.)Most Democrats dont (perhaps in part since they would have been out there committing the fraud).Part of the divergence on those last three poll questions is a function of their subjects: current political actors and controversies.(Few people in 2017 spend much time debating the relative value of Kennedys policy decisions.)Part of it, too, is rooted in the stark political divide in the country right now, a divide that inclines people to believe the worst about their political opponents.(Like that a prominent Democrat engaged in paganistic rituals or that Trump had an impostor stand in for his wife.)Part of the acceptance of the Kennedy theory, though, is rooted in an idea central to the political moment.Believing that there was a plot to kill Kennedy means believing that the institution of the federal government conspired to lie to the public a belief that has been embraced widely in parallel with a growing distrust of American institutions.In other words, the political conspiracies in Fairleigh Dickinsons polls are ones that ask us to question each other; the Kennedy assassination theory asks us to question the authorities.Most Americans, regardless of party, are willing to.Few, though, are willing to extend their partisanship to involve their political opponents directly in the assassination itself.That is largely reserved for the president.
Trump declares the opioid crisis a public health emergency:::::President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Oct. 26, but not a national state of emergency.Here's what the declaration means.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) President Trump said Thursday that the opioid epidemic which is killing more than 100 people each day is the "worst drug crisis in American history" and said his administration is declaring it a public health emergency, pledging the nation's full resolve in overcoming it.Addressing it will require all of our effort, and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its very real complexity, Trump said during a speech in the East Room of the White House, where he was joined by first lady Melania Trump and New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R), chairman of a presidential commission on combating the crisis.As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue, Trump said.It is time to liberate our communities from the scourge of drug addiction.We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.We can do it.With Trump's declaration, the federal government will waive some regulations, give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds and expand the use of telemedicine treatment, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on Thursday morning.[See how deadly street opioids like elephant tranquilizer have become] But the president stopped short of declaring a more sweeping national state of emergency that would have given states access to funding from the federal Disaster Relief Fund, just as they would have following a tornado or hurricane.Officials who briefed reporters said that such an emergency declaration would not be a good fit for a longtime crisis and would not offer authorities that the government doesn't already have.Trumps announcement drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and some public health advocates, who questioned his commitment to the crisis, given that Trump made no immediate request to Congress for emergency funding.America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet, said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).Todays announcement is nothing more than a dog-and-pony show in an attempt to demonstrate the Trump administration is not ignoring this crisis.The presidential memorandum signed by Trump on Thursday orders Eric Hargan, the acting secretary of health and human services, to declare a nationwide public health emergency and direct all federal agencies to use any emergency authorities that they have to reduce the number of opioid overdose deaths.The last time that a national public health emergency of this scope was called was in 2009 in response to the H1N1 influenza virus.The emergency will last 90 days but can be repeatedly renewed.In making his appeal, Trump invoked the story of his late brother, Fred Trump, who died of complications related to alcoholism.The president credited his brother for warning him of the effects of drinking and said a concerted advertising campaign could keep people from becoming addicted to opioids and other drugs.I learned because of Fred; I learned, Trump said.Trump spoke to an audience that the White House said included family members of those affected by the opioid crisis, along with an array of administration officials and elected leaders from around the country.We are here today because of your courage, the first lady told the audience.The opioid epidemic has affected more than 2 million Americans nationwide, and sadly the number continues to rise.No state has been spared, and no demographic has been untouched.[Advocates hope Trump puts money behind words on opioid crisis] Officials repeatedly said they plan to roll out even more initiatives to address the crisis in the coming days and weeks.They laid out a handful of things that will quickly happen by declaring the public health emergency: Patients in isolated areas such as Appalachia will have greater access to opioid treatment through telemedicine and receive prescriptions without seeing a doctor in person, as is generally required under current law.The Department of Health and Human Services will speed up its hiring process to have people in place to help states in crisis.The federal government will allow states to temporarily shift the use of federal grant funds to target those with opioid addictions.The Department of Labor will make Dislocated Worker Grants available to those with opioid addictions and others who were dislocated by this health crisis or who have had trouble finding work because of their addiction.The government will spend money from the Public Health Emergency Fund, although it has only $57,000 in it.The officials said that the White House is working with Congress to find additional funding for this crisis which experts say will cost tens of billions of dollars to properly address but they declined to share any exact figures.Leana Wen, health commissioner in Baltimore, which has been battling a stubborn opioid epidemic for years, said she is happy that Trumps announcement is drawing attention to the drug crisis.But she pointed out that after hurricanes and other national disasters, billions of dollars in relief is quickly made available to victims.The same thing should happen when it comes to stopping an epidemic, Wen said.We should not have to depend on repurposed dollars that take away from other health priorities.The money is needed to expand treatment for people with substance abuse disorders and to provide more of the antidote naloxone to first responders and the public, Wen said.The city is currently paying $70 to $90 for a two-dose pack of naloxone, she said.Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said Trumps action was woefully inadequate to address the challenges we face.Our communities need federal funding and resources to fight this epidemic, she said.Fire and police departments are struggling to afford overdose reversal drugs.Schools and health centers need to expand prevention education to all students.Families need expanded access to substance use treatment.These are actions we can take right now.And this announcement does little to support any of them.Lenny Bernstein contributed to this report.

No network has interviewed Trump more than Fox. Heres what theyve asked him.:::::President Trump gives a thumbs-up after meeting people affected by Hurricane Harvey during a visit to the NRG Center on Sept. 2 in Houston.(Susan Walsh/AP) CBSs Mark Knoller crunched the numbers.After President Trumps interview with Lou Dobbs on the Fox Business Network on Wednesday, Trump has now participated in interviews with Fox News Channel or affiliated networks 18 times out of 26 television interviews in total.Combined, Trump has granted five interviews to NBC, MSNBC, ABC and CBS, in total.He has given three to the Christian Broadcasting Network and Trinity Broadcasting Network.And he has given zero to CNN.Why?Perhaps the interview with Dobbs can offer some insight.Here, in order, was what Dobbs said to Trump over one stretch of the interview, according to a Fox News transcript.Youre also one of the most loved and respected in history.And how does that feel?How where is Donald Trump today, as you are just now beginning your presidency?Without question Right.Right.Right.Yes.And Yes.Well I you you are a, if I may say, everything as advertised as you ran for president.And appreciate everything youre doing.Thanks so much.Over the course of the interview, during which Dobbs was quoted by Fox 68 times, Dobbs said right in response to the president 16 times.A quarter of his responses.Not the hardest-hitting stuff.Interviewers from Fox News, Christian Broadcasting Network and more went easy on the president with statements like this: "Mr. President, I am so glad to see you.I'm so proud of everything you're doing."(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) To be fair, there have been interviews in which Fox hosts have held Trumps feet to the fire.(See Tucker Carlsons interview from March.)More often, though, Trump is not playing softball so much as teeball see the two interviews he has done with Sean Hannity.As in: See them below.Weve taken official Fox transcripts and stripped out Trumps replies.Skim through to get a sense of the exchanges Trump has had with interviews from the Fox News family.To make that skimming easier, weve color-coded the replies.Yellow responses are those we think were critical or challenging to Trump; baby-blue ones are those that agreed with or praised him.We didnt even color-code the teeball questions.We trust youll recognize those without a prompt.These are in chronological order, so it ends with that Dobbs interview this week.It ends, in other words, with Mr. President, thank you.KEY: positive/agreeing, critical/challenging Sean Hannity (Fox News), Jan. 26 What a week this has been.Well thats what I wanted; first I got some time to talk with you earlier in the week in the Oval Office.And the thing that really stood out to me is you seem to be enjoying yourself and very focused on all the promises you made in the campaign.Is it your intention to keep every promise?Lets talk a little bit about the Executive Orders on Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and 120 ban that goes to the promise of extreme vetting.Would it be gambling if (inaudible) at some point when there is a procedure in place, if you can ascertain whether or not somebodys been radicalized or not, or if radical groups actually trained some of their soldiers to say the right things to get in.But if you capture, positively ascertain theyre safe, and find out whats in their heart, does that mean no go?Does that mean you wont gamble?In all areas?Mm-hmm.You do not need Congress now as it relates to building a wall.And you said in an interview last night that you plan to do this expeditiously.Thats about 700 mile[s] of fencing, other measures as well.Do you think youll need more than that?Will you have to go to Congress to get their support for?Youre talking about a real wall, impenetrable.Mm-hmm.Let me talk about a big decision youre going to make next week.Youve announced on Thursday you will make your Supreme Court choice Announcement.Two questions on that.One, will it be from the list that you gave out during the campaign?Will it be an originalist?Have you made your decision?Next question Chuck Schumer, others threatening, weve never had a Supreme Court Justice filibustered.But theres a chance that might happen.Would you want Mitch McConnell to use the nuclear option You would?There are people Leaking in Washington?Thats a shock.Right.Let me ask you, I dont remember you saying this in the campaign, and I was on the road with you quite a bit.We did a lot of the town halls together.They are now talking about a 10 percent reduction in spending, in other words eliminating baseline budgeting, a 20 percent reduction in the government workforce.How important is a balanced budget to you and were you surprised Republicans before you got here raised the debt ceiling $9.7 trillion?I heard you got the price down quite a bit already.But you do want that 10 percent short of the military?One of the worst ways it seems to spend money is going through the Washington bureaucracy.Every congressman has their pet project.Theres been talk about infrastructure; anywhere the Democrats want a trillion dollars.I think you talked about $137 billion to start.Is that something you want to pay as you go?Is that something youd rather?Right.Yeah, by the way, I hear a helicopter out there in the background.You took great pride in meeting with Carrier, saving jobs.Meeting with Ford, savings jobs.Youve met with union people $7 billion, by the way.But is, you want to get rid of 75 percent of regulation.Or more.Paul Ryan said 20 percent corporate tax rate, you want a 15 percent Right.The media, a little bit of a contentious start, if you will, with them.They want to, Ive seen now, the New York Times, CNN, NBC, theyve used the word liar to describe you.As it relates if youre talking about crowd size But they also colluded against you in a campaign And my question to you is I said journalisms dead, so we agree.Martin Luther Kings bust?Its there.Mm-hmm.Okay, sure.Yeah.I know.You know when you do well.Mm-hmm.So then, heres my question.Between Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, I think you reach 50 million people.So, if we know now through WikiLeaks, some of these networks were colluding with Hillarys campaign to defeat you.Ive seen major newspapers to cable networks that use the word liar.And my question to you is: Does that make you want to rethink entirely how this administration will deal with the media?But I dont remember them treating Barack Obama this way.Obamacare.The Republicans, theyre meeting in Philly and you are going to see them, but they had an artificial deadline they set the deadline for tomorrow.They dont think theyre going to make that.You want at the same time repeal and replace.I know there are nine separate plans out there.What is crucial for you to have in that plan to It went up $5,400 when it was supposed to be down $2,500 a year.Let me move on.You cant even buy a catastrophic plan.Could you do it in four years?Youve mentioned the forgotten man a lot both during the campaign and woman.And in your inaugural speech.And you mentioned it last night.I gave you statistics, the very first interview I did with you, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, nearly 50 million in poverty, 44 million Americans on food stamps.I say it every night.One day, you asked, what are all those numbers you give.But explain, by getting rid of regulation, energy independence, jobs that will be created, a 15 percent from the highest corporate tax rate to the lowest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world and repatriating trillions.How does that help and impact those people I talk about all the time?And trade deals.You got rid of TPP.You want all bilateral trade agreements But you want bilateral?One of the problems we have is evil in our time.Winston Churchill dealt with evil in his time.Roosevelt dealt with evil in his time.My father fought in World War II.Thats true.This is different.Waterboarding black sites came up in your interview last night.And I was thinking, if I had an opportunity to speak with David Muir, Id say, okay, two guys go into your house, they kidnap your child, one guy gets away with your child, you tackle the other guy, that guy knows where your child is, would you dont waterboard that guy?Thats why it was legal.Well, we actually know it works.I interviewed there were only three people that America waterboarded.One of whom was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.That led us to the courier who led us to bin Laden.And I know because I talked to the guy that was running the program at the time.I want to ask you about None.None.Not one.We both lost friends that day.I would ask David Muir, if they kidnapped your kid and you have one of the kidnappers, what would you do to get the location of your child?Its over.Its over at that point.I spoke to the guy that ran the program and saw the waterboarding of those three people.Let me ask you this.I will go through these very quickly, the countries that youre going to be doing with now.Israel, one of our closest partners.Prime Minister Netanyahu is coming.One of the big issues is the embassy, Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.How important is it to repair this relationship and what about that move of that embassy?Its repaired already.Within five minutes?And youre holding back the money the last-minute money that President Obama gave to the Palestinians.Where do you stand on the embassy from Tel Aviv to Not yet?How about I know you spoke to Gen. el-Sisi, did you ever see the speech that he gave on radical Islam?And do you believe he could Do you trust the Saudis?Over the years, I would argue theyve been very duplicitous.Have you talked to Vladimir Putin yet?So much came up about this.Have you had discussions with him?How about the leaders of China?And I know you spoke to the leaders in India.What about Pakistan?Let me ask this.I think is important.I actually agree with you wholeheartedly about the Iranian deal.We paid them ransom.Let me ask you about the power of the pardon, which is absolute for a president.One night, I know you were watching my show, and I had the mother of the sailor who is spending a year in jail because he took six pictures for his own use in a submarine and you were comparing it.Would that be something early on, you would consider?Christian Saucier.Did you get the story of Clint Lorance, another guy, got 30 years.He was doing his job, protecting his team in Afghanistan.When you saw the Womens March this week and then you hear Madonna say, I thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, imagine if I said that when Barack Obama was here.Cause.Last question, and then were going to you will take us to the Oval Office, which is nice.You were very passionate last night about Chicago and about the violence.In the course of Barack Obamas presidency, 4,000 people died, murdered, and another however-many-thousand more shot.You might go in and help fix it if they cant fix it.Its a war zone.All right.So let me its inauguration night.You gave your speech.You go to the balls, you come back, and youre in the White House, in the residence with Melania.And by the way thats Marine One right there.And so my question is, whatd you think?What are you thinking?Yes.Im sure.What a beautiful helicopter.I have known you for years, and on a personal level, whenever I have ever talked to you, its either 11 p.m., 12 midnight, 1 a.m. or 5 or 6 a.m. Youre a workaholic.You get bored on vacations?Youre busy now.Hard on your family?(inaudible) met your son.Your 10-year-old.What a wonderful, smart, charming kid.And then they attack him, thats got to hurt you and Melania.Horrible.And hes a great kid.I know him.I know yes.I know you talked a little bit about this, the nuclear codes.How long was that meeting?How in depth was it?And thats what you said about Putin, if we can get a long, well get along.Its going to be harder right.In many cases its going to be harder when Ive always said theres a clash of culture As it relates to you know countries that practice Sharia.By the way were in the Oval Office.Abe Lincoln.By the way Yes.Get a shot of these.It was a pretty rough campaign.When you first walk in this office everyday and you think of it Ive got one question about the desk, and you have Ivanka and Jared have young kids, are we going to see one of the kids maybe crawling through there?Yes.Why did you pick that desk?You were very impressed with your phones too.We need to.I assume youre going to be putting, theres a picture of your father That wasnt there yesterday.I did notice that.And I really why did you choose the rug of Reagan?You could have also designed your own.Trade, yeah.In your lifetime, who was the president that maybe you admire the most?I was surprised my last question for you.I was surprised last night.I was watching your interview and you were holding up the letter that Barack Obama had let had left you.Seemed like a lengthy letter.And you seemed to have a personal rapport with him and you were right, this was a really, really incredibly vicious campaign.He doesnt talk to me.I cant figure out why, yeah.Helpful to you?Very, very last question.Has this whole experience changed you in ways in any way that you can think of?Youre working.Mr. President, good to see you.Thank you for your time, youve been very generous.Appreciate it.Bill OReilly (Fox News), Feb. 5 So another big week for the Trump administration.Judge Gorsuch, that roll out went very smoothly I think.Alright.But the refugee deal, not so much.You wouldnt do anything differently if you had to do it over again?I mean some of your people didnt really know what the order was?Alright.Lets talk about Iran.Your assessment; do you think were on a collision course, we being the United States, with that country?The nuclear youre talking about?Possible you tear it up?So its possible Sanctions, thats how youre going to start with them?But youre moving a carrier right?So youre not real bullish on Iran at this point?You talked to Putin last week, you had a busy week last week.Do you respect Putin?Do you?Why?Right.But hes a killer though.Putins a killer.I dont know of any government leaders that are killers.Mistakes are different than Lets talk about Mexico.There was a report you talked to President Nieto and you told him, this was the report I want to know if its true or not, that if his army couldnt handle the drug cartels that U.S. Army soldiers would, did you say that?Got a problem.At this point do you consider Mexico a corrupt country?Because this stuff has been going on for decades.Have you figured out what kind of a tariff youre going to levy on Mexico to pay for the wall?Yeah you intimidated them theyre afraid of you.Oh come on, theyre afraid of you.You know these companies.They want to do whats right?Why didnt they do what was right in the past?Theyre afraid of you.Alright.Lets turn [to] domestic policy.I just spent the week in California.As you know they are now voting on whether they should become a sanctuary state.So California and the USA are on a collision course.How do you see it?So defunding is your weapon of choice Is there any validity to the criticism of you, that you say things you cant back up factually and as the President if you say for example that there are 3 million illegal aliens who voted and then you dont have the data to back it up.Some people are going to say, thats irresponsible for a president to say that.Is there any validity to it?I know, but you have to have data to back that up.you think you will be proven correct in that state?The data already shows that 3 million illegals voted.Well thats good.Lets get to the bottom of it.Now 2017, can Americans expect a tax cut?Can Americans in 2017 expect a new health-care plan rolled out by the Trump administration this year?All right, last question, you get four hours of sleep or some crazy thing like that, when your head hits the pillow, do you ever say to yourself, I cant believe Im here.I cannot believe that I am the president of the United States, when I wasnt a politician.I didnt start out this way.That wasnt my life goal.Does that ever come into your mind?Football.how do you see this game?Theyre all taking gas So youre rooting for the Patriots?Sure, now Fox Sports is demanding I ask you to make a prediction.You have to.By how many points?Alright, so thats your good presidential prediction.Mr. President, thanks very much for taking the time.Tucker Carlson (Fox News), March 15 Mr. President, thanks for joining us.So last night, your tax return from 2005, the first two pages, appeared, and the reporter who got it, he said in his mailbox, said that the front of it is stamped client copy, and he suggested that it did not come from the IRS, but that it was leaked to him potentially by someone in the White House, wasnt it?So it showed that you paid about a little less than 25 percent federal taxes on your income that year, which was more than a lot of people, but its still less than the 40 percent that wage earners, people do investments, would be paying.Is it fair to have a tax system I know youre doing tax reform soon where wage earners pay twice the tax that investors do?But you want to start and you can imagine a system where I think federal top is a little less than 40 percent.Obviously taxes at the top on capital are 20, but youd like to see them at parity?So you said, in a subsequent bill lets talk about this bill.So its been seven years since Obamacare passed, and Republicans have said the whole time, were going to get rid of it, and were going to give you something better.Are you satisfied with the bill were now looking at that Paul Ryan is pushing is the best the Republicans could do after seven years of thinking about it?Right.This bill has, as one of its centerpieces, a tax cut for investors that would primarily benefit people making over $250,000 a year.Already done pretty well in the past 10 years, as you know.A Bloomberg analysis showed that counties that voted for you, middle-class and working-class counties, would do far less well under this bill than the counties that voted for Hillary, the more affluent counties.It seems like maybe this isnt consistent with the message of the last election.Are you confident that Paul Ryan I mean, doesnt seem like you agree on economics or foreign policy or social policy.Are you confident that you share enough in common that he can hes on board with your interests?Right.So on March 4, 6:35 in the morning, youre down in Florida, and you tweet, the former administration wiretapped me, surveilled me, at Trump Tower during the last election.How did you find out?You said, I just found out.How did you learn that?So, 51,000 people retweeted that.So a lot of people thought that was plausible, they believe you, youre the president youre in charge of the agencies.Every intelligence agency reports to you.Why not immediately go to them and gather evidence to support that?Why not wait to tweet about it until you can prove it?Dont you devalue your words when you cant provide evidence?Right, but youre the president.You have the ability to gather all the evidence you want.Do you talk to anyone before you tweet?And is there anyone in the White House who can say to you, Mr. President, please dont tweet that, who you would listen to?But then they say to you, but youre I mean, as you know, the response look, so you had this big speech to the joint session on Tuesday.You had great press all week, bipartisan, and then you let off this tweet, and immediately, people say You cant back up what you say.Do you think its okay to make the counterargument, even from people who support you, who say look, I support Donald Trump, I believe what he believes, and I want him to succeed badly, but if the president says something that cannot be proved or is demonstrably untrue, he devalues his own currency.Does it ever go through any kind of mediator Do you show your staff and Last question.European nationalism, obviously, is flowering, and a lot of it is about immigration and culture.Do you think its possible to move a large Muslim population into the West and successfully integrate them into Western culture?Have you seen that anywhere?Could we do it here?Mr. President, thanks.Martha MacCallum (Fox News), April 28 Well, you made a pretty good effort to get a lot of things done in the past few days.You are a registered Democrat for a long time, now Republican president of the United States, and people say, Well, President Trump is not an ideologue, he is a pragmatist.How would you describe your political philosophy?Like what, how would you change them?You dont have to do that anymore.You really try to make a lot of moves to shrink the size of government, to shrink the size of the bureaucracy.But people say why not be concerned about the deficit?Why allow it to balloon with this tax reform deal and why not touch entitlements because unless you do that, youre not really ever going to take a bite out of the spending.Four buy one?In terms of legislation youre going to see everywhere on Saturday that there was no major legislation passed in the first hundred days.You have the Republican Congress Understood.You are right and we have looked at the list.I shouldve been more specific about having about health-care reform tax reform immigration reform?Okay.But my question for you is about is about Congress because when you were running you said Im going to do great deals with Congress, Im going to have great relationships on Capitol Hill.Are you disappointed with how the Republicans have handled these big issues?Health care went down the first time.And there was some suggestion it might happen today but now its not going to happen.I hear you, but, you know But I want to know about the leadership on this, because after the first health-care bill did not pass you said I have complete confidence in Paul Ryan.Do you still have complete confidence that he can get these moderates on board with the House Freedom Caucus, because youve got to get everybody upon the raft?So theyre going to get it done.And the timeframe?Next week?Okay.And a lot of people said they had all these years to put these bills together, these plans together, and they Maybe they didnt know that you were going to win, so they werent ready.Yes.Yes.So what what do you say to the members of Congress who say well, you know, the presidents approval numbers are in the high 40s.Im not necessarily going to, you know, bend to his will because on tax reform and on health care, I might lose my own election at home that you dont have the numbers to make it important for them to come along with you?Right.Well, that story is not is not going anywhere as you know.I mean, that story has a lot of, sort of, avenues to it and the most recent one comes back to Mike Flynn who when he left when here signed you said that he was treated horribly and that you felt badly about that.Given what we now are seeing on the payments from Turkey and Russia, would you stand by that comment?I want to move on to a couple of other quick things because I know were short on time.The huge cut that small businesses would see would also be enjoyed by hedge funds and also by real estate companies.Is that going to make it tougher for you to get that big cut through for the past through past companies in your tax reform?But your critics are going to say, Well, real estate companies like President Trumps company will benefit along with that middle cut, so is there is it going to make it harder for you to get that big cut in the middle, the 39 takes to 50?Well eliminate those and then Yes.So your life pretty much changed completely after Election Day, how would you say the presidency has changed you?Do you ever think will may be one term would be enough of this kind of life?Personal question for you, youre going back to New York.Im surprised that you havent been back to New York yet since you became president.Yes, we were around the corner, we know.Yes.Were looking forward to having your the first lady and your son will be here soon?Mr. President, thank you very much.Good to be with you.Ainsley Earhardt (Fox News), June 23 Big news today, you didnt you said you didnt tape James Comey.Do you want to explain that?Why did you want him to believe that you possibly did that?It was a smart way to make sure he stayed honest in those hearings.Robert Mueller do you think he should recuse himself?He is friends with James Comey.He has hired attorneys that were part of Hillary Clintons foundation and given money to both President Obama and Hillary Clintons campaign.Should he recuse himself?Pete Hegseth (Fox News), Sep. 25 You have certainly started a national conversation this week, Mr. President, on the NFL.You say the NFL situation is a very important situation.Your critics say its been a distraction, but you say its critical.And you talk about words like patriotism and citizenship.Why is this such an important issue for you?What prompted that in Alabama?Why did you step out?Mr. President, were here in Indiana.Youre going to launch your tax reform plan in front of this crowd.Who is your tax plan intended to help?Are there any rates or brackets that are non-negotiable?Mr. President, the health-care bill this week didnt went down in the Senate.What about this plan makes you feel confident that it wont meet the same fate?Do you still have confidence in Mitch McConnell?Do you feel like when you start negotiating with Democrats, do you feel like you can trust Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi?Youve been discussing a new deal?Sean Hannity (Fox News), Oct. 11 How are you, Mr. President?Its my second interview since youve been president.You guys want to start with good news?Do you want some good news?You dont get a lot of good news in the media.The markets up 25 percent since you were won.You tweeted this out but nobody in the media brings it up.So I said, you know what, Im going to bring it up tonight.$5.2 trillion in wealth created.We have the lowest unemployment rate in 16 years.You came back to Pennsylvania.I know youve been in Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and North Carolina because a lot of people still need opportunity and jobs.Youre really here.Youre going to be talking at length about your economic plan.Lets talk about it.Lets go through it.So and this is important.I mean, how many theres no two accountants that can give you the same liability to the government if you give them the same information.Thats how complicated the tax code is.You want to drop seven brackets to three?You said you said the corporate rate.which is so important, you said 20 percent is your max.The top 10 percent pays 70 percent of the tax bill.The bottom 50 percent pay 2 [percent] of the total income tax rate.Why is the there are multinational corporations that have parked trillions of dollars in countries that offer them better tax relief.Youre trying to incentive those trillions to come back here with a lower repatriation rate.How low will that be?And how much do you think you can bring back into the United States?And what does it mean?Youre never going to bring it back.One of the things some people have brought up, like our Every time I turn tune in to anybody else in the media except Fox, they all have tax cuts for the wealthy.Now the rate for some people, go goes down.But if you live in a state like New York, or Illinois, and New Jersey, or California you wont be able to deduct your local or state income tax.In other words, if you elect [politicians] that want to raise taxes, youre going to pay the penalty.So thats not really true that this is a tax cut for the wealthy, as theyre portraying it.What is your answer to that?No income tax.But you also a big part of it, youve already done.And that is, youve ended a lot of the Obama era regulations, especially in industries like energy and coal.There seems to be you have a very strong commitment.You just recently went forward with Anwar.Youve put in place opportunities for the coal mining industry, like fracking.We do have an opportunity to be energy independent.And there seems to be millions of high-paying career jobs for people available.If that decision is made, how big a part is that for the economic recovery?This isnt a bad area, is it?You also won there.You also won Pennsylvania, right?Is he going to win Pennsylvania in 2020, too?Yes.The biggest obstacle, before you arrived here, I had an opportunity to interview a lot of people in this great crowd.And I asked them basically three different questions.What they thought of you.Overwhelmingly, theres a lot of support for you here.Congress when I asked them about what was your answer on Congress?What was your answer on the media?We saw what happened with health care and John McCain.This economic plan sounds a lot to me like what Reagan did and that created 20 million new jobs and revenues doubled.This is important for your agenda.How do you get this through the Senate, which has not had a good record in the last 10 months?Fake news.Do you agree with that, fake news?This is important.In 1974, there was Truckers would benefit.You do?So with some people, you saw and heard Bob Corker.Jon McCain wasnt there, even though I can run So thats got to be frustrating and disappointing.You think you can get it done by the end of the year?Three two.I think theyll be higher tonight.Im just guessing.Barack Obama was the first president in history that never hit 3 percent GDP growth of a single year in his presidency, which I think speaks volumes.Of the treasury.A lot of people I was surprised, watching all last year with Colin Kaepernick.The guy praised a murdering thug dictator.He had socks that depicted cops as pigs.And other issues, he actually donated to a charity that actually supported a cop killer.And then we saw the NFL.And you took it on, it appears, based on the letter that Roger Goodell put out yesterday, that Donald Trump initiated a debate over standing for the flag and our anthem and those that fought, bled and died and looks like you won.One second.Ive got to take a water break.Theres no air conditioner.This was important to you.Obviously, the people of the country are with you.Hundreds of thousands of people fought, bled hundreds of thousands died fighting under that flag.When you look at the Obama years, Chicago.One city, his adopted home town, 3,900 people were murdered.In the last six years of Obamas presidency, 18,000 shootings.I dont think he mentioned it but three or four times.And disproportionately, his economic policies hurt black Americans, Hispanic Americans more.How will your policies help minorities that are still struggling?We watched a lot of high profile incidents during the Obama years.Ferguson, Trayvon Martin down in Florida, Freddie Gray he called the he said the Cambridge police acted stupidly.It seems every two or four years and Ive been now 30 years in radio, I just started my 23rd year at FOX that every two or four years thank you is that every two to four years the Democrats will play the race card and I resent it as a Conservative.Because theyll say oh their policies theyre racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic and meanwhile their policies havent helped the minority communities in America.Is there a way from the Federal governments perspective that you can bring economic opportunity and safety?There was a lot of coverage of our phrase they would report in the media cryptic phrase the calm before the storm.It seemed related to Rocket Man his term Kim Jong-un, in terms of him having ICBM capability, nuclear capability, firing missiles over Japan, our ally, threatening Guam, and potentially maybe being able to reach the United States, continental United States, with a nuclear weapon.At some point, this is going to come to a head.What was the calm before the storm?Is it fair to say, if he keeps firing missiles, thats going to end?You dont want to telegraph.When you said The calm before the storm youre not going to talk about that either?Iran, it was interesting.It was interesting.Bill Clinton, when he made the deal with Kim Jong-uns father, Kim Jong-il, he actually said that this is a good deal for the American people.It was not.It seems the same mistake was made with President Obama and the Iranian deal.Theres reports you will decertify this -you can also pull out of it.John [Bolton] is suggesting you just pull out completely.Why decertify, and not just scrap it?Or do both?Do you know what youll do?Why not, right?Yes.Plane loads.You want out of this deal.Let me ask you about immigration.You came up with a 70-point plan.It was fear, after you had met with Pelosi and Schumer and you were talking about DACA one of the things Ive always noticed is, we always get the tax increase, we never get the spending cuts, you always get the consideration on immigration, you never get the wall built.Part of it is there will be, you said, no deal on DACA, unless, of course were going to end chain migration, youre going to build a wall thats going to be see-through now, so the The wall will be built.So you say (inaudible) so no amnesty no chain migration no DACA, until you fund the wall I have identified, and Ive even talked to this, Ive never seen any one person face as much in terms of attacks as you have.You have a media thats hostile.You have Democrats that are hostile.You have Republicans that are hostile.A lot deep state that has been leaking on you.And one of the things that has come up almost throughout your whole presidency is this Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia obsession.Heres my question, I interviewed Julian Assange five times.Ive talked to him other times.He has said its not Russia.There was no collusion.They didnt come the DNC note did not come from them.Congressman Dana Rohrabacher met with him and he says he has proof positive evidence that would show the Trump campaign never colluded with Russia.He just want is it in the best interest of the country that if he has that information that he should give it?It seems Im guessing here he wants in return to be left alone.Should the country does the country deserve to know the truth that (be hows that)?A lot.Yes.Youve only taken one thats since youve been president.But Im glad to have you.Hey, wow.Come on.Help me out here.Thank you.Mr. President, I think I remember one time we had an early conversation and Im going to end the interview on this, and this is how Ive always felt.I just I have you said, Well, you know I have all these things and maybe you want to play golf on my course one day.You said this long before we were friends before you ever ran for office.And then when you ran I just said I only want one thing: help our country.Lets help the forgotten men and women.Lets keep this country safe.And I think thats our prayer for you and the country.The president of the United States.Brian Kilmeade (Fox News Radio), Oct. 17 Hey Mr. President, how are you?Great to see you.This is radio.Right, you look great.But youre looking youre TV friendly.So, I know this is a big week.How important is getting this budget passed?To even get to the tax reform conversation, Mr. President?On tax reform or the budget on the budget in particular right?Right.I talked to Sen. Joe Manchin yesterday who really seems to enjoy your interactions.And he says if they could give me a little something, I could deliver six to eight Democrats.Number one, do you believe that?And No.2, are you willing to negotiate?In West Virginia?So what Mick Mulvaney brought up to me this morning on television was no one talks about the zero percent, because theyve up to $24,000, youre not going to pay any tax, thats part of tax reform Also, people are focused on the corporate rate deduction, what about the small business?Right.So you golfed with Rand Paul over the weekend, and I think most agree, including Mark Short this morning, said that hes going to be the greatest challenge, because he does not like to vote for budgets or tax reform.I mean, can you be friends can you be friendly with someone thats going to vote against that?Have you talked to him?Have you tried?Right.Right.So its going to be a big week obviously, and theres certain things you zone in on, and every Presidents got his preference, some (inaudible) foreign policy.I think you love the numbers, the budget, and the economy.But Ive got ask you something the big picture So I looked at those numbers So are you saying when you when they raise premiums, or raise deductibles, theyre trying to increase their profits instead of doing an honest job about giving people insurance?Are they being dishonest in going too profit-oriented?You would know better than me.Right.Sen. Alexander and Sen. Murray are working on a bipartisan plan.They stopped when it looked as though Lindsey Graham and Cassidy had something going.Is this to force their hand to come up with something?No, not so much this paper, but so much the $7 billion, Im not making that payment.Does that help So you did it to push action?David Axelrod said last night that youre pulling this back and (inaudible) tearing up the Iran deal is your attempt to obliterate the Obama legacy.Is it?I havent.And thats why you handed it to me ahead of time, gave me a little bit of time to study.So some other news that broke today and you tweeted out, Congressman Marino was pulled back as drug czar.What went into that?Big expos on 60 Minutes.New HHS secretary, I was talking to Kellyanne Conway, today.It seems like youre close.Do you want to go over any names?You came out with Mitch McConnell yesterday and seemed on the same page and then said, Ill take any questions.And, it was just a regular it was like a press conference youd see on a sporting event.I know.Why is that?One of the questions was about writing the Green Berets soldiers and ends up being a bigger story.Can I ask you what you thought about when you brought up past presidents and what theyve done?Do you want to clarify anything?No, I meant seeing you happy?Were fair.Thank you.Right.I think were fair.Thank you.I appreciate the time you gave us and the Brian Kilmeade Show.And this morning.And, thanks for having us out here.Thank you, Mr. President.All right.So, were here in the Eisenhower Building and the president actually gave us my own notes for the interview, so thats great.There he is.Thanks for listening.Keep it here.Im Brian Kilmeade.Maria Bartiromo (Fox Business), Oct. 20 Mr. President, thanks so much for sitting down with me today.Here we are on the week that the Dow Jones industrial average just hit 23,000, five-and-a-third trillion [dollars] of market value created since your election.And largely, because of this anticipation and hope that your policies will get implemented.Tell us where we stand on the tax plan right now.It it could be quite historic.Thats a big deal, that on Sunday, exactly.Do you think you have the votes?Yes.You soured on the health-care bipartisan plan a bit right from Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray?Yes, Im interested about that because even your supporters say, you know, hes got fantastic policies.We want to see this through.But the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the way.So obviously the feuding with Sen. Corker I think theres a personal thing going on between you and Sen.

Benjamin Netanyahu.He commended you.He congratulated you for decertifying Iran in what you did last week.Do you think theyre going to get Europeans to support you in terms of sanctions, in terms of not selling technology to Iran?And on North Korea, is our policy with China just about what it does with North Korea or do we have a separate policy with China for something else?Right.For the first time ever Mr. President, would you like to add anything else that I may have missed?When we end, then where we begin and thats taxes.You cant tell companies what to do, right?Are you sure theyre going

markets has been extraordinary and record setting.All of the indexes, at or near record levels.You have accomplished so much in that nine months.And yet, as you say, we need tax reform.Youre meeting resistance from within your own party.Youre meeting resistance from the Democrats.How do you move from here?A lot of love and a lot to get done.And and the and tax reform is critical because of what you have established as the standard now for economic growth under the Trump presidency, tax reform is going to be absolutely critical to driving that growth, job creation and bringing capital back, which youve been talking about for two years before you were elected Absolutely.So where do we go, in terms of capital repatriation for corporate America, how do you incentivize corporations to get back to America with all of that money for investment in jobs, plant equipment, research and development?Right.A conservative number.And the middle class you say this is for the middle class and small business and the pass-through rates are all very attractive.What do you expect the impact to be for working men and women, the middle class, those who aspire to be in the middle class?Right.Well youre the first president to talk openly and honestly about offshoring of production, the outsourcing of jobs.Millions of jobs That that have begun, under your administration, to come back to the country.The idea that made in America, buy in America, hire in America, how how likely is it that that can actually be realized with a with a business community that has fought those on the wrong side of those issues for a very long time?Right.How likely is it that there will be a resolution on NAFTA in these current negotiations?And So as you look at the agreement that has, by the most conservative estimates, costs the United States $1 trillion over the course of over the course of the past 23 years since its inception Okay.Right.Right.There was a Every The when you focus first on free trade, people are like oh, my gosh.Hes talking like an isolationist, A protectionist.And then they started looking at the numbers to see that we are, amongst all of our trading partners that this country is the only one who said, You know, please, take what you want.We dont have to have a mature, intelligent relationship with you.We dont have to have balanced trade.Every other major partner does precisely that.Right.U.S.The role of business in this country, critical, off fundamental to the to the countrys wellbeing and its future to the creation of jobs.But business has taken such a voice in this town, in this swamp that you are the only countervailing influence to that dominance of U.S. multinationals in this country.And its the country owes you a great debt on so much.But on that in particular.And I And you have focused from June 16th of 2015 on the relationship of our borders, our sovereignty, our economy, whether youre looking at the opioid crisis in this country or the import of drugs that all crosses that border.Youre being pushed back against, by the leadership of the House and the Senate on the issue of funding a wall in its entirety.You have been pushed back against talking about changing all of those trade agreements, again, all the external issues that are so critical to the countrys future, your vision for this country.How in the world are we going to be able to deal with all of these issues if you if you cannot bring the Republican party together?Oh, yes.For drugs?Do you have a favorite yet?Tough job.Youre obviously enthused about what youre going to get done.Youve got to be immensely gratified at what youve been able to do often with a recalcitrant Congress and Senate.Going forward, theres another wall and theres a wall thats just fallen between the American public, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons campaign.They funded something called the Trump dossier which they ballyhooed for some time.We now know who paid for it.The DNC and Hillary Clinton and one, as yet, unnamed republican.Do you want to Do you have a suspect?Right.I think her word that she likes to use, its so serviceable about that dossier, debunked.Its been debunked.And, contemporaneously, suddenly the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight Committee are turning to the Democratic Party and talking about not talking about but beginning the investigation of something called Collusion with the Russians.Your thoughts?Right.Right.Relationships you were criticized for even trying to court, if you will, President Xi of China.Everyone, the so-called intelligentsia of this countrys foreign policy establishment, said youre wasting your time, it just cant be done.And obviously youve made significant progress with him and Right.written into the Constitution.Hopefully the whole world.Anything to report to America on your conversation with President Xi?Right.Youre nearing a decision on who will chair the Fed.Any hints?We appreciate it.All right.And you I do, and I think I may I constrain myself?Because an ad hoc adviser to the president I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping.I havent been utterly rejected Right.Absolutely.And Im saying that, by the way, not being any fan of interest rate hikes by the Fed here, and as has been discussed since December of 2015.I have to ask you in conclusion and I really appreciate your time, as does our audience you came into this job fighting like hell.And you are fighting like hell every day.I I thats And Ive got to ask you, I mean, youre one of the most I would say, by the left particularly, reviled, even hated men to ever hold your post.Youre also one of the most loved and respected In history.And how does that feel?How where is Donald Trump today, as you are just now beginning your presidency?Without question Right.Right.Right.Yes.And Yes.Well I you you are a, if I may say, everything as advertised as you ran for President.And appreciate everything youre doing.Thanks so much.Mr. President, thank you.
Grassley: We ought to pursue probe into Obama-era uranium deal:::::Trump on the 401(k) tax break: 'Maybe we'll use it as negotiating'
Flake says he wont endorse Moore:::::Trump on the 401(k) tax break: 'Maybe we'll use it as negotiating'
This is why the congressional budget process is broken:::::House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 26 lauded the passage of the budget as an "enormous step" toward tax reform, and said the plan would be released "very shortly."(Reuters) The Republican House and Senate have now adopted their annual budget resolution, missing the legal deadline by more than six months.Congress has also failed to pass a single regular spending bill for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, opting instead for a stopgap measure that runs out in early December.This is nothing new: Congress hasnt completed work on all of its spending bills by the Oct. 1 deadline since 1996, and in some years hasnt even bothered to adopt a budget blueprint.Established in 1974, the congressional budget process now seems broken.Partisan conflict and creaky rules have undermined the process, and with it Congresss budgetary discipline.This is how its supposed to work Under the Congressional Budget Act, fiscal work is supposed to proceed in an orderly, scheduled way each year.The president is to submit a budget proposal by the first Monday in February, and Congress is to adopt its own blueprint by April 15.This congressional budget resolution can, but does not have to, set up the fast-track reconciliation process, described in more detail below.The budget resolution is not signed into law, but it can represent an important statement of a partys priorities and has become a highly partisan document.No member of the minority party has voted for a budget resolution offered by the majority party since 2008.And 1997 was the last year that a budget resolution received more than a small handful of minority party votes in either chamber.[President Trump is trying to reach across the aisle.Good luck with that.]The Appropriations Committees in both chambers are to follow with a set of separate spending bills; since 2007, there have been 12.Each deals with particular federal functions, such as defense or the environment, and are to be completed before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1.Annual spending bills bear greater political burdens Lawmakers and party leaders come to Washington with many policy and political goals, but when Congress is as gridlocked as it has been in recent years, they find fewer opportunities to pursue them.Instead, the few must-pass bills considered each year, including the spending measures needed to keep the federal government running, become the only outlets for these legislative hopes.Managing such conflict on budget-related measures in the House is made more difficult by the rules governing how leaders bring spending bills to the floor.Under long-standing House practices, the majority partys leaders tend to allow individual legislators wide latitude to offer amendments to spending measures.Through the mid-1990s, leaders treated a wide range of House bills the same way, leaving them open for amendment.But in recent years, those opportunities have all but disappeared on non-spending bills.Since 2011, the House Rules Committee has sent only 11 non-spending measures to the floor under open rules.When their ability to influence other bills is limited, lawmakers channel their amendments to spending bills.In some cases such as when, in 2015, a House member offered an amendment that would have allowed the Confederate flag in federal cemeteries such efforts can derail the appropriations process altogether.Budgets are free from filibusters but not conflict Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, neither budget resolutions nor reconciliation bills can be filibustered.Filibusters have become extremely common in the contemporary Senate, so that few bills can pass unless backed by at least 60 Senators.Since Senate majorities that large are rare, these measures become especially attractive vehicles for achieving partisan goals.[Republicans are the party of ideological inconsistency] When theres no filibuster threat, Senate leaders have a harder time limiting senators ability to offer amendments to the budget resolution.As a result, budget resolutions now regularly involve a vote-a-rama, a lengthy series of back-to-back votes that extends late into the night.Senators have seen their chances to amend other bills become increasingly subject to complex, off-the-floor negotiations.And so they take advantage of the budget rules by filing hundreds of largely symbolic amendments as a way of recording their own positions and forcing partisan opponents to state theirs.Since the early 1980s, the Senate majority has, in some years, wanted to use the reconciliation rules to advance a filibuster-proof bill.But before the majority can introduce a reconciliation bill, it has to adopt a budget resolution.That can lead to even more conflict, since the majority is motivated to pass a budget by any means necessary.Thats what happened in January when the new Republican Congress adopted a shell budget without specific policy details more than three months after the start of the fiscal year.In adopting this bare bones budget, the majority laid the groundwork for a reconciliation bill that would repeal Obamacare and couldnt be filibustered, enabling passage without any Democratic votes.(Of course, that failed when Republican Sens.Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and John McCain voted against it.)While Republicans have abandoned ACA repeal, theyre using the reconciliation tactic again.Using parameters set in the newly adopted budget resolution, they are hoping to rush through tax cuts in a filibuster-proof bill that would not require any Democratic votes.The partisan environment doesnt help either One frequent criticism of the current budget process is that Congress has been loading up omnibus spending bills that cover many parts of the federal government rather than considering each subject-specific spending measure individually.Work by political scientist Peter Hanson suggests that, in the Senate, parties have been relying on one or few large spending measures in response to broader partisan dynamics.Unlike the budget resolution, spending bills can be filibustered.This means some minority party support is needed, first to bring the bill up for debate and then for eventual passage.When the Senate majority is small like Republicans current 52-seat coalition and when the parties are polarized, its harder to get this necessary cooperation.Putting individual spending bills on the floor also forces senators to take politically difficult votes that potential opponents could highlight and challenge come the next election season.To help their own members avoid such scrutiny and to reduce the number of times they need to attract minority votes, majority party leaders take the omnibus route instead.The cohesion of the majority party or lack thereof also matters.In recent years, one symptom of House Republicans internal divisions has been a bloc of members unwilling to vote for omnibus spending bills.When that faction has been large enough that there were not enough Republican votes to pass the measures, Republican leaders have had to turn to Democrats for help keeping the government open.The leverage this gives Democrats makes must-pass omnibus bills targets for other partisan fights as we see with an emerging conflict over immigration policy ahead of Congresss December deadline for passing its next spending bill.[Watch out, Congress.Tax reform could be just as hard as health care.]Where do we go from here?Without a functioning budget process, it is difficult for Congress to serve as a responsible steward of the nations resources.When short-term spending bills are the norm because Congress cannot complete its work on time, federal agencies, uncertain about funding levels beyond the next few months, are unable to plan effectively for the long term.Congresss operations are quite different today from when the Congressional Budget Act was adopted in 1974.Theyre even more different than they were in the late 19th century, when the House and Senate first launched individual appropriations subcommittees that would specialize in crafting specific spending bills for separate floor consideration the same basic approach to which Congress unsuccessfully aspires today.Scholars and practitioners with very different perspectives have suggested many options, from eliminating the opportunity to filibuster the motion to take up spending bills in the Senate to biennial budgeting.But without changes in the partisan landscape, rule changes alone are unlikely to restore Congresss budgetary discipline.Molly E.

A very honest and trustworthy senator: Graham, Booker testify in Menendez corruption trial:::::Sen. Cory Booker, shown here on Capitol Hill on Oct. 17, appeared as a character witness for Sen. Robert Menendez, a fellow New Jersey Democrat.(Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock) Sen. Robert Menendezs defense team drew high-profile witnesses from both sides of the aisle Thursday to praise the New Jersey Democrats character but sparks flew after the judge ruled the defense couldnt also elicit testimony from a well- connected lawyer.The eight-week-old public corruption trial of Menendez and his co-defendant, Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, has been a somewhat dry affair, focusing on the details of flight records, Caribbean port contracts and Medicare billing policies.That changed Thursday when Sens.Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took the stand.The defense had also planned to call Marc E. Elias, the attorney who commissioned the now- famous dossier containing allegations about President Trumps connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin.[Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier] Here's what you need to know as Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)'s corruption trial progresses.(Amber Phillips,Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Elias, who has represented Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and many Democrats, was expected to discuss the practice of filling out Senate financial disclosure forms.Omissions on such forms are the basis for three of the charges against Menendez.But the trial judge, William Walls, said Thursday he would not allow Elias to testify, leading to a contentious exchange with the defense lawyers, who asked him to declare a mistrial.You let the government tell their side of the story, and then were not allowed to tell our side, Melgen attorney Kirk Ogrosky told Walls.Thats the issue in a nutshell.Unimpressed by that argument, Walls said the trial would continue.All of you are out of your legal Pampers, and Im not bailing you out unless its a case of rank injustice, he said.Walls showed little patience for the allegation, cutting off Ogrosky and Menendez attorney Abbe Lowell several times during their arguments.I sometimes feel like I cant finish a sentence without you interrupting, Lowell told the judge.The defense attorneys said they would file additional written arguments on the issue.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) was the first Republican to testify on behalf of Menendez.(Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock) Menendez is facing bribery charges, accused of taking gifts from Melgen that included trips on a private jet, a stay at a Paris hotel and campaign donations.In exchange, prosecutors allege, Menendez sought to help Melgen on several fronts, from getting visas for the doctors girlfriends to trying to resolve a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the U.S. government.Menendez and Melgen say that they are longtime friends who enjoyed spending time together and that they were motivated by that friendship, not corruption.Graham testified that he has known Menendez since their days in the House of Representatives and later worked with him as part of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of senators who tried to come up with comprehensive immigration reform.The two often eat breakfast together in the Senate dining room, Graham said.Citing the Iran nuclear agreement, which Menendez opposed, Graham called Menendez someone Republicans can go to if theyre looking for bipartisan support.Graham said that he and Menendez dont often agree on issues but that the New Jersey Democrat is a man of high character.In very difficult circumstances, he always keeps his word, Graham said.A handshake is all you need from Bob.Hes a very honest and trustworthy senator.Prosecutor Peter Koski asked Graham if he had been in the courtroom the past eight weeks for the testimony of other witnesses.Graham replied that he had not, a response that Booker also gave later.Booker, the former mayor of Newark, was effusive in his praise of Menendez and his efforts to fight for people of the inner city.Booker joked that when he first got to the Senate in 2013, Menendez helped show him the ropes.Unsure of whether he needed to push a button or pull a lever to cast a Senate vote, Menendez told him he simply needed to say, Aye.Since that time, their relationship has grown and flourished, Booker said.He described Menendez as profoundly honorable and trustworthy, and a politician who understands from experience the struggles of working-class people.Bob and I are in the thick of it together, Booker said.Were partners.Were in the struggle together.I dont just observe him, I work with him.Menendez is someone who when he gives you his word, you can take it to the bank, Booker said.As character witnesses go, Booker could have cachet for the jurors.He was the mayor of Newark, where the federal trial is being held, for about eight years before winning his Senate seat, and he is the first African American elected to statewide office in New Jersey.The two sitting senators are the most powerful players deployed in the defense strategy of rebutting the charges by presenting Menendez as an honorable, honest person even if those witnesses dont have anything to say about the facts of the case.Booker, a potential 2020 presidential aspirant, has been close to Menendez since winning his Senate seat four years ago and has remained steadfastly supportive of the indicted senator despite the trial.My loyalty is to a guy that is fighting the good fight, Booker told The Washington Post on Wednesday.My focus is supporting him as a guy thats trying to put up a strong defense, he added.Booker has already made high-profile appearances in the courtroom, including on the first day of the trial, when he was there as a guest and hugged Menendez.Menendez spoke to reporters after the court session ended and thanked Graham and Booker for testifying about who I really am.He said he was disappointed that it reached a point where his attorneys had to make a mistrial motion and said they would carry on with their defense.Elias, of the firm Perkins Coie, has advised Menendez for more than a decade as his campaign lawyer, a service he has long provided almost every Senate Democrat.He has also advised Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC that was the recipient of a $700,000 check from Melgen that was earmarked toward Menendezs 2012 reelection and that prosecutors allege was part of the corrupt bargain.Barrett and Kane reported from Washington.Read more at PowerPost
On health care, Republicans praise Trumps success but blame Congresss failures:::::President Trump waves to reporters as he departs for Texas to attend a briefing on hurricane relief efforts Oct. 25.(Bill OLeary/The Washington Post) On Wednesday, President Trump was asked what he wanted the country to know about the failure of the mission in Niger that killed four Special Forces soldiers earlier this month.Well, were going to look at it, Trump replied, saying that the soldiers were there to battle the Islamic State, a dangerous business.Did he authorize this mission?a reporter asked.No, I didnt.Not specifically, Trump said.But I have generals that are great generals.These are great fighters.These are warriors.So you gave them authority to do this mission?another reporter asked.I gave them authority to do whats right so that we win, Trump replied.If that sounds a lot like a commander in chief hinting that he doesnt bear blame for the soldiers deaths, theres a good reason for that: Thats whats happening.Again.When a Navy SEAL was killed in Yemen earlier this year, the White House suggested that the plan had been drawn by the Obama administration in other words, that it wasnt Trumps fault.The I alone can fix it candidate has evolved into the I didnt do it president.And no group is more likely to be blamed by Trump for missteps or problems than Congress even members of Congress from his own party.When Trumps promise to repeal and replace Obamacare collapsed, Trump blamed the House (for passing a mean bill) and the Senate (for not passing anything at all).He was sitting there with his pen, ready to sign something, but never got anything to sign.Who can blame him for that?This strategy leverages the relationship that Trump fostered with his base over the course of 2016.Bad news about Trump wasnt actually bad news, it was fake.Also anything he said or did, Hillary Clinton had said or done something worse.A system evolved, like an oyster forming a pearl: When something negative happened, supporters and sympathetic media quickly built up a shell around Trump to insulate him from its repercussions.Layered on top of that was Trumps explicitly running against the Republican establishment embodied by Republicans on Capitol Hill.Trump consistently polled better than Republican leaders in Congress among members of his own party, a reflection both of his rhetoric and his partys antipathy to its career politicians.When Trump won, Congress got a boost in the eyes of Republicans, who apparently believed a new day was dawning in Washington.As Gallup noted earlier this week, though, that affection rapidly faded.We have a concrete example of how that can work to Trumps benefit.New polling from Fox News released Wednesday addressed views of the Affordable Care Act (that is, Obamacare).Most Americans generally view the law favorably, but three-quarters of Republicans have a strongly unfavorable view of it.The Trump administration has taken concrete steps to undercut the law in the absence of being able to overhaul it.That includes slashing funding for enrollment outreach, stopping participation in enrollment events and spurring premium increases by cutting off a reimbursement mechanism for insurers.Polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that most Americans believe that Trump and his party now own Obamacare and are responsible for its fate, suggesting that this strategy may not pay off over the long run.But that Fox poll asked a more nuanced question, with more options.If the health-care system falters, who is to blame?Trump?Republicans in Congress?Obama?The most common answer was Republicans in Congress, the pick of 3 in 10 respondents.Only 2 in 10 blamed Trump.But among Republicans the responses were even more lopsided: Only 5 percent of Republicans think Trump would be to blame if health care gets significantly worse.Its fair to blame Congress for not passing legislation, certainly.But consider who Republicans think should get the credit if health care improves.About 3 in 10 think congressional Republicans get the credit for improvement but 40 percent think Trump does.Heads, Trump wins.Tails, Mitch McConnell loses.Just among Republicans, anyway.Interestingly, the exact same percentage of Americans overall 19 percent would blame Trump for a failure as give him credit for success.The intent of the American system is that all parties work together to address problems, sharing the credit and blame to some extent between lawmakers and the executive.Trumps Washington, though, operates differently.The buck stops with him when its a good buck the bad bucks slip past his desk to someone else.Its how he ran his campaign; its how he runs the country.And, at least within his own party, it works.
Clinton, the DNC and the making of the 'Trump dossier' -- what we know:::::(CNN) The long probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election took another turn this week when it was revealed that Hillary Clinton's campaign helped fund the creation of the controversial Trump dossier.Like with so much else attached or adjacent to the Russia investigation -- from President Donald Trump's campaign and its associates to Clinton and hers -- separating the noise from the news can be an exhausting endeavor.This latest round of new details poses all the usual complications.So, what happened -- and what matters?Partisans, especially Clinton and Trump loyalists, would give you very different answers.But it boils down to a question of priorities.None of the major facts revealed this week are being disputed.The fight is over what's relevant to the bigger picture -- and whether anything has materially changed.Shall we?What happened?The law firm for the Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee has acknowledged its clients' role in paying a company called Fusion GPS for opposition research on Trump.Some of that research became the dossier of allegations about the now-President and Russia.This matters because: Fusion GPS is the research group that hired as a subcontractor the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.And it was Steele, working for Fusion GPS sometime after it hooked up with the Democrats, who compiled the now-famous dossier.Is this news?In a story like this, even seemingly minor details can tweak the narrative.As CNN reported in January 2017 , a summary of Steele's file was presented by senior US intel chiefs to both President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump a few weeks before Inauguration Day.Also in that story, and especially relevant now: "(Steele's) investigations related to Mr. Trump were initially funded by groups and donors supporting Republican opponents of Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries, multiple sources confirmed to CNN.Those sources also said that once Mr. Trump became the nominee, further investigation was funded by groups and donors supporting Hillary Clinton."Even more simply put, Republicans began this specific effort to gather dirt on Trump and, when they pulled back, Democrats took it over.It makes perfect sense if you look at a calendar.As noted above, the Democrats first started work with Fusion GPS in April 2016 -- the month in which it became undeniably clear Trump was on his way to becoming the GOP nominee.So again, the new thing here is not that Democrats paid Fusion GPS, and so helped -- wittingly or unwittingly -- to bankroll Steele's work, but that it was, specifically, Clinton's campaign and the DNC.(Your eye-rolling friend would, right about now, pop up to ask, "Well, who else would it have been?"It's a fair question.)Note: Opposition research -- as dirty and secretive as it can be -- is an everyday part of US elections.If it's no big deal, why didn't Clinton's team and the DNC share this earlier?Good question!The Clinton campaign and the DNC could have simply told reporters they had entered into a deal with Fusion GPS months ago, cutting off whatever speculation was out there and effectively forestalled this new drama.But they did not.And the result is the fact that the Clinton campaign funded this research could very well take some wind out of the sails of those outraged about Trump's emissaries potentially working with a foreign power.The first explanation, as given in various forms by former campaign officials and the DNC, is that they didn't know.Indeed, as reported by CNN on Thursday, both Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denied to congressional Russia investigators that they had any knowledge about an arrangement to research Trump.Brian Fallon, the campaign's national press secretary and now a CNN political contributor, tweeted on Tuesday that he wasn't aware of the connections.But he made no apologies, tweeting, "I have no idea what Fusion or Steele were paid but if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping (Justice Department special counsel Robert) Mueller, it will prove money well spent."I have no idea what Fusion or Steele were paid but if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) October 25, 2017 In a subsequent post, Fallon responded to a reporter's question asking why Marc Elias, the Clinton campaign lawyer, had kept mum on the matter for so long."Don't know what Elias may have said," Fallon tweeted, "but if he was coy, he was prob just being a good lawyer honoring confidentiality."Dont know what Elias may have said but if he was coy, he was prob just being a good lawyer honoring confidentialityhttps://t.co/byV0gsQO81 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) October 25, 2017 What also remains unclear is how much Elias knew about Steele's work, and its contents, during the campaign.A source told CNN this week that the dossier -- the one published by Buzzfeed after CNN reported on its existence -- "wasn't in Marc's possession before the election," and that "while he was certainly familiar with some, but not all, of the information in it, from the research that was being done, he didn't have and hadn't seen the full document, nor was he involved in pitching it to reporters."The politics of it all The dossier was for months, well before the end of the campaign, an open secret in political and political journalism circles.Its details were not reported, even as parts of it made the rounds among reporters, because no one could confirm the details inside it.In the time since, despite the dossier's most salacious allegations still going unverified, its broad assertion that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community.Note: Details from the dossier were not reported before Election Day, except by Mother Jones , in late October 2016.CNN also reported earlier this year that US investigators have corroborated other aspects of the dossier, specifically that some of the communications among foreign nationals mentioned in the memos did, in fact, take place.CNN reported in April that the FBI last year used the dossier as part of the justification to win approval to secretly monitor a Trump associate, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.Officials familiar with the process say even if the application to monitor foreign policy adviser Carter Page included information from the dossier, it would only be after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation.The officials would not say what or how much was corroborated.The sum result is that the substance of Steele's research remains a heated point of debate.Anti-Trump forces are excited to see it further probed and amplified in the media.Trump and his allies, meanwhile, are keeping up their efforts to discredit everything in its pages, along with anyone who would report on it and, over the last few days, the people who underwrote the work that delivered it.The most obvious example of the latter point came from White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.She tweeted a Washington Post story about it on Tuesday -- not to allege fake news, but to give this analysis: "The real Russia scandal?Clinton campaign paid for the fake Russia dossier, then lied about it & covered it up."The real Russia scandal?Clinton campaign paid for the fake Russia dossier, then lied about it & covered it up.https://t.co/kR8z2zsZ7Q Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) October 25, 2017 As with so much else related to Russia, the congressional and special counsel investigations into its 2016 activities, and the media conversation about it all, muddier waters make for a happier White House.
The JFK assassination files: Live updates:::::Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.
Trump releases some, but not all, JFK records:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday agreed not to release the full tranche of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , acquiescing to last-minute requests from national security agencies that some of those records remain secret.The US government released over 2,800 records Thursday night in an effort to comply with a 1992 law mandating the documents' release, but kept roughly 300 files classified out of concern for US national security, law enforcement and foreign relations.In a memo , Trump directed agencies that requested redactions to re-review their reasons for keeping the records secret within 180 days.Still, Trump's decision to keep some documents secret is likely to keep conspiracy theories alive, fueling those who have long questioned official conclusions about the assassination and argued that the government has helped cover up the truth.An initial review of some of the previously classified documents shed some light on the circumstances surrounding the Kennedy assassination.One document revealed that the CIA intercepted a call Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald made to a KGB officer at the Russian Embassy in Mexico less than two months before killing Kennedy and that CIA agents speculated that he might be a KGB agent.Oswald spoke to an "identified KGB officer," Russian Consul Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov "in broken Russian."The report says "It is not usual for a KGB agent on a sensitive mission to have such overt contact with a Soviet Embassy," but adds "such contact in official installations may be caused by the agent's own carelessness."The files also revealed new information about threats the FBI received against Oswald after he was arrested.Hoover said on November 24, 1963, he "received a call in our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald," information the FBI shared with the Dallas chief of police."He again assured us adequate protection would be given.However, this was not done," Hoover said.Oswald's killer Jack Ruby has maintained that he acted alone and it was not clear if Ruby had made the threat to the FBI's Dallas office.What will remain secret?Trump teased the release of the documents twice in the last week, but did not make clear whether he planned to allow the full release, though he noted in a Saturday tweet that he would allow the release of documents "subject to the release of further information."The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.So interesting!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2017 In his letter, he says more information should eventually be released."The American public expects and deserves its government to produce as much access as possible to the John F. Kennedy assassination records," he wrote."I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted" on the records, the memo said."At the same time, executive departments and agencies have proposed to me that certain information should continue to be redacted because of national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.I have no choice -- today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation's security."Trump is permitted to block the release of certain documents if he finds "an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations" and if "the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure," according to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.The deadline comes 25 years after the enactment of that law, which mandated the release of all government documents related to the Kennedy assassination in an attempt to quell conspiracy theories that have long swirled around the assassination.But as deadline day came on Thursday, US intelligence and law enforcement agencies continued to make last-minute requests, resulting in a "messy" process in the final hours of the deadline, a senior US official told CNN.The White House did not receive all of the requests until mid-day Thursday.That left Trump's aides scrambling to funnel all of the information to the President, who had only a few hours to decide how to proceed.Administration officials said the sensitive information that will remain redacted for now relates to "intelligence, law enforcement and other details."That includes the identity of individuals involved in the investigation into the assassination, their roles as informants to law enforcement and information about foreign partner organizations that were involved in the investigation, a senior administration official said."The President heard those justifications from the agencies that requested the continuing postponement and he acknowledged that information ... requires protection," the official said.Agencies requesting continued redaction of certain documents will need to submit a report to the US Archivist by March 26, 2018, explaining why those documents meet that standard, the White House said.Documents determined to not meet those standards will need to be released by April 26, 2018.By setting a new deadline in 180 days, Trump's team is hoping to enforce greater accountability from the agencies to get them more thorough accounting for their reasoning on keeping some of the records redacted.What are historians looking for Historians who have closely studied the Kennedy assassination have said they do not expect the documents to reveal any bombshells or to contradict the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible for killing Kennedy.Still, the files will give Americans a fuller picture of how the 35th US president was killed and the ensuing investigation into his assassination."There's going to be no smoking gun in there," Gerald Posner, the author of "Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK," told CNN's Michael Smerconish on Saturday."Anybody who thinks this is going to turn the case on its head and suddenly show that there were three or four shooters at Dealey Plaza -- it's not the case.""Oswald did it alone," Posner continued."But what the files are doing and why they're important to come out is they fill in the history of the case and show us how the FBI and CIA repeatedly hid the evidence."The CIA and FBI documents could also shed new light on Oswald's mysterious trip to Mexico City weeks before the assassination.The files could also reveal new details about US involvement in attempts to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro, notably the CIA's alleged ties to the mob as part of that effort.Trump has been encouraged allow the full release of the files by several Republican figures in the lead-up to the document dump deadline.25 yrs ago Cong said all gov records abt JFK assassination shld b released this month unless Pres blocks No reason 2 keep hidden anymore 1/3 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) October 4, 2017 "No reason 2 keep hidden anymore," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted earlier this month."Time 2 let American ppl + historians draw own conclusions."The President's longtime political adviser Roger Stone, an avid JFK assassination conspiracy theorist, also privately urged Trump to allow the full release of the documents.Stone Thursday night said Trump's decision "has the inadvertent effect of fueling suspicion and skepticism.""If the documents aren't embarrassing, then why withhold them?"Stone told CNN."The issue is it shows the treachery of the Central Intelligence Agency who recruited (Lee Harvey Oswald), who trained him and who placed him."
Trump 'unhappy' with government redactions to JFK files:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump wanted more of the documents related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination released.But when the final requests from government agencies hit his desk on Thursday, there wasn't enough time to go through the hundreds of records the agencies wanted to keep secret, two US officials said.As the deadline ticked away, Trump was confronted with a choice: release all of the 3,100 records without any redactions, or accept the redactions of intelligence and law enforcement agencies and release 2,800 of those documents.Trump agreed to the second option, while also requiring agencies to conduct a secondary review of the information they believed should be redacted within 180 days.But Trump was still miffed by his decision."He was unhappy with the level of redactions," a White House official said, adding that Trump believed the agencies were "not meeting the spirit of the law."White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Thursday night that Trump "has demanded unprecedented transparency from the agencies and directed them to minimize redactions without delay."Read More
President Trump's memo on the release of JFK documents:::::MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES SUBJECT: Temporary Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy The American public expects -- and deserves -- its Government to provide as much access as possible to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records (records) so that the people may finally be fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event.Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted.At the same time, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have proposed to me that certain information should continue to be redacted because of national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.I have no choice --today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security.To further address these concerns, I am also ordering agencies to re-review each and every one of those redactions over the next 180 days.At the end of that period, I will order the public disclosure of any information that the agencies cannot demonstrate meets the statutory standard for continued postponement of disclosure under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C.2107 note) (the "Act").Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President and Commander in Chief by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby certify that all information within records that agencies have proposed for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act must be temporarily withheld from full public disclosure until no later than April 26, 2018, to allow sufficient time to determine whether such information warrants continued postponement under the Act.This temporary withholding from full public disclosure is necessary to protect against harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.I hereby direct all agencies that have proposed postponement of full disclosure to review the information subject to this certification and identify as much as possible that may be publicly disclosed without harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations.Any agency that seeks to request further postponement beyond this temporary certification shall adhere to the findings of the Act, which state, among other things, that "only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records."The need for continued protection can only have grown weaker with the passage of time since the Congress made this finding.Accordingly, each agency head should be extremely circumspect in recommending any further postponement of full disclosure of records.Any agency that seeks further postponement shall, no later than March 12, 2018, report to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) on the specific information within particular records that meets the standard for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act.Thereafter, the Archivist shall recommend to me, no later than March 26, 2018, whether the specific information within particular records identified by agencies warrants continued withholding from public disclosure after April 26, 2018.The Archivist is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.DONALD J. TRUMP ###
Trump wanted gag order lifted on FBI informant:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made it clear he wanted the gag order lifted on an undercover informant who played a critical role in an FBI investigation into Russian efforts to gain influence in the uranium industry in the United States during the Obama administration, according to two sources familiar with the President's actions.The President directed his senior staff "to facilitate the Justice Department's full cooperation with Congress to lift the gag order," one of the sources said.The sources said White House counsel Don McGahn then relayed the message to the Justice Department.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, publicly called on the Justice Department last week to lift the nondisclosure agreement preventing the informant from speaking to Congress.One of the sources said that "when Grassley expressed interest in having (the informant) as a witness, the President wanted to ensure he could."The Justice Department has strict rules limiting the White House's involvement in criminal law enforcement matters.Any involvement by the White House counsel in the decision is unusual, particularly because it relates to the President's political opponents.Read More
Air Force says $22M jet crash caused by assembly error:::::Story highlights The crash occurred on April 5 during a routine surface attack training mission Large portions of the aircraft were found intact after the crash Washington (CNN) Investigators have concluded that a $22 million US Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed near Joint Base Andrews, Maryland earlier this year because its engine was improperly assembled and was missing key parts, the service announced Thursday.The crash occurred April 5 during a routine surface attack training mission.Shortly after departing Joint Base Andrews, the aircraft "experienced an uncommanded engine acceleration, followed by a loss of thrust," forcing the pilot to execute "critical action procedures for low altitude engine failure," according to an Air Force press release.Photos: April 17, 2017: An An Army UH-60 helicopter from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, crashed at Breton Bay Golf and Country Club in Leonardtown, Maryland.One crew member died.Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: April 5, 20917: A US F-16 crashed several miles outside Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.The pilot safely ejected.Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: May 18, 2016: An Air Force B-52 crashes on the Pacific in Guam Hide Caption 3 of 16 Photos: June 7, 2016: Two South Carolina Air National Guard collide over Georgia.November 25, 2015: An Air Force F-16 crashed while on a training mission in New Mexico, but the pilot managed to safely eject from the aircraft.Cost $24,915,222.00 August 2015: Two Air Force F-16Cs accidentally collided on a runway at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, which resulted in one of the aircraft being destroyed and nearly $71 million in damages according to the accident report.December 1, 2014: An F-16CM deployed with the 77th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron crashed supporting Operation Inherent Resolve.The pilot was fatally injured on impact.The aircraft was destroyed with a loss valued at $30,796,852.November 2014: An F-16C crashed in the Gulf of Mexico.The pilot was killed.Cost $21.9M October 20, 2014: Two F-16Cs, assigned to the 125th Fighter Squadron, 138th Fighter Wing, Tulsa Air National Guard Base (ANGB), collided during a training mission near Moline, Kansas.One aircraft was destroyed.The total loss to property was $22,490,842.Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: June 2, 2016: A U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds F-16 crashes near the Air Force Academy in Colorado.Hide Caption 5 of 16 Photos: October 2014: An Air Force F-15D of the crashed in a field close to a school near Weston Hills, Lincolnshire, England.The pilot safely ejected.Cost $45.2M Hide Caption 6 of 16 Photos: October 2015: An Air Force C-130J crashed in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.Cost was $110.6M Hide Caption 7 of 16 Photos: June 2, 2016: Blue Angels Navy F/A-18 crashes during practice for an airshow in Smyrna, Tennessee, killing the pilot.Hide Caption 8 of 16 Photos: April 30, 2015: Fire heavily damaged an RC-135V, cost $62.4M.Hide Caption 9 of 16 Photos: May 26, 2016: Two F/A-18Fs went down in the Atlantic following a mid-air collision.Aircrew ejected safely.No fatalities.Jan. 12 2016: F/A-18A had an engine fire leading to ejection and crash.Cost was $71M Oct 21, 2015: F/A-18C crashed on departure from Lakenheath, England.One military fatality.$ 75.2M loss.Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: May 29, 2016: An EA-18G had inflight arresting gear engagement leading to nose landing gear damage and engine damage in the South China Sea Hide Caption 11 of 16 Photos: Oct. 18 2015: Electrical arcing at vapor cycle power receptacle led to E-2C fire in a the hangar bay on a carrier in the Western Pacific.Hide Caption 12 of 16 Photos: June 14, 2016: An MH-60S crashed into the water while simulating a swimmer deployment in Newport News, Va.

A messy Middle East keeps Tillerson busy:::::Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's to-do list for the Middle East is not getting any shorter.The top US diplomat outlined a series of US priorities and concerns in a briefing with reporters as he ended a six-day trip to the Middle East, South Asia and Europe.Tillerson touched on US concerns about strife between Iraq and separatist-minded Kurds that could undermine the fight against ISIS; the need for Iraq to remain focused on defeating the terrorist group; the squabbling between America's allies in the Gulf; and Iran's influence in Syria and Iraq.He also offered a glimpse into US efforts to improve relationships among its Middle East allies, one possible key to containing Iran's influence in the region.The lengthy list was a reminder that despite President Donald Trump's campaign declarations that the US can no longer afford to be the world's policeman, the Middle East inevitably pulls every administration into its orbit and issues.Tillerson gave a nod to threading that needle, saying that the US will continue its leadership role, but -- like the administration before it -- the Trump White House will call on other countries to do more."The US remains committed to providing leadership in every region of the world," Tillerson said at the end of travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, India and Switzerland."And as we lead, we will continue to ask more of others to take up their responsible roles as well, so that they can ultimately provide for their own people and uphold their own sovereignty," the top US diplomat continued."As we do, we will provide greater security and prosperity for the American people."Tillerson spoke in Switzerland, where he met with Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy on Syria.There, Tillerson said that with ISIS "on the brink" of defeat, the US wants to see the war torn country turn to political negotiations about a future that eventually does not include its leader."As we have said many times before, the US wants a whole and unified Syria with no role of Bashar al-Assad in the government," Tillerson said.Referring to the Obama administration's early declaration that "Assad must go," Tillerson said that, "when this administration came into office we took a view that it is not a prerequisite that Assad go" before a political process starts."Rather, the mechanism by which Assad departs will likely emerge from that process," he said.Asked about the view that Syria has been a victory for Tehran, because it has kept Assad in power and maintained its hold on a country strategically important to it, Tillerson framed his answer in terms of the fight against ISIS."Iran has not particularly been successful in liberating areas," he said, praising the Russian government and the anti-ISIS coalition for successes."So I don't think that Iran should be given credit for the defeat of ISIS in any way in Syria, rather I think they have somewhat taken advantage of the situation with their presence there."Tillerson also touched on Iran's ties to Iraq.The long border and centuries long connections between the two neighbors means "we are not going to eliminate all contact between those two countries.There are legitimate contacts that should continue, economic, trade, things like that," Tillerson said.But he indicated that the US would like to see more distance between the Iraqi government and Iran."What we're saying to Iraq is you must develop the capacity to stand on your own and resist that influence," Tillerson said.In its place, he indicated, the US would like to see a closer relationship between Iraq and countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council, such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, that are close US allies as well."There has been more than three decades of isolation almost between Iraq and the GCC countries," Tillerson said, Iraq and the Gulf countries share a common culture and ethnicity, Tillerson suggested."These are all the same people.Iraqis are Arab.Iraqis are not Persian," he said.The US has strongly supported recent overtures between Saudi Arabia and Iraq."We've worked hard to facilitate and encourage that," Tillerson said, describing the Saudi and Kuwaiti commitment to helping with Iraq reconstruction."It is important to facilitate Iraq again standing on its own, that it doesn't have to only look to the east," where Iran sits, Tillerson said."It has important partners, security partners and more importantly, economic partners to the south, and I think this is how we strengthen Iraq as an independent country and they can make their own decisions then."Referring to a recent meeting between Iraq and GCC members in Saudi Arabia, Tillerson said the US is "glad to see expanding connections between Iraq and its neighbors."The efforts to pull Iraq farther away from Iran have been complicated by a dispute within the GCC, with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and others accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism."The US remains troubled and concerned about the far-reaching consequences of the Gulf dispute," Tillerson said."Our message is clear, the GCC is strongest when it is united."And tensions within Iraq, between the central government and Kurds who have pushed for independence in the north, are another concern."We are disappointed the parties have not yet been able to reach an entirely peaceful resolution over recent tensions," Tillerson said.
Warren: 'More questions than answers' on Niger attack:::::Story highlights Elizabeth Warren said she wants 'an honest conversation about our posture overseas' Pentagon officials briefed members of the Senate armed services committee (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren says there are "more questions than answers" about what led to four US soldiers being killed in the October 4 Niger ambush, and she's arguing for Congress to have a bigger role in determining how US troops operate in countries like Niger where they don't have an active combat mission.Warren, who sits on the Senate armed services committee, told CNN the attack was yet another sign that Congress is long overdue to debate a war authorization that better defines the US' counterterrorism role.In her first public comments on the Niger ambush, the Massachusetts Democrat said it was time for "an honest conversation about our posture overseas.""When we deploy soldiers to places like Niger that aren't considered active combat zones, what are there authorities and rules of engagement, what kind of force protection do they have, what level of risk are we as a country putting them at?"Warren said."These are decisions that require congressional input."Warren and the rest of the Senate armed services committee were briefed by Pentagon officials Thursday about the circumstances of the Niger attack and what investigators have determined so far.Read More
Trump judge nominations: McConnell acts to break filibuster:::::Story highlights The Senate majority leader is taking steps to improve his relationship with President Donald Trump Mitch McConnell is looking to show Congress implementing the President's agenda Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved Thursday to break filibusters of four appeals court nominees, acting aggressively to break what he complained is "often mindless" Democratic obstruction of President Donald Trump's judicial appointments.McConnell, who is still reeling from his inability to muscle through the Senate a repeal of the Affordable Care Act , is under increasing political pressure from the right flank of his party to more assertively bolster Trump's legislative agenda, especially by confirming judges to their powerful lifetime posts."Senate Democrats have decided to continue wasting the Senate's time with pointless obstruction of these nominees," McConnell said before he filed procedural motions that will be voted on next week to break the filibusters."Time and again, they have erected partisan procedural hurdles designed not to change an outcome but simply to waste the Senate's time.""Often," McConnell added, "Democrats don't even oppose the nominee in question."Each of the nominees McConnell is trying to get confirmed, was appointed to an influential circuit court post: University of Pennsylvania law professor Stephanos Bibas for the third Circuit; Notre Dame law professor Amy Barrett for the 7th Circuit; Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen for the sixth Circuit; and Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid for the tenth Circuit.Read More
After long delay, State Department advances Russia sanctions:::::Story highlights The State Department had come under sharp criticism for missing the October 1 deadline Washington (CNN) The State Department, facing bipartisan scrutiny from Congress, issued long overdue guidance on which Russian individuals and entities will be subject to sanctions under recently passed legislation -- 25 days after it was due.The notice, required by the law, was due Oct. 1 and is meant to put potential stakeholders -- including US companies -- on alert in advance of the implementation in January.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent the list to Congress Thursday, State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.The State Department had come under sharp criticism from lawmakers from both parties who questioned why the Trump administration had missed the deadline and whether the delay reflected reluctance from the White House to further sanction Moscow."Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has authorized the department to issue guidance to the public specifying the persons or entities that are part of or operating on behalf of the defense or intelligence sectors of the government of the Russian Federation," Nauert said."What that means is that Secretary Tillerson has signed off on this and it is now being held on Capitol Hill."Nauert said that the State Department was also reaching out to "key US industry stakeholders and our allies and partners" to explain the list.Read More
Pentagon officials brief Congress on Niger attack:::::(CNN) The Pentagon on Thursday provided lawmakers with a classified briefing detailing what the agency has uncovered so far in its investigation of the Niger ambush that left four US service members dead, amid swirling questions on Capitol Hill about the larger US strategy in Africa in the wake of the attack.Leaving the back-to-back briefings for the House and Senate Armed Services Committee, lawmakers said there are still many unanswered questions, including why it took 48 hours to recover the body of Sgt.La David Johnson, who was separated from the rest of the team, and how the attackers were tipped off to the presence of US troops.But the briefing has for now satisfied Arizona Sen. John McCain, the powerful Armed Services chairman who blasted the Pentagon last week for not being forthcoming about the attack and threatened to issue subpoenas if he did not get the information he was seeking."I am pleased at the cooperation we're getting now," McCain told reporters."It was an excellent briefing, we got a lot of good information.It's progress and we expect more, but this is what we've been asking for."However, McCain did express particular concern about why it took that much time to recover Johnson's body.The Arizona senator said he was told the investigation is expected to last about 30 days, and once the Pentagon has finished with its assessment he'll decide whether to hold a public hearing on Niger.The October 4 attack has sparked questions not just about the specifics of the ambush but also about the role US forces are playing in Africa.The US Army team that was attacked had been gathering intelligence on a terrorist leader operating in the area before it was ambushed.US officials told CNN that the unit was not under orders to conduct a kill or capture mission on the leader, and the team was not directed to "take direct action" against enemy forces, according to a US defense official."I was encouraged by the testimony that on the initial assessment, there were not significant steps that could have been taken to prevent this assault," said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican."The detailed investigation may produce different conclusions, so I'll certainly await the results of that investigation to ascertain what exactly occurred, but I was encouraged by the initial testimony."But the lack of drone support for the Niger mission and others like it was a significant concern to both Democrats and Republicans.Several noted that the head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, told Congress in testimony earlier this year that he only had 20% to 30% of his command's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance needs fulfilled."That shortfall has not changed, and the tragic outcome of this incident in my view, can be attributed to lack of support in intelligence and resources that are necessary," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.The attack has also sparked new questions about whether the war against ISIS is moving to Africa as operations wind down in Iraq and Syria, and whether the US needs to adjust its strategy accordingly."The more we succeed in the Middle East, the more we're going to see snakes run to Africa," said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican."And we've got to be prepared to advise and assist the nations there that are willing to work with us."House Armed Services chairman Mac Thornberry told reporters that he's hoping to get all the answers to what happened in Niger as quickly as possible, but he understands it's going to take time -- particularly because US investigators will need the cooperation of the French and Nigerien governments."You're never satisfied because there's an urgency to find out what happened," Thornberry said."So I expressed concern about how long the investigation is taking, until one of my colleagues reminded me we don't really know all the situation from Las Vegas yet.So it's a fair point, but we need to be right about it.We need to find the answers."
In Hill interviews, top Dems denied knowledge of payments to firm behind Trump dossier:::::(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta and former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz both privately denied to congressional Russia investigators that they had any knowledge about an arrangement to pay for opposition research on President Donald Trump, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.The interviews happened before this week's disclosure that the Clinton campaign and DNC paid for the research.Senate investigators may seek to further question the two top Democrats and dig deeper on the origins of the so-called Trump dossier, one of the sources briefed on the matter said.Their remarks to congressional investigators raise the stakes in their assertion that they knew nothing about the funding because it's against the law to make false statements to Congress.The White House has seized on the funding disclosures to discredit the ongoing investigations into potential collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.While the most salacious allegations in the dossier haven't been verified, its broad assertion that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community.In recent closed-door interviews with the Senate intelligence committee, Podesta and Wasserman Schultz said they did not know who had funded Fusion GPS, the intelligence firm that hired British Intelligence Officer Christopher Steele to compile the dossier on Trump, the sources said.Podesta was asked in his September interview whether the Clinton campaign had a contractual agreement with Fusion GPS, and he said he was not aware of one, according to one of the sources.Sitting next to Podesta during the interview: his attorney Marc Elias, who worked for the law firm that hired Fusion GPS to continue research on Trump on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC, multiple sources said.Elias was only there in his capacity as Podesta's attorney and not as a witness.On Tuesday, that law firm, Perkins Coie, wrote in a letter that it had retained Fusion GPS as part of its representation of the Clinton campaign and the DNC.The disclosure of the Democratic funding source for Fusion GPS is raising new questions for the congressional Russian investigators.The Perkins Coie letter suggested its clients -- the Clinton campaign and the DNC -- did not learn about the matter until recently.Senate intelligence Chairman Richard Burr told CNN Wednesday that the disclosure that Fusion GPS had been paid by the Clinton campaign and the DNC opens up a new line of inquiry for the panel to pursue as part of its investigation."This provides us the ability to connect some dots that we couldn't do before this," Burr said."And any investigation when you have a revelation this big, it begins to clarify some pictures that you were already trying to understand.This ... will require us to dig a lot deeper in some areas that maybe a week ago we weren't planning to."As CNN has previously reported , Republican foes of Trump -- whose identity is still not known -- initially hired Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump.Perkins Coie took over funding for that research on behalf of Clinton and the DNC in April 2016, as it became increasingly clear that Trump would become the Republican presidential nominee.Fusion hired the former British spy who assembled the dossier in the summer of 2016.It is not clear whether Hill investigators will press to learn the source of the Republican funding of Fusion.The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, declined to comment through a spokesperson.Asked about her interview before staff investigators on the Senate intelligence panel, which occurred earlier this month, Wasserman Schultz reiterated she had no awareness of the dossier.She declined to say whether she had spoken to the committee.Her Hill interview had not been previously reported."I didn't have any awareness of the arrangement at all," she told CNN."I'm certainly not going to discuss with you what I talked to any committee about."In a statement, Wasserman Schultz said, "I am grateful that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence offered me the chance to share any useful information I may have had as former DNC Chairwoman, which could aid in its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.This was an unprecedented attack on our democracy, and we must prevent it from ever happening again."Wasserman Schultz spoke to the panel voluntarily.Elias declined to comment, and Podesta did not respond to an inquiry.One source familiar with the situation said that Podesta voluntarily spoke with the panel and that much the discussion centered on how Russian hackers got access to troves of his private emails.The topic of Fusion GPS, the source says, came up toward the end of the interview and was not a focus for the investigators.But with the new disclosure about the Clinton campaign and DNC ties, Podesta, Elias and Wasserman Schultz may have to return to the committee, sources said.The House intelligence committee has also spoken to Podesta as part of its Russia investigation.But the dossier and Fusion GPS were not discussed in that interview, according to one source familiar with the investigation.Republicans on the House intelligence committee are trying to subpoena financial records of Fusion GPS in order to learn who paid for the research.The issue is currently in the midst of a court battle as Fusion GPS is seeking an injunction to stop the release.Trump told reporters Wednesday that the Clinton campaign and DNC's involvement with the dossier is a "very sad commentary on politics in this country."
50 years of theories: JFK file release spotlights explanations:::::Over the years, those theories sprawled, and the government made some of its document hoard public.Seeking to settle the matter once and for all, Congress passed a law 25 years ago mandating the government release all its documents and giving agencies a long window to keep sensitive information secret.In keeping with that law, President Donald Trump issued a memo Thursday evening blocking some of the files from seeing the light of day, at least temporarily.However, Trump's memo did not block 2,800 government documents relating to the assassination -- from a total that once made up millions -- from release.Trump tweeted his excitement on Wednesday -- as he headed to Dallas for a fundraiser -- saying it is "so interesting!"The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.So interesting!The National Archives sought to temper expectations, warning the most explosive documents have likely already been released, but the deadline of the JFK Records Act, set 25 years ago, could breathe oxygen into some of the many competing theories.After Kennedy's death, President Lyndon Johnson ordered an independent inquiry into it and named Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren to lead that team, known as the Warren Commission.The commission's historic report declared Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and without assistance to kill Kennedy before Jack Ruby murdered Oswald while in custody.Oswald was a former Marine who moved to the Soviet Union for a few years before coming back to the US.His association with communist elements and brief trip to Mexico City shortly before he appeared in Dallas are of interest for those who plan to sift through the unreleased files.The Warren Commission report continues to face heavy skepticism from people advocating alternative theories, and a poll taken around the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination showed the majority believed more than one person was involved, showing popular suspicion for the idea Oswald acted alone.Here are a handful of the most popular and well-known conspiracy theories about the assassination: Multiple shooters The House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations report also concluded Oswald fired on Kennedy, killing the President, but differing with the Warren Commission, the House report said there was a "high probability" that two gunmen fired at Kennedy, offering skeptics of the Warren Commission endless fodder.The term "grassy knoll" now recalls the theory that Kennedy's killer was not necessarily Oswald, but instead a man firing from the ground along the route of Kennedy's presidential motorcade.Trump world finger-pointing Trump's longtime associate Roger Stone is a passionate conspiracy theorist, who now works for the fringe, far-right website InfoWars.Stone is an advocate for the full release of the files and authored a book pointing the blame for the assassination at Kennedy's vice president and successor, Lyndon Johnson.North Carolina Republican Rep. Walter Jones, a leading congressional advocate for the full release of the files, told CNN he spoke with Stone about pressing Trump not to block the disclosure.And like his friend Stone, Trump himself has tossed out his thoughts on the assassination, pointing during the campaign to Sen. Ted Cruz's father -- without evidence -- as someone potentially involved.CIA involvement One of the most popular theories, and one featured in popular culture from Oliver Stone's film "JFK" to Don DeLillo's novel "Libra," is the idea the CIA or people associated with the CIA were involved in some way in the Kennedy assassination.Some theories go far enough to suggest a CIA-affiliated person fired the deadly shot, while others state the CIA or other government agencies had knowledge there would be an attempt on Kennedy's life and, by not acting, they were complicit in the murder.Rep. Jones suggested he belongs to the camp that believes there was likely some agency involvement or inaction and said he believes the release could help settle the matter."The government owes the American people the truth," Jones said."And if you were complicit then so be it.'Fess up to it."The House report said the CIA "was deficient in its collection and sharing of information both prior to and subsequent to the assassination."Castro's revenge When Fidel Castro led a communist revolution in Cuba, the US recoiled as the ideological brethren of its Cold War enemies found a foothold not far off from its own shores.Kennedy greenlit an operation, known as the Bay of Pigs, early on in his presidency, in a failed attempt to topple the Castro government.Incidentally, the botched operation, among other things, led Kennedy to criticize the CIA, and a New York Times report quoted Kennedy as saying he wanted "to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds."After the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US continued plotting to kill Castro for years, including trying to poison the autocrat's cigars.Given the potential motive and Oswald's communist leanings, one theory posits Castro had a hand in the killing.For his part, the now-deceased Castro reportedly said after the killing: "This is bad news."Mafia members One theory pulls away some of the Cold War mystique and the potentially crazed lone wolf idea.Instead, it posits the Kennedy assassination was a mafia hit, although possibly one with CIA complicity.Kennedy appointed his brother Robert as attorney general, and the younger Kennedy made going after organized crime one of his top priorities.Moreover, Castro's revolution pushed out elements in Cuba that were friendly to mafia interests.The House investigation said its evidence showed the mafia was not involved in the assassination, but would not rule out the involvement of members of the mafia.Kennedy was not the target Kennedy was not alone in Dallas.First lady Jackie Kennedy was by his side, as was Democratic Texas Gov.John Connally.The governor also took fire when Kennedy was killed, and one theory says Oswald meant to kill the governor, not Kennedy.
What Trump's opioid announcement means:::::Both are forms of national emergency declarations, but the primary difference is the scope and funding for each order."This epidemic is a national health emergency," he said."Nobody has seen anything like what is going on now."He added: "As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.Never been this way.We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.We can do it."Trump, through the Public Health Services Act, directed his acting secretary of health and human services to declare a nationwide health emergency, a designation that will not automatically be followed by additional federal funding for the crisis, according to a senior White House official.Instead, the order will expand access to telemedicine in rural areas, instruct agencies to curb bureaucratic delays for dispensing grant money and shift some federal grants towards combating the crisis.If Trump had used the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, the federal government would have been able to immediately tap into funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund to combat opioids.The Stafford Act, though, has traditionally been used to provide recovery money to natural disasters, most recently from Hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey.Funding JUST WATCHED Will Trump's wall stem flow of drugs into US?Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Will Trump's wall stem flow of drugs into US?05:21 Both designations come with pluses and minuses, experts and senior administration officials told CNN.The nationwide health emergency that Trump ordered is more tailored and directed, but comes with less immediate action.Senior White House officials told CNN that they will follow up this order by working with Congress to fund the Public Health Emergency Fund and to increase federal funding in year-end budget deals currently being negotiated in Congress.But both of those avenues are far from guaranteed, especially given all the other issues on Congress' plate.By using the Stafford Act, Trump would have taken a dramatic step and immediately provided the federal government with money earmarked for natural disasters to combat the issue.But both Trump and Obama administration officials say that designation would have been too broad and put an undue burden on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund, a fund already cash strapped by recovery efforts from the three major hurricanes that hit the United States this year.Using FEMA funds to combat the opioid crisis would be "a little bit like asking an engineer to bake a cake," said Rafael Lemaitre, the former communications director for the White House Drug Policy Office under President Barack Obama."I do think the Public Health Service Act is more appropriate route to take than the Stafford Act designation," he said."I worked at FEMA for two years and dealt with multiple disasters.The Stafford Act is not structured to deal with a long term, complicated public health crisis like the opioid crisis."Tom Coderre, a former senior official in Obama's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration office at HHS, echoed that sentiment."One of the things that I think is the most beneficial part of having a public health emergency is you really can marshal public support and then you can bring all the resources of the federal government to bear on it, bringing people from all of the agencies to combat the issue," he said.Though both Lemaitre and Coderre said this step was important, both agreed that it was not, in Lemaitre's words, a "silver bullet solution to the opioid crisis."That, they said, would be additional funding from Congress."A smarter play here would be for the administration to move beyond this declaration and pass the billions in funding needed to address this crisis.That is how you move the needle on this," Lemaitre said.Fight against opioids There are also concerns in the treatment community about how other actions by the Trump administration -- namely efforts to repeal Obamacare and strip funding from Medicaid -- would adversely impact the fight against opioids.Coderre called efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the sweeping Obama-era health care law that mandates drug treatment services, the "elephant in the middle of the East Room today."Trump's order on Thursday will rely heavily on the presidential commission he convened earlier this year, which in their interim report urge the President to use either the Public Health Services Act or the Stafford Act to declare a state of emergency."The first and most urgent recommendation of this commission is direct and completely within your control.Declare a national emergency under either the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act," wrote the commission led by New Jersey's Republican Gov.Chris Christie."With approximately 142 Americans dying every day, America is enduring a death toll equal to September 11th every three weeks."Christie heralded Trump's announcement by noting that the step was recommended by his commission.But concerns remain about how Trump will follow through on the nationwide health emergency declaration."I hope the Trump administration follows through without delay to use this order to provide relief to the millions of families suffering from this crisis," said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat."We cannot afford to wait months between an announcement and action."
Trump discusses his late brother's addiction:::::Story highlights Fred Trump Jr. struggled with alcoholism for much of his life He died in 1981 at age 43 Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump personalized his anti-drug message on Thursday at the White House, discussing how his elder brother's struggle with addiction led him to never drink or smoke.Fred Trump Jr. struggled with alcoholism for much of his life and died in 1981 at age 43.Trump has cited his brother's short life when pushing for tougher drug enforcement and awareness and did so again on Thursday."I had a brother, Fred.Great guy, best-looking guy, best personality, much better than mine," Trump said."But he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, 'Don't drink.Don't drink.'He was substantially older, and I listened to him and I respected (him)."Ever since his brother's warning, Trump said, he has abstained from drinking and smoking because he had "somebody that guided me" in that aspect of life.Read More
9 Democratic primaries to watch in 2018:::::(CNN) The beginning of Donald Trump's presidency began with a threat from activists to unseat any Democrat, in any position, who crossed party lines or failed to keep a hard line of liberal resistance against the new administration.Those calls, along with an ongoing and testy internal fight over the direction of the party, seemed to boost the prospects of a bloody 2018 primary season.But somewhere along the way, the grim reality of Democrats' position in Washington came into focus -- perhaps it was the travel ban, or the solidarity created during the longer battle to protect Obamacare -- and the party, at least on the federal level, settled into a period of electoral dtente.The promised rebellions faded as progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, rededicated his "political revolution" to grassroots campaigns and organizing.And even moderate "blue dog" incumbents, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, stuck with the base through 2017, deflating his progressive challenger's campaign before it could gain any traction.Still, there is a lot worth watching as Democrats sort out their candidates, and priorities, ahead of the November 2018 elections.Here are a few races, some big and others probably below the radar, that could give us a hint about where the party is headed.1.California: Feinstein vs. de Len vs. the field California state Senate leader Kevin de Len, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Tom Steyer No, it's not technically a Democratic primary -- California throws everyone, whatever their party ID, onto the same ballot for an open primary, with the top two finishers advancing to the fall election.That said, the California Senate race figures to be the most compelling Democratic intra-party contest of the coming year, with California state Senate leader Kevin de Len the early favorite to advance to a November showdown with incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is all but a lock to finish top in the June primary.(This system locked Republicans out of the 2016 general election Senate ballot, too.)De Len comes in to Feinstein's left but will likely split some of the spring vote with other liberal challengers.Billionaire activist Tom Steyer hasn't ruled out a run.Same for another (less) wealthy activist, Joe Sanberg, who is also considering it.Progressive groups are floating some long shot candidates of their own and David Hildebrand, a self-described Democratic socialist, could attract support from the left.2.Illinois governor: Two familiar names and one outsider J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy A billionaire, a Kennedy, and a little known, progressive state senator are the three to keep an eye on as Democrats gear up for a fight with the wildly wealthy incumbent Republican Gov.Bruce Rauner.J.B. Pritzker is the Hyatt heir and venture capitalist with a name familiar to everyone in the region (and a sister who served as President Barack Obama's commerce secretary).Chris Kennedy, son of the late Robert Kennedy, had some practice jabbing at Rauner, assailing his "so-called turnaround agenda" as a sleight of hand, and "part of the narrative that government doesn't work so he has to privatize it," in remarks at the Democratic convention in 2016.Kennedy is the early, if narrow, favorite, but Pritzker's overstuffed pockets will allow him to spend (and spend and spend) all the way up to the vote.State Sen. Daniel Biss might be the most interesting (and left-most) of the three, but his campaign is struggling to break through.In part, that's a money issue.Pritzker and Kennedy are awash in it.Biss is not, and he tripped out of the gate when he brought on Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate, then promptly parted ways with him after Ramirez-Rosa's support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against the Israeli government grabbed some headlines.The decision dampened Biss' progressive cred -- Ramirez-Rosa, a Democratic Socialists of America member, never hid his support for BDS -- and raised questions about the campaign's vetting process.3.Iowa governor: A big, rowdy tent Andy McGuire, John Norris and Cathy Glasson Perhaps the widest open of the big ticket Democratic primaries, the Iowa race was also the least likely, one year ago, to turn into a national pressure point.If Trump had not tapped the state's now former Republican governor, Terry Branstad, to become his ambassador to China, the field would surely be much smaller.Instead, there are -- right now -- seven candidates vying for the nomination.And while there's no reliable public polling at this point, the early buzz is with candidates like Andy McGuire, the former state party chairwoman, John Norris, an Iowa political fixture who ran Jesse Jackson's 1988 campaign there , State Sen. Nate Boulton, and Cathy Glasson, a nurse and union leader who is working overtime to court the Berniecrat crowd.She recently nabbed an endorsement of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action Fund, a progressive group close to Sanders.Activist Jon Neiderbach, former Iowa City Mayor Ross Wilburn and businessman Fred Hubbell are also in the mix.But the tone of the debate could be as important as its results.As the Des Moines Register's Jason Noble put it back in May , "a crowded and dynamic primary could help the (state) party clarify its message."4.Illinois-3: Blue Dog under attack Marie Newman One of the few incumbent Democrats facing a serious primary challenge on the federal level, Rep. Dan Lipinski, a "blue dog" now vying for an eighth term in the House, is generally regarded as one of the party's most conservative elected officials.He is anti-abortion and voted against Obamacare in 2010.This year, he opposed the GOP repeal plan but voted in the House for "Kate's Law," a controversial bill that would crackdown on undocumented immigrants who repeatedly enter the country illegally after being deported.In a district Hillary Clinton won comfortably in 2016, a challenge seemed inevitable.On the flip side, Marie Newman has a profile more in line with the party's recent liberal shift.She was endorsed by the Daily Kos , the liberal online activist hub."The 3rd District is beyond solidly blue," Newman told columnist Ted Slowik in July."We have this Republican in Democrat's clothing inside the district acting as our voice in Congress."Lipinski, though, has deep roots in the state political establishment -- his father, preceded him in Congress before becoming a lobbyist -- and has fended off a primary challenge before.He also figures to outspend Newman.5.Oklahoma governor: It's not impossible!Connie Johnson Yes, there are Democrats in deep red Oklahoma.And with Republican Gov.Mary Fallin a term-limited lame duck, they won't have an incumbent to take on in 2018.History suggests it's not a lost cause either, as Fallin's predecessor, the Democratic Gov.Brad Henry, also served two terms.What was a three-way race featuring former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson, State Rep. Scott Inman and Connie Johnson, a former state senator and DSA member -- by far the most liberal of the group -- was cut down to two on Wednesday, when Inman abruptly dropped out and announced plans to resign his current post next year.Edmondson belongs to one of the best known and most powerful families in Oklahoma politics.His father was a US congressman, his uncle a governor and US senator, and brother James is now on the state Supreme Court.But progressives will be interested to see how Johnson fares -- especially after Inman's departure.An unabashed progressive, she spent nearly a decade in the state senate and, in 2014, became the first woman and African American to win her party's nomination for the US Senate out of Oklahoma.6.New York: Who's going to take a run at Cuomo?New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo It's been a difficult year, but Gov.Andrew Cuomo is still liking his odds in what could yet be a contentious primary.Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner, a Cuomo ally turned antagonist who has taken public issue with his strategy for aiding financially pressed smaller cities, is among those mulling a challenge.In August, The Wall Street Journal reported that actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, of "Sex and the City" fame, was doing the same.She's yet to make a decision, but her name recognition could help build some quick momentum.Former Democratic state senator Terry Gipson is another potential opponent.He too -- sensing a theme here?-- could attract support from liberal activists and, in an interview with The Auburn Citizen's Robert Harding earlier this month, took a shot at Cuomo, saying, "I am continuing to be frustrated that we live in one of the bluest states in the country and our state government continues to govern as if we live in Oklahoma."Bottom line: a tougher-than-expected 2018 primary race could take a potential 2020 presidential bid off the table for Cuomo -- and augur trouble for similar, more moderate blue-state Democrats around the country.7.Rhode Island: Progressives keep chipping away Rhode Island state Rep. Aaron Regunberg State Rep. Aaron Regunberg jumped into the lieutenant governor's race in Rhode Island on Tuesday, setting up a showdown with incumbent Democrat Dan McKee.The 27-year-old Regunberg supported Sanders in 2016 and will have the Working Families Party, one of the progressive organizations that helped lead the successful statewide charge to expand sick leave in the state, boosting his bid.(Regunberg sponsored the House version of the leave bill.)Gov.Gina Raimondo, a moderate Democrat, is expected to win her 2018 re-election bid, so victory for Regunberg, viewed for now as a narrow underdog, would create an interesting dynamic in Providence -- and a chance to see if the party's two poles can get along and run a state government.8.Maryland governor: Slow start to a big race Benjamin Jealous Unlike New York, Maryland's gubernatorial primary is both crowded and wide-open.Incumbent Gov.Larry Hogan is a Republican and Democratic voters don't yet have a clear handle on his would-be challengers.The most familiar names nationally, former NAACP president and CEO Ben Jealous and Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, a policy consultant married to Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, haven't broken through on the state level, according to a Goucher Poll survey released last month.Former state attorney general Doug Gansler, who registered the most potential support, took himself out of the running a week before the poll came out.After him, Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker scored best, with 21% saying they would consider voting for him.Fourteen percent said the same for Jealous; Rockeymoore Cummings fell short of double-digits, at 9%.Mostly though, voters said they needed more info, with 7 or 8 out of 10, depending on the candidate, saying they "don't know enough to judge."Jealous' fate will attract the most national attention.Already known for his time running the NAACP, he was among the most prominent of Sanders' big-name backers in 2016.He is a former board member for Our Revolution, the political organization spun out of that campaign.Jealous has their endorsement and that of the Maryland Working Families Party in 2018.9.Florida-7: A lefty longshot Chardo Richardson Down in Florida's 7th congressional district, former ACLU of Central Florida board president and Air Force veteran Chardo Richardson is seeking to outflank incumbent Rep. Stephanie Murphy on the left.Richardson is a longshot still and Murphy has a significant fundraising advantage, but he comes on the scene with the backing of the Justice Democrats, a progressive group launched by Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks.California Rep. Ro Khanna, the young organization's most prominent backer, won his seat in 2016 by knocking off a fellow Democrat, incumbent Mike Honda.An upset here would signal a big shift -- in the direction of the party's progressive wing -- for Sunshine State Democrats.
Budget narrowly passes House, a key step in tax reform:::::(CNN) The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget resolution Thursday that clears the path for Congress to fast-track tax reform legislation, a major victory for President Donald Trump and congressional Republican leadership.The vote was 216-212, with 20 Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure.Republicans passed the bill despite some opposition within the party over a plan to eliminate the popular State And Local Tax deduction (SALT) in the tax reform framework.The budget includes reconciliation rules that will allow the Senate to pass tax reform with only a simple majority rather than the usual 60 to overcome a filibuster.The Senate has already approved the bill, and while the reconciliation rules next head to the President's desk, the President does not sign the budget resolution.Trump tweeted after the vote , "Big news - Budget just passed!"The current tax reform framework calls for nixing SALT deductions, a tax break used by nearly one-third of filers.Cutting the deduction would help Republicans raise more than a trillion dollars to help pay for tax cuts over 10 years, making it a huge source of revenue for their overall plan to reform the tax code.But Republicans from states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California argue that their constituents rely on the deduction.While some are open to making changes to SALT -- such as capping the income level at which taxpayers could use it -- others don't favor any kind of compromise and want tax writers to leave SALT completely alone."My solution is to take it off the table," said Republican Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey.New York Republicans are skeptical The state and local tax deduction was one of the earliest deductions that Republicans announced would be eliminated, and the uproar was swift.The House GOP is expected to unveil text of its bill next week, and members warn that there will be a dozen more changes to the tax code that will upset members and various constituencies.While negotiations continued over SALT in a meeting shortly after the vote, leaders and high-tax state members emerged saying no deal had been struck but talks would continue.House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters he got the message that the 20 Republicans who voted no were trying to send."They made it clear," Brady told reporters."They need this problem solved before they vote yes on tax reform."Both Brady and members from SALT states were vague on details of a potential compromise, but Republicans from New York said they're still determined to prevent a total elimination of the popular deduction in their state."We stood firm staying 'no' as a group today to let them know we're not kidding," said Rep. John Katko.Katko, who represents the Syracuse area, said the meeting didn't go into specifics of a possible deal."I think we'll be OK," he said."The bottom line is that the ball's in their court and now they know it," he told reporters.Rep. Peter King, who represents Long Island, said there were some Republicans who voted "yes" on the budget Thursday that might not necessarily vote "yes" on tax reform down the road.King said he would have felt better if the budget had gone down, but he said he still felt like leadership was taking it seriously -- though he wasn't entirely confident there would be a resolution in the end."I'm confident they're going to come back with a proposal.I just don't know how satisfactory it would be," he said.King said he expects more meetings will be held early next week when Congress returns.This story has been updated and will continue to update with new developments.
US launches 'most advanced' stealth sub amid undersea rivalry:::::Washington (CNN) Touted as the world's most technologically advanced fast attack submarine, the USS South Dakota is set to join the US Navy fleet amid a growing threat to American undersea dominance from several foreign rivals.Operating beneath the ocean's surface, a submarine's strategic value is often tied directly to its ability to navigate in or near enemy waters without being detected to conduct reconnaissance or attack missions.For years, the United States has maintained a technological edge over the submarines developed by rival nations, but recent advances made by Russia and China have sparked concerns of an emerging threat to American undersea superiority.Christened earlier this month , the nuclear-powered USS South Dakota marks the US Navy's latest effort to maintain that edge and provides a technological blueprint for future development.The Navy's 70-boat submarine fleet is made up of three major types of boats: ballistic-missile submarines, attack submarines, and cruise-missile submarines.Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The USS Michigan, an Ohio-class guided-missile submarine, arrives in Busan, South Korea, for a routine port visit in December 2010.Click through the gallery to see some of the other subs in the U.S. Navy's fleet.Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet A dolphin swims in front of the Virginia-class attack submarine USS John Warner during its sea trials in May 2015.Virginia-class subs, displacing 7,800 tons and at 377 feet long, "are designed to seek and destroy enemy submarines and surface ships; project power ashore with Tomahawk cruise missiles and special operation forces (SOF); carry out inntelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions; support battle group operations; and engage in mine warfare," according to the Navy.Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The Ohio-class guided-missile submarine USS Georgia (SSGN 729) departs Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay to conduct routine operations in October 2015.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The USS Seawolf, shown here in support of European operations in June 2015, is the lead vessel in the three-boat Seawolf class.The Seawolf and the USS Connecticut, the second boat in the class, displace 9,138 tons and are 353 feet long.Click to the next slide to learn more about the third sub in the class, the USS Jimmy Carter.Hide Caption 4 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The Seawolf-class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter is moored in a Washington state facility that reduces a ship's electromagnetic signature in 2006.The Jimmy Carter is 100 feet longer than the first two subs in its class.The extra space is for a "multimission platform," the Navy says."This hull section provides for additional payloads to accommodate advanced technology used to carry out classified research and development and for enhanced warfighting capabilities."Hide Caption 5 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The U.S. Navy has more than a dozen ballistic missile submarines, also called boomers, in service.The boomers, 560 feet long, can carry 24 nuclear-armed Trident II ballistic missiles and serve as nuclear deterrents.Here, the Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS West Virginia departs a naval shipyard in 2013.Hide Caption 6 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The Ohio-class guided-missile submarine USS Ohio transits Puget Sound, Washington, in June 2015.The Ohio and three other guided-missile subs -- USS Florida, USS Michigan and USS Georgia -- were originally built and deployed as ballistic-missile subs, but were converted to guided-missile platforms beginning in 2002 after the Navy concluded it had a surplus of the boomers.Hide Caption 7 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleet The Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Hampton surfaces through Arctic ice in March 2014.The Los Angeles-class is the biggest in the Navy's sub fleet, with a few dozen in commission.These subs displace 6,900 tons and are 360 feet long.The class was introduced in 1976.Hide Caption 8 of 8 The Navy currently fields 17 Virginia-class fast attack submarines, which are built to operate in the world's littoral and deep waters.Virginia-class submarines can launch torpedoes at other submarines and at ships.They can also launch missiles at ground targets, gather intelligence, and deploy Navy SEAL units for special operations."Their inherent stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower directly enable them to support five of the six maritime strategy core capabilities -- sea control, power projection, forward presence, maritime security and deterrence," the Navy said.Incorporating "acoustic superiority" that is expected to provide unparalleled stealth capability, the USS South Dakota will be used as a "demonstrator to prove out advanced technologies," according to Navy spokesperson Lt. Seth Clarke.Lessons learned from South Dakota will be incorporated into later Virginia-class submarines -- "increasing our undersea domain advantage, ensuring our dominance through the midcentury and beyond," Clarke said.The nuclear-powered USS South Dakota marks the US Navy's latest effort to maintain undersea superiority."Stealth capability is one of the crucial advantages of submarines ... the Virginia-class brings capability and capacity that is so crucial as we head into potential peer conflict down the road."according to Randy Forbes, a former US representative who served as chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee while in Congress.The 360-foot USS South Dakota is scheduled to officially enter the fleet in August 2018.The Navy plans to upgrade its Virginia-class boats while developing the next-generation, nuclear-armed Columbia-class.One of those upgrades includes outfitting Virginia-class submarines with additional "Virginia Payload Modules" for Tomahawk or next-generation missiles to provide more strike capacity.Most Virginia-class submarines currently feature two Virginia Payload Tubes, each capable of launching six Tomahawk cruise missiles, according to the Navy.Expected to be operational by 2024 or 2025, that added firepower will help fill the gap as the Navy plans to retire several of its aging fast-attack and ballistic-missile submarines in coming years, according to Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.Brewing submarine rivalry Forbes said the United States has traditionally been able to track foreign submarines but recent advancements made by the Chinese and Russians highlight the need for developments like those seen on the USS South Dakota to maintain American undersea dominance.Russia has invested heavily in developing its own underwater stealth capabilities in recent years and their submarine technology is approaching the level of the US fleet, much like the peer-to-peer comparison seen during the Cold War, according to one congressional aide familiar with the issue.While the Russian military is not necessarily building a large quantity of submarines, it is developing boats with advanced quieting capabilities that are "very competitive" with those in the US fleet, said Hendrix."Russia is modernizing its existing fleet of Oscar-class multipurpose attack nuclear submarines and producing their next generation Severodvinsk Yasen-class," US Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris told the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year."The Russians are making a leverage investment ... with submarines you don't have to build a lot of them," according to Hendrix.The United States has also recently noticed an uptick in Russian submarine activity -- conducting "spurts" of heavy patrols across various regions, according to the aide and a US Navy official."They can't maintain the presence we do with 24/7 operations, but this activity is meant to push the boundary and to see what the US reaction will be," the aide said.But while the United States continues to monitor foreign submarine activity, the increase in Russian patrols is widely viewed as presence and testing maneuvers that do not pose an immediate military threat.It's something the United States should be reacting to but not overreacting to, the congressional aide told CNN.In 2016, US Navy commanders told CNN that Russian submarines had become increasing assertive in the Atlantic Ocean and that their undersea activity was reaching levels unseen for decades.The commander of the USS Missouri submarine, Fraser Hudson, assessed at the time that the renewed Russian activity is not just "a political statement but the Russians are seeking to gain experience in case hostilities were ever to break out between it and the United States."Honestly, I think it's operational experience.You maintain the experience in those (areas of responsibility) so that if anything were ever to happen, they have experience," he said last year.A Russian sub also turned up off the coast of Florida in 2012, and the USS Missouri was called on to track it.JUST WATCHED U.S. Navy alarmed by Russian submarine buildup Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. Navy alarmed by Russian submarine buildup 03:01 In addition to flexing their military muscle in an attempt to show "they still are or want to be a dominant super power," the Russians are also trying to test whether their submarines can travel for long periods without being detected, according to the aide."The Russians are probably at about 80% of the capacity they were at during the Cold War," according to Forbes, who also noted that they are constantly pushing the envelope in terms of capability.China, on the other hand, is opting for a quantity over quality approach when it comes to building up its own submarine fleet."The Chinese are not as advanced but are getting there and they are producing diesel submarines in numbers," the congressional aide told CNN."In the end, numbers are a capability in themselves."Hendrix also noted that there is no indication the submarines being developed by China are close to being as advanced as those in the US arsenal but warned their approach of producing a large number of boats does pose a threat."Quantity can have a quality," Hendrix said.In addition to adding to the size of its submarine fleet, Harris warned earlier this year that they are also advancing their undersea capability.JUST WATCHED Navy sub emerges from under Arctic ice Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Navy sub emerges from under Arctic ice 00:55 "China is improving the lethality and survivability of its attack submarines and building quieter, high-end diesel and nuclear-powered submarines," he said.Both China and Russia have also increased their presence in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, where Harris said 230 of the world's 400 foreign submarines are operating.Roughly 160 of those 230 submarines belong to China, North Korea, and Russia, according to Harris.Forbes said the United States must also develop a strategy to counter Chinese and Russian activity in "gray zones" where they are incrementally expanding their presence by strategically "fighting and competing" through military posturing.China's claims in the South China Sea represent one glaring example as to how they've been able to successfully implement this type of strategy in a way that allows them to expand their military reach without engaging in direct confrontation, according to Forbes.Forbes also explained that the United States has yet to develop a coherent strategy to counter Russian and Chinese gray zone activity -- a challenge that will require both the Navy and Congress to reconsider the way it utilizes American sea power."Major strategy is not some secret play you pull out in the fourth quarter of a football game," Forbes said, adding that if US military leaders don't articulate a strategy to Congress there is no way a plan will be implemented.Emerging challenges By most accounts, the United States still maintains the most capable submarine fleet in the world, but while the addition of the USS South Dakota represents a leap forward in technological advancement, some argue the Navy still faces challenges.Despite President Donald Trump's request for additional defense spending, years of budget cuts and continuing resolutions have had a severe impact on the Navy's maintenance and shipbuilding efforts.The Navy plans to build 30 Virginia-class submarines and replace its 14 aging Ohio-class boats with 12 Columbia-class submarines, the first of which is expected in fiscal year 2021.In March 2016, the Government Accountability Office reported that total program acquisition costs will be about $97 billion, including $12 billion for research and development and $85.1 billion for procurement.There are also discussions about extending deployments and service lives for existing submarines to help make up the difference.But even if the Navy is able to achieve its goal of producing two or three new fast-attack boats per year, the service will only have 41 attack submarines by 2029, according to the Navy's FY17 30-year plan An attack submarine inventory of 41 boats falls well short of the 65 to 70 boats needed to effectively maintain undersea dominance, according to Hendrix.Harris told the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year that he agrees with assessments indicating a need for 66 fast attack submarines.The need to continuously upgrade submarine stealth capabilities also presents a challenge for the Navy, according to Forbes, who said there comes a time when the cost for another decibel of quietness becomes too expensive.Increased costs and the development of new detection techniques that do not rely on the sound a submarine makes could change the way the US Navy thinks about undersea warfare, according to Forbes."If we can't make up the numbers we will have to move to a different way of fighting," Forbes said, adding that the current strategic mindset revolves around "one-on-one" submarine combat."In the future, submarines may have to fight more like an aircraft carrier," he said, describing a system in which submarines are complemented by a variety of unmanned platforms.

5 opinions on Trump's border wall prototypes:::::San Ysidro, California (CNN) President Trump called for a "big, beautiful wall" between the United States and Mexico.And the vision is now morphing into reality with the construction of eight 30-foot tall prototypes in no-man's land on the border south of San Diego.The concrete poured for the sections of wall is now hardening ahead of official tests to see if the prototypes can be scaled, dug under or simply blown up.As that happens, their arrival on the landscape is also hardening opinions.Here are views from five people we spoke to in the shadows of the wall.'The wall is a message' Adriana Alvarez "The wall is a message for Mexicans and people from Central America to stay away from the US.I don't think the wall will be effective because drugs get in through other ways and migrants will always find a way into the US right under the noses of authorities."Read More
White House facing scrutiny for Russia sanctions delay:::::Washington (CNN) Top Senate Republicans are pledging to find out if the White House is intentionally delaying new sanctions on Moscow as the Trump administration is several weeks past a congressionally-imposed deadline to identify top Russian officials involved in political cybermeddling."We're going to check into it," Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN Wednesday."I will find out in the next 24 hours.I'm going to get on the phone with someone and find out."Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the administration is acting "as if they are unilateral.""We have to do what we need to assert our role," he told CNN.Corker and McCain are among Trump's fiercest Republican critics in Congress.The White House is under fire as the deadline to begin the process of slapping fresh sanctions on Russia passed three and a half weeks ago.Administration officials said Wednesday a review process was still underway to identify individuals connected to the Russian defense and intelligence services.The White House pinned the missed deadline on the State Department.Preparing to see Putin JUST WATCHED Things Trump has said about Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Things Trump has said about Putin 01:27 The delay comes as Trump prepares to see Russian President Vladimir Putin for the second time face-to-face during a summit meeting in Vietnam.The White House has declined to say whether the two men plan to sit for formal talks when they both attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Da Nang, but a person close to the administration said Trump's aides are working to arrange a bilateral meeting between the two leaders, although the details have not been finalized.Announcing a new round of sanctions against Russia for its cyber intrusions into last year's presidential election ahead of talks with Putin would prove provocative.Putin has denied Russian involvement in election meddling, and Trump -- who did express concerns about the cyber intrusion during his first meeting with Putin in July -- has nevertheless called the intelligence community findings that Moscow worked to sway the election in his favor a "hoax."It was that attitude which prompted US lawmakers over the summer to approve legislation that required Trump to impose new sanctions on those involved in Russia's cyber efforts.Trump signed the law grudgingly behind closed doors facing with veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate.But in a signing statement, he expressed constitutional objections to Congress' attempt to sway his foreign policy.And the White House expressed reservations at the law's potential to sour his efforts to improve relations with Russia.Since then, the administration has taken some steps to comply with the law, including updating an existing set of Treasury sanctions on Russia related to its incursion into Ukraine.On September 29, the White House delegated authorities for identifying those involved in the cyber intrusions to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.But the administration did not, as required by the law by the start of October, "issue regulations or other guidance to specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation."Neither the State Department nor the White House could say when the assessment -- which was required by law to be completed by October 1 -- would be finished, saying only that it would be announced "soon."White House 'remains committed' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted the administration "remains committed to holding Russia accountable -- and has on a variety of fronts," citing actions to confront Russia's actions in Syria and recent comments from US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley condemning Moscow's support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.Privately, however, White House officials blamed the State Department for the delay, expressing frustration at the process, which led to the missed deadline."There is no deliberate holdup," one official said, adding the memo on beginning implementation of the sanctions should have been prepared and circulated by now.On Tuesday, the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the agency was "working to try to complete that process.""My understanding -- and I'm not working on this myself -- but from our people who are working on it, they tell me that it's pretty complicated, that it can take some time," Nauert said.The delay had drawn concerns from Republicans and Democrats alike, who worry the administration is slow-walking a process that Trump had already expressed misgivings about when it was being debated over the summer.'Obey the law' "They can say whatever they want to.But they have to obey the law.The law is what the Constitution says we have to obey," McCain said, suggesting his armed services panel had the power to enact its own punishment of Russia's cyber behavior.His Democratic colleague, Sen. Ben Cardin, said he had yet to receive a formal response to a letter he and McCain wrote to the administration late last month pressing for a comprehensive plan for implementing the sanctions required by the law.Cardin said an early October meeting with Tillerson to discuss the matter yielded few answers, and he hadn't heard from the State Department since then."I am concerned," Cardin said."First of all, the relationship between the different agencies and the White House is unclear.We've seen supposed decisions made and not be carried out," he said."They've already missed deadlines.We will look at other options."A person familiar with Cardin's October 11 meeting with Tillerson said the top diplomat assured him the State Department was working on the guidance, and that the administration had no intention of shirking its responsibilities under the law to conduct the review.
Trump declares opioid epidemic a public health emergency:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency on Thursday, telling an audience in the East Room of the White House that "we can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.""This epidemic is a national health emergency," he said."Nobody has seen anything like what is going on now."He added: "As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.Never been this way.We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.We can do it."Trump, in a wide-ranging speech about opioids, stressed the need for further enforcement and linked his planned wall along the US-Mexico border with efforts to stem the tide of illegal drugs coming into the United States."An astonishing 90% of the heroin in America comes from south of the border -- where we will be building a wall -- which will greatly help in this problem," he said.Some experts are skeptical about the wall's ability to fight the problem, given its roots in painkillers prescribed by doctors in the United States.Trump also stressed the need to crack down on those Americans who are buying illegal drugs, stressing the need to link enforcement with stopping abuse in the first place."Every person who buys illicit drugs here in America should know that they are risking their futures, their families and even their lives," he said."Illegal drug use is not a victimless crime.There is nothing admirable, positive or socially desirable about it."Trump's move is different from the broad order the President previewed over the last few months.On Thursday, the President directed acting Health Secretary Eric Hargan to declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Services Act -- which directs federal agencies to provide more grant money to combat the epidemic -- not a national emergency through the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.The difference between the two orders is money and scope.If Trump had used the Stafford Act, the federal government would have been able to tap into funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund to combat opioids.A senior administration official, however, said the designation was not the right fit because the FEMA money is meant for natural disasters, not health emergencies.Under the Public Health Services Act designation, no additional federal funding will automatically be directed to the crisis, said an official, but federal agencies will be directed to devote more grant money already in their budget to the problem and take "action to overcome bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies in the hiring process," according to a fact sheet on Trump's order.The Trump administration will work with Congress to fund the Public Health Emergency fund and to increase federal funding in year-end budget deals currently being negotiated in Congress.Trump called for creativity in trying to fight the opioid epidemic, even suggesting a "really tough, really big, really great" advertising campaign that would aim to convince people never to do drugs in the first place.That sort of strategy advocates for targeting kids and young adults with anti-drug messaging, evocative of the "Just Say No" ad campaign of the 1980s and early 1990s.The President also personalized his message, telling the audience of Cabinet officials, lawmakers and families affected by the opioid epidemic that his older brother Fred Trump Jr.'s struggle with alcoholism taught him about curbing addiction."I had someone who guided me and he had a very, very tough life because of alcohol," he said, adding that reaching young people and urging them never to start using drugs will make it "really, really easy" to fight the scourge.Administration officials, pressed as to why Trump didn't declare a nation disaster to combat the crisis, pushed back against the idea that Trump's order is less sweeping than what he promised."Under the Stafford Act, as unfortunately we have seen on multiple occasions over the last several months, the Stafford Act is deigned to respond to mostly natural disasters that are (of a) very short time duration and a specific geographic region," one official said, adding that the Trump administration believed the order under the Public Health Services Act is "a better use."Trump's order will last 90 days and, according to another official, can be renewed every 90 days until the President believes it is no longer needed.Since 1999, the number of American overdose deaths involving opioids has quadrupled.From 2000 to 2015, more than 500,000 people died of drug overdoses, and opioids account for the majority of those.Recently released numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that around 64,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2016.Trump, after campaigning for president in part on fighting the scourge of opioid addiction, has long teased sweeping action.The President told reporters in August that he would designate the epidemic a "national emergency" but failed to follow through.The lack of action, treatment advocates said, has deprived the fight against the deadly drugs a designation that would offer states and federal agencies more resources and power.During an impromptu press conference in the White House Rose Garden last week, Trump said that he would officially declare the national emergency when asked why he had not followed through with his initial pledge.And speaking with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he would have a "very big meeting on opioids" on Thursday and will be declaring the opioid epidemic a national emergency "in the very near future."Public health emergency vs. national emergency The primary difference between the two designations is access to funding.The designation Trump will announce Thursday does not allow the federal government to tap into FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and it is an open question whether Congress will offer more money to fund the Public Health Emergency fund, which Congress has not funded in recent years.But multiple Obama administration health officials told CNN that they believe using the Public Health Services Act is the more appropriate avenue.Using FEMA funds to combat the opioid crisis would be "a little bit like asking an engineer to bake a cake," said Rafael Lemaitre, the former communications director for the White House Drug Policy Office under Obama."I do think the public health service act is more appropriate route to take than the Stafford Act designation," he said."I worked at FEMA for two years and dealt with multiple disasters.The Stafford Act is not structured to deal with a long term, complicated public health crisis like the opioid crisis."Lemaitre added that FEMA's fund is "already running on fumes because of the three hurricanes" that hit this year.Tom Coderre, a former senior official under in Obama's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration office at HHS, echoed that sentiment."One of the things that I think is most beneficial part of having a public health emergency is you really can marshal public support and then you can bring all the resources of the federal government to bear on it, bringing people from all of the agencies to combat the issue," he said.Though both Lemaitre and Coderre said this step was important, both argued that it was not a "silver bullet solution to the opioid crisis."That, they said, would be additional funding from Congress."A smarter play here would be for the administration to move beyond this declaration and pass the billions in funding needed to address this crisis.That is how you move the needle on this," Lemaitre said.2016 election Shortly after taking office, Trump convened a White House commission to study the problem and provide recommendations.Earlier this year, despite then-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price saying it wasn't needed, the commission recommended Trump declare a national emergency using either the Public Health Services Act or the Stafford Act."I commend the President on the bold action he is taking today by adopting the first recommendation" the commission made, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, the head of the panel, said Thursday.The businessman-turned-politician made combating the opioid epidemic a top priority during the 2016 campaign.The issue was elevated to such importance that during the closing moments of Trump's 2016 campaign -- when time is at its most precious -- the Republican nominee headlined an opioid roundtable where he met face-to-face with those directly impacted by the issue."I just want to let the people of New Hampshire know that I'm with you 1,000%, you really taught me a lot," he said before promising to help people who "are so seriously addicted."His actions as president, though, have left even members of his own commission with concerns.Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, a member of the President's commission on opioid addiction, told CNN on Wednesday that he worries the President and his administration are using the opioid epidemic for photo ops."We don't want any more photo-ops," the former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island said."I'm just speaking as an advocate, in this fight every single day as someone who is in recovery and someone who is an advocate.We don't want any more visits to rehab centers and photo-ops, saying how courageous we are.Enough already.We want to save lives."
The Republican party is in the midst of a civil war. And Donald Trump is winning.:::::Which is sort of like randomly telling someone who didn't ask how much money you have or how smart you are.Chances are you don't have all that much money and you aren't that smart.(Unrelated: I am very, very, very smart.My mom always tells me that.)Trump's overcompensation is seemingly meant to tamp down chatter that the GOP is in the midst of a war for its soul."Imploding," is how Hillary Clinton described the GOP during an appearance at Yale University Wednesday night.EVERYTHING IS FINE!, Trump is saying.Nothing to see here!That is, of course, not accurate.Already this week we've seen GOP Sens.Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona blast Trump as an irresponsible and dangerous leader.Last week Arizona Sen. John McCain and former President George W. Bush offered critiques of their own of Trumpism -- loosely defined for these purposes as a mix of populism, nationalism and anti-PC talk with a smidge of media scapegoating thrown in.Meanwhile, former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is actively recruiting primary challengers against GOP Senate incumbents up for reelection in 2018 and promising an all-out war on the establishment "More than a year ahead of the 2018 congressional contests, a super PAC aligned with McConnell (R-Ky.) revealed plans to attack Bannon personally as it works to protect GOP incumbents facing uphill primary fights.The effort reflects the growing concern of Republican lawmakers over the rise of anti-establishment forces and comes amid escalating frustration over President Trump's conduct, which has prompted a handful of lawmakers to publicly criticize the president."This is a civil war.The governing wing of the Republican party (smaller government, less regulation and lower taxes but a baseline willingness to compromise) is battling the Trump wing.And, right now, the Trump wing is winning -- bigly.Consider Thursday's vote in the House approving a $4 trillion budget that is estimated to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.They did so because under Trump the focus is now on providing the country with tax cuts which, according to the White House's math, will more than make up for the projected growth in the deficit.That's a stunning sign of just how much Republicans have changed in just the last seven years.Remember that House Republicans steamed to the majority in the 2010 midterms behind the strength of the tea party movement, which was formed with the express purpose of protesting the growth of government -- and deficits -- under President Barack Obama.There was a time not so long ago when lots and lots of Republicans on Capitol Hill were leery of approving disaster relief dollars unless they were offset by spending cuts elsewhere so as not to increase the deficit.That guiding principle has been obliterated by Trump.Then there is the politics, which, at this point, looks like a rout for the Trump forces.Let's start with Flake and Corker.There's no question that their critiques of Trump have driven the conversation in Washington -- and politics more generally.And, maybe, they embolden other Republican elected officials to speak out.But, both of them gave up in the face of the Trump takeover.Flake, in particular, had his hand forced by his outspoken Trump opposition.His poll numbers suggested that winning a primary against a Trump-aligned candidate would have been very difficult, a fact he acknowledged in his retirement speech."It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, and who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican party -- the party that for so long has defined itself by belief in those things," Flake said JUST WATCHED Sen.

Marsha Blackburn is the early favorite for the GOP nod and has been a steady supporter of Trump.Then there's what happened in Alabama's Republican Senate runoff last month.The governing wing of the party (+ Trump) lined up behind appointed Sen. Luther Strange.Bannon and the rest of the Trump coalition (sans Trump) sided with former Alabama state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore.Moore crushed Strange -- riding a message very similar to Trump's in 2016: Political correctness is killing this country, liberals think they know better than you (but they don't) and you can't trust the media.Trump's decision to endorse Strange has complicated the analysis of which side in the GOP civil war really won in Alabama.It shouldn't.Yes, Trump endorsed Strange and even campaigned for him.But, in terms of tone and issues, Moore is a born and bred Trumpite.And, when Strange lost, reports suggested Trump was deeply unhappy that he wasn't on the winning side and angry that McConnell has allegedly led him to believe that the race was closer than it wound up being.JUST WATCHED Anderson Cooper reads Trump's deleted Alabama senate primary tweets Replay More Videos ...

Trump pick for top environmental post once wrote Texas would be 'better off' as an independent republic:::::Story highlights "Although I reverently pledge allegiance to the United States, with regret I hazard the claim that Texas would be better off today as an independent republic free of the yoke of the present federal government," White wrote in 1995.In her essay, White called the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood "not a happy occasion."(CNN) President Donald Trump's nominee to be White House senior adviser for environmental policy wrote an essay in 1995 in which she argued that because of federal overreach, including environmental regulations, Texas would be better off as an independent republic.Kathleen Hartnett White, the nominee to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, authored the essay for a 1995 edition of the now-defunct Texas Republic magazine marking the 150 year anniversary of Texas statehood.In her essay, White called the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood "not a happy occasion."White's past writings on politics and policy, particularly as they relate to the federal government's role in regulating the environment, could be a subject to scrutiny during the Senate confirmation process.If confirmed, White would oversee environmental policy across the government.In her 1995 essay, White singled out "onerous" environmental regulations such as the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act as examples of federal overreach on states' rights.CNN's KFile obtained a full copy of White's essay from Edward H. Sebesta, an expert of the Texas secessionist and neo-Confederate movements who is writing a book on the Texas Secession movement.White was a rancher at the time she authored the essay.Before that, she had served as the director for private lands for the National Cattlemen's Association.White did not respond to a CNN request for comment.The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for White.Spokespeople for the committee's Republican chairman, Wyoming's John Barrasso, and ranking Democrat, Delaware's Tom Carper, did not immediately respond to requests to comment.Read More
Trump campaign analytics company contacted WikiLeaks about Clinton emails:::::(CNN) The head of a data analytics company linked to the Trump campaign contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016 regarding thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails kept on a private server while she was secretary of state, according to four sources familiar with the outreach.Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, sent an email to several people including top Donald Trump donor Rebekah Mercer, relaying that he had emailed Assange seeking access to emails from Clinton's private server to turn them into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, two of the sources said.Cambridge Analytica was hired in the summer of 2016 as part of the Trump campaign's three-pronged data operation, which was led by Brad Parscale and overseen by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.No one from the Trump campaign was copied on the email, the sources said.Nix sent the email in summer 2016, two sources said, but it is not clear whether he sent it before or after Cambridge Analytica was brought onto the campaign.The attempt at collaboration raises fresh questions about the willingness of people associated with the Trump campaign to work with Wikileaks for political gain.The site, which publishes leaked documents, released hacked emails in July from the Democratic National Committee and in October from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.US intelligence has said the Podesta emails were stolen by Russia and handed over to WikiLeaks through an intermediary.News of the email exchange comes amid federal investigations into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.Parscale, the Trump campaign's digital director, was interviewed Tuesday by the House intelligence committee as part of that inquiry.The 33,000 emails deleted from Clinton's private server have never materialized.Nix and Cambridge Analytica, which is backed by Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, did not respond to requests for comment.After the Daily Beast report published, the Trump campaign issued a statement by campaign executive director Michael S. Glassner: "Once President Trump secured the nomination in 2016, one of the most important decisions we made was to partner with the Republican National Committee on data analytics.Leading into the election, the RNC had invested in the most sophisticated data targeting program in modern American in history, which helped secure our victory in the fall.We were proud to have worked with the RNC and its data experts and relied on them as our main source for data analytics.We as a campaign made the choice to rely on the voter data of the Republican National Committee to help elect President Donald J. Trump.Any claims that voter data from any other source played a key role in the victory are false."The statement does not address contacts between Cambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks.In Parscale's congressional interview, he denied there was any Russian collusion with the campaign's digital operations, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Many of the committee's questions for Parscale were about the campaign's work with Cambridge Analytica, the sources said.The committee asked the digital firm for documents earlier this month, and Cambridge Analytica said it was cooperating.Parscale downplayed the campaign's connections to Cambridge Analytica, one of the sources said.He began working for the Trump Organization's digital team in early 2015 before Trump officially announced his plan to run for office.Parscale and employees from his firm, Giles-Parscale, incorporated some staffers from Cambridge Analytica into their data operation.They also worked with teams from data companies that were partnering with the Republican National Committee.In July 2016, Trump called on Russia to find the emails."Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.Let's see if that happens.That'll be next," Trump said in a news conference.News of the outreach comes after an earlier disclosure that a Republican operative, Peter W. Smith, had been on the hunt for Clinton's missing emails during the campaign.Smith spoke to The Wall Street Journal in May , saying he and the colleagues he enlisted found five groups of hackers claiming to have 33,000 deleted emails from the private server Clinton used during her tenure as secretary of state.He said that he determined two of the groups were Russian."We knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government," Smith told the Journal.Smith was found dead of an apparent suicide weeks after the interview.Steve Bannon, Trump's former White House chief strategist, was vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to run the Trump campaign in August 2016, according to The New York Times .The Mercers are investors in Breitbart News, the far-right site where Bannon served as executive chairman before he ran Trump's campaign.Political strategist Roger Stone, Trump's long-time confidant, had boasted during the campaign of knowledge about upcoming Wikileaks publication of damaging documents, at one point telling the Boston Herald Radio that he expected "Julian Assange and the Wikileaks people to drop a payload of new documents on a weekly basis fairly soon.And that of course will answer the question of exactly what was erased on that email server."An attorney for Stone told CNN, "Mr. Stone has complied with the committee's requests.No further statement will be issued."After the hearing, Stone said he answered the committee's questions other than revealing the identity of his intermediary because that person was a journalist and the conversation was off the record."I'm not going to burn somebody I spoke to off the record," Stone said."If he releases me, if he allows me to release it, I would be happy to give it to the committee.I'm actually going to try to do that."Stone has previously denied any contact with Assange and any advanced notice of WikiLeaks release of emails belonging to Podesta.
The conspiracy theorist in chief has the keys to the national archives:::::That's essentially the scenario as President Donald Trump, who built his political career fanning the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama wasn't born in the US and has made sport of creating new ones, took the opportunity to green-light part of a trove of previously classified documents related to the JFK assassination -- while citing national security to keep many of them secret, at least on a temporary basis.Trump has relished releasing the documents, teasing it on Twitter and in comments to reporters, although the opportunity came to him courtesy of a law enacted 25 years ago in 1992, after the release of fellow conspiracy theorist Oliver Stone's movie about the assassination.His surprise decision late Thursday to accede to mysterious government agency requests and keep a few of the documents secret will only add fuel to the fire.Trump even added to Kennedy conspiracy canon when, during the 2016 campaign, he pushed the scurrilous idea that rival Ted Cruz's father had been photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald.There's no evidence to support that report, which came from the Trump-friendly National Enquirer.In case you needed that to be stated.The Kennedy assassination theories are legion -- read about some of them here -- and it is, in many ways, the greatest conspiracy theory in US history that Oswald had help.Every responsible examination has come to the conclusion he did not.The release of documents isn't expected to shatter those conclusions.Nor is it likely to convince Americans.A Gallup survey in 2013 found that 61% didn't think Oswald acted alone.If the many reviews and millions of pages of already public documents haven't put the conspiracy theories to rest, neither will this.It's not clear what Trump's thoughts are on the Kennedy assassination.It bears mentioning that Trump has started, pushed and profited from a number of non-Kennedy conspiracy theories during his career.Here are some of those, just as a refresher and without re-litigating any of them, in no particular order: 1.Barack Obama was not born in the US Trump was, in many ways, Birther No.1.Long after it was shown Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump wouldn't admit that was true.He finally did, but turned the spectacle of his comeuppance, in September 2016 , into a marketing event for his new hotel and a jibe at Hillary Clinton.None of the other theories Trump has fanned have ended with anything close to this type of finality.But it bears mentioning that if conspiracy theories were to judged on their efficiency, this is Trump's piece de resistance.Back in September of 2015 , 20% of Americans doubted Obama was born in the US, 29% of Americans (and 43% of Republicans) thought he was a Muslim.JUST WATCHED Trump finally ends birther lie Replay More Videos ...

National Park Service Denies Permit for Huge Naked Woman Statue on National Mall:::::A permit to bring a 45-foot statue of a naked woman to Washington D.C. was denied by the National Park Service.Statue of 45-Foot Woman gets denied permit to stand on National Mall A group that wanted to bring a 45-foot statue of a naked woman to the National Mall was denied a permit because it would detract from historic monuments and could damage the turf, National Park Service (NPS) officials said."The proposed nearly 48-foot height of the statue introduces a visual element that would diminish the propertys significant historic features by altering the setting and historic character of the National Mall landscape," NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said in an email.Organizers of Catharsis on the Mall wanted the R-Evolution statue to stand near the Washington Monument, facing the White House, for 91 days between November and March.The permit was denied Wednesday, Litterst said.Catharsis organizers claimed in a statement that NPS issued them a permit and then revoked it.NPS did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether that claim was accurate.Catharsis spokeswoman Natalie White accused NPS of denying the permit to silence women."They don't want us to take action, they don't want us to say enough is enough, they don't want this symbol to remind women to stand up to the injustice this administration has forced upon them," she said in a statement.The park service also denied a permit for a memorial temple to stand on the National Mall for 119 days, Litterst said.The statue and temple "would likely cause significant damage to and require replacement of the underlying turf and soil," Litterst said.Homemade Bomb Found After High School Threat Investigators have discovered a homemade bomb at the home of one of the two Georgia teens suspected in threats against a Woodstock high school.The Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday morning that as part of their investigation into threats directed against Etowah High School, they had discovered a homemade incendiary device at one of two 17-year-old suspects arrested in the case.(Published Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017) Catharsis on the Mall was granted a permit for an event Nov. 10-12 and will be allowed to assemble 30 other temporary structures, Litterst said.The arts festival was granted permission to light a fire on the Mall, Litterst said.This year will be the third year Catharsis on the Mall holds the ceremonial burning, Litterst said.A crowdfunding campaign was launched in October to bring the statue, and reached 73 percent of its $90,000 goal before NPS announced the permit was denied.The R-Evolution statute is intended to represent women free from domestic violence, artist and creator Marco Cochrane said.

Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.
US Now Moving Toward Armed Drones, Lethal Force in Niger: Officials:::::In Washington, there is a search for answers about the ambush in Niger that killed four U.S. Service members.(Published Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017) The Trump administration is paving the way for lethal strikes against terrorists in Niger as the U.S. military pushes forward with a plan to arm the Reaper drones that fly over that country, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News.France has already decided to arm its drones in the region, U.S. documents show, and the move to arm U.S. Reapers has been under consideration for some time long before this month's ambush of a Green Beret unit that resulted in the deaths of four American soldiers.But that incident, details of which are still coming to light, is fueling an urgency within the Trump administration to take more aggressive steps against the terrorist groups that are operating in North and West Africa, according to intelligence and military officials.In the wake of the attack, the U.S. has been pressing the government of Niger to allow armed drones at the U.S. bases in that country, three U.S. officials said.Beset by poverty, weak governance and insurgent movements, the African region that includes Niger and neighboring Mali is considered by U.S. officials to be a fertile recruiting ground for Al Qaeda and ISIS.U.S. officials believe the militants who ambushed the Green Berets belong to a group that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.President Obama declined to allow armed drones to fly over the region, but the military has been pressing for some time to reverse that decision, officials said.Kelly 'Stunned' by Rep.'s Criticism of Trump's Call to Widow
Police Probe Alleged Lynching Threat Against Congresswoman:::::A Facebook post suggesting a Florida congresswoman be lynched following her public feud with President Donald Trump over his phone call to a Gold Star family has prompted the FBI to contact authorities in Chicagos northern suburbs.Patrick Fazio reports.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2017) A Facebook post suggesting a Florida congresswoman be lynched following her public feud with President Donald Trump over his phone call to a Gold Star family has prompted the FBI to contact authorities in Chicagos northern suburbs.Special Agent Garrett Croon told NBC 5 Tuesday the bureau was familiar with the post about Rep. Frederica Wilson and the agency was talking with Des Plaines police."We are aware of a social media posting generated in Des Plaines, IL and are in contact with local authorities, Croon said in an email.Screenshots of the Facebook post which appears to have been deleted along with the users account are being shared on social media, and some have claimed its creator is a former police officer.Croon said he did not know if the alleged author was a police officer.Des Plaines police did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.Chicago police referred questions to Capitol Police, citing a department policy to not comment on threats or security measures for public officials.Capitol Police said they do not comment on "ongoing investigations."The alleged post, which NBC 5 has not verified the authenticity of, contains an image of a glum-looking Wilson in one of her flamboyant signature cowboy hats.Need ten good men to help carry out a lynching, it reads.Must have own horse and saddle.Rope will be provided.The Chicago Tribune reports that 54-year-old Des Plaines resident Tom Keevers says he is receiving death threats after an "anonymous 'meme-maker'" twisted his words in a Facebook post.Calls to a phone number listed under Keevers' name were not immediately returned.The paper reports Keevers floundered through an interview in which he says he didnt write the post, could not remember threatening to lynch the congresswoman and that it was possible someone used his words to make a meme."Dont people get in arguments on Facebook all the time?"the Tribune reports Keevers as saying, before he doubled down on his initial defense: "I did not use those words."The post comes after a public tumult between Wilson and Trump surrounding the congresswomans claim the president botched a condolence call to the pregnant widow of a Green Beret killed in Niger earlier this month along with three of his comrades.Wilson said Trump told the slain soldier's widow her husband knew what he signed up for."Wilson accused Trump of being insensitive.The pregnant widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, Myeshia Johnson, said Monday the phone call she received from Trump before meeting her husbands body at Dover Air Force Base made her more upset as the president struggled to remember her spouses name, NBC News reported.She said thats when Trump told her that her husband "knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways," "I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!"Trump tweeted in response.Calls and emails to Wilsons office were not responded to but a statement on her website stands by her assertion that Trump fumbled the phone call."Despite President Trump's suggestion that I have recanted my statement or misstated what he said, I stand firmly by my original account of his conversation with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson," the statement reads in part."Moreover, this account has been confirmed by family members who also witnessed Mr. Trump's incredible lack of compassion and sensitivity."Meanwhile, in Des Plaines, authorities continue to investigate the alleged Facebook threat."People threaten Donald Trump all the time and nothing happens," Keevers told the Tribune."I dont think a lot about what I write on Facebook."Threatening a member of Congress, which is a federal crime, can carry a prison sentence of up to five years.Keevers was honored by the FBI in 2003 for helping apprehend a bank-robbery suspect, the Tribune reported at the time.
Nurx, the 'Uber of Birth Control,' Aims to Help Women in the Nation's Contraceptive Deserts:::::Students at the University of California, Davis, can now purchase $30 Plan B emergency contraceptives, pregnancy tests, condoms and other personal care products from a vending machine.The idea came from UC Davis senior Parteek Singh, after a friend was unable to buy emergency contraceptives in time.(Published Friday, April 28, 2017) Often referred to as the "Uber of birth control," Nurx ships birth control directly to a woman's doorstep, bypassing the traditional visit to a clinic or physician typically necessary for getting or renewing a prescription.Available in 15 states plus Washington D.C., the app may simply be an extra modern-day convenience for some women, NBC News reported.But for others, it's the difference between having access to birth control and not.According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, nearly 20 million women in America live in so-called "contraceptive deserts": counties where the number of public clinics is not enough to meet the needs of the county's population.The group estimates that more than 19.7 million females ages 13 to 44 lack reasonable access to public clinics that provide birth control, defined as at least one clinic or provider for every 1,000 women.President Trump Declares Opioid Epidemic a Public Health Emergency

Gold Star Father of Soldier Killed in Afghanistan Receives $25K Check Months After Trump Promise:::::Chris Baldridge, left, and his late son, Army Sgt.Dillon Baldridge, right, are pictured in this undated photo.Dillion Baldridge was killed in Afghanistan on June 10, 2017.The grieving father of a 22-year-old soldier killed in Afghanistan said he received a $25,000 check from President Donald Trump Monday, months after the commander in chief offered to send him the money during a condolence call, WRAL.com reported.The check is dated Oct. 18, the same day The Washington Post reported Trump had not yet fulfilled his promise to the Gold Star father.It came with a letter that said, "I am glad my legal counsel has been able to finally approve this contribution to you."Army Sgt.Dillon Baldridge, of Zebulon, North Carolina, and two other soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan soldier on June 10 in the Achin district of Nangarhar province.In an interview with the Post published last week, Chris Baldridge said he received a call from Trump a few weeks after Dillon was killed to talk about the loss of his son.Baldridge said when he expressed frustration with the military's survivor benefit program, Trump offered to give him a personal check for $25,000.Gold Star Widow Recounts Trump Call President Donald Trump is contradicting a war widow's account of the controversial condolence call she received from the president following her husband's death.Speaking on "Good Morning America," Myeisha Johnson said she heard President Trump stumbling, trying to remember her husband's name as the call began."That's what hurt me the most.Because if my husband is out here fighting for our country and risked his life for our country - why can't you remember his name?"Johnson said.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2017) Asked about the Post's report on Oct. 18, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters told NBC News "the check has been sent.""Its disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the President, and using it to advance the medias biased agenda," Walters said.The White House blamed the delay on an "approval process" that involves "multiple agencies anytime the President interacts with the public, especially when transmitting personal funds."It added that Trump "followed up several times to ensure that the check was being sent."Kelly 'Stunned' by Rep.'s Criticism of Trump's Call to Widow White House chief of staff John Kelly said Thursday he was "stunned" and "broken hearted" by a Florida congresswoman woman's criticism of President Donald Trump's phone call to one of the families of Americans killed in Niger nearly two weeks ago.(Published Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017) Dillon's stepmother Jessie Baldridge told Zebulon's WTVD the family plans to launch a foundation in his name to ensure his legacy of service lives on.Their first event will be a fundraiser to help a local preschool in town."Dillon would be proud of this," Jessie Baldridge said."I mean who can say they started their foundation from a loan from the president of the United States?"The controversy surrounding the $25,000 check came to light after Trump boasted two days earlier in a Rose Garden press conference that he reaches out personally to all families of the fallen, and wrongly asserted that past presidents had not.Calling every family member isn't a presidential tradition.Trump's recent predecessors have reached out to Gold Star families through letters, private meetings and invitations, as well as calls.For Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who saw far more war dead on their watch, individual phone calls would have been a time-consuming task.Still, Trump suggested he did more to honor the families than his predecessors."I think I've called every family of someone who's died," Trump said, then adding, "virtually everybody."He said it's his practice both to make phone calls and send letters.Trump Denies He Disrespected Fallen Soldier President Trump is denying a Florida Congresswoman's account of his phone call to the wife of a U.S. soldier recently killed in Niger.Rep. Frederica Wilson says she was with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, and listened on a car speaker phone as the president spoke with her.Wilson claims Trump told the widow that her husband "must've known what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway."(Published Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017) The Associated Press reached out to the families of all 43 people who have died in military service since Trump became president and made contact with about half the families.Of those who would address the question, relatives of nine said they had heard from Trump by phone or mail.Relatives of nine others said they haven't.Some of those who received calls were comforted, while others came away more upset.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen to Appear Before House Intel Panel on Tuesday:::::The Wall Street Journal reports Special Counsel Robert Mueller has put together a grand jury to look into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign.(Published Friday, Aug. 4, 2017) President Donald Trump's personal lawyer is scheduled to speak Tuesday with investigators for the House probe into Russia's involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, NBC News reported.Sources familiar with the House Intelligence Committee's probe say Michael Cohen will talk with them in private.The sources requested anonymity to discuss private workings of the House probe.A source with first-hand knowledge told NBC News that Cohen will also appear before to Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday.Cohen is a former executive with the Trump Organization.He was in talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, but ended those negotiations as Trump's White House bid grew stronger.It was later revealed that Cohen had written an email to Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, seeking help in getting the Moscow tower built.But Peskov said he never responded to the email.President Trump Declares Opioid Epidemic a Public Health Emergency
House narrowly passes budget with opposition from some blue state Republicans:::::House Republicans narrowly approved the Senate-passed budget resolution Thursday, clearing a procedural hurdle and allowing the House of Representatives to take up a tax overhaul.Interested in Taxes?Add Taxes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Taxes news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The bill passed 216212, with all Democrats and some Republicans opposing the measure.Speaker Paul Ryan cast a rare vote in favor of the measure, highlighting the significance of the vote.The president applauded the House for "fulfilling its obligation to the American people" in passing the budget and said he looks forward to "further cooperation with Congress," according to a statement from the White House."This resolution sets the stage for Congress to put America first by providing economic relief for the American people in the form of tax cuts and tax reform," the statement read.A group of New York and New Jersey Republicans opposed the bill out of concerns about possible changes to state and local tax deductions in the GOP tax plan to be formally proposed down the line.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi bashed the bill as a "massive con."Republicans are carrying out a massive con on the American people with their #GOPBudget & #BillionairesFirst tax plan.Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) October 26, 2017 While the nonbinding $4 trillion budget plan would add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, all but the most strident deficit hawks voted for the measure, abandoning GOP orthodoxy for their once-in-a-generation effort to rewrite the tax code using reconciliation, which allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate, in lieu of the usual 60-vote threshold, for passage.President Donald Trump has made that argument, pitching the possibility of a tax overhaul to members this week as he rallied support for the budget resolution.He said, Tom, just hold your nose, close your eyes and vote yes, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said of Trumps message in a phone call last Sunday.I think thats how a lot of guys are approaching it.After their failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act this year, political considerations also trumped longstanding policy concerns for some members of the party.There wasnt a win in health care, and the base is frustrated, Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who voted against the measure, told ABC News.If there isnt some sort of win, I think there will be repercussions in 2018.Republicans will release the details of their tax plan next week, and hope to send the measure to the Senate by Thanksgiving.GOP tax writers still have a number of issues to resolve before releasing the proposal, including any changes to the state and local tax deductions, and potential changes to 401 (k) plans, despite President Trump's pledge not to touch retirement savings accounts.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., declined to weigh in on the debate between Trump and GOP tax writers, who argue that changes to retirement savings accounts are needed to help pay for the proposed tax cuts."I agree with comprehensive tax reform and giving the committee the latitude they need," Ryan told reporters Thursday.
Trump declares opioid crisis a national public health emergency:::::President Donald Trump officially declared the opioid epidemic a "national public health emergency" in an announcement at the White House Thursday.Interested in Opioid Epidemic?Add Opioid Epidemic as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Opioid Epidemic news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The move diverges from previous promises -- even as recently as Wednesday night -- to declare the epidemic a "national emergency.""Effective today my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law," the president said Thursday."And why I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis."The president shared a personal story of his experience with addiction, through his brother Fred, who struggled with alcohol."I learned myself, I had a brother Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best personality, much better than mine, but he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol.And he would tell me, 'Don't drink.Don't drink,'" he said."And to this day, I've never had a drink.And I have no longing for it.I have no interest in it."He continued: "But it really helped me.I had somebody that guided me.And he had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol, believe me, very, very tough life.He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through.But I learned because of Fred, I learned."Two senior administration officials confirmed to ABC News that the president will direct acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan to announce a nationwide public health emergency and also direct agency heads of other departments and agencies to exercise emergency authorities to minimize deaths and damage caused by the opioid crisis.USA Today first reported the details."A nationwide public health emergency will really reorient all of the federal government and executive branch's resources towards focusing on providing relief for this urgent need," an official said.The Public Health Emergency Fund at HHS currently stands at $57,000, according to an agency spokesperson, and officials said the president's declaration won't yet include a request for Congress to replenish the fund.Shawn Thew/Getty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, questioned the value of President Trump's opioid declaration today, calling on the White House to push for more funding to combat the epidemic."What I would say to the president on that is, "Show me the money,'" Pelosi said."What is the point?""We all agree that this a place we have to go.I had the speaker write me a letter that we would continue to have the funding in the appropriations bill.But the president's statement are words without the money, and so we'd like to see [that]," she added.The president had said as early as August he would be declaring a "national emergency," which many interpreted as his commitment to authorize a presidential emergency under the Stafford Act or the National Emergencies Act.The opioid crisis is an emergency, and Im saying officially right now: It is an emergency.It's a national emergency, Trump said at the time.Were going to draw it up and were going to make it a national emergency.It is a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had.The president teased the announcement on Wednesday, telling reporters an emergency declaration gives us the power to do things that you cant do right now, but offered no additional details.In an interview Wednesday night with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network, the president again alluded to the announcement he planned to make."There are a lot of good people that are seeing what's going on and I think we'll be successful in that next week I'm declaring an emergency -- a national emergency -- on drugs," Trump told Dobbs."The opioid [crisis] is a tremendous emergency."However, experts have told ABC News that declaring it an official national emergency, as Trump long touted he would eventually do, might have been a mistake.Experts described the difference between the two potential declaration options before the president in interviews earlier this week.The Stafford Act would have opened up federal resources such as FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund -- usually employed for natural disasters such as hurricanes Maria and Harvey.This gives federal agencies the authority to cut red tape hindering recovery missions.Requests for funding from the Disaster Relief Fund come from a governor who claims the circumstances has overwhelmed his or her state's resources.The president instead will ask the acting secretary of Health and Human Services to declare a public health emergency, which allows the agency to waive restrictions and deploy medical personnel to rural areas where medical options are limited.The declaration follows a bombshell report from The Washington Post and CBS News "60 Minutes" implicating multiple members of Congress in the passage of a bill that significantly weakened the Drug Enforcement Agencys enforcement capabilities in the opioid crisis in favor of lobbying by pharmaceutical companies.Following the report, Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., withdrew his name from consideration to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy.The number of prescription opioids legally sold nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2010, despite no change in the amount of pain that Americans reported, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Today, drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States -- the majority of those lethal episodes involve an opioid."Every person who buys illicit drugs in America should know they are risking their future, their families, and even their lives," Trump said."And every American should know that if they purchase illegal drugs, they are helping to finance some of the most violent, cruel, and ruthless organizations anywhere in the world."The president made the crisis a primary talking point during his campaign for the White House and in March signed an executive order launching a commission led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie to explore ways to curb opioid abuse and overdoses.My statement on @POTUS Donald J. Trumps Action on the opioid crisis: pic.twitter.com/nmNHGCIwIR Governor Christie (@GovChristie) October 26, 2017 On the campaign trail, he would often speak about the opioid crisis in states like New Hampshire and Ohio, but would often cite drugs pouring from across the U.S.-Mexico border as a primary driver of the problem.He reiterated that specific concern with Dobbs on Wednesday and cited his planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as a deterrent."What's going on there [with] the drugs pouring into the country," Trump said."I'll tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need the wall.Part of the reason we need the wall is for drugs."ABC News' Jeffrey Cook and Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.
Confusion abounds as Obamacare open enrollment period approaches:::::In just a matter of days, on Nov. 1, millions of people will enroll in Obamacares marketplace for health insurance, but after months of back-and-forth over the law, consumers are still confused about when, where, how -- and if -- they can get coverage.Interested in Health Care Reform?Add Health Care Reform as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Health Care Reform news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest While most of the country gets health coverage through their employer or through government programs, over 10 million people need to purchase plans through the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, law that Republicans have vowed to repeal.Joe Raedle/Getty Images FILE But the Trump administrations moves to shorten the length of this years open enrollment, cut advertising dollars and slash funding for programs that assist in enrollment have health care advocates concerned that far fewer people will sign up for health insurance this year.With the government's scaled-back operations, health care advocacy groups have stepped in to help inform people of their options.The confusion has been running the gamut running from do I need to have insurance?to is the ACA gone?said Jim Willshier, Director of Policy at the Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers.With Open Enrollment days away, so-called navigator programs like the ones run by Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers, are focusing on grassroots efforts to inform and educate the public.But that task was made more challenging by recent budget cuts.The Trump administration cut $116 million in funds for advertising, outreach and navigator programs.Drew Angerer/Getty Images Willshier said thirty-five percent of his organization's budget was cut from 2016 to 2017.An enrollment period that's been cut in half to 45 days has only added to the pressures.In some states, the enrollment period has been extended, but in most places, navigator programs will have to do more with less money and less time.Were just trying to make ourselves as available as possible, were going to be working on weekends, and were trying to get the word, said Leslie Bachurski, Director of Consumer Navigation at Consumer Health Coalition, which serves 42 counties in Pennsylvania.A recent Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that only one-fifth of the population is aware that the recent debates theyve seen playing out in the headlines about the Obamacare marketplaces only effect people who buy health insurance on their own.Its likely the result of a whole year of debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act, where theyre hearing about it nightly on the evening news and not remembering what the punch line is, said Karen Pollitz, a Senior Fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Health insurance was always complicated, it was never intuitive to people.And on top of that you have people saying Obamacare is dead.To fill the advertising void, even some private companies are doing outreach of their own.Oscar Health, a new health insurance company started by Jared Kushners younger brother Joshua, rolled out an advertising campaign for the open enrollment period.The company put up ads in places ranging from Grand Central Station in New York to Nashville.The company is also providing educational tools for consumers."Because health care is so confusing, and there's a lot of industry terminology, we've invested a lot in educational content to help people understand their plan and what options are available," said Sara Rowghani, the Senior Vice President of Marketing at Oscar.Three former Obama administration officials -- former Medicare and Medicaid administrator Andy Slavitt, Josh Peck, and Lori Lodes -- joined together to create Get America Covered, a group that's working on advertising and outreach efforts."What we are doing is making sure that people get that basic information because people are really confused," said Lodes."The good thing is what counters the misinformation and confusion are the basic facts."
Martha Raddatz reflects on her upcoming miniseries about 'Black Sunday:' 'It's different than anything Ive ever done':::::At a time when service, sacrifice and Gold Star families are at the forefront of the nations dialogue, ABC News Martha Raddatz reflected on her most important project on the Powerhouse Politics podcast.Its different than anything Ive ever done.Its really the most important project Ive ever been on, Raddatz told ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl and Political Director Rick Klein Wednesday about her mini-series based on best seller "The Long Road Home: A Story of War and Family" The two-part series premiere, airing Nov. 7 on the National Geographic Channel, chronicles the events of April 4, 2004, when a platoon was ambushed in Sadr City, Baghdad, in an attack that came to be known as Black Sunday.Sergeant Eric Bourquin, whose platoon was ambushed, recalled being under the impression that they were on a "peacekeeping mission."I was a very young man and we were just doing a patrol out there, Sgt.Bourquin, who was 23 years-old during the ambush, told ABC News Powerhouse Politics, adding, on the way back things changed dramatically for us.A total of eight soldiers lost their lives on "Black Sunday," a battle during one of the deadliest periods of the Iraq War.Actor and producer Jon Beavers who plays Sgt.Bourquin, thinks the new series will affect the conversation.It touches on the different humans, the different individuals that pay the cost of war, I think we as a country maybe need an update on what is the cost of war and who pays it, Beavers, also known for his roles in NCIS (2003) and Gotham (2014) said.Despite the raw emotions portrayed on-camera, Raddatz said the last night of shooting was the most emotional night on set, as the mother of a soldier who was lost on Black Sunday, walked the set replicating the scene where her son died, alongside Raddatz and the actor playing her son.The actor had his arm around her, I had my arm around her, holding hands, walking down that set, and I said Do you want to come off, do you want to take a break?Raddatz recalled of the walk, adding, She said no, no, no ...I want to see what he experienced, I want to be where he was ... she looked up into the sky of the set and said this is the last thing he saw.But she said I think he was so brave.Following the series finale, the National Geographic Channel will air a documentary produced by ABC News with Iraq war veterans.
Russia sanctions still not implemented, despite White House promises:::::Close to a month after the due date, the Trump administration has still not implemented the Russia sanctions that Congress passed nearly unanimously and Trump signed begrudgingly in August.Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The law, which also targets Iran and North Korea, called on the Trump administration to identify which Russian intelligence and defense officials would be targeted before Oct. 1.Despite the delay, the White House said today it will implement the penalties."The Trump administration remains committed to holding Russia accountable -- and has on a variety of fronts," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement, citing in particular a "strongly worded statement" by U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley."Treasury updated sanctions last month.The State Department's portion is undergoing an interagency review and will be announced soon.I'd refer you to the State Department for additional information," Sanders added.That update from the Treasury Department was a formal first step to give the proper agencies the authority to designate individuals.But the agencies have yet to use that authority.Since then, the State and Treasury Departments have been working on identifying the Russian individuals and entities to list under the new sanctions.In particular, the two agencies are still working together to develop guidance for partner countries and private companies to help them avoid violating the new sanctions, State Department officials told ABC News.That's what's holding up implementation of sanctions, they say."We are being very careful to develop a guidance that companies need because there are business entities that need guidance," Secretary of State Tillerson said on CNN Oct. 15, adding, "We have every intention of implementing Congress's intent."The former CEO of Exxon is keenly aware of the necessity of such guidance.In July, Exxon was slapped with fines by the Treasury Department for violating other Russia sanctions, while he was CEO.The delays have engendered lots of questions and anger from members of Congress.Sens.John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ben Cardin, D-Md.-- top Republican and Democratic senators on foreign policy -- called out the administration in a letter earlier this month, demanding answers for the delay.Theyve had plenty of time to get their act together, they wrote Oct. 11.The House Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee issued their own scathing letter to Trump Wednesday night, calling the delay "baffling and unacceptable" and saying it "deepens concerns over your campaign's and Administration's ties to Russia.""If the executive branch ignores its responsibility to keep our country safe, we as lawmakers in a coequal branch of government are obligated to take action," the group, led by the committee's ranking member Rep. Eliot Engel, D-NY, warned.Sanction guidance doesn't normally take this long to develop, either.The Iran portion of the law, which has an Oct. 31 date for implementation, is ready to take effect, a U.S. official told ABC News.ABC News' Ben Siegel contributed to this report.
Trump slams Democrats as 'disgrace' for helping to fund dossier:::::President Donald Trump lashed out at Democrats on Wednesday after a lawyers for Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee acknowledged helping fund the infamous dossier of alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest I think it's a disgrace, Trump said.It's a very sad commentary on politics in this country.On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that Marc E. Elias, a lawyer who represented both the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained the Washington-based investigative firm Fusion GPS to conduct research.In a letter obtained by ABC News addressed to an attorney for Fusion GPS, Matthew Gehringer, general counsel for Perkins Coie, detailed his firms arrangement with Fusion GPS.To assist in its representation of the DNC and Hillary for America, Perkins Coie engaged Fusion GPS in April of 2016, to perform a variety of research services during the 2016 election cycle, Gehringer wrote.By its terms, the engagement concluded prior to the November 2016 Presidential election.A full copy of the letter can be read below.In August, ABC News reported that Fusion GPS was paid during the heated Republican primaries by a still unknown Republican and then later worked for Democrats, all of whom wanted to dig up dirt on Trump and plant negative news stories, according to political operatives.The 35-page dossier, prepared by a former British spy and Moscow station chief named Christopher Steele, alleges the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, and includes uncorroborated, salacious allegations about Trump himself, which he has repeatedly denied.Its all fake news, Trump said.Its phony stuff.It didnt happen.Between June 2015 to December 2016, the Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million in legal fees, according to campaign finance records examined by the Washington Post.And since since November 2015, the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in legal and compliance consulting.It is not possible to know how much of those funds were passed on to Fusion GPS.As Trump fumed, Democrats defended the campaign and the committee.Former Clinton campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon said the Democrats did nothing wrong.I think it's important to remember that opposition research happens all the time in the campaign, Fallon said on CNN.Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said the content of the document is more important than the circumstances behind its creation.Its important to know who paid for it, Swalwell told ABC News.But it is also important to know if whats in the dossier is true.The DNC, meanwhile, distanced itself from the reported revelation, saying its new leaders were not involved in the decision to retain the investigative firm.Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization.But lets be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaigns ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened, said DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa.The identity of the initial Republican funder of the dossier, however, remains a mystery.Republican House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes approved a subpoena earlier this month that would force the bank handling finances for Fusion GPS to open up its books, which could force the identity of that initial client into public view.In response to questions today from ABCs Cecilia Vega, President Trump hinted that the identity might not remain a mystery for much longer.I think I would have, if I were to guess, I have one name in mind, Trump said.It will probably be revealed.
ANALYSIS: Republicans' public condemnation of Trump has echoes of the past:::::The president came to power by accident, a populist, out of the mainstream of the party that nominated him, and believed by many to be a racist.His name was Andrew Johnson and he escaped removal from office by impeachment by one vote in the Republican senate.In looking for an historical parallel to the statements this week of prominent Republican senators about the president of their partythe example of Andrew Johnson is the closest I can come.Sure, there have been lots of senators who have opposed their partys presidents think Ted Kennedy running against Jimmy Carter in 1980.But to have this kind of denunciation of a presidents character by high-ranking members of his own party is virtually unprecedented.Andrew Johnson, of course, came to power after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.He had been a Democrat but an ardent Union man who refused to secede from the Senate with his home state of Tennessee.When Lincoln sought a second term his re-election was far from certain and he needed the support of Union Democrats so he chose Johnson as his running mate.The new vice president disgraced himself at the inauguration by showing up drunk (his defenders insisted that he was ailing) and he was dismissed by the powers in Washington as an irrelevancy.But just weeks after he assumed his position as the number two in government, he ascended to number one.At first the Radical Republicans in Congress thought they could work with him because of his populist positions and his disdain for secession.They had been ready to take on Lincoln for what they saw as his temporizing on Reconstruction.But those Republicans soon found that Johnson was even less willing to impose any punishment on the southern defectors than Lincoln had been.The president opposed his party on measure after measure but the Republicans had enough votes to defy Johnson and pass the all-important 14th and 15th amendmentsextending the protections of the federal government to the states and granting African American men the right to vote.Finally, Johnsons persistence in opposing the Republican majority paved the way to impeachment proceedings.After the House voted to impeach and the trial in the Senate began, the assumption was that the president would soon be looking for work.There were more than enough Republicans to constitute a two/thirds vote for conviction.But it didnt happen.Every one of those Republicans had his own political reasons for wanting Johnson, whom they universally despised, either to stay or go.(The highly influential daughter of the presiding Chief Justice Salmon Chase was said to oppose Johnsons ouster because his wife was a nonentity and with her in the White House Kate Chase Sprague could rule the Washington social scene.)I cannot agree to destroy the harmonious working of the Constitution, argued Iowa Senator James Grimes, for the sake of getting rid of an Unacceptable President.That was perhaps the least self-interested reason for voting to keep Johnson in office, if true, but others in the Senate also had cause to stop short of the drastic step of removing a the constitutionally chosen chief executive.So Johnson served out his term and returned to Tennessee where five years later he was re-elected to the Senate and briefly took his seat among the men who had voted to throw him out of office.He died a few months later but died having defeated his enemies.The speeches of Republicans opposing this president passionately and persuasively mark a meaningful milestone in the U.S. Senate.But it would be a leap to assume that anything will come of it.
Republican tax plan could affect 401(k)s, despite Trump assurances:::::Republican tax writers on Capitol Hill are still considering changes to 401(k) retirement savings programs, downplaying President Donald Trump's repeated pledges not to touch retirement accounts popular with middle-class Americans in the GOP tax overhaul.Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest At a breakfast with reporters this morning, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said tweaks to the current system are possible in the tax plan, which Republicans are expected to release on as early as Nov. 1.We want more Americans to save more.We want them to save earlier in their lives, Brady said, adding that congressional Republicans are exploring a number of ideas and share the same goal as Trump.We are continuing discussions with the president, all focused on saving more and saving sooner, he said.Kevin Lamarque/Reuters On Monday, Trump tweeted, There will be NO change to your 401 (k), amid reports that Republicans writing the sweeping tax bill are considering reduced contribution limits for 401(k)s. There will be NO change to your 401(k).This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017 He reaffirmed his position Wednesday, telling reporters that leaving the retirement savings plans intact is very important.I didnt want that to go too far.Thats why I ended it very quickly, he said of the 401(k) discussions.Brady declined to comment on Trump's response to his comments, other than to point out that Trump called him "fantastic."The emerging conflict between the White House and congressional Republicans over retirement savings highlights the challenges Republicans will face when they release their full proposal to overhaul the U.S. tax system.Republicans are already steeling themselves for lobbying from interest groups opposed to changing existing tax law, and some are concerned that additional criticisms from the president could complicate their effort."I dont think the president knows exactly what were contemplating and how that would enhance savings in our country," Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., another member of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters."I think when he said more changes he probably meant that he didnt want Americans to be worse off from any changes."Rep. Dave Schweikert, R-Ariz., another member of the panel, said the ongoing discussions about changes to retirement plans are more complicated than Trump suggested."The president said something on this, but there's three- to four-dozen moving parts that are in this conversation," he said, inviting the White House to contribute to the policy debate.A move to lower contribution caps to the plans, which are not taxed until money is withdrawn from them, could force more Americans to contribute to their retirement by putting money into plans that are taxed immediately.The policy change would help pay for some of the tax cuts in the Republican plan -- which is crucial to moving the bill through Congress.The House will vote Thursday on a budget resolution setting the parameters for the tax bill and clearing a procedural hurdle that will allow them to take up the legislation and pass it with a simple majority in the Senate.Despite ongoing disagreements within the party over changes to state and local tax deductions, Republicans hope to pass the bill through the House by Thanksgiving and get it to Trumps desk by the end of the year.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017 Ward, who also has the backing of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, is viewed as unelectable by many in the Republican establishment who are keenly aware that Arizona is key to keeping their 52-to-48 majority in the Senate alive.Responding to the news, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC established by supporters of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released a statement bashing Ward.The one political upshot of Sen. Flakes decision today is that Steve Bannons hand-picked candidate, conspiracy-theorist Kelli Ward, will not be the Republican nominee for this Senate seat in 2018," according to the statement.Al Drago/The New York Times/Redux, FILE It was also less than two weeks ago when McConnell himself emphasized that the GOPs nomination of electable candidates is essential to maintaining its majority.My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority.And the way you do that is not complicated, McConnell said in the Rose Garden standing beside President Trump, You have to nominate people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home.The Flake announcement also sets off a fresh round of speculation on other potential Republican contenders for the seat.Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, who worked on Trumps presidential campaign, Rep. Martha McSally, Rep. David Schweikert and Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham are among the names mentioned as candidates with a broader appeal than Ward.Ward also garnered criticism when she said that Arizonas senior senator John McCain should step down from his seat as soon as possible after news that he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.Christopher Brown/Polaris via Newscom, FILE McCain, who was first elected to the Senate in 1986, has said he will remain in the Senate as long as he is healthy and able.But if McCain, 81, is unable to serve out the rest of his term through 2022, it would throw yet another wrench into Arizonas already complicated political climate.Democrats have been eyeing Arizona as a prime pickup opportunity in 2018, a state that Trump won by less than 4 points in 2016, and the fact that the race is now an open seat, elevates the need to win there.Sinemas entry into the race boosted national Democrats hopes of turning the seat blue, with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) quickly endorsing her after she announced her run last month.The DSCC also looked to capitalize on the Flake news Tuesday."Senator Flakes retirement is another example of the divisiveness roiling Republican primaries, DSCC spokesman David Bergstein wrote in a statement.These dynamics will continue to hinder Republican efforts in Arizona and whatever candidate succeeds in claiming their nomination will fall short of Kyrsten Sinema and her proven record of results for Arizona's working families."But despite the optimism, Democrats face an undoubtedly tough road to win in a state that has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1988, then-incumbent Sen. Dennis DeConcini.
Biden: 'I've decided Im not going to decide not to run' in 2020:::::Former Vice President Joe Biden isn't ruling out running for president in 2020.Interested in Joe Biden?Add Joe Biden as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Joe Biden news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "I havent decided to run," he said in an interview with Vanity Fair, "but Ive decided Im not going to decide not to run.Well see what happens."Biden previously ran unsuccessfully in 1988 and 2008, and was actively considering a 2016 run but decided against it after his son Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.In the interview with Vanity Fair, which was timed to be released with his new book "Promise Me, Dad," Biden said when Beau got sick there was "no question" in his mind that he was going to run in 2016."I had planned on running, and I wasnt running against Hillary or Bernie or anybody else.Honest to God, I thought that I was the best suited for the moment to be president," Biden said.As for the actual 2016 candidates, Hillary Clinton has already repeatedly ruled out another presidential run and President Donald Trump has already established a re-election team.Biden, who campaigned for Clinton in 2015 and gave speeches including scathing rebukes of Trump, did not mince words when talking about him now, calling Trump "self-referential and uninformed," and Biden portrayed Trump as a threat to the country's principles."This sounds corny, Biden said in the Vanity Fair interview, "but everything the founders did was to erect institutions that made it more difficult to abuse power.Thats why they have three different branches of government.And what really worries me about this administration is the frontal attack on those institutions that, if they were lost, makes the abuse of power so much more available."
Senate Republicans confident Flake, Corker retirement announcements won't jeopardize GOP agenda:::::While their colleagues Jeff Flake and Bob Corker both excoriated President Donald Trump while announcing they would not seek re-election, many Senate Republicans have said they are confident that the two Trump critics decisions would not hurt the GOP's agenda.Interested in Republican Party?Add Republican Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Republican Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Both Flake, R-Ariz., and Corker, R-Tenn., have expressed concerns about the general direction of the GOPs top legislative priority, tax reform, but have also indicated they would not vote against bills just to spite Trump.J. Scott Applewhite/AP Some people think that we carry out our personal feelings on policy but that's just not what most of us, anyway, do, Corker said Tuesday.Ive got a job as a senator to do the best that I can.Flake said Wednesday that hed worked with Trump on judicial nominees and hopes to work with him on tax policy and on addressing the legal status of the children of undocumented immigrants in the United States.Those sorts of statements leave many of Corker and Flakes colleagues confident that their retirement announcements dont instantly put tax reform, or any other bills, in jeopardy.I think they will work with the president where they can in spite of the concerns about the way he handles himself, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said.But their openness to the tax reform bill, which is still the subject of negotiations in both the House and Senate, doesnt mean they have put rubber stamps on that or any other piece of legislation, either.Flake told ABC News Wednesday that he understands some growth-triggering tax cuts might lead to short-term deficits, but that he is concerned about the long-term impacts.I am extremely concerned about our debt and our deficit and so were going to have to look at the package and see what it does, he said.Corker has been more categorical than Flake, saying earlier this month that he would vote against a tax bill unless it reduces deficits.Corker and Flakes announcements certainly dont make the math for Senate Republicans any easier: They can only afford to lose two of their 52 members and still pass tax reform, given its consideration under a lowered, 51-vote threshold and Vice President Mike Pences power as a tiebreaking vote.Three Senate Republicans have already demonstrated their willingness to vote against a major presidential priority.Sens.Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona tanked the Senates so-called skinny health care repeal and are far from sure yes votes on tax reform.Plus, besides tax reform, most other big bills will be considered under a 60-vote threshold, meaning that Republicans will have to get at least a few centrist Democrats on board.But Senate Republicans appear convinced that their two outspoken colleagues will vote no differently now than they would have before announcing their retirements.I dont expect any difference in the pre-announcement Flake from the post-announcement Flake, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

Trump declares opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history Video:::::Transcript for Trump declares opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history Meantime, president trump declaring war on the nation's open yoid crisis today, and offering a very personal story.But the president was careful with his words, calling it a, quote, public health emergency, and why the words he chose could determine how much money the government will spend to fight this.ABC's senior white house correspondent Cecilia Vega tonight.Reporter: With the stroke of a pen today, president trump declared the opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history.I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis.Reporter: The declaration means -- patients in rural areas can reach doctors and obtain prescriptions to treat addiction by phone or internet.Unemployed workers who lost their jobs because of addiction will receive job training and assistance.And it lifts bureaucratic red tape, allowing more funding for treatment centers in all 50 states.But the president stopped short of declaring a sweeping national emergency, something he has repeatedly promised.It's a national emergency.We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money.Reporter: Today, he said something slightly different, calling it a public health emergency.That means his action does not include emergency federal money to address the crisis that kills nearly 100 people a day.For more than a year, ABC news followed families battling the effects of addiction.In New Hampshire, David sat down with Rory Smith, who found his son, Aaron, in their basement, overdosed.He was gray.I yelled for the phone, to call 911, and I proceeded to give him mouth to mouth.He was not breathing, and I couldn't feel a heartbeat.Can you tell me what that's like?It's probably the worst thing I've ever had to do in my life, was giving him mouth to mouth.I just -- I said, is this how it's all going to end?Right here, in my basement?Reporter: That time, they were able to revive Aaron, but after another overdose, he died.At his funeral, Kerry Norton, a nurse and advocate who tried to help Aaron, made this promise to his grieving father.I'm so sorry.I will fight for him.I promise you.Reporter: Late today, Kerry told us, the problem in new Hampshire has only gotten worse.People desperate for treatment, often having to wait weeks.Now, from president trump, a familiar call to action targeting young people with a just say no style ad campaign.If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it's really, really easy not to take them.Reporter: The president said his own wakeup call came from his older brother, Fred.Great guy, best looking guy, best personality, much better than mine, but he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, "Don't drink.""Don't drink."He would say it over and over and over again.And to this day, I've never had a drink.And Cecilia Vega joining us from the white house.And Cecilia, it was deeply person, the president's story, but the white house is still facing tough questions tonight about whether the president's action today is an adequate response for a crisis of this magnitude.Reporter: David, this comes at a time when the health secretary here was fired for questions over his use of private jets.The drug czar recently resigned no replacement has been named.And tonight, Democrats are sounding the alarm about funding.Nancy Pelosi today said, show me the money.But David, as you know, the president, right there in that story, called this a winnable war.And of course, you checked back in with those families and we'll continue to do so on this crisis.Cecilia, thank you.We turn next here tonight to This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
President Trump declares opioid crisis a 'public health emergency' Video:::::Transcript for President Trump declares opioid crisis a 'public health emergency' President trump.Making it official there signing his name to an official order declaring the Oprah you would crisis to be a national public health emergency.The president joined there by families of people who have lost family members to the drug crisis.He has spoke of this as a national shame and a human tragedy.Invoking his brother Fred trump.Who died prematurely because of complications from alcoholism.He connected the OP oil crisis up to his favorite themes of immigration in the border saying that he will raise this issue.With China and next week on his Asian trip.And also saying that this is part and parcel of his effort to tighten the borders here at home he talked about new regulations.And he talked also about the need to help people who are hooked.And the need to help prevent people from getting hooked joining us to make sense of all of this are several ABC news contributors among them ABC's Mary Alice park she works for the politically unit.Also on the phone is doctor Jan asked in the chief medical correspondent.Mary Alice first to you this has been something that president trump has been talking about on the campaign trail for quite some time hasn't it.Absolutely you know I Charles a lot can change house while and I was struck out a fact that this issue came up.Every single place we went from Boston to Seattle next specially in rural parts of the country West Virginia.Rural remote.New Hampshire it's part of the reason you saw so many governors there in the room with the president this is an issue that came up.Nonstop.On the campaign trail and I think you saw the president really.Took to heart was incredibly.And pathetic but in that speech you said talking about his own Stanley and made a point of making sure that people understand how serious it was taken grades stand.I've witnessed for a moment Mary announcement I want to go to ABC's senior White House correspondent Cecilia Vega who joins us by telephone Cecilia he declare this to BN national.Public health emergency.What does that mean.Well that you know there's a little bit of controversy over this perhaps not surprising David the president had for months.They saying that he would declare this as national health emergency.And and it fact that it.Partly what his own commission on hope to its recommended that he's fallen short of going to.All the way bear out but but his commission also gave him the option of declaring that the public health emergency took.A big picture what did god will just talk about a couple of fake to freeze up some of the bureaucracy in terms of grant money to.The clinics and things like that it helps overcome.A number of bureaucratic delays and things like hiring specialists to treat addiction.Out are in very specific ways this is going to duke expand access to treatment for patients in and rural areas for example these patients will be allowed kept.Used to telemedicine the Internet in the fall to reach a doctor to help them with prescriptions for addiction.But what it doesn't deal with it doesn't increase funding.The White House eater telling us that they hope congress.Pick that up down the road it it you know in in the big picture it's unclear.Really elected will do on the ground what it will actually tree achieved on the experts many of them say that this is largely symbolic but nonetheless this is being widely applauded as a big move.Albeit symbolic by the White House because it creek that sense of urgency for a problem that you and I both know we've covered this issue is very much a national crisis we're talking about a 140.Two deaths a day this country an open letter to blame for that.As the president said there are more deaths from OP lords in this country than from.Motor vehicles and gun violence combined.And yet as you point out there's some question here about the commitment of money the public health emergency fund I read.Now stands at 57000.Dollars the current budget for the Health and Human Services Department would cut funding.To that department so there's some question here isn't there about the commitment of money.It's exactly those pointing deed and not just that lets not forget that there is no drug czar in his administration right now there is no director of the health and human services.Department not and and as you were saying a this comes.As this administration has pushed for unprecedented.Cuts.And federal aid to states for Medicaid programs and Medicaid has.Has proven to be what are the most effective tools in combating opium addiction.Those are the big questions that are out there right now but I do I do have to go back to what we have you heard universally.From doctors and from addiction specialist who say.If it is unclear how much people actually do in terms of can have in terms of tangible effects but really.Even if this is symbolic.People are very in this industry and and in this community very very happy to beat.Did this priority is patient.OP ladies and and the crisis in this country as as a top priority from Washington right now.ABC's Cecilia Vega thank you so much for joining us you gotta get under world news and we look forward to your report tonight.Let's move along now to doctor Jan Ashton who is joining us by telephone she's ABC's senior.Met our stories chief.Medical correspondent hi John.I gave it so it what is your sense of what's needed here.Well you know let me take you behind the scenes could I want to pick up on a couple of points that it's Jillian made about.You know what's going on on the federal level and what's going on in the trenches to its eco.I want to share it with our viewers that our listeners you know I'm a practicing physician I mean a private practice and every year.And three health care provider with a prescription pads that has.I DEA number and a controlled dangerous substance to coach CBS late and number has to be new dilute the latent in the court yet it's paid for that.But in many cases behalf do you I'd hate some new CME's continuing medical education and answer some questions that better.I just completed my literally yesterday up from my violations annual which is due to the end of this month.And I had to answer.Question about well you Lloyd than we have to register in the eight security.As a physician who describe who had prescribed.Class of medication.And it tell you how pervasive this approach in this attack it is.This is absolutely.Affecting change at the health care provider prescribe or level.Which I think is a good thing because let's face a lot of health care.Professional to prescribe these medications aren't doing it because they want someone to become an addict.They're doing it because.Twenty years ago in medical school or thirty years ago in medical school that was the only class of pain medication.That those providers knew about so we education.Needs to occur at pharmaceutical development I was happy here the president mention that.That apps.We need to occur but I also want to address something that often and at a forgotten voice in this.In this debate in this crisis which is the millions and millions of Americans who live and suffer from chronic pain.And they are so you're all.That there will be an over compensation of backlash.You know to an over extreme that will affect them getting some kind of pain relief whether it is from the proper use a populated.You know in some cases or with other things I think that is a very real here and we need to remember in the medical profession action.That that goal is treating pain pickle if not to withhold.Pain relief.From a patient but I will tell you as.Crap and I got a pharmacology award at my graduating medical school classic Columbia.We need a much.Better class of medications that will be like her pain it has never been and I deal and now of course being you know that not only is that not right Yelp of pain.In many cases but it does lead to addiction and dat so I was very very happy even at this with the formality Dijjer this.Coming from the top down as well as the bottom up.As you point out there that some of the new regulations.He propose there are.Making some supplies of pills seven day only supplies that really tricky.For somebody being prescribed pain medication we also talked about taking particular at least one specific drugs.Off the market.Is this something that he's gonna get much push back from the pharmaceutical industry or from the drug stores.Current I don't think from the drug stores I think that armistice or thirty weigh on work with this because.They've already been incredibly helpful with trying to limit.The amount of these medications that dedication can go home with an itch and I want to tell you that as for perform surgery as someone who had surgery at the patients.Often times.You know this isn't real problem patient having surgery are given 455060.Perreault.You know in the short term post operative period we have better medications to treat back katic pain then OP Lloyd so I think that the removal of fat now off the market.You know which only be used at a hospital setting what it is safe and effective and appropriate.You know outpatient setting I agree with that at as a as a medical professional and I think.That we definitely need better option for patients who were dealing with acute or chronic pain DO POA are not the answer.Thanks so much Jan let's bring in Geneva sans she works with the justice team.Geneva you have been neck covering some of the frontlines of the open your prices with Pierre Thomas.Tell us about the night when stories you did last summer.That's very epidemic it's something that reaches all corners of the United States across the nation so we partnered with time.And our ABC affiliates to attract and quantify that scope of the crisis that was heading.Across the United States and one thing only found is that it's really hard to track in real time.That data.Overdose deaths of overdoses.State health departments and hospital association and bring and that information in all different kinds of Lee is.And that's one thing that health experts say could really make a difference is real time data tracking.And so we looked at across the US and like the first lady of the same.The thing that really stood out even more than shocking numbers in their numbers are incredibly high.Was the individual stories that we found during that week this summer.Their legs.Woman and her young.Early twining is she had just gotten out of rehab in Kentucky her family thought she was on generate track.And she stayed over at a friend's house ended up in the hospital.Her mother got a phone call saying you need to get here immediately.But it was too late she had died of an overdose of the heroin overdose.And her family spoke out that leak Tass and others.To.Science prevent the next case from happening.There is little girl in New Hampshire really young girl was clutching the photo of her father that had also died about her an overdose.She was left without a father.And in Miami at ten year old boy accidentally came in contact with heroin and it's those stories that really touching.As you say the First Lady said this could happen to any of us she said no state has been spared no demographic.Untouched by this.Mary Alice parks going back to you briefly here.I wonder this is something that is near and dear to the hearts of trump voters and there's a sense out there.That in places where there's been middle class or working class that's been left behind factory closures jobs shipped overseas.That people have in some of these communities turn to drugs and often with tragic result.It was really amazing how the president was able in one speech in a way to I don't think we've seen.Can do before talk about such a wide range of solutions.From international commerce to very.Intimate conversations that people can have with there friends and family.I really encouraging community leaders to step up to the plate here and you said it maybe some of the hardest hit areas a rural parts of the country.He was really imploring people to take a personal.A personal stake in this as well to sent to find a way to reach out to those that are hurting the most even if they're not.Medical professionals themselves I think is part of the reasons to go back to politics for a Sackett.Part of the reason he sought Democrats in that room too you know Joseph Manchin from West Virginia was sitting right there.There are Democrats I was following on Twitter who were applauding the president for this move so I think that but he he will continue to get high praise.The president also worked in there his talk of a border wall with Mexico.And Geneva I know that you spent time in Arizona near the Mexico border.And to what extent is that connected here to this overall problem.Still in Arizona that's where a lot of the traffickers.Bring their drugs and through Mexico.Lot of it's coming up through Mexico and DA tells us that Arizona Elway and then Carrey in the column mine for the rest of the country they see.Thousands of pounds of heroin coming through.Doses of fat not and then.In the upcoming lands there overdoses in the northeast in California.When we rarely went on one raid at that we found pounds of black tar heroin inside someone's home.And that alone it is that few handfuls that it was pounds could've provided thousands of individual doses worth millions of dollars on the street.All right.President trump says today that we can be the generation that ends hope BO it eviction we will see he has certainly put this on the radar screen.And his administration.Will be judged on the basis of this major piece domestic policy.That he pushed forward today.I'm David Wright with the ABC digital team you can.Continue to follow the story on world news and on Nightline and of course on the new ABC news' ethics for Jordan's.This transcript has been automatically

Trump expresses optimism on tax reform Video:::::Transcript for Trump expresses optimism on tax reform To the white house now where president trump is pushing hard for tax cuts ahead of today's crucial vote in the house.In an interview he struck an optimistic note.I think the house is looking re really good.Passing this bill along rapidly.That will happen hopefully today and did want to make a couple of calls.I said, fella, please, no changes, just pass it along.Let's bring in Cecilia Vega and, Cecilia, the president optimistic but we're already seeing a tug-of-war over 401(k)s. Reporter: Yeah, George, but so have sources I've spoken to are not as optimistic as the president on this one.The president said definitively there will be no changes to your 401(k) But the top Republican on capitol hill, the person writing this tax reform plan says, no, actually there could be some changes under consideration, some sharp limits to what employees can contribute to their retirements.Here at the white house yesterday president trump seemed to muddy the waters yet again and said actually 401(k)s could be used as a negotiating tool as Republicans are debating and trying to figure out how to pay for his tax reform plan.The big deal right now, George, president trump needs Republicans in order to pass this but he's already alienated and frustrated some of his allies on his continual mixed messages on this one.Everyone wants tax cuts.Always differences in how to pay for it, as you said.Meantime, the president could make a major announcement previewing for some time an emergency on the opioid crisis but there's some nuance there.Reporter: Yeah, this is something he campaigned on.He first promised to declare a national emergency on this months ago.Sources here at the white house tell us that today the president will deliver what's being billed as a pretty big address on this topic.But he's not expected to declare the more sweeping national health emergency.He's going to call this a public health emergency.His own opioid commission had declared -- had recommended that he use the bigger phrase on this one.Nonetheless, though, George, experts are applauding it as something much needed.Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in this country and a majority of that relates to opioids.No question it's a national crisis.Now to those highly anticipated documents about This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Trump responds amidst searing attacks from 2 Republican senators Video:::::Transcript for Trump responds amidst searing attacks from 2 Republican senators And we begin with president trump, tonight responding, after coming under attack from two senators in his own party.The president was asked if he accepts any blame of the civility oshgs lack thereof in politics right now.And the president tweeting about a stand og vags he received from Republican senators as proof they are not fractured.Here's ABC's senior white house correspondent Cecilia Vega, leading us off.Reporter: At the white house today, with his character under fire from fellow Republicans, president trump brushed aside questions about whether it's time for him to be more civil.Well, I think the press makes me more uncivil than I am.People don't understand.I went to an ivy league college, I was a nice student, I did very well, I'm a very intelligence person.Reporter: It comes in the wake of blistering attack from two prominent Republican senators who are not running for election.Tennessee's Bob corker accuses president trump of debasing the country.And Arizona's Jeff flake delivered this scathing rebuke on the senate floor.Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused as telling it like it is.Reporter: Do you agree with that, do you bear any responsibility for that?Well, I think it's sad, but I think to a large extent in all due respect, I think the media causes a lot of it, but politics is a rough business, there's no question about it.Reporter: The president's message, everything is just fine.His party loves him.His proof?The standing ovation he received from Republican senators on capitol hill.He's now tweeted about it three times.With corker and flake out, are there any other Republicans you want to see out of the senate?Not at all.Reporter: Everybody is where they should be?We have a very good relationship.Honestly, the Republicans are very, very well united.Reporter: Now, he especially needs them to be united on tax reform.But his mentioned messages on how to pay for those tax cuts frustrate even his own allies.The president has said definitively, there will be no changes to your 401(k), but today, the top Republican writing the tax plan said actually there could be changes, including limits on how much people can contribute to that retirement fund.When asked about that, the president said this.401(k)s to me are very important and they're important because that's one of the great benefits to the middle class.Reporter: But then, just seconds later, a muddied message.Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating, but trust me.So, let's get to Cecilia Vega live from the white house.And Cecilia, the president also spoke today about that ambush that killed four American special ops soldiers in Niger, saying for the first time that he did not specifically authorize the mission himself.Up asked the president about his phone call with the widow of one of those soldiers, sergeant la David Johnson.That widow saying the president didn't seem to know her husband's name.Here's how he answered it.I respect her.I respect her family.I certainly respect la David.He who, by the way, I called la David right from the beginning, just so you understand.They put a chart in front, la David, says la David Johnson.So, I -- right from the beginning, there's no hesitation.One of the great memories of all time.There was no hesitation.Great memories, talking about the chart in front of him.The president seeming to question the widow's account.Reporter: He is, and sergeant Johnson's wife said the phone call made her cry even more.He is continuing to refute her account of the story.Today he said, quote, all of these calls are about warmth and nobody has more respect for the families than he did.David?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Trump talks to reporters before trip to Texas Video:::::Transcript for Trump talks to reporters before trip to Texas Your watching footage from just moments ago president trump there at the White House speaking to reporters on his way out of Washington ten.I'm Mary Alice park stretching ABC news president trump is leaving Washington to go to Texas to get an update on.Hurricane Harvey relief and also to do some fundraising and talked to members of the Republican National Committee.Down in Texas he was answer questions on a wide range of issues talking about ongoing fights against ices in Africa again defending an arguing.About that condolence call with them but widow of the fallen soldier again.Arguing that he was respectful during that phone call and kind that he did mention when David Johnson's name from the start.That obviously the big bulk of the conversation at the top dealt with politics.In the Republican Party I'm joined and I calling Johnny were hold it here in Washington also who works with me.In the politically unit at John it was struck by the fact that he said.That ad that that the GOP has great unity.In the party he said they were not as much a mess as the Democrats this coming just the day after obviously to top Republican senators.Speaking out against the president's.Integrity and character.What do you think it's he seemed just.In denial.Well you know I am sure you there's player Republicans publicly held at if you talk to them that might dispute the president the Kabul a bit but.I was struck by the fact that the president acknowledged that he still needs these two senators who still leads Jeff flake hastily Bob Corker to pass things like.Tax reform like yeah immigration like Health Care Reform.And it seems that he is a president that you know it's as he was willing to put aside sort them or personal nature.Of late and corporate attacks because if you listen to corker speech and if you listen to.You know corporate being interviewed on the help partner persists today they have some very personal words for the president.And this seems like a president who realizes how much is riding on his legislative agenda like tax reform he knows that the Republican Party needs something to Ron on.In 28 team and so you know I thought it was interesting that he was willing to put aside the fact that.Jeff lake's speech and bop or resorts yesterday more avert personal.Attack on the president and what they view.That's.His brand of politics and out out of lockstep with their view of conservatism so I think it's the president that realizes how important it's going to be to pass things like tax reform and other legislation.And right I think you raise a really interesting point.Giant that's that Bob neither Bob Parker nor Jeff likely talked about policy in their remarks they didn't disagreed with the president's.Make America green agenda mean we know that Bob corporate had some issues with.Some tax reform proposal as he's a fiscal conservative that wants to make sure that.Tax reform does not add federal deficit but these are two Republicans who are very conservative when it comes to policy and have by and large voted.With the president you're right instead that their speeches yesterday at her interviews yesterday really.Were abouts the integrity of this president his character.Do you think that he will be in the president's from will be able just to dismiss that continued to dismiss Saturdays those personal questions going to go away.Right I think you know it.That's are discussing you know over the past couple days it is very rare to see these types of tax I think that the president.You know he responded to play country where this morning pointing out his is low poll numbers again he talked about flakes poll numbers again there.Think that you know I think this is a president that I like he said whenever he views.You know some something that's set about and that's false he's going to counter punch.I think when it comes to.Realizing.The fact that his legislative agenda is not going.To get past unless he has the support of up the entire Republican caucus.I think you will sort of see him sort of shrug this off and you saw you did see some Republican senators come out yesterday like senator Kenney from Louisiana today.You know there worsened standing ovation there wasn't lot for the president in that room and sure there is in the Republican caucus but.You know you still are going to have these what's is the Republican Party I don't think they're going to go away.That really view that this presents brand of politics as out of step with what the Republican Party with conservatism so I think.You know the presence not gonna laugh Twitter I don't think any time soon but you know I think we'll continue to sort of see him downplay it and in the coming months.Ray your a he app silly tried to downplay talk about just politics and Jeff flakes poll numbers.I guess the little bit of a chicken or egg question it was deathly poll numbers serve starting to shrink because of his.I sort of in battle relationship but this president sometimes speaking out but often still voting with him.I mean we've seen it Steve ban and that sort of dark clock how that is constantly hanging over.Sort of more establishment Republicans and president trumps relationship.C Bannon has threats into primary every single sitting Republican senator with the exception.Of Ted Cruz.And Mitch McConnell over the weekend said that that more anti establishment elements of the party has.A history of nominating folks that just cannot win in the general election.It redeeming I didn't really even deposit a year Johnnie do you think that that Arizona has the chance of going blue.Although Democrats have a very high profile repute there and and reps senators Christensen about.Who represented district it's just outside of Phoenix includes parts of Tempe so.You know the Democrats believe.And this was always going to be one of their prime pickup opportunities that the state that Hillary Clinton.Only lost by a by about 3.5 points and that in the 26 election.It's a state that's going to be key.If Democrats have any any hopes.Up taking back the senate and money team but.You bring up a really good point ST ban in there and it's hard to find.Better evidence sort of the B discord and deep divisions.In the Republican Party than what Steve Bannon.Is attempting to do it needs 201818.Returns.Like he said saying he's going to trying and and primary every single Republican incumbent.You know it remains BC how successful he'll be in that effort he claimed victory and an Alabama and now it's sort of claiming victory for these.Retirements from corker and flake so you know when it comes airs on its there's also a candidate there Kelly wart that Steve Bannon has gone and campaigned for so.I think it remains to seen exactly how this'll play partners on I think there's a lot of time for other.Republicans in the race but you know what you said.You know there's there's.It's it's hard to see a more stark example of the divisions but with Stevens.A party.I think our cut cap and folders is with us now their from the White House.Hi Catherine.Hi Marianne Smith so I want to ask you just about.The mood at the White House the day after such a landmark day in Washington two top Republican senators.Really rebuking the president and his character we were Diana talking about how personal.Some of those conversations were yesterday on Capitol Hill what is the mood like.There at the White House.I mean just saw president for about fifteen minutes or so we came over here and talk to reporters about just not among other topics you know he views this.I'm as a victory in his eyes along with the speed ban inside of this and but you know he pushed all this criticism from corker inflate you know of course none of the members again.I'm he's on over there he always comes up.Behind there to talk to us when.He's in a Gooden added I'm so today you know the president inside the White House really viewing this as a victory for them but what.His staff at others in the White House is there any acknowledgment of some of the substance.Of the critique from those two senators conversations about.Being untruthful about playing loose with the truth about reckless attacks me think about the power of some of those words that Bob Parker and Jeff flake used.In their anxiety or any.Retrospect action is taking place there or or or not at all.You know as a good question because I see I feel like in any other administration there would be.Just not but Mary Alice really mean you saw.Sarah senator as I'm from the White House podium the other day say.You know I think this this was a good thing when our Cecilia Vega asked in the Serra scanners if the president was.Contributing to to this divisive rhetoric in American politics.And she brushed that off so internally and Mary Alice I can belittle that there's.Too much conversation about that you know you have these two senators on the hill who Wear crucial votes but in terms of the president in the White House they just don't particularly see now why they don't seat.The president has divining.America as dividing politics like these like these two senators say now of course the president will fight back as you guys are talking about earlier and her Johnny I'm saying you know somebody.Hits in hill he'll hit back he just ten that a second ago on.On the South Lawn so he clearly.Some little offended by the rhetoric from what you think that he is done anything wrong or contributed.Comes to this you know tune it to this dismissive.I'm conversation.Happen happening on Capitol Hill you know his his White House and and he is well site that he of their yesterday talk about.On the budget to talk about his tax plan and a show of unity.So the move over here in terms of those two senators.It's it's pretty striking how there's not too much conversation about the president's actions possibly contributing.That's moderate it was very interesting listening to the president.Dismiss the idea of instability and on the press he said that the press portrays him in Iran lightened he's actually.More visible person that he gets credit for.Catherine I really appreciate you always bring your inside take it there from the White House and studied her over the all your Smart analysis.You're watching ABC news and rewrite for the morning a political know it.Every some morning you can sign up to get that and bring you we'll bring you all but live

Trump administration moves forward on Russia sanctions following four-week delay:::::The Trump administration broke its silence on new Russia sanctions Thursday, sending to Capitol Hill a list of Russian entities that it will sanction individuals for doing business with, following a four-week delay that infuriated senior members of Congress.Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The State Department's delivery -- a list and technical guidance regarding the sanctions obtained by ABC News -- is meant to comply with legislation President Donald Trump signed in August to impose new sanctions against Russia's defense and intelligence sectors.The sanctions have not yet been implemented.After Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signed off on the guidance Thursday morning, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Bob Corker at 2:30 p.m. to relay it to him.The State Department then informed other senior members of Congress, before it releases that guidance publicly some time shortly, according to spokesperson Heather Nauert, who said it is also informing private industry and allied countries.The guidance provided today by the State Department is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation, Corker said in a statement.Congress will expect thorough and timely consultation until full implementation is complete.Sens.John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ben Cardin, D-Md.-- top Republican and Democratic senators on foreign policy who called out the administration for the delays in a letter earlier this month welcomed the move as step in the right direction toward holding Russia accountable for its attack on our election.But they warned they would continue to monitor the administration to ensure the administration is following both the letter and the spirit of the law.Mark Wilson/Getty Images The list, obtained by ABC News, includes 39 entities ranging from aircraft and helicopter manufacturers to engineering firms, a shipyard to Russias spy services, the FSB and the SVR.As Corker noted, publishing this list does not mean these sanctions have been fully implemented.This portion of the law required the administration to issue guidance on who these Russian defense and intelligence entities are by Oct. 1 - a deadline they blew past - and then start sanctioning individuals and businesses that were engaged in significant transactions with them starting on Jan. 29, 2018.There is no asset freeze for or blocking of the members on the list, according to State Department guidance obtained by ABC News.Instead, the sanctions are for any individuals or entities that do business with them.The list is being made public so far in advance to give American businesses and allied countries enough time to make sure they are not be in violation by implementation day.In addition, the Trump administration's guidance has concluded that the definition of a significant transaction will be decided on a case-by-case basis looking at its impact on U.S. national security and Russias intelligence and defense agencies giving them and companies wiggle room to argue a deal is not significant.That gave McCain and Cardin pause, with the two remarking that it "allows for notable discretion" and vowing to "closely examine how the administration decides to define" the term.The State Department defended itself from Republican and Democratic critics, over the missed deadline, with Nauert saying the delay was because, Its complex, complicated, and industry needs to know what will happen if they engage in certain activities We were given about two months to pull it together, which is a relatively short period of time.Tillerson was hands-on in the process, she added, but not specifically in pulling names of individuals and entities.ABC News' Mariam Khan contributed to this report.
Infighting plagues Senate Judiciary Committee's Russia investigation:::::The Senate Judiciary Committee has hit something of a partisan stalemate in its investigation of Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election, a potentially ominous portent for how the probes outcome might be viewed.The breakdown has clearly been coming for weeks as negotiations between staff to the chairman and ranking member broke down over concerns that the probe was focusing too much on areas each side deemed to be too partisan.They can go ahead and do whatever it is they want to do, declared a clearly frustrated California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panels top Democrat.We have decided that each side is going to take a course.... Our focus is obstruction of justice and whether there was cooperation/collusion between the Trump administration and Russia, she added.Feinstein has grown more frustrated in recent weeks with what she has called the slow pace of committee action as it relates, for instance, to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, someone the panel has threatened to subpoena for weeks.Im not sure what it is.Sen. Grassley and I have gotten along, but their staff seems to want to take this into a different venue and thats Hillary Clinton, and its [former Attorney General] Loretta Lynch.We think its collusion and obstruction of justice, Feinstein said.Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, brushed off suggestions that his committees investigation had totally ruptured along partisan lines.Im doing what I do, Grassley said, adding in reference to Feinstein, She wants to do what she wants to do.And were doing a lot of things together.The chairman noted that he wants to probe more deeply into a controversial, 7-year-old Obama-era agreement that led to Russia owning a 20 percent stake in the U.S.s uranium supply through a Canadian mining firm called Uranium One, which had U.S. holdings.Then-Secretary Hillary Clintons State Department approved the sale, with explosive allegations swirling around whether or not the Clinton Foundation profited tangentially from the deal.The Clintons have denied any wrongdoing.That involves an area that she may not want to go into, Grassley said.Indeed, when asked about the so-called Uranium One deal today, Feinstein said she had only read a couple of articles on it and was not prepared to discuss the topic.Grassleys investigative staff recently made public 13 letters the chairman sent, without sign-off from Feinstein, to a wide range of individuals highlighting some of the majority's priorities as it seeks its own path forward.The letters, sweeping in scope, requested information as well as private interviews with committee investigators.The committee is investigating improper political influence or bias in Justice Department (DOJ) or FBI activities during either the previous or the current administration [and] the removal of James Comey from his position as director of the FBI, one letter, sent to the current General Counsel at DOJ, as well as an Obama Justice Department official, reads, adding that the panel also wants the DOJs and FBIs activities related to Hillary Clinton, the DOJs and FBIs activities related to Donald J. Trump and his associates, and the DOJs and FBIs activities related to Russian interference in the 2016 election.The chairman is seeking testimony from a former top member of special counsel Bob Muellers investigative team as well.Peter Strzok, one of the FBI's top investigators, tapped by Mueller to help lead the probe of Russian meddling in last year's presidential election, stepped away from his post in mid-August for reasons that have not been made public.On Comeys firing, GOP investigators are focused on Lynch, as well as the law professor to whom Comey gave his contemporaneous memos detailing concerns he had following alleged interactions with President Donald Trump.Comey circumvented Lynch in his investigation of Clintons use of private email, and that circumvention figured in the case Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made for firing Comey.One senior committee Democratic member told ABC News, Thats just an excuse for Grassley to ask a bunch of questions about Hillarys emails.Thats all it is.Both Grassley and Feinstein said there would be times when they would work together.Both, for instance, must approve any subpoenas.One area where both sides might cooperate is on questions surrounding the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting between Russian officials and top Trump campaign officials, including Donald Trump, Jr., who was hoping for dirt on Clinton, his campaign rival.Grassley investigators sent letters to every known participant in the meeting, including the Russians.Staff are free to sit in on any interviews, the senators said.But already there is some confusion over whether or not the majority is still investigating possible collusion between Trump officials and Russian President Vladimir Putins government.When asked if the majority was still investigating collusion, Grassley muddied the waters, first saying yes, but then adding, based on the proposition that now what were doing on the Uranium One makes it very bipartisan.I am disappointed, Feinstein told reporters.I hope that, as some time goes by, well be able to work things out.Meanwhile, the separate Russia investigation being conducted by the Senate Intelligence Committee is still operating on a bipartisan basis with few signs of infighting.Feinstein, a member of that panel as well, chalked that up to the probe being conducted almost entirely by staff, so its totally different.Meanwhile, the traditionally bipartisan House Intelligence Committee has been plagued by infighting over its Russia investigation.Republicans maintain they have found no evidence of collusion after dozens of interviews and charge Democrats with leading a fishing expedition against Trump that could continue into the midterm elections.Democrats have accused the majority of rushing to wrap up the investigation prematurely and scheduling interviews before the committee has received relevant records from the relevant agencies, entities and individuals.Earlier this week, Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who had previously stepped back from leading the Russia investigation after ethics complaints accusing him of disclosing classified information, announced a new investigation of the Russian uranium deal, blindsiding Democrats as they were interviewing Trump lawyer Michael Cohen in the committees secure meeting room.The rift has some members concerned that the committees Republicans and Democrats will release separate reports with their own findings and conclusions about Russian efforts to influence the election.ABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.
Youth crime disclosure rules wholly inappropriate, say MPs:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Rules on disclosing crimes committed in childhood in England and Wales should be "radically revised", say MPs.The Commons Justice Committee said the system was "wholly inappropriate", denied children a "second chance" and may breach human rights laws.People do not have to disclose "spent" past convictions and cautions after a period of time but sometimes employers can ask that they are disclosed.The government has listed 942 crimes that are not exempt from disclosure.The coalition government brought in changes in 2013 that allowed old convictions to be "filtered out" of record checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) after 11 years for adults and five-and-a-half years for young offenders.Sexting In the case of cautions, they are "filtered" after six years for adults, or two for those under 18 at the time.But there are 942 offences which cannot be filtered, ranging from sexual and violent crimes to offences such as failing to display a certificate of registration in a residential care home.The justice committee's report said that that system operated "in a mechanical fashion, with no right of appeal against disclosure decisions".It pointed to offences such as "sexting".While under recent changes sexting does not appear on a DBS certificate - unless it is at the discretion of police - others who committed an offence before new guidance came in were left in an "unresolved" position, the committee said.Image copyright Getty Images The committee said: "We do not think that the difficult problem of sexual offending by children is assisted by giving them a record of a non-filterable sexual offence."We note the inconsistency between the current police response to 'sexting' by children, designed to prevent them from entering the criminal justice system, and the previous policy of taking formal action."While we commend this change in policing approach, we are concerned about the implications for children whose "sexting" offences pre-date the policy change, acquiring non-filterable criminal records as a result."It suggests the current system may "fall short" of the UK's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.It is illegal to possess, take or distribute sexual images of someone who is under 18, including of yourself - figures released in July showed thousands of children had been investigated by police for sexting in the last three years in England and Wales.The committee recommends: That a rule which means multiple childhood convictions can never be "filtered out" of DBS checks should be removed.That the single database of 942 offences which cannot be filtered be replaced with customised lists of offences applying to different employment areas That police chiefs should be given discretion to withhold disclosure, depending on age and circumstances of the offender That people should be given the right to have an independent review of any police decision to disclose convictions or cautions That the time allowed for convictions to become "spent" under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 be reduced Committee chairman Bob Neill said the government's main aim in youth justice was to stop people being drawn into crime "but these laudable aims are systematically undermined by the current disclosure regime"."Mistakes made as a teenager can follow someone around for decades and create a barrier to rehabilitation, as well as profound problems with access to employment and education."In 2014-15, the total number of standard DBS checks was 31,753 - 8,268 of which related to people who were under 18 years old at the time of their offence.A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: "We have noted the committee's report and will publish our response in due course."The government says it will consider the recommendations of two other reviews - by the Labour MP David Lammy and by child behavioural expert Charlie Taylor after the Supreme Court rules on cases challenging the current disclosure regime next year.
Emails reveal Foreign Office alarm at Trump travel ban:::::Image copyright PA The UK government wanted to set up an internal warning system to monitor and react to decisions made by President Donald Trump, emails show.The emails reveal concerns about the impact of Mr Trump's travel ban on UK citizens and national security.Officials did not want to be caught out by similar orders issued by the US president "just as London is going to sleep", one official said.The emails were released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act.The BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale said: "These emails show just how concerned the Foreign Office was about the flow of unexpected announcements emerging from the Trump White House and the potential impact on the UK.""But we have to remember that this concern was also shared by other parts of the US administration that were at times equally blindsided by the president's early morning tweets," added our correspondent."So the emails do not reflect any particular deterioration in UK-US relations.They illustrate the kind of steps foreign governments have had to consider to cope with Mr Trump's unpredictable style of government."Most of the emails released to the BBC were between the British Embassy in Washington and the Foreign Office around the time of Mr Trump's executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries.The order, signed on 27 January, was one of string of decrees, proclamations and orders issued by Mr Trump during his first weeks in the White House.It was signed hours after Prime Minister Theresa May became the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump at the White House.Foreign Office officials feared the ban would prevent thousands of UK citizens with dual nationality travelling to the United States and discussed the likely impact of that on relations between Mrs May and the new president."BE (British Embassy) Washington have been trying to get clarity from State (The State Department) without luck so far," officials said in an internal Foreign Office email dated 28 January - the day after Mr Trump signed the order."If true, this would obviously mean thousands of dual nationals with British passports being banned from travelling to the US.Not great after the PM visit."Another email, on the same day, said: "The dual nationals angle will of course be really difficult for us.I'll come back to you when I have more on our response."In the end, the new restrictions did not apply to British citizens with dual citizenship, but officials were keen not to be caught out again by the actions of President Trump.Image copyright Reuters On 30 January, Kara Owen, director of the Americas desk at the Foreign Office sent an email around the Foreign Office, including to the deputy British ambassador to the US Patrick Davies, asking for a new warning system to be set up to look at the impact of Mr Trump's executive orders on British interests."Many of these orders will no doubt be issued just as London is going to sleep," she said."I would like us to establish a system for assessing impact of the orders on U.K. interests (if any) and offering quick advice on what to do about it to the right readership (including senior readers in FCO and Whitehall, press and private offices)."She added: "I would welcome any other predictions about EOs (executive orders) foreshadowed during the campaign and likely to touch on our interests - he is doing a lot of what he said he would."The documents also reveal the EU contacted the Foreign Office to check whether Britain was attempting to get a special deal for its citizens in the aftermath of Mr Trump's travel ban - and concerns about the impact on national security.In one exchange, the Home Office's international director, Richard Clarke, discusses "potential UK activism/adverse reaction" in response to the travel ban, with officials at the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Also released was a heavily redacted analysis of the first three weeks of the Trump presidency, including a section entitled "Video killed the radio star".The documents reveal civil servants expected a change in Theresa May's friendly outlook towards the US President should British citizens be banned from entering the United States."You might have seen that the PM didn't engage on the question on Trump's immigration policy saying they were for the US," said one official, referring to Mrs May's press conference in Turkey on 28 January, when she was questioned about the policy."Presumably that changes if Brits (ie dual nationals) are blocked from entering the US?," replied another official.The document warned that questions on whether the government explicitly supported US immigration policy were a "bear trap".The emails also show Foreign Office also struggled with the weight of communications from MPs in the aftermath of the US President's executive order.One official complained of "yet another UQ (Urgent Question to be answered in Parliament)", in reference to a question put by former SNP MP Stuart Donaldson requesting a statement on the impact on the ban on British citizens.In addition, the emails revealed which journalists and public figures the FCO paid particular attention to.Tweets from The Guardian's Anushka Asthana and Alan Travis, Steve Hawkes of The Sun and Jack Blanchard, then of The Mirror, were circulated with Foreign Office updates.
EU preparing for no deal Brexit, says Michel Barnier's adviser:::::The European Union is preparing for the UK to leave without a deal, a senior official has said.Stefaan De Rynck said Brussels did not want a "no deal" scenario but it was braced for one.Mr De Rynck is an adviser to EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.He dismissed claims by David Davis that the EU would push talks on a deal to the wire saying the bloc did not want to "add risk" to the exit process by "playing with time".Davis warned over Brexit vote promise "Brexit is a process we want to manage in a calm and rational way," Mr De Rynck told a seminar at the Institute for Government think tank in London, adding that failing to reach a deal would harm both sides.He said: "There is a clear negative impact from no deal, I think that that is clear, for both sides but especially for the UK economy.But it is not a scenario people want to work towards."We are preparing for it, that is for sure, at 27 [the other 27 EU states] but it is not a scenario that we in the negotiation room want to bring in that negotiation room."He added: "On going to the wire, we would certainly want to avoid that."'Very quickly' As it stands, the UK will leave the EU in March 2019 whether it agrees a deal on the terms of withdrawal or not.Prime Minister Theresa May has said she believes the two sides will reach a deal but the UK must prepare for all eventualities.The so-called divorce bill, the amount the UK will pay to settle its liabilities when it leaves the EU, remains a major sticking point in negotiations.Hopes that negotiations would move on to Britain's future relationship with the EU this month were dashed after EU chiefs said more work was needed first on the divorce talks.Mr De Rynck said "sufficient progress is not far away" but the UK must set out how it believes the divorce bill should be calculated to end the deadlock over money."In terms of the guidelines for the future relationship as well as the possible transition, all of that can come very quickly," he said.Earlier this month, European Council President Donald Tusk said the rest of the EU was not preparing for a no deal outcome."EU27 is not working on 'no-deal' scenario," he said."We negotiate in good faith and hope for sufficient progress by December."
Legal challenge to DUP-Tory deal fails in High Court:::::Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Ciaran McClean stood unsuccessfully for the Green Party in West Tyrone in the general election A legal challenge against the deal between the Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservatives has failed at the High Court in London.The DUP agreed to support Theresa May's government in return for 1bn for Northern Ireland over five years.Ciaran McClean, a Green Party member, argued the pact breached the Anti Bribery Act 2010.Lord Justice Sales said the grounds relied on by Mr McClean were not "properly arguable in a court of law".Mr McClean launched a crowdfunding campaign to finance the case, which he brought independently of political parties, in July.Lord Justice Sales and Mr Justice Lewis heard the application for a judicial review on Thursday.Dominic Chambers QC, acting for Mr McClean, told the court the confidence and supply agreement was unlawful as it "purchased" the political support of the DUP.He said it was "unlawful because it makes provision for the expenditure of public funds for party political advantage".The application was contested by both the First Secretary of State, Damian Green, and the Attorney General.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Under the deal, the DUP guarantees its 10 MPs will back the government on legislation relating to Brexit and national security In a written submission to the court, James Eadie QC for the government argued that the criminal law of bribery does not apply to a confidence and supply agreement between political parties."The allegation that the agreement entails public expenditure which is unlawful is misconceived because the expenditure contemplated by the agreement will have appropriate parliamentary authorisation," he wrote.After the verdict, Mr McClean told the BBC that he is considering an appeal."We put the most serious charges to any government in modern times and the consequences of that could have been the fall of the government and the government finding themselves in the dock," he said."I don't think that was ever going to happen.But I think it was still right to get this aired."His solicitor, David Greene, is a senior partner at London-based Edwin Coe solicitors, who represented hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, one of the claimants in the successful Brexit challenge in the Supreme Court.Following the judgement, lawyers representing the government were awarded full costs.Lord Justice Scales said it was "not appropriate for the burden of costs to be borne by the taxpayer".Under the confidence and supply arrangement, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security - while Northern Ireland will receive an extra 1bn over the next two years.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Tory-DUP deal came two weeks after June's election resulted in a hung Parliament While rival parties in Northern Ireland have largely welcomed the additional funding, concerns have been raised that the deal could undermine the peace process and devolution negotiations, with the UK government dependent on the support of the DUP.The deal was also widely criticised by opposition parties in the UK.Labour branded it "shabby and reckless", while the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones called it a "straight bung" and said it "kills the idea of fair funding".
UK foreign policy 'should put values above economics':::::Image copyright HoC British values should be put above "raw economics" in foreign policy, the new chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee has said.Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said he was not opposed to selling arms to countries like Saudi Arabia but it must be done in "a rules-based system".He said Britain's reputation as a fair place to do business underpinned the UK economy and must be defended abroad.He added it would be "great" to be PM, foreign or defence secretary one day.But he told the House Magazine his focus for the next few years was to chair the foreign affairs committee.'Very blunt' Mr Tugendhat, who has served in the Territorial Army in the Middle East, said: "The fundamental underpinning of our economy is the value that people place on Britain as a fair place to do business, on British law and values being fair, whether that be accountancy, whether that be legal service, whether that be finance."Therefore, we've got to be careful when we make foreign policy that we recognise that we've got to defend those values abroad above simple raw economics in a very blunt system."Image copyright PA But he said foreign policy should not be conducted in a way "that damages our ability to promote economic growth in the UK".The interview, carried out earlier this week, was published the day after Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon suggested to MPs that criticism of Saudi Arabia in Parliament was "not helpful" as he attempted to secure a deal with the country for a second batch of Typhoon fighter jets.Asked about arms sales to Saudi Arabia in light of the country's role in the conflict in Yemen, Mr Tugendhat said, "I certainly don't think it's wrong to sell arms."But we must be realistic as to what we're doing when we do sell arms.And part of that has to be within a context of, as I say, a rules-based system."Saudi Arabia has caused some issues for us in that, and other nations have too.But it's certainly not wrong to enable countries to defend themselves."'Difficult to translate' Of Boris Johnson's performance as foreign secretary, he said: "He's certainly got a lot of passion for the United Kingdom and has a way of expressing himself which certainly carries a lot of noise."He added that "cross-cultural humour" was very hard to do as it was difficult to translate."I think there are ways of doing diplomacy.I've done it in Afghanistan, in Iraq and Saudi [Arabia] and across parts of Africa and most of the Middle East, and I just think that it's very, very hard to make humour work in international environments, which is why very few serious politicians try it."Seen as a rising star of the Conservative Party, Mr Tugendhat was elected as chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, two years after becoming MP for Tonbrige and Malling.

MP Bob Blackman defends Tapan Ghosh's appearance in Parliament:::::Image copyright Youtube Image caption Tapan Ghosh (centre) appeared at two events hosted by MP Bob Blackman (right) A Tory MP has defended his decision to host Parliamentary events attended by a controversial Hindu nationalist.Tapan Ghosh's appearance at the events has sparked criticism, with a Labour MP attacking his "abhorrent views" about Muslims and pointing to his appearance with EDL founder Tommy Robinson.Bob Blackman, who hosted the functions, told the BBC's Asian Network he had been unaware of Mr Ghosh's remarks.Mr Ghosh told Asian Network he was not Islamophobic.Mr Ghosh, the founder of Hindu Samhati, a nationalist group based in India, appeared at two Parliamentary functions last week that were hosted by Mr Blackman, who is chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for British Hindus.'Abhorrent' Raising a point of order in House of Commons on Thursday, Labour MP Naz Shah said it was "incredible" that he had been invited to Parliament."Mr Ghosh holds abhorrent views, is on record for calling upon the United Nations to control the birth rate of Muslims, praising the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Burma and also said Muslims should be forced to leave their religion if they come to a western country," she said."Only this Monday Mr Ghosh was pictured with UK far-right extremist leader Tommy Robinson."It seems incredible to me that any member would think it would be acceptable to host a meeting with this individual, let alone invite him to our House of Commons."Responding in the Commons, Mr Blackman said he had hosted a Diwali celebration and the launch of a report into Hindu minority rights in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which Mr Ghosh attended.He said it was only in order to present evidence to this meeting "that that individual was invited to this House" by the National Council of Hindu Temples.Pressed later on Mr Ghosh's past comments, Mr Blackman told Asian Network: "I've had a chance now to study these various tweets and they're not ones I agree with."He did not make anti-Islamic remarks at the event.I can assure you had he voiced some of these comments I would've challenged him."Free speech Mr Blackman said he did not regret sharing a platform with him, saying it was "relevant to what we were discussing".When contacted by the BBC Mr Ghosh said he was not Islamophobic.The Muslim Council of Britain said: "It is astounding that a Conservative MP seems to have welcomed to Parliament with open arms a man who trades in propagating hatred against Muslims in India."Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was at the Diwali event Mr Ghosh attended, said she "fundamentally disagrees with Mr Ghosh's views on Islam".Mr Blackman said he was a "passionate believer of free" speech.Asked whether he would share a platform with a hard-line Islamist or anti-Semite, he told Asian Network presenter Nomia Iqbal: "It's an individual choice.Extremism is never acceptable in any guise or form but the way you combat it is is to take it on directly."He added: "I represent a community where everyone is a minority and the reality is we have to bring people together and that at times means having challenging discussions."Mr Blackman said he was conscious of the fact his Harrow East constituency is made up of more than 10,000 Muslims, adding that he was working to promote a new Muslim school in the area.
National Action charges: Man accused of MP murder threat:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Six men were charged with encouragement to commit murder.Police said it was related to Labour MP Rosie Cooper A man arrested as part of an investigation into the far-right group, National Action, has been charged with encouragement to commit murder.The BBC understands the charge against Christopher Lythgoe, 31, from Cheshire, relates to Labour MP Rosie Cooper.He is one of six men charged with being members of the banned group.A 22-year-old man, from Lancashire, who cannot be named, has also been charged with the intention of committing acts of terrorism and "threats to kill".It is understood the threats to kill charge also relates to Ms Cooper.All six are to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.National Action became the first far-right organisation to be banned in the UK in December 2016.It means that being a member of or inviting support for the organisation is a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment.Ms Cooper said: "I would like to thank everyone involved in this case, especially the counter-terrorism police, for keeping me, my staff and the public safe."There remains an ongoing criminal investigation so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further."Who are National Action?By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned last December after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism.Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England.One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes.Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement.Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry.The charges follow a number of raids across England and Wales by counter-terrorism officers as part of a national investigation into the group.The others charged with belonging to a proscribed organisation are: Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside Matthew Hankinson, 23, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside Andrew Clarke, 33, of Warrington Michael Trubini, 35, of Warrington A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the men were charged following "co-ordinated activity" by police.
Tory MP Davies leaves Brexit 'belly-aching' seminar:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davies says there is a "wider discussion" to be had about universities A Welsh Tory MP left a university seminar because he "wasn't going to be lectured on freedom of speech", having raised concerns about universities "belly-aching over Brexit."David Davies defended Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who asked universities for names of professors teaching Brexit courses and the content of lectures.Mr Davies said later Mr Heaton-Harris "should have gone a lot further".The Westminster seminar was on a survey on public views concerning Brexit.The event was organised by Cardiff University.On Tuesday, it emerged Mr Heaton-Harris wrote to universities asking for the names of professors "involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit" and for a "copy of the syllabus".Of the eight universities in Wales, Cardiff, Bangor and Glyndwr confirmed that they were sent the letters whilst Aberystwyth said they had no record of having receiving it.The remaining four universities have yet to respond.In a tweet, Mr Heaton-Harris, a Eurosceptic MP and Conservative government whip, said: "To be absolutely clear, I believe in free speech in our universities and in having an open and vigorous debate on Brexit."Downing Street said Mr Heaton-Harris had written to universities in his capacity as MP for Daventry and not as a representative of government.Image copyright Conservative Party Image caption Chris Heaton-Harris says he believes in "open" debate on Brexit The issue was raised with Cardiff University's Vice-Chancellor, Colin Riordan, at the breakfast seminar meeting on Thursday morning.Monmouth MP Mr Davies, sat at the front, intervened in what one described as a "pretty polite exchange of views" but others said was a "rant".The Conservative MP defended his colleague's actions and argued that universities "shouldn't be promoting anti-Brexit views because they're publicly funded".After a comment from former Labour Leader Lord Kinnock, David Davies left, saying he had "had enough of this".'Eating croissants' Talking to BBC Wales after the event, Mr Davies said he "wasn't going to spend my morning with Lord Kinnock or being lectured by him on freedom of speech.""Free speech is an issue that universities need to address and it's absolutely time that they realised that they are publicly-funded organisations that shouldn't waste their time belly-aching about Brexit."They haven't got the time to sit there drinking coffee and eating croissants and lecturing people in Parliament about anti-Brexit bias," he added.A Labour MP present at the event said Mr Davies' departure "felt very staged", whilst another accused the Monmouth MP of having "turned up deliberately to make a fuss".Speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Chris Heaton-Harris' letter was "as authoritarian a request as could possibly be made.""I suspect this gentleman would have a lot to teach Stalin," he added.

UK population to pass 70m in 2029, ONS projections say:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's population is set to exceed 70 million before the end of the next decade, according to the Office for National Statistics.The UK population was estimated to stand at 65.6 million in 2016.The ONS projections are now for a 3.6 million, or 5.5%, increase over the 10 years to 2026, with the 70m mark being passed in the middle of 2029.This is two years later than the ONS's 2014 projection that the UK population would pass the 70m barrier in mid-2027.The reason for the change is that since the 2014 study the assumption of net migration of 185,000 a year has been cut to 165,000 a year, while the expected number of children per woman has been cut from 1.89 to 1.84 - with growth in life expectancy trimmed for men from 84.3 to 83.4 and for women from 87.1 to 86.2.Andrew Nash, of the ONS Population Projections Unit, said: "Over that period 54% of growth is projected to result directly from net international migration.The other 46% is because there will be more births than deaths."Over the decade from mid-2016 projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, for Northern Ireland the figure is 4.2% while for Scotland and Wales the percentages are 3.2% and 3.1% respectively.The figures, which do not take into account any Brexit impact, puts projected UK population growth between 2015 and 2040 at 16%, compared with 10% growth for France and 4% for Germany, while Italy's population is projected to see a slight decline.The study also says that the numbers of people aged 85 and over with have doubled to from 1.6m in 2016 to 3.2m in 2041.Analysis, by BBC Home Affairs Editor Mark Easton The Brexit vote has made calculating the growth of the UK's population much more difficult.The level of net migration and, indeed, the potential emigration of young, fertile residents are dependent on the kind of post-Brexit agreement that emerges.Nevertheless, the Office for National Statistics has had a stab at it and concluded that the UK population will not grow as fast as previously thought.In 25 years' time, it believes there will be close to 73m people in the UK - some 2m fewer than they had thought before the EU referendum.Net migration will be lower and so will the fertility rate with fewer young foreign-born women coming to live in the UK.They also expect a slower rate of increased life expectancy than previously assumed.The impact of Brexit is dependent on the kind of deal that emerges and what happens to the UK economy as a result.Those factors will affect the numbers who wish to come and wish to leave.The ONS thinks, annually over the next 25 years, net migration will fall by about 20,000 compared with previous forecasts.But the uncertain nature of our politics makes these kind of projections fraught - particularly for those who use the data to make decisions about building roads and houses and transport infrastructure.
MP Darren Jones sports painted nails in slavery awareness stunt:::::Image copyright HoC A Labour MP has spoken with painted nails in the Commons to raise awareness of modern slavery in nail bars.Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, defended Avon and Somerset police officers who had done the same.He said the force had faced a backlash from some newspapers.The force's #LetsNailIt hashtag on social media used a series of tweets of male and female officers with painted nails to highlight the issue of modern day slavery.Mr Jones said car washes and nail bars were a common location for modern slavery.Image copyright Avon and Somerset Police Image caption Avon and Somerset Police posted pictures of officers with painted nails on social media to highlight the issue of modern day slavery "I share other members' concerns that the papers have reported a backlash against Avon and Somerset Constabulary for wanting to raise this issue on social media in a way that communicates to people in their daily lives to keep an eye out for where they see these things happening," he said.In July this year the force raided a nail bar in Mr Jones's constituency and arrested four people for trafficking and slavery offences, he said.Mr Jones said he could be the first male MP to have sported painted nails in the Commons.He added: "It's not also an endorsement for Eddie Izzard for the Labour NEC."
Unpaid internships ban to be debated in House of Lords:::::Image copyright PA The House of Lords will debate whether to ban unpaid internships on Friday.Lord Holmes of Richmond will introduce a Private Members' Bill calling for a ban on unpaid work experience exceeding four weeks.He said the bill would ensure young people had equal opportunities to get into the workplace.The government has previously opposed attempts to ban unpaid internships, arguing it could "undermine existing employment laws".Without government backing the bill is unlikely to succeed.An attempt in Parliament to ban unpaid internships was blocked last November.But new research by the Social Mobility Commission suggests there is strong public support for the bill.Three quarters of the 5,000 people surveyed said they backed a ban on unpaid internships lasting four weeks or more.'Discriminatory' Lord Holmes of Richmond said: "Unpaid internships leave young people in a catch-22 situation; unable to get a job because they haven't got experience and unable to get experience because they can't afford to work for free."The practice is clearly discriminatory, crushes creativity and competitiveness and holds individuals and our country back."It's time we consigned them to the past, to the novels of Dickens."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Entry into many professional careers often requires candidates to have completed internships Many interns already fall under the legal definition of a "worker", a person who has a contract or arrangement to do work, and are entitled to the national minimum wage.However Lord Holmes argued existing legislation was insufficient."Absolutely we need better enforcement of existing legislation and greater education of young people about their rights," he said."But the national minimum wage can only work if it's possible to establish that someone is a 'worker'.You also have to rely on the intern to report it or HMRC to find out."HMRC certainly need to do more to find employers using unpaid interns.But this bill gives clarity and closes those loop holes."'Confusion' Tanya De Grunwald, founder of careers blog Graduate Fog, who campaigns for fairer wages for interns, said: "The bill is well-meaning but I think it's the wrong solution."The message should be that most unpaid internships are already illegal, with certain exceptions such as working for charities ... Our focus should be on enforcing existing minimum wage law."She said she would like to see universities doing more to make young people aware of their rights and for it to be made easier to report advertisements for unpaid internships to HMRC.In April, a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research found the number of internships had risen by 50% since 2010.Research by the Sutton Trust, which works to improve social mobility, found nearly a third of graduate interns are unpaid.It estimated a six month unpaid internship in London would cost someone 5,556.
David Davis warned over Brexit vote promise for MPs:::::The government is under pressure from rebel Tory MPs and Labour to guarantee a Commons vote on Brexit before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.David Davis denied "fudging" the commitment by suggesting on Wednesday such a vote could happen after that date if talks go to the wire.He said he "fully expects" MPs to get a "meaningful" vote in time.But ex-minister Nicky Morgan told him Tory rebels were "deadly serious" about getting the promise into law.It comes as the government announced that MPs would begin detailed scrutiny of the EU Withdrawal Bill on 14 and 15 November.Former education secretary Ms Morgan said the government could put the issue of a vote "beyond doubt" by backing an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was tabled by former attorney general Dominic Grieve.Citing reports that Mr Davis did not think rebel Tories were serious about the amendment, she said: "Can I tell him we are deadly serious, and it would be better for the government to adopt a concession strategy on having a withdrawal agreement secured by statute sooner rather than later for all concerned."In reply, the Brexit secretary said: "I won't pre-empt the discussions in the bill, but those reports are not true."'Cast-iron guarantee' For Labour, Keir Starmer said: "More than three months after the repeal bill was first published, the government has finally found the courage to bring it back to Parliament for line-by-line scrutiny and debate.Whether it will survive scrutiny remains to be seen."He added: "Ministers must listen to the sensible demands made by Labour and some of their own MPs about what changes need to be made to the bill."David Davis was summoned to the Commons on Thursday morning to explain comments to the Brexit committee on Wednesday, which suggested the vote could take place after March 2019.At PMQs later on the same day Theresa May had to reassure MPs there would be a vote.Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of saying "one thing one day, another thing the next", which he said was "not good enough".He called for a "cast-iron guarantee" that MPs would get a vote.Mr Davis denied any government commitments had been undermined by his comments, which he said had been misinterpreted.He said he expected a "proper and meaningful" vote on any Brexit deal "at the right time".'Take time' But he added: "Of course this vote cannot happen until there is a deal to vote upon, but we are working to reach an agreement on a final deal in good time before we leave the European Union in March 2019."Clearly we cannot say for certain at this stage when this will be agreed, but as (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier said, he hopes to get a draft deal agreed by October 2018 - and that's our aim as well."So we fully expect there will be a vote in the UK Parliament on this before the vote in the European Parliament, and before we leave the European Union."He also insisted the choice for MPs would be "meaningful - whether to accept that deal, or to move ahead without a deal".Referring to his appearance before the Commons Brexit Committee, Mr Davis said the government recognised the ratification of the Brexit agreement "will take time and could run into the implementation period".He denied claims he had "fudged" the government's commitment to a vote before Brexit but added that he was not in control of the timetable of Britain's exit from the EU because "it's a negotiation".
Universal credit: MPs urge government to cut waiting time:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'It's a lot of weeks to wait' The six-week waiting time for universal credit should be cut and be a maximum of one month, MPs say.The Work and Pensions Select Committee said the six-week wait before claimants receive their first payment was causing "acute financial difficulty".It said reducing the delay - designed to mimic waiting for a first pay cheque for a new job - would remove a "major obstacle" to the policy's success.Theresa May has said the government was listening and was making changes.At Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May defended the concept of universal credit, which she said was a "simpler" system that "makes sure work pays".Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment, is designed to make the system simpler and ensure no-one faces a situation where they would be better off claiming benefits than working.But it has faced a backlash from some MPs, who fear payment delays risk pushing families into destitution.Conservative committee member Heidi Allen said: "Despite the clear support for universal credit, there is cross-party recognition that the six-week wait does not honour the original intentions of the system."To truly represent the world of work, the payment cycle must mirror how the majority of people are paid i.e.monthly."The cross-party committee said advance payments could "mitigate some of the unwelcome consequences of the current design of universal credit, but they do not address their underlying foundations".'Cruel' wait Its report concluded: "The baked-in six-week wait for the first payment in universal credit is a major obstacle to the success of the policy."In areas where the full service has rolled out, evidence compellingly links it to an increase in acute financial difficulty."Work and pensions committee chairman Frank Field said the waiting period for the first payment was "cruel"."Such a long wait bears no relation to anyone's working life and the terrible hardship it has been proven to cause actually makes it more difficult for people to find work," the Labour MP said.Universal credit has been introduced in stages to different groups of claimants over the past four years, with about 610,000 people now receiving it.Almost a quarter of all claimants have had to wait more than six weeks to receive their first payment in full because of errors and problems evidencing claims.But the government recently approved a major extension of the programme to a further 45 job centres across the country, with another 50 to be added each month.
Harvey Weinstein faces losing CBE amid sexual assault allegations:::::Image copyright Getty Images Harvey Weinstein could be stripped of his CBE following allegations of sexual assault made against the Hollywood producer, the BBC understands.The removal of the honour is believed to be being "actively considered" by the government's Honours Forfeiture Committee for the first time.He was awarded an honorary CBE for outstanding contribution to the British film industry in 2004.Bafta has already suspended Weinstein's membership.A Cabinet Office spokesman said forfeiture action "is confidential" and he could not comment on whether a specific case was being considered by the committee.More than two dozen women - among them actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan - have made accusations against him including rape and sexual assault.Weinstein insists sexual relations he had were consensual.The latest claim against him came from actress and writer Brit Marling, who described an encounter in 2014 in which she claimed the movie mogul suggested they shower together.A number of organisations have distanced themselves from the American.The Oscars board voted to expel the 65-year-old, whose films have won 81 Oscars.The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) suspended him and said it hoped the announcement would send "a clear message".A group of Labour MPs, including Jess Phillips and Chi Onwurah, have written to the prime minister calling for his CBE to be removed.CBE stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire and is a rank in the UK's honours system - one step below a knighthood.Taking honours away, called "forfeiture", is done when someone is judged to have brought the honours system into disrepute.The Honours Forfeiture Committee considers cases and the prime minister then sends recommendations to the Queen.Honours stripped Previous recipients of honours to have had them removed include banker Fred Goodwin.The former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland was heavily criticised over his role in the bank's near-collapse in 2008.Other high-profile cases include jockey Lester Piggott, who was stripped of an OBE after he was jailed in 1987 for tax fraud.The former spy Anthony Blunt was stripped of his knighthood in 1979 for supplying hundreds of secret documents to the Soviets while a wartime agent for MI5.
Brexit: Is a last-minute deal possible?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019.The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019.It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU.Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too.According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.Even if a deal was done at "the 11th hour" as Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through.So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all.The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about "hypothetical scenarios" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in "good time" before March 2019.It's not entirely clear what "deal" Mr Davis was referring to.The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts.The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations.The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights.The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked.If the "deal" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that.The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well.Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states.But that option would be a hard sell.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?:::::Image copyright Getty Images This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs.But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage?Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement.The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger.Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear.An engineer accompanying me explains that these are "sewage ejectors", dating from 1888.An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits?But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster.And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink.The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds.Image copyright CIBSE Heritage Group Collection Image caption The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that "everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point" - before being ejected out to the main London drain.The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall.And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later.But, adds Mr Piper "we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer".So what happens if they suddenly fail?"If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable.The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards.Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers.There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes.And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do.The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state.Some have known this for years.A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace "faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"."There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."Home from home So how has this happened?And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics?Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability.Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there.So any repairs have been crammed into recess times.And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist.The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a "daily sense of continuity and security".Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges.Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call "elite blockage".The palace, he says, "casts a spell" on many who use it.It represents a kind of politics with "low expectations of public engagement" which "locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics".Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future.Meanwhile "the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."Image copyright uk parliament Image caption The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics.Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter.Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation.MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn.But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action.So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change?"It's starting to look like that," says Dr Shenton.It might be that "the whole place just grinds to a halt"."In terms of British pride," warns Prof Flinders, "if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an "elite blockage" like no other.Chris Bowlby presents Parliament - A Building Catastrophe?on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 October 2017 at 20:30 BST.You will be able to listen via the Radio 4 programme website or download the programme podcast.
Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels.There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money.But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal.But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a "period of implementation".It is not entirely clear what would be implemented.But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all.Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently?The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators.And both the EU and Theresa May (in her Florence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries?Those third countries might have their own opinions about that.But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself?It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues.The Confederation of British Industry, for example, argues that in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition.But UK government policy is rather different.It still argues that a deal on our "final relationship" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do.Upping the ante But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered.Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that "what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere", Mr Davis said: "We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."He added: "But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period.The words "at least in principle" contain a fair amount of wiggle room.And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly.It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition.And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must "take account of the framework for a future relationship".But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante."No final deal" equals "no transition" equals "hard Brexit".As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on.But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How are the talks really progressing?:::::Image copyright Press association So it's come down to money.Who would have thought it?After five rounds of negotiations on Brexit, the EU remains insistent: there will be no discussions with the UK on a transition period, or on future relations, until financial commitments have been clarified.So what exactly is it about the money that is proving so difficult to resolve?It comes down to the detail (or lack of it) contained in Theresa May's carefully crafted speech in Florence.Overall, the speech was greeted across the EU with a considerable sense of relief.It suggested that progress was at least possible at a time when some countries were beginning to fear the worst.The prime minister opened the door for the UK to contribute roughly 20bn (17.9bn) to the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, so that no-one else would be out of pocket.And - crucially - she went on to say that "the UK will honour commitments we have made during the period of our membership".But EU negotiators - under clear instructions from the member states - want to know exactly what that means in practice.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister said the UK would "honour commitments" Looming large in the background is something called the Reste Liquider (RAL) - EU money that has already been committed to projects in the long-term budget but has not yet been spent.The RAL is currently running at an eye-watering 239bn, which could mean a UK share of more than 30bn.Much of it is due to be spent on big infrastructure or development projects that have been delayed.There are also pensions and contingent liabilities, such as loans to other countries, to consider.The EU isn't asking for a figure to be agreed - but for a guarantee within the negotiating process, probably in writing, that "honouring commitments" means "all commitments."'Time pressure' The UK position, on the other hand, is that the prime minister made a substantial gesture in her Florence speech, and it is in no position to move further unless it gets something in return."They are using time pressure to get more money out of us," the Brexit Secretary David Davis told the House of Commons this week."Bluntly, that is what's going on."It sounds like deadlock, but that's not necessarily the case.Three more rounds of negotiation have been suggested between this week's summit and another one in December.The hope is that a way will be found to move forward, even if it takes a moment of crisis to get there."The EU27 don't believe the UK is too far off 'sufficient progress'," says Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the political consultancy Eurasia Group."They want Mrs May to be able to leave Brussels with a win that will enable her to strike a deal by December."That's why both sides have said they want to accelerate the negotiating process, and prepare for discussions about the future.If the language of the current draft of the summit's conclusions doesn't change much, the EU27 will agree to begin internal discussions about a transition period and the nature of a future relationship.They won't talk directly to the UK about these issues until December at the earliest.And only then if "sufficient progress" has been made on all the "divorce" arrangements, including money.It doesn't sound like much.But it's a start, and it is seen in Brussels as a carrot for the UK negotiating team.So what might the EU be likely to decide in internal discussions over the coming weeks?For EU officials involved in the negotiating process one thing about transition is clear: the more you keep things the same, the easier it will be to agree.That's why the internal deliberations among the 27 on transition could be concluded very quickly.They will probably offer to prolong all existing EU rules and regulations (the body of law known as 'the acquis') - or, to put it another way - to extend the status quo.That means that after Brexit - for "about two years" (ie for the length of a transition period) - the UK would be outside the EU's political institutions, but inside its economic arrangements.It also means the UK would have to accept EU budget payments, EU regulations and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.To put it in the formal language of the European Council's Article 50 negotiating guidelines: "Should a time-limited prolongation of Union acquis be considered, this would require existing Union regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures to apply."Difficult to stomach The details of what that means are difficult for some Brexit supporters in the UK to stomach.But the prime minister, in her Florence speech, has already accepted that the framework for any transition (she prefers to call it an implementation period) would be "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".Problems would arise, however, if the UK tried to argue for exemptions or exceptions.Take, for example, one idea that has been floated (forgive the pun): leaving the Common Fisheries Policy at the same time as the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.That doesn't really tally with the kind of transition that EU officials have in mind.Once you start unpicking the offer, all sorts of complications begin to arise.So it's not quite take it or leave it.But it's not far off.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Unpicking the agreement, such as leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, could lead to further complications There are other potential problems with a transition period that will need to be resolved.What, for example, does it mean for trade agreements with third countries, when it makes a difference whether products (or parts of products) are manufactured in the single market or not?But agreeing upon the terms of a transition will be much easier for the EU27 than agreeing on the outline of a final deal - on everything from trade to security.The 27 member states are a little more nervous about those discussions because differences of opinion are bound to emerge between them.Many countries have obviously been thinking hard about this already.One internal German government paper has been reported here.Finding a compromise But there is another issue that overshadows debate about Brexit in capitals across the EU - what exactly is it that the UK wants?Every change of emphasis in London adds to the confusion.As Finland's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Samuli Virtanen, put it this week: "It seems that at the moment the EU 27 is more unanimous than the UK 1.And that is one of the main problems here."But it all rests on finding a compromise on money.And that really has to happen before the end of this year.Otherwise time is going to start running out.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How do other EU countries see a 'no deal'?:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that "concrete progress" was being made in talks so far European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels and at the top of their agenda is a review of the Brexit negotiations.They are demanding better clarifications from the UK over its financial commitments, and the impasse has led to a lot of talk of a "no deal" Brexit.We ask journalists covering the summit how their countries view the possibility of no formal agreement between the UK and the EU.Germany: Daniel Brssler, Sddeutsche Zeitung Brussels correspondent The German thinking now is that a "no deal" scenario is not what you want - of course it would have an impact on British-German trade.But my impression is that the German government thinks that a bad deal, from the European perspective, would be even worse.They are saying we need a fair deal.But if there is no deal we will survive it, it will be tough but the EU will survive it - and Germany has a lot of trade with the rest of Europe.So far the talks are not seen in Germany as having broken down - people think there is still time to make a deal, that enough progress might be made in December.But people see that there is a risk.Politicians see responsibility for this on the British side - and Brexit has already estranged us to a certain degree.There is a feeling of them and us, you can see a pretty strict mood in Berlin.People say we need a fair deal, but there is no mood to have a deal just to please the British.Denmark: Lotte Mejlhede, TV2 News correspondent I don't think any country in Europe wants a "no deal" result.Business people and politicians in Denmark are very interested in having a good future trade deal with the UK.Denmark has quite a lot of trade with the UK, and we have an issue with the fishing quotas.Some Eurosceptic politicians want to join the UK outside the EU, but in general the attitude is that we're better off staying in, and that's also because of our size - our population is 5.5 million, and it's quite hard to do big trade deals alone.When the UK leaves, the axis of the EU will be France and Germany.Now I think everybody is hoping for a deal.But we know businesses are also preparing for the worst-case scenario.Poland: Maciej Sokolowski, TVN24 News correspondent People in Poland were just waiting for the announcement on Wednesday by the British Prime Minister [Theresa May] that everyone living in the UK can stay there with the same rights as today.That's the most important thing for Poles living in the UK, the guarantee that they can stay.The change of tone was really important.There were rumours like: "Do we have to go back to Poland?"and "Do we have to leave our jobs now?"Brexit isn't the main topic now in Poland.Of course there's about a million Polish people in the UK, but Poles are not talking much about the money, or the Ireland issue.On freedom of movement - the UK isn't in the Schengen area, so it shouldn't be much worse after Brexit.But no-one knows now what no deal really means.We still see the UK as our biggest friend in the EU, with Hungary.So after Brexit it will be a political problem for Poland, being without our main friend in the EU.Spain: Adolfo Lorente, El Correo correspondent Ordinary people don't understand what has happened with the UK.The situation is very complicated.We read that the UK is very angry with the EU, that it doesn't want to pay the bill.People don't understand the economic impact, but it's very important for Spain - we export fruit, wine.Many Spanish people go to Britain to learn English or work.Now there is a lot of doubt - people ask "What is happening with Brexit?"and "What about exports and passports?"It's like the situation with Catalonia - Spanish people feel that they don't want to be with us, they want to be separate.But we think that being together, united, is better.Gibraltar is also a big issue for us.Patriotism in Spain is very high now.Theresa May's support for Spain over Catalonia in exchange for [Spanish PM] Mariano Rajoy's support over Brexit is a real possibility.Some diplomats here in Brussels smile and say it's possible.
London's role in the Russian Revolution:::::Image caption The Islington pub where Bolsheviks and Mensheviks argued fiercely during the 1903 party congress In August 1903, a small band of dedicated but argumentative political activists held a fractious conference in London.It consisted of Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and about 50 other committed agitators who wanted to overthrow the autocratic rule of the Russian Tsar.Their quarrels might have seemed minor at the time, but they have rippled out across history.This was when the Russian revolutionary movement divided into the two rival factions of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.And a key vote happened in a pub in Islington.The Bolsheviks, described as the 'hards' and led by Lenin, wanted a tightly centralised and disciplined political party; the Mensheviks or 'softs' favoured a looser, broader-based alliance with sympathetic forces.Over the following years, as issues and affiliations shifted, their differences fluctuated but were to become deeper.Fourteen years later, in the second (October) revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks took power, sidelining and defeating the Mensheviks, and went on to form the Soviet Union.At the 1903 congress in London, where the split emerged, Lenin's faction narrowly lost the vote on the nature of party membership.But then seven anti-Lenin delegates walked out over other disagreements, and with his opponents depleted, his side then won a crucial vote on the editorial board for the party's journal.Pub venues This outcome enabled Lenin to call his group the Bolsheviks, meaning 'majority' in Russian, while his rivals became the Mensheviks or 'minority'.The bitter dispute prompted uproar in the meeting.According to Richard Mullin, a researcher into early Russian Marxism, Lenin's notes indicate that the tumultuous session took place in the Three Johns pub in Islington.Image caption The Whitechapel building where Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and others arrived for the 1907 congress "The 1903 London congress is regarded as decisive in the development of Bolshevism - it's hugely significant", says Neil Faulkner, author of A People's History of the Russian Revolution.But of course its significance is seen differently according to different political viewpoints."Most people on the revolutionary left would say this is the decisive break between revolution and reform," explains Dr Faulkner."A lot of liberal commentators would see it as the tiny seed from which ultimately grows the gulags and the labour camps of the 1930s."To avoid being monitored during their conference, the Russians moved from venue to venue over a fortnight, often using meeting rooms in pubs recommended by friendly British trade unionists.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Leon Trotsky met Lenin for the first time in London The first session in London occurred in a club in Charlotte Street in central London.Otherwise most of these locations are unknown today.The 1903 congress had actually started in Brussels, but after harassment from the Belgian police it moved to London.The British authorities showed more acceptance of exiled Russian revolutionary activities than did many other European countries.This comparative tolerance meant that some other key events in the history of the Russian revolutionary movement also happened in Britain.The 1907 party congress moved to London after being banned in Denmark, Sweden and Norway.This was a much bigger affair of more than 300 delegates, following an outbreak of major social unrest against the Tsar in Russia in 1905.The congress took place in the Brotherhood Church in Hackney, which has since been knocked down and replaced by a housing development.Those present included almost all the future leaders of the Bolshevik revolution, including Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin (a minor figure at the time), Zinoviev, Kamenev and Litvinov, as well as the prominent Russian writer Maxim Gorky.This was the last full congress of the party until after the revolution.Image caption Lenin briefly lived in Tavistock Place in Bloomsbury, central London in 1908 The participants first registered for the conference at a building in Fulbourne Street, Whitechapel, which still stands today.At the time it was a Jewish socialist club.Stalin and Maxim Litvinov (who later became Soviet foreign minister) stayed in a doss house nearby in Fieldgate Street, which has since been converted into a somewhat more salubrious block of flats.The conference saw further disputes between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.One issue for discussion was whether to approve the use of bank robberies to help fund revolutionary activities.Most delegates could only afford the trip back to Russia when the impoverished party secured a loan from an eccentric soap manufacturing London businessman who was inspired by watching conference proceedings.A few years earlier Lenin had spent 12 months in London, in 1902-3.He mainly divided his time between researching and writing at the British Museum reading room, and editing a revolutionary journal, Iskra ("The Spark").'Lenin room' In the reading room he studied works on economics and on the Russian peasantry.Lenin was able to obtain books which would have been confiscated in Russia, and was rather impressed by the British state's commitment to the library, telling a friend: "The British bourgeoisie do not spare any money as far as this institution is concerned, and that is as it should be."On his various visits to London, Lenin generally stayed around the Bloomsbury area, so that he had easy access to the museum.In 1902 Iskra was produced in London and smuggled across Europe into Russia.Lenin was provided with an office and printing facilities by a supportive left-wing publishing company.Image caption The 'Lenin room' in the Marx Memorial Library This building is now the Marx Memorial Library in Clerkenwell.They have preserved what they call 'the Lenin room' with busts of him, old editions of the journal, and copies of Lenin's voluminous collected works.A map on the wall outside shows the smuggling routes used.For Lenin, the journal was crucial both for building up a network of revolutionary activists and also for spreading the political analysis he favoured.It was in London, in October 1902, that Lenin and Trotsky met for the first time.The pair discussed the political circumstances of Russia, but Lenin also showed Trotsky the sights of London.When they went past the Houses of Parliament, Lenin said to his companion "that is their famous Westminster".Trotsky later wrote it was obvious that by "their", Lenin didn't mean it was the British parliament, he meant it was the ruling class's parliament.Yet it was that parliament, and the system it represented, which gave Lenin, Trotsky and their comrades the political freedom to pursue their goals.Martin Rosenbaum is the presenter of The British Road to Bolshevism on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday, 16 October 2017.You can follow Martin Rosenbaum on Twitter as @rosenbaum6
Fires, floods and mice: What it's like to work in a crumbling Parliament:::::Image copyright Houses of Parliament The Palace of Westminster's famous towers, gilt and gargoyles exude grandeur.But descending into the basement which runs underneath the Houses of Parliament inspires a different kind of awe - alarm and anxiety.To go on a tour of the cavernous corridors below the building is to enter a seemingly never-ending network of claustrophobic passageways lined with huge tangles of protruding wires and pipes, taped up here and there, leaking, hot to the touch.Faults go unmended because the pipes are so entwined they cannot be safely dismantled, and boiling steam rushes through ancient plumbing all day and night because engineers are afraid if they switched it off they would not be able to get it back on again.The overall impression is of a temporary fix ready to give way to flood or fire at any moment.The team charged with keeping the whole thing ticking over says the basement gives the clearest image of how precarious the situation is.But increasingly the sticking plasters fall off and the failing fabric of the building gives way, making it difficult for the people who work there to do their jobs.What's it like inside Parliament?One assistant to a Conservative MP told the BBC that all the staff in her office on the lower-ground floor of the Palace had to relocate twice while asbestos was removed, and again after a pipe burst in the corridor.On one occasion, she was working in her office when a light fitting fell from the ceiling on to her desk.Image copyright Anonymous Image caption Staff have had to move offices repeatedly due to asbestos "They've taken the approach of just putting plasters on problems rather than overhauling it," she says, "so overall it's just a bit dodgy.""The walkway to the car park is usually so flooded underneath that the floor panels bounce around and your shoes get soaked."A Labour researcher recalled an occasion a few years ago when the toilets above Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw's office "leaked through and dripped onto papers, leaving horrid smells".The sight of mice running around is so commonplace that several parliamentary workers only mentioned it in passing, saying, "oh yeah, we've got loads" or "the place is riddled with them".A parliamentary spokesman said: "Providing a physical working environment that is as safe as we can possibly make it is an absolute priority."Image copyright Houses of Parliament Image caption Overloaded and unsafe wiring carries the constant risk of fire The Labour MP Meg Hillier has investigated options for the restoration of Parliament as chair of the Public Accounts Committee, but also has personal experience of doing battle with the dilapidated surroundings.She told the BBC of the "hole in the carpet which you have to remember where it is otherwise your foot goes through it".She added: "The plugs in my office buzz and spark - I take extra care to switch them all off before I leave because I'm terrified of a fire starting in there."The head of engineering on the estate, Andy Piper, says that if a fire were to start everyone could be evacuated, but at present he is not confident the building could be saved as it would not be safe for firefighters to enter.Warnings from history It's estimated that 60 small fires have started on the estate over the past 10 years, and 24 fire inspectors patrol the grounds on rotation.Caroline Shenton, author of several books on the history of the building, points out that concerns raised by MPs and architects in the 1830s about the condition of the accommodation went unanswered.Image copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images Image caption Historians see parallels with the warnings that preceded the 1834 fire In 1834, a massive fire destroyed both Houses of Parliament and other buildings on the site."I do see a parallel because there had been years of attempts to change the accommodation, and the squabbles were exactly the same - over symbolism and expense," she says.Alexandra Meakin, a former clerk in Parliament and research associate at the University of Sheffield, summarises the situation as "desperate".She points out that most of the electricity and plumbing was originally put in after World War II and went out of date in the 1960s and 70s.Why has nothing happened?It's now been over a year since a specially convened committee recommended a complete relocation of all staff from the Palace of Westminster to allow major restoration works to take place.Image copyright Houses of Parliament Image caption Buckets catch leaks in the peers' Not Content lobby "Major" does not do justice to the scale of the programme - the head engineer at Parliament told the BBC there wasn't any comparable project in the UK."People liken it to restoring a cathedral or a stately home, but that doesn't come close - and those places would not have hundreds of people working there, as well as being the seat of government."Even if the government were to give the green light tomorrow, it would take several years just to move people out and get reconstruction started.So why wait?There are some who believe it's essential for MPs to remain in place at all costs, and would prefer repairs to take place around them.As Conservative Sir Edward Leigh put it earlier this year: "This is not an office block.If it were I would agree we should move out, but it is not."It is the centre of the nation and the nation should keep its debating chamber in this building."Image copyright PA Image caption Can the government find time to restore Parliament while it debates Brexit?Others are of the view that there are better uses for 3.6bn - especially with the social housing shortage in the spotlight.Another Conservative MP, Shailesh Vara, summarised it thus: "When we are writing to our constituents and saying that they cannot have an additional few pounds for whatever they are seeking money for, do we really want to go to the public and say that, nevertheless, we want to spend billions of pounds on our place of work?"Meg Hillier doesn't buy this argument, reasoning: "The public aren't going to have much confidence in us if we can't keep our own house from falling down."What next?From a procedural perspective, a motion approving the restoration has to be brought forward and passed in government time.There has been speculation ministers are shying away from bringing it forward as they face the not-insignificant task of legislating for Brexit.Former Parliamentary clerk Alexandra Meakin says: "Given the cost of the programme, and the fear of media hostility - particularly in the wake of the Big Ben furore - there is very little incentive for the government to hold the debate."A spokesman for the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom denied this, telling the BBC: "Discussions are ongoing within Parliament and efforts to arrive at a consensus continue."As Parliament resumes after recess, this could be the session in which MPs finally take action.But in the meantime, as one member of House services put it: "We are prisoners of the building's historic and iconic significance."
Brexit: What would 'no deal' look like?:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption UK Brexit Secretary David Davis and Chief EU Negotiator Michel Barnier say they both want a deal There's a lot of discussion at the moment about a 'no deal' Brexit.What does that actually mean?It seems to mean slightly different things to different people.But in the current context it basically means that there would be no formal agreement reached during the negotiations between the UK and the EU, which are taking place under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.These are the negotiations that are led by David Davis for the UK and Michel Barnier for the EU - the fifth round of talks is being held in Brussels this week.Even if there is no deal under Article 50, there would still have to be some kind of formal relationship between the UK and the EU in the long term - for trade, security and every other aspect of bilateral ties.But if the Article 50 process fails there is very little time to work on alternative strategies before Brexit in March 2019.When would we know if there was going to be a 'no deal' Brexit?This is an important question because the timing is critical.One scenario, being pushed by some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, is that if the current negotiations make no progress - and the EU refuses to move on to talk about a future trade deal - the UK should announce that it will pursue a 'no deal' Brexit instead.Leave supporters believe that would free the UK from all EU structures in one fell swoop.If such a decision were to be made in, say, March 2018 there would still be a year before the UK is due to leave the EU.That's very little time to prepare for such a massive change, but it would be better than nothing.A more worrying scenario for many business leaders, and millions of citizens who are caught up in the Brexit process, is that something could go wrong at the very last minute - perhaps a deal that has been tentatively agreed but is subsequently rejected by one side or the other.Then the UK could crash out of the EU with neither side fully prepared for the consequences.This is the 'cliff edge' that gives many people in business and politics sleepless nights - a chaotic Brexit that would benefit no one.Are preparations for 'no deal' already taking place?Yes they are - on both sides of the Channel.The UK government has been careful to say that it is not seeking a 'no deal' outcome, but that it has to be prepared for all eventualities.The Prime Minister has tried to move away from an emphasis on her initial message that "no deal is better than a bad deal" - but when pushed she continues to defend that stance.So there is a combination here of prudent planning behind the scenes, and public statements which aim to have an impact on the negotiations - trying to hurry things up by warning of possible alternatives.For the EU, the President of the European Council Donald Tusk has been very clear, arguing that no deal would be the worst deal of all."A no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone," he said earlier this year, "but above all for the UK."Contingency planning is also happening elsewhere in the EU, though - within both governments and the business community.The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said last week that it was setting up a task force of major companies to make provisions for the "serious case of a very hard exit."Anything else, it said, would be nave.What would 'no deal' mean in practice?If the two-year Article 50 process came to an end with no agreement, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March 2019 with no deal in place.Again, much would then depend on how long both sides have had to prepare for this.The consequences of 'no deal' would affect almost every aspect of life, and it is impossible to say exactly how events would unfold.But here are a few examples: Money: With no agreement in place, according to a House of Lords report there would be no legal obligation for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement.That would leave a huge hole in the EU budget.It would save the UK money in this instance, but it would antagonise the rest of the EU and further sour relations.Legal action, possibly via the International Court of Justice in The Hague, could not be ruled out.Citizens: Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of EU nationals to reside in the UK, or of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU, could technically disappear overnight.In theory, they could become third country nationals, subject to domestic immigration rules.Given the fact that this would affect more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and nearly a million UK citizens in the EU, it could well be that individual EU countries would try to strike deals with the UK to guarantee citizens' rights.Common sense should prevail, but that cannot be guaranteed.Trade: With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply.Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, and on goods the EU sends to the UK.It would not be the frictionless trade - certainly to begin with - that the government hopes to promote.Tariffs on many industrial products would be 2-3%, but on cars they would be 10% and on many agricultural products between 20% and 40%.The trade in services would also suffer if nothing was agreed in advance.Under a pure 'no deal' scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country.The financial services industry would be particularly vulnerable, and it accounts for a significant slice of the UK economy.Again it is worth emphasising that all these restrictions would apply to EU businesses wanting to trade in the UK as well.'No deal' is not a one-way street.Without any deal, and with no transition period negotiated, the UK would be free to sign trade agreements around the world as soon as it could finalise them.How might it try to go about this?There are a few pointers here.Customs: A government White Paper on customs, published yesterday, sets out options for a 'no deal' scenario in more detail.A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal.Image copyright Getty Images Traders would need to present goods to HM Revenue and Customs "inland as much as possible" to avoid congestion at ports, and consignments would need to be pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible.The White Paper promises to minimise disruption for business and travellers - but to give some idea of the scale of the challenge, HMRC estimates that about 130,000 businesses that export to the EU would be dealing with customs for the first time.'No deal' is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper hints at how disruptive it could be.The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would, in particular, be a huge concern, with serious ramifications for the Northern Ireland peace process.Regulations: With no deal of any kind in place, the UK would suddenly cease to be a member of dozens of regulatory agencies that govern many aspects of daily life.In time, it would need to replace all of them with agencies of its own.Thousands of new employees would need to be recruited and trained - a process which should have already started if there were to be any chance of it being completed before Brexit.EU bodies that regulate the aviation industry and the pharmaceutical industry are often cited as prime examples.One of the main concerns associated with a 'cliff edge' Brexit is that there would be no time to put new measures in place, even if plenty of contingency planning had been done.In theory - under a worst case scenario - that could mean that planes would be grounded temporarily, and drugs could not be imported.But again, the hope would be that common sense would prevail, and that some kind of interim arrangements would be made to keep things moving.It would be in the interests of neither the UK nor the EU for chaos to ensue.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
SNP conference: Is the childcare pledge 'unmatched'?:::::The claim: Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference that the Scottish government's commitment to early years education and childcare was "unmatched anywhere else in the UK" as she fleshed out plans to expand childcare provision.Reality Check verdict: Overall, Scotland's planned childcare provision would be the most generous in the UK, as it plans to offer 1,140 hours a year, regardless of whether parents are in work.However, a pilot scheme under way in Wales is better for working parents as it offers 1,440 hours a year.When Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage at the SNP conference, she said she was committed to giving children in Scotland "the best possible start in life".She confirmed that the Scottish government would increase its offer of free childcare from 16 hours a week to 30 hours for three- and four-year-olds, as well as vulnerable two-year-olds, by 2020.And she pledged to double investment in early years education and childcare, from 420m to 840m a year, by the end of the current parliament."This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK," she said."And it's the best investment we can make in Scotland's future."The first minister's office confirmed that what she meant was that the universality of care offered to children north of the border would be better than that provided in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Reality Check has looked into the claims.Image copyright Getty Images Parents of three- and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds in Scotland are currently offered 600 hours of free childcare a year.It works out at roughly 16 hours a week over 38 weeks of the year but families can choose to spread the hours over a longer period.The Scottish government wants to increase annual childcare provision to 1,140 hours by 2020.Funded childcare is currently offered to all families in Scotland - regardless of the employment status of their parents.That is where Nicola Sturgeon's plans differ from those in practice across the rest of the UK.England All families in England are currently offered 570 free hours a year.However, where both parents (or one in single-parent families) work more than 16 hours a week, they are entitled to 1,140 hours a year.Wales In Wales, a pilot scheme is under way where working families in seven authorities are offered 1,440 hours of childcare a year.That works out at 30 hours a week over 48 weeks.As in England, it is available only to families where both parents (or one in a single-parent family) work more than 16 hours a week.Every child in Wales is eligible for 10 hours of early years education a week, from the term after their third birthday.That is incorporated into the 30 free hours in the pilot areas.Northern Ireland Families in Northern Ireland can access between 12.5 and 22.5 hours of funded pre-school education a week over 38 weeks for all three- and four-year-olds.One of the key actions of the NI executive's draft programme for government was to "extend responsive, high-quality provision in early childhood education and care" for families with young children.However, Northern Ireland has been without an executive for 10 months, following a row between the DUP and Sinn Fein.The parties are in discussions to restore the government.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Poll tracker: Concern rises over handling of Brexit talks:::::After a pause for the Labour and Conservative party conferences the next round of opinion polls is hotly anticipated.They will be closely scrutinised in an attempt to gauge whether the problems that beset Theresa May's speech have any impact on how the public perceives her.And whether any of the parties have been able to attract new supporters with their conference policy announcements.A first post-conference poll from YouGov suggests little has changed in terms of voting intention but May's personal ratings might have taken a hit.But there are several more to come over the next few days which should give us a clearer picture.Throughout the summer, the Westminster voting intention polls were remarkably stable.Labour did not quite retain the level of support they had immediately after the general election but on average they held on to a narrow lead over the Conservatives.There was no perceptible movement for the smaller parties either.On leader satisfaction, Theresa May's rating improved a little.She still has a negative rating, meaning more voters disapprove of her or think she's doing a bad job than the opposite, but it has become a bit less negative.Opinium, Ipsos MORI and BMG all show a small improvement.And on the question of who would make the best prime minister, Mrs May has restored her lead over Jeremy Corbyn.Polls from YouGov, Opinium and Ipsos Mori all put the Labour leader behind by a gap of about 7-10% - although this lead has shrunk in YouGov's post-conference poll.Brexit split Despite some over-excited headlines, there's no clear evidence of a major shift in opinion about Brexit - at least in terms of whether people think the 2016 vote to leave was right or wrong, or how they'd vote in the event of another referendum.Over a period of many months there may have been a very slight shift in favour of remain.But the overall picture is that the country is still pretty much split down the middle.Where there has been movement is in the public's perception of how the government is handling Brexit negotiations.After Theresa May's Lancaster House speech in January, YouGov and ORB reported a marked increase in the number of people who said the government was doing well.By the time the general election was called a majority of respondents approved of the government's performance on this issue.Since the election, that trend has undergone a sharp reverse.In their latest poll, YouGov found that 61% of respondents thought the government was doing badly compared to only 21% who thought it was doing well.With "don't knows" removed, ORB reported 36% of people approving and 64% disapproving.As Professor John Curtice has pointed out, May's Florence speech has not had the same effect as her earlier one.
Organ donation opt-out plan: What do people waiting for transplants think?:::::Image copyright Julie Bartlett Image caption Heart failure left Julie exhausted and grey-skinned - a pump has brought the colour back to her cheeks and given her a good quality of life At home, Julie Bartlett has her bags packed and people on standby to drive her to hospital, just in case she receives a phone call saying doctors have a heart that is a match for her.If the call comes, she'll have a couple of hours to get to Harefield Hospital in west London - she can even rely on a police escort if she gets stuck in traffic."That call could be this afternoon.It could be never," she says, but she's optimistic that government plans for a new organ donation system of presumed consent in England might boost her chances significantly.While the policy content of Theresa May's conference speech on Wednesday might have been overlooked, one of the prime minister's announcements could potentially save many lives - about three people a day in the UK die because of a lack of organ donors.The Conservatives are proposing a consultation on changing the organ donation system in England from opt-in to opt-out, meaning people's organs could be used in transplants when they died unless they expressly said otherwise.Currently, anyone who wants to donate their organs after death has to "opt in" through the donor card scheme.There are currently 6,500 people waiting for an organ donation and it is hoped the new system would see more organs becoming available.What do people waiting for an organ, and recent recipients of life-saving transplants, think of the proposed changes?Life in limbo Last Christmas, former midwife Julie Bartlett was fitted with an LVAD - a mechanical pump for the heart known as a "bridge to transplant" - but what she really needs is a new heart."I could kiss Theresa May - although she's got that bad cold," she said."It was something that I have been waiting for, for a long a time - the sooner they do it, the better."In 2009, Julie was diagnosed with heart failure and never expected to see her first grandchild or go to her daughter's wedding.After it became end-stage heart failure and she was in a hospice, the option of the LVAD was presented to her."My quality of life is good now, but I have good days and bad days," she says.The LVAD means Julie is permanently attached to two lines, has to recharge batteries overnight and can shower only weekly because of the wound."There are limits, but I'm very blessed to have one and it's better than being bedbound in a hospice," she says.However, a new heart would transform her life.It would even free her to travel abroad, as while on the waiting list she must stay in the UK.Freedom While she waits for that heart, Julie lives in limbo.She believes families should have the final decision over donation, as they do under the Welsh "soft opt-out" system - where if the individual's family objects, their organs are not removed."Families need to share what their wishes are, so they are less likely to go against the person's wishes.It's a gift," she said.Image caption Matthew's new kidneys allow him to "do what normal boys do" The Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to 12-year old Matthew Pietrzyk, who spent eight years on dialysis after he was born with failing kidneys which had to be removed.He and his mum Nicola told the programme that the transplant has not only "given him his life back" but had also transformed those of his brothers and parents.The family can now go on holiday and make plans without the fear of emergency hospital visits.Nicola said she can finally "be a mum" instead of a nurse.Matthew believes that the new opt-out scheme will "save lives".But another patient in need of a kidney donor is not so impressed with the proposals.Kerigh Palmer, from Hertfordshire, whose first kidney transplant failed this summer, said the change would be "pointless" because, under the system the government is proposing, families could still stop donations."The majority of possible transplants are blocked by family members," she says."I don't think doctors should be saying 'these are your loved one's wishes, now what do you want to do?'""It takes away the individual's choice."Image copyright Kerigh Palmer Image caption Kerigh Palmer does not think the new opt-out scheme goes far enough Kerigh's transplant story has been long and full of hurt.After her kidneys failed in 2015, her wife, Julie, offered to donate hers.But they weren't compatible so Julie donated to another patient, and Kerigh, 40, received hers from someone else.Julie's recipient's transplant was a success.Kerigh's, though, was not - complications during surgery meant it failed at the last hurdle.As she drifted in and out of consciousness after the operation, she heard the words: "We are very sorry that it did not work.""Is it true?"she asked Julie, who was lying in a hospital bed nearby."It was devastating.That person is living with my kidney effectively.We feel pretty bitter."Image copyright Kerigh Palmer Image caption Julie, left, saved another kidney patient's life.But the kidney Kerigh received did not transplant successfully Straight after the gruelling failed operation, she was back on dialysis twice a week."I'm trying not to think about what's happened, because I will depress myself."I'm thinking ahead to Christmas, because I love Christmas.I'm not thinking 'where's my next kidney coming from?'"But she admits it would be life-changing to have a successful transplant."I wouldn't be tied to the hospital, I could work full-time without having to work from hospital, I could go abroad on holiday, eat what I like, not have to second-guess everything I do."
What does the future hold for the Greens?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election At a meat-free conference in the pretty surrounds of Harrogate, Green Party members have been digesting their disappointing election result in June, when they polled around 525,000 votes - half their previous tally - and ended up with a vote share of just 1.6%.But while the mood among the few hundred delegates gathered in Yorkshire is reflective - it's certainly not despondent.Yes, party members admit, the snap election caught them off guard and they were squeezed by Jeremy Corbyn's resurgent Labour party, whose agenda encroached on territory previously claimed by the Greens.And there has been considerable debate about whether the party was right to stand aside 22 candidates in marginal seats to give Labour or the Lib Dems a clear run at trying to beat the Tories.One of those candidates told me she thought Green voters should have been able to choose the party they wanted to, and that anyone prone to making tactical choices would have done so anyway.Another described the decision as "surrender" - seeing as there was no real payback from Labour or the Lib Dems by coming out strongly for electoral reform.There are others though (including the leadership) who believe the hung parliament was, in part, a consequence of the Greens not fielding candidates in certain seats - and that it demonstrated a spirit of co-operation among parties.But generally - across the conference, there is a sense of optimism that the Greens do still have a place and a role."Speaking truth to power" was the slogan of co-leader Jonathan Bartley's speech.He said that from opposing fracking to being anti-austerity, the Greens had consistently set the agenda and their ideas were now "common currency".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Green Party stood aside for other candidates in 22 constituencies at the general election On issues such as tackling climate change, he said the Greens' "voice of truth" had never been more important.And there was his commitment to a second Brexit referendum - on the final deal agreed with Brussels, a passionate defence of free movement of people and a claim that Britain's future was better in the EU.But the party also wanted to make a case for a new economy - a Green economy - with people and the environment at its heart.His speech on Monday was a morale-boosting address - to rally the troops and reassure them the Greens are still relevant.
David Guetta, Theresa May and the politics of the conference playlist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption David Guetta's Titanium was often heard at the Tory conference There's not much to do while you're waiting for political leaders to start their party conference speeches - so attention often turns to their choice of warm-up music.But now the parties have packed up for another year, what can we glean from their choices - particularly the Tories' apparent fondness for French DJ David Guetta?Straight after Theresa May's eventful speech, two of pop's big names, Calvin Harris and Florence Welch, followed the time-honoured tradition of complaining about their songs being used.But it was Titanium, a 2012 chart-topper by Guetta and Australian singer Sia, that was by far the most-played track at this year's Conservative conference in Manchester.Earlier this year, Guetta told the Financial Times he was "never into politics" - and his mother was a communist who disapproved of her son "chasing materialistic dreams".But it's the track's lyrics, not its writer, that caught the pundits' attention.Coverage of Mrs May's speech was dominated by her struggle to finish it (she had a cough and was interrupted by a prankster) and the PM has been dogged by questions about her leadership throughout the conference.So when Sia sings "I'm criticised but all your bullets ricochet, you shoot me down, but I get up, I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose, fire away, fire away," it seemed pertinent to some in the auditorium."You can always find meaning in songs political parties decide to play but [Titanium] is particularly poignant," said New Statesman journalist Anoosh Chakelian, pointing to the chorus line: "You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium.""[That] is May's position after losing her majority but staying in her job."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Did 2012 chart-topper Titanium sum up Theresa May's tricky speech?A less sympathetic verdict was offered by 23-year-old party member Sophie Jarvis, who said the Guetta track was more relevant to "2012 Ibiza"."To me it sounded like the playlist was put together by a 40-year-old thinking they're down with the kids," she says.During her ill-fated general election campaign, Mrs May was accused of appearing "robotic" - a criticism she rejected, although she did admit the campaign - which was characterised by repetitions of its "strong and stable" slogan - was "too scripted"."Theresa May repeatedly asserts she is not robotic," said Eliza Easton, a policy researcher who was at the conference."But Titanium, a song about a metallic woman unaffected by her challengers, is playing on repeat at the conference."A party spokesman did not confirm how the playlist was selected or whether the prime minister was involved.For the record, when Mrs May was asked in 2014 to choose her eight favourite songs on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs, her choices were mainly classical and did not include anything by David Guetta.Just before the PM's big speech, Home Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio 5 live the Tories had got their "mojo back" - and the playlist was certainly upbeat.Besides Titanium, the most popular tune on the conference floor in Manchester was Journey's rousing 1981 hit Don't Stop Believing.Titanium and Don't Stop Believing suggest a theme, according to Spectator journalist Katy Balls."I think [the Conservatives] are trying to suggest they are resilient in times of difficulty, like now."Image caption Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun were chosen by Labour for its conference playlist The Tories' conference followed Labour's version in Brighton and the Liberal Democrats' in Bournemouth."Endless repetition of the same song is a common feature of these conferences," says Anoosh Chakelian, adding that Killers hit All These Things That I've Done was a particular favourite with the Conservatives during the David Cameron years.Katy Balls was also at Labour's conference in Brighton last week, and found the mood more positive."Labour tried to suggest they were ready for power," she says."A song I remember most is Empire of the Sun - We Are the People (Who Rule the World)."Beatles classic Here Comes the Sun ("the smiles returning to the faces...I feel that ice is slowly melting") was played before Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage in a speech where he said his party was now united and ready for government.Choosing the conference playlist for Brighton was a "team effort", says Mr Corbyn's spokesman, who did not confirm whether there was an intentional theme.As it turned out it was the songs sung from the stage in Brighton - Tom Watson with Oh, Jeremy Corbyn and the leader himself with a rendition of Happy Birthday for Diane Abbott - that caught the attention.
Do Tories think Corbyn could be next PM?:::::They used to see Jeremy Corbyn as an unelectable throwback to the 1970s - but that was before the general election.Do Conservatives now think he could be the next prime minister?"I am afraid I have to say yes.That doesn't appeal to me but I can see it."Like many Conservatives who were in Manchester this week Ron Allcock is struggling to get his head round the idea of the Labour leader as a credible opponent."He is grabbing all the headlines and people are now thinking 'well, he isn't a bad guy after all'.It's astonishing.Really astonishing."Image caption Ron Allcock says the party needs to do something "dramatic" What worries the 80-year-old Chelmsford councillor is that Mr Corbyn appears to have grown in confidence since the general election and that young people still appear to be flocking to his side."We have to think of something really dramatic to get their attention," he says.Everyone you speak to here admits they underestimated the Labour leader - but opinions are divided over how to fight back.Image caption Jane Hunt and Hilary Fryers think the Corbyn bubble will burst Some, such as Jane Hunt, whose dreams of unseating Labour's Lilian Greenwood in Nottingham South crashed and burned in June, believe the Corbyn bubble will burst."We need to get through the stage where Jeremy Corbyn is sexy.He is going through a phase where people think he is a Messiah almost.That will soon die off.It's built on absolutely nothing as far as I can see."Like others you speak to, she claims Mr Corbyn "hoodwinked" young people by promising to abolish tuition fees and "sort" their debts."I am afraid I think the students were absolutely conned and I think they will switch off from politics once they realise they've been conned.They'll be switched off for a generation and that's really unfortunate."It certainly cost her her own chances, she says, as students queued up outside polling stations to cast a ballot for her opponent, who got 10,000 extra votes.Mrs Hunt's friend, Hilary Fryers, from Market Harborough, agrees that Corbynmania is "built on sand" and will eventually crumble.Image caption Anthony Clarke says the election campaign was too negative Some Tories - including Theresa May's Parliamentary aide George Hollingberry - believe it was a mistake to attack Mr Corbyn on his record at the general election."It's not good just harping back to the 1970s, talking about Hamas, trying to do Jeremy Corbyn down, there's a message out there that people are listening to and we've got to tell them why it's dangerous, why it's wrong for the country and why they shouldn't fall for it," he told BBC Radio 4.Anthony Clarke, the election agent for former Bath MP Ben Howlett, who lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse in June, says many Tory voters were turned off by the relentless attacks on Mr Corbyn's character."You could argue that we would have done much better if we ignored him, sidelined him," he says.Image caption Diana Beech says Corbyn's polices need to be 'unpicked' But he has his doubts about whether the Labour leader will ever walk through the doors of Number 10."He is potentially quite a difficult opponent, for one reason or another.I still don't rate him as somebody who is capable of ruling this country."When we have got Brexit out of the way and everything has settled down I don't think he will be in that position."One thing everyone does agree on is that the party urgently needs to do more to attract younger voters."I think there is such a momentum growing out there, to coin a phrase", says Diana Beech, director of policy and advocacy for the Higher Education Policy Institute, and a Conservative Party member, "People feel disillusioned.They want change.I just think there is a growing momentum from the grassroots, helped by social media."But she does not think the party should try to ape Jeremy Corbyn's policies."I think the only way to bring it down is to unpick the economic arguments."Josh Rendall, of Chelsea and Fulham, pictured above, agrees."The party didn't appeal to under-40s at the last general election.There was no overall vision."What the prime minister has done this week is a good step forward but having Labour-like policies, I don't think really works for anyone."As for Mr Corbyn, he says: "I personally underestimated him."Just look at his conference speech last week, compared to the one a year ago or even two years ago.He was a man who had confidence, he wasn't flailing about.He was confident in himself and I think the party underestimated that."The Conservatives need better policies on housing and student finance, not just watered-down versions of Jeremy Corbyn's policies, he argues, in what is becoming an increasingly familiar refrain at this conference, "but I don't know what they are".
PM vows to renew the 'British Dream':::::Image copyright Getty Images A white picket fence, a good job, a nice car and a prosperous future for our kids - most of us have heard of the American Dream.But what about this side of the Atlantic?Theresa May promised to bring back the "British Dream" during her Conservative Party Conference speech - or the idea that "each generation should do better than the one before it".She said her domestic servant grandmother, who has three professors and a prime minister as grandchildren, was proof the dream could be real, but admitted it felt "distant" and "out of reach" for many people today.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted Mrs May had set out a vision of "how to renew" the British Dream - but others watching the speech questioned what it was in the first place."The British Dream?What on earth is that?Never heard of it.What's in it?Unicorns?"David Hendy tweeted.Others began offering their own interpretations of the dream.Skip Twitter post by @Becca_DP the #britishdream is when u think 'it is a coat day' so u wear a coat and it turns out it was indeed a coat day and u are a good temperature beccadook (@Becca_DP) October 4, 2017 Report Despite the confusion, Mrs May is not the first politician to use the phrase.Former UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, who grew up on a council estate in Moss Side in Manchester, previously claimed he was "living proof" of the British Dream.He described it as the chance to "succeed in your life, no matter your postcode, your gender or the colour of your skin".It echoes the original idea behind the American Dream, which was coined by the writer James Truslow Adams in 1931.He described the ideal of a land where life was "better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement".Who dreamt it up?Mr Johnson himself said in 2005, while editor of The Spectator and a shadow minister, that the UK had been "hopeless" at communicating any sense of a British Dream - compared with the Americans."We've all got to be as British as Carry On films and scotch eggs, and falling over on the beach while trying to change into your swimming trunks with a towel on," he wrote in the Telegraph.Mr Johnson went on to say the first practical step was ensuring everyone in the UK speaks the same language."We should teach English, and we should teach in English.We should teach British history."But Michael Howard, writing in the Guardian shortly after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, saw the dream differently.Image copyright Working Title/BBC Image caption The success of fictional ballet dancer Billy Elliot has been likened to the British dream The then-Conservative Party leader thought it embodied the values of "decency, tolerance and a sense of fair play"."We need to break down the barriers that exist in too many people's lives - and minds - that prevent or deter them from making a success of life," he said.He nevertheless agreed with Mr Johnson that "no one" talked about a British Dream as they do in America.Two years later, the academic Prof George Rodosthenous, a specialist in musical theatre, observed in a journal article that the British Dream was "a term which needs urgently a definition".He was writing about the story of Billy Elliot - the fictional son of a coal miner who defies the odds to go to the Royal Ballet School in London - and defined it as "the desire to do better than one's own parents, the forbidden desire to dream and the action of dreaming".'British drawbridge' Professor Pamela Cox, social historian at the University of Essex, said the British Dream has come to stand for home ownership, having a secure job and a living standard higher than your parents.However, she believes it is "not a phrase that rolls off the tongue like the American Dream".Prof Cox said the one thing that holds back the British Dream is what she calls the "British drawbridge"."Elites are very good at pulling up the drawbridge behind them - things such as private schools and an inflated housing market."The British elite don't have much interest in sharing spoils.It's very much about keeping it for themselves."The American Dream is much more 'anyone can make it'.The British Dream is a different version - there is not a willingness for everyone to make it."
PM speech: Are fewer black people being stopped and searched?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May said that following a speech at the Conservative Party conference in 2014, government action had meant "the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds".Reality Check verdict: The number of black people being stopped and searched by police has fallen by two-thirds since 2010-11 but not since the 2014 conference.Also, black people still form a disproportionately large percentage of those being stopped and searched and the percentage has actually risen since 2013-14.As she delivered her keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference, the prime minister reminded Tories of what she sees as a key achievement - a reduction in the number of black people being stopped and searched, but all is not what it seems.Theresa May spoke about a young black man called Alexander Paul who spoke at the conference in 2014 about his experience of police stop-and-search tactics.She said: "Inspired by his example, we took action.We shook up the system, and the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds."The overall number of stop-and-searches fell dramatically between 2010-11 and 2015-16, which is the most recent year for which data is available.So, the number of black people being stopped also fell.This graph shows that the number of black people being stopped fell by two-thirds over the total period, but not since Mr Paul spoke at the conference in 2014.Disproportionately stopped But even though far fewer black people are being stopped and searched, they are still more likely to be stopped than any other ethnic group.When you look at the percentage of those stopped and searched who define themselves as black, little has changed.It was 15.2% in 2010-11, and fell to about 11% in 2013-14.Then it rose, and in 2015-16 was back up to 15.1%.The 2011 census found that 3.3% of people in England and Wales defined themselves as black - meaning black people are being stopped and searched nearly five times as often as you would expect them to be.So, while the number of black people being stopped and searched fell, their proportion of the total rose since Mr Paul spoke at the 2014 Conservative party conference.Just to be clear - these figures don't include stop-and-searches related to terrorism or that are carried out because police are trying to manage an incident that affects public safety - those fall under different legislation and are recorded separately.They would not have significantly changed the data.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: The people who are negotiating:::::The nature of Brexit will ultimately be decided by the governments of the 27 remaining EU nations and the UK.But the figures who negotiate the detail of the deal will be hugely important.Many would argue that Germany's Angela Merkel and the UK's Theresa May are the two most important people in the Brexit negotiations.But here are eight figures who will also be crucial to what happens.Of the four from the UK, three are within the Exiting the EU department.On the EU side, the figures represent the Commission (the EU's executive cabinet), the Council (the leaders of each member state) and the parliament of elected MEPs, who will have to approve the final deal.The EU negotiators A seasoned master of French and EU diplomacy, chief negotiator Michel Barnier will go head-to-head with UK Brexit Secretary David Davis.They used to be sparring partners in the 1990s, when they were rival Europe ministers with contrasting visions of the EU.Like Mr Davis, Mr Barnier does not owe his current status to his country's elite club of politicians.He did not attend the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, incubator of French political high-flyers.He has already given a clear indication of the tough stance he will take in negotiations - from guaranteeing the rights of Polish students and Romanian nurses in the UK, and British pensioners living in Spain.He is also adamant that the "sequencing" of the talks is key - the UK won't get to negotiate a trade deal until separation terms are agreed that preserve the integrity of the EU single market, and the UK settles its outstanding bills.Michel Barnier made his mark in French politics by organising the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in the French Alps.And for a long time he was regarded as a provincial - some called him "the ski instructor".He served as France's Europe minister and was briefly foreign minister.He stems from the Gaullist tradition.It was Charles De Gaulle who famously said "Non" to the UK joining the Common Market.Since 2010, Mr Barnier has been big in Brussels.As internal market commissioner he had oversight of the City of London at a sensitive time - in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.That role caused jitters in UK business circles, as Mr Barnier pushed through financial reforms.While some in the City disapproved of new EU regulations on bank capital reserves and bankers' bonuses, other officials found him more accommodating to City interests later on.And his opposite numbers in the Brexit talks will hope for the same pragmatism.Who is Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier?Sabine Weyand - one of "the Commission's best and brightest", according to its president, Jean-Claude Juncker - was picked as Mr Barnier's deputy chief negotiator in September.She studied at Cambridge University in the 1980s, and knows well the country whose exit from the EU she will be helping to engineer.But this German national is best known as a veteran at representing the Commission and its interests.And that makes her a formidable opposite number.She has 23 years' experience in trade relations and more than a decade at the Commission itself.One Brussels lobby group predicted Ms Weyand was unlikely to give much ground in trade talks on any UK hopes of a la carte access to the EU, particularly any weakening of the EU single market ideal of free movement.Those who have seen Ms Weyand in action speak highly of her as being far from a faceless cog in the Brussels machinery.Cecile Toubeau, whose group campaigns for sustainable transport inside Europe, came into contact with her at the time the VW emissions scandal blew up in 2015."She was very straightforward, she got to the point quickly, she understood the issues that we were bringing," says Ms Toubeau."She was open to what we said but I felt she was able to say, 'That's politically not something we can consider'."She was no-nonsense and honest - she really knew her stuff.She didn't need to look to her assistants for guidance."In its list of the most influential women in Brussels, the politico.eu website put Ms Weyand at number eight, calling her a "Commission problem-solver".She served in the cabinet of French former EU trade chief Pascal Lamy from 1999 to 2004, and later helped steer the EU's climate policies.She also monitored national governments' economic and financial performance in the Commission's Secretariat-General.In the run-up to the Brexit vote, Donald Tusk did all he could to find a deal to keep the UK in the EU.He was apocalyptic when he warned that the UK leaving could end "in the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety".His efforts came to nothing and as the result emerged he tried to calm the waters in Brussels, saying "what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger".But in the wake of PM Theresa May's re-election without a parliamentary majority, he warned the UK to make up for lost negotiating time, tweeting: "We don't know when Brexit talks start.We know when they must end.Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations'."As president of the European Council, his challenge is to keep Europe's leaders united as they negotiate Britain's exit.Mr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is loathed by Poland's nationalist government that tried and failed to unseat him.But he has the respect of other European leaders for his handling of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the migrant crisis and the Greek debt negotiations.He has warned the UK not to expect to cherry-pick its way out of the EU and he has rejected British threats to walk away without a deal.But he has spoken of his aspiration for a "smooth divorce" with the two sides breaking up as "good friends".Mr Tusk is from Poland's Kashubian minority and grew up in Gdansk, the Baltic port city where anti-communist demonstrations, led by the Solidarity trade union, erupted in the 1980s.He was active in Solidarity while studying history at the University of Gdansk.As prime minister, Mr Tusk led Civic Platform (PO), which espoused free market policies.His government cut jobs in the state sector, pursued privatisation, cut taxes to woo foreign investors and tried to persuade Poles abroad to come home.Didier Seeuws, a hard-working diplomat with an eye for detail, was quickly tapped by Donald Tusk to head the Council's task force for the Brexit negotiations.While the Barnier-Weyand Commission task force will do the "heavy lifting" in the negotiations - dealing with the technical detail of Britain's exit from the EU - the Council team will be tasked with keeping the remaining 27 national governments happy and shaping the EU's longer term strategic relationship with the UK.Mr Seeuws will also have to bear in mind the views of MEPs - the European Parliament will have to approve the final deal.Mr Seeuws's team is said to have been meeting twice a week in preparation for negotiations - prompting unhappy comparisons with the UK side's state of preparation in some of the media.Mr Seeuws is respected for his role in handling the Greek debt negotiations - working through the night until dawn and overcoming divisions between heads of state to achieve a deal.From 2007 to 2010, the 51-year-old technocrat from the Flemish city of Ghent was Belgium's deputy ambassador to the EU, where he is said to have negotiated a breakthrough on the European patent system - following a 30-year deadlock.The ambassador he served under, Jean De Ruyt, told the BBC his political instincts were "always spot on" and that he "trusted his judgement and recommendations completely"."Apparently modest and obliging, he is capable of mastering the most complex of technical issues and understanding immediately the political stakes, but at the same time able to explain in simple words what has been discussed or decided."I have no doubt that Didier will often be able to reach a fair compromise when, as expected, difficult negotiations will reach a stalemate."Prior to this, Mr Seeuws served for several years as spokesman for the Belgian prime minister, none other than Guy Verhofstadt, the man chosen as chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament.Eventually, Mr Seeuws took up a job as right-hand man to Donald Tusk's predecessor at the European Council, Herman van Rompuy.He has since worked at the Council as head of transport, telecommunication and energy.The UK negotiators A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics as secretary of state for exiting the EU.Initially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, he was elected to parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle.Despite his Eurosceptic views, he served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration.He later served as Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he is now charged with unpicking.His "hard man" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the front runner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005.He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms.In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge.He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May.He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data retention plans - dubbed the "snoopers' charter" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet.It was the first time in his long and colourful career that he had been put in charge of his own government department.Olly Robbins is the top UK official at the Brexit talks.At the start of the process, he was the top civil servant in David Davis's Exiting the EU department.But he has now moved to the Cabinet Office to work more directly for the prime minister, following reports of tensions with Mr Davis.The move was seen as a sign of Theresa May taking more control of Brexit negotiations.He cut his teeth at Gordon Brown's Treasury, helping to co-ordinate public spending policy, before going on to serve in senior behind-the-scenes roles for both Tony Blair and Mr Brown in Downing Street.By civil service standards, his rise was meteoric - he was Mr Blair's principal private secretary by the age of 31.He gained a reputation for being a skilled mediator in the frequent disputes between No 10 and the Treasury."In all my dealings with him, he really embodied the essence of the impartial civil service, and he's very popular," former Olympics minister Lady Jowell, told website Politico.After a spell as director of the civil service and as David Cameron's deputy national security adviser, Robbins became the senior civil servant in charge of immigration policy at Theresa May's home office.When Mrs May became prime minister she drafted Robbins in as her senior EU adviser, prompting speculation the government wanted to put the free movement of people at the heart of Brexit negotiations.Robbins generated some headlines in 2016 when he was ejected from a Home Affairs select Committee hearing by then chairman Keith Vaz for failing to give information about the UK Border Force's budget on time.He was also caught on camera "grinning sheepishly" as Mrs May handed her handbag to him at an EU summit in Malta.A career diplomat, with a reputation as a low-key but solid operator, Sir Tim Barrow was drafted into the role of UK ambassador to the EU following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers, who had accused the government of "muddled thinking" over Brexit.Sir Tim was Britain's ambassador in Moscow between 2011 and 2015, a turbulent period in relations between the two nations, and previously served as Britain's ambassador to Ukraine.The diplomat started his foreign office career in 1986 at the UK embassy in Brussels before going on to serve as a private secretary to Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook, advising on the EU, Russia and Middle East."It's the toughest negotiation in our lifetimes and I think he is up to it," Britain's former ambassador to Lebanon Tom Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."I have seen him in Brussels.He knows the corridors, he knows the characters.But actually more importantly I saw him in Moscow where he was incredibly resilient as ambassador there, dealing with Putin in a very testing time in our relationship and Tim had a reputation of being bulletproof out there."BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Sir Tim was less likely to be criticised by Brexit supporters than some other potential candidates for the job, as it "would be very hard to say that Sir Tim Barrow is an out-and-out pro-European".A fluent Russian speaker, Sir Tim was educated at Arnold Lodge in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and Oxford University.As director general of David Davis's department, Sarah Healey is, in effect, second-in-command of the civil service machine tasked with delivering Brexit.She comes fresh from a similar role at the culture department and also led cross-government efforts to promote more women into senior civil service roles through job-sharing arrangements.Her previous claim to fame was as a contestant on University Challenge - she won the BBC Two quiz in 1998 and twice competed in the Champions of Champions competition for Magdalen College, Oxford.Healey studied modern history and English at Oxford and gained a postgraduate degree in social policy from the London School of Economics before embarking on a career in the civil service.Her former boss at the culture department, Tory MP Ed Vaizey, told the Times she was "incredibly sharp and intelligent", adding "there are no flies on her at all".She worked briefly for Iain Duncan Smith, when he was work and pensions secretary, and, before that, was director of strategy and funding at the education department under Michael Gove.She recently told a think tank conference that, as a student of history, freedom of information was an issue "close to my heart"."One of the things I reflected on when I took this job was that my children, if they were to take history degrees, would write essays on what we were doing so it was terribly important that they do have access to the archives of the time," she said.Profiles by Becky Branford, Paul Kirby and Brian Wheeler.Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.
'No point trying to be cool' - the Tories seeking young voters:::::Image caption Around 200 people attended the Conservative Ideas Festival The Conservatives have a problem.More young people are voting than at any time in the last quarter of a century, but largely not for them - so what can the party do to change that?It's been labelled - perhaps unfairly - the "Tory Glastonbury".Around 200 activists, MPs, sympathetic thinkers and business people meet in the low September sunshine to discuss how the party can attract young voters.Just two years ago, the split in support between Labour and the Conservatives among 18 to 29-year-olds was fairly even, 36% to 32%.Fast forward to this June's general election and that small gap had become a chasm - according to pollsters YouGov - with Labour now on 64% to the Tories' 21%.In fact, unless you were touching 50, you were in a minority if you voted Conservative.'Panic mode' Addressing worried-looking party figures at the Big Tent Ideas festival in Berkshire, Lord Cooper - one-time director of strategy for ex-Prime Minister David Cameron - puts it starkly.Older Conservative voters, he says, are dying.And younger, more "open" voters are not going to decide when they hit 50 that "feminism and the internet and the green movement are a bad thing after all".Unless the party responds, he adds, "it is going to die".So what should they do?Image caption Bim Afolami says the party "realises that there is a problem" in not attracting enough young voters "Somebody famous and clever said the Conservative Party only knows two modes - complacency or panic," says one of the Tories' youngest MPs."And we're definitely in panic mode."Bim Afolami, an old Etonian and former banker, is 31 and has only been an MP for a few months, but his thoughts have already turned to this question."The party generally, collectively, realises that this is a problem," he says.With the Budget less than two months away, he says Chancellor Philip Hammond recently told a meeting of Conservative backbenchers that the party must address two of the key issues for younger voters - housing and student debt.Victoria Borwick - who represented the safe seat of Kensington until she became one of the 33 Conservative MPs swept away by Labour's better-than-expected showing in June - echoes the message."Every single MP should go back to their own area and see how they can build more housing for the next generation."'Not Glastonbury' It might be only 100 miles away, but the Big Tent Ideas Festival couldn't be further from Glastonbury.The music is Bach - perfectly rendered by a violinist.The buffet is delicate and refined.And there are more MPs in attendance than the young voters whom the ideas are intended to reach."This is not Glastonbury," Mr Afolami points out."It's more akin to (literature festival) Hay-on-Wye."The comparison is clearly unfair, but does it matter?The story goes that the brains behind the event, Conservative MP George Freeman, saw Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn cheered by thousands at Glastonbury over the summer and asked, "Why is it just the left who have all the fun in politics?"Image caption MP James Cleverly says young people were offered an "electoral bribe" by Jeremy Corbyn Conservative MP James Cleverly is unimpressed."Wow, a left-wing leader getting a good reception at a rock festival," he says, ironically."What kind of crazy world is it we live in that that kind of thing happens?"It's a bunch of young people who've just been given a massive electoral bribe."Mr Corbyn - who said before the election he would "deal" with student debt - will be punished for taking "younger voters for fools", Cleverly says."Being hip, being popular, being cool, that's really easy," says Cleverly."Until you have to make tough decisions.And when you have to make tough decisions, that veneer of coolness comes off real quick."So the better thing to do is to be right and be doing the right things for the right reasons rather than trying to be cool and popular and saying whatever thing is going to get good headlines or a big cheer at Glastonbury."Diversity What, then, can the party learn?Labour's general election campaign was praised for its use of social media and for reaching young people previously unmoved by party politics.Tobi Alabi - a south Londoner who was invited to attend the ideas festival, and was courted by Conservatives there, but isn't a supporter - says the party was an irrelevance for most of his friends.Labour, he says, related and appealed to young people.Image caption Tobi Alabi says the Conservative Party did not display diversity "That's something the Conservative Party didn't do.They didn't display diversity.They didn't display an appeal to young people.You have to tap into young people's interests."So - if they do that - could those young people won over by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour one day support the Tories?"Those people can be won back," says a hopeful Bim Afolami."Those are not people who have decided forever to vote for one person or one party."I think if we show them that we've got the right policies - but, more importantly, the right values - those are people that we can at least compete for in the future."Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
Who's that girl? GCSE student wows at conference:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Newly-reformed GCSEs are leaving teenagers 'spaced out and stressed out', Lauren Stocks tells Labour delegates It was a moment that caught the Labour party conference off-guard.Sixteen-year-old Lauren Stocks had just received her GCSE results and wanted to talk about the toll that changes to the exams had taken on her and her classmates.In a passionate speech, she articulated the scale of the mental health problems that blight her generation."There's a statistic we were shown when I was about 13 or 14 that told me three in 10 people in every classroom suffer with a mental illness.Using strong language, she denied that to be the case."It's a good half."I could've walked into any food tech, history, art, maths classroom and just watched seas of spaced-out, stressed-out, depressed kids, in a battlefield where they can't afford pens and paper," she said, gulping hard."It is a disgusting sight," she told delegates, and urged parents of teenagers with newly-reformed GCSEs ahead of them to make sure they know they are loved.In under three minutes, Lauren delivered a speech conveying the impatience of youth.("I didn't make notes before I came on stage and my thoughts will be fairly scattered, so please go easy on me.")Her audience were on their feet, cheering Lauren for a speech that's since been shared thousands of times on social media.Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren has been a Labour party member since the age of 14 "It felt pretty weird," she tells the BBC."I was kind of in my own little world."To see everyone stand up - I really appreciated it."And the plaudits didn't stop there."My Snapchat blew up," she says.About 30 people from her old school contacted her to say they were really glad she had spoken up for them."I have suffered with many a mental health issue.I was worried it was just me but the response was overwhelming."Skip Twitter post by @braveteaching Crying, partly with pride that our schools have made the articulate & amazing Lauren Stocks & partly cos she has to spend her energy on this https://t.co/entxGdER5q Lucy Rimmington (@braveteaching) September 27, 2017 Report Some social media users though, with characteristic brutality, were less than warm, criticising her choice of hair dye and appearance.The impact of these negative comments is something her mum, Sarah Hilton, worries about a lot but Lauren less so."They're saying: 'That's not a girl'."When I checked last night, I was definitely female," she says, laughing it off.She also diplomatically brushes off the inevitable parallels being drawn with a famous 1977 Conservative conference speech by another 16-year-old, which was watched by a smiling prime minister-in-waiting - Margaret Thatcher."I haven't seen the speech but I have studied William Hague," she says."I don't have the best opinion of him."Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren's mum, Sarah Hilton, says her daughter has been educating her about politics Despite her years, Lauren is no stranger to public speaking.Now under-19 representative for North West Young Labour, she has been an activist for two years.Her interest in politics was first piqued at 12 as she idly watched YouTube videos of people discussing left-wing ideas.After a brief dalliance with the Greens, she joined the Labour party on 3 August 2015."I remember if as if it were yesterday," she says, almost wistfully.A few weeks later, Lauren received an email asking people to attend a Manchester food bank that leader Jeremy Corbyn would be visiting."I asked mum if I could go.I'd never been into Manchester alone before."My mum dropped me off at the food bank and after that they kept me involved," she says.After her experience of sitting the new GCSEs, she says students should be empowered and told what they can achieve, not threatened that if they fail, they'll be left watching Jeremy Kyle all day.This year's GCSE students in England were the first to sit exams which were numerically graded and tougher than in the past.The changes, introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove, resulted in a dip in results, but schools minister Nick Gibb said pupils and teachers were rising to the challenge.Exam regulators said the new qualifications had allowed students to better demonstrate their abilities and had better prepared them for further study.A Department for Education spokesperson said: "We recognise there are challenges facing the profession including a more demanding curriculum and higher expectations for pupils.Where staff are struggling we trust head teachers to take action to tackle the causes of stress and ensure they have the support they need."The government has also taken steps to reduce the burden of exams on young people including removing multiple, pointless resits and investing 1.4 billion in children's mental health services".Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren met veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner at the party conference Conference was, Lauren admits, a fast-paced eye-opener but also a chance to meet her heroes, Dennis Skinner ("soon-to-be Sir"), writer and activist Owen Jones ("I love him so much") and Laura Smith ("a rising star who I hope to see in Cabinet").For all her enthusiasm for politics and its people - and despite lobbying from her mum - she is not certain that's where her future lies.Lauren is now studying history, sociology and politics at college, and plans to stand for council in 2019.But beyond that, she says she has no political ambitions."If it's meant to be, it's meant to be."

Election 2017: Which seats changed hands?:::::The Conservatives have lost seats in Parliament and no longer enjoy an overall majority, while Labour has exceeded the expectations of pollsters and increased its number of MPs.But this isn't the whole story... 1.The Conservatives won 20 seats Although it was a bad night for Theresa May's party overall, with 33 MPs ejected from Parliament, it actually won seats elsewhere.The majority of their gains were in Scotland, where the Conservatives performed well against the SNP, unseating the former SNP leader Alex Salmond in Gordon.The party also took six seats from Labour, and snatched Clacton from UKIP.2. Who lost seats to Labour?Labour's six losses were offset by 36 gains - 28 of which were from the Conservatives and two from the Lib Dems - including Nick Clegg's former seat of Sheffield Hallam.The party also took six Scottish seats from the SNP.3.Most of the changes were in Scotland and the north of England Although the political landscape of Northern Ireland has also shifted dramatically with the UUP and the SDLP losing all of their MPs.Changed seats All seats Please enable Javascript to view our results map Con Con Lab Lab SNP SNP LD LD PC PC UKIP UKIP Ind Ind DUP DUP SDLP SDLP UUP UUP SF SF Green More maps showing the changes from 2015 to 2017 are here.4.The SNP saw some huge majorities disappear The table below shows the largest majorities in the last general election in 2015 that have been overturned.Nine of the largest 10 previously belonged to the SNP - a 14,000-vote majority won by the party's former spokesperson on social justice, Eilidh Whiteford, in 2015 has been converted into a 4,000-vote majority for the Conservatives.Constituency (out of 650 so far) Result 2015 Majority 2017 Majority Banff & Buchan CON GAIN FROM SNP 14339 3693 Coatbridge, Chryston & Bellshill LAB GAIN FROM SNP 11501 1586 Ayr, Carrick & Cumnock CON GAIN FROM SNP 11265 2774 Angus CON GAIN FROM SNP 11230 2645 Stirling CON GAIN FROM SNP 10480 148 Ochil & South Perthshire CON GAIN FROM SNP 10168 3359 Rutherglen & Hamilton West LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9975 265 Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9974 259 Midlothian LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9859 885 Canterbury LAB GAIN FROM CON 9798 187 Oxford West & Abingdon LD GAIN FROM CON 9582 816 Glasgow North East LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9222 242 Moray CON GAIN FROM SNP 9065 4159 Gordon CON GAIN FROM SNP 8687 2607 Battersea LAB GAIN FROM CON 7938 2416 Kensington LAB GAIN FROM CON 7361 20 Aberdeen South CON GAIN FROM SNP 7230 4752 Aberdeenshire West & Kincardine CON GAIN FROM SNP 7033 7949 East Lothian LAB GAIN FROM SNP 6803 3083 Warwick & Leamington LAB GAIN FROM CON 6606 1206 Reading East LAB GAIN FROM CON 6520 3749 Dumfries & Galloway CON GAIN FROM SNP 6514 5643 Foyle SF GAIN FROM SDLP 6046 169 South Down SF GAIN FROM SDLP 5891 2446 Colne Valley LAB GAIN FROM CON 5378 915 Mansfield CON GAIN FROM LAB 5315 1057 Portsmouth South LAB GAIN FROM CON 5241 1554 Stockton South LAB GAIN FROM CON 5046 888 Bristol North West LAB GAIN FROM CON 4944 4761 High Peak LAB GAIN FROM CON 4894 2322 Stroud LAB GAIN FROM CON 4866 687 Enfield Southgate LAB GAIN FROM CON 4753 4355 Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross LD GAIN FROM SNP 3844 2044 Bath LD GAIN FROM CON 3833 5694 Ipswich LAB GAIN FROM CON 3733 831 Renfrewshire East CON GAIN FROM SNP 3718 4712 Crewe & Nantwich LAB GAIN FROM CON 3620 48 Clacton CON GAIN FROM UKIP 3437 15828 Edinburgh West LD GAIN FROM SNP 3210 2988 Ceredigion PC GAIN FROM LD 3067 104 Keighley LAB GAIN FROM CON 3053 249 Leeds North West LAB GAIN FROM LD 2907 4224 Kingston & Surbiton LD GAIN FROM CON 2834 4124 Warrington South LAB GAIN FROM CON 2750 2549 Copeland CON WIN 2564 1695 Stoke-on-Trent South CON GAIN FROM LAB 2539 663 Sheffield Hallam LAB GAIN FROM LD 2353 2125 Middlesbrough South & Cleveland East CON GAIN FROM LAB 2268 1020 Dunbartonshire East LD GAIN FROM SNP 2167 5339 Cardiff North LAB GAIN FROM CON 2137 4174 Twickenham LD GAIN FROM CON 2017 9762 Walsall North CON GAIN FROM LAB 1937 2601 Peterborough LAB GAIN FROM CON 1925 607 Derbyshire North East CON GAIN FROM LAB 1883 2861 Lincoln LAB GAIN FROM CON 1443 1538 Southport CON GAIN FROM LD 1322 2914 Bedford LAB GAIN FROM CON 1097 789 South Antrim DUP GAIN FROM UUP 949 3208 Belfast South DUP GAIN FROM SDLP 906 1996 Weaver Vale LAB GAIN FROM CON 806 3928 Eastbourne LD GAIN FROM CON 733 1609 Brighton Kemptown LAB GAIN FROM CON 690 9868 Fermanagh & South Tyrone SF GAIN FROM UUP 530 875 Plymouth Sutton & Devonport LAB GAIN FROM CON 523 6807 Bury North LAB GAIN FROM CON 378 4375 Berwickshire, Roxburgh & Selkirk CON GAIN FROM SNP 328 11060 Vale of Clwyd LAB GAIN FROM CON 237 2379 Croydon Central LAB GAIN FROM CON 165 5652 Derby North LAB GAIN FROM CON 41 2015 Gower LAB GAIN FROM CON 27 3269
Theresa May: 10 reasons why the PM blew her majority:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May awaiting her constituency result in the early hours of Friday The post mortem on how Theresa May managed to lose her majority in Thursday's general election after expecting to secure a landslide victory is well under way.Here are 10 theories.First things first.Did she blow it?Yes.The Conservatives came first in this election with 318 seats, with Labour the next biggest party on 262 seats.The Conservatives got more votes that anyone else - 42.4% to Labour's 40% - and Theresa May's party got more votes than anyone since the record-breaking total John Major received in 1992.And yes, that means she got more votes than Tony Blair's New Labour landslide in 1997.So, you ask, in what sense did she blow it?Well, she had 331 MPs - more than the 326 needed to have a Commons majority - when she decided to call the election with the aim of increasing her majority.She also began the campaign with an undisputed opinion-poll lead in double figures and a landslide victory within her grasp.She ends it having to try to do a deal with the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs to stay in power, and knowing that, the decision to call a snap election will go down as one of the biggest own goals in British political history.So how did it come to this?1) Deciding to call an election Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking.Why does she need to do it?'Theresa May had been serenely racking up stunning approval ratings and huge opinion-poll leads.Her constant refrain was "Brexit meant Brexit" and it seemed a serious, tough, honest and non-flashy politician was what the British people wanted.Her honeymoon period felt like that of another self-consciously unshowy prime minister who came to power without an election - Gordon Brown.But unlike Mr Brown in 2007, she did not allow speculation about a snap election to run rife only to blow her reputation by deciding not to call one after all.She ruled out having an election.And then she changed her mind.She insisted she was acting in the national interest but others detected baser motives.Jeremy Corbyn said: "How can any voter trust what the prime minister says?".Nicola Sturgeon said it was a naked power grab and a bid to crush all opposition.The public, like Brenda in Bristol, seemed weary of politics and voting.2) The wrong type of campaign Image copyright Getty Images This was Theresa May's election - the Conservatives were some way off in the distance, if they were visible at all, at the start of the campaign.But was she the right kind of candidate to be placed front and centre like this?Katie Perrior, Mrs May's former director of communications thinks not.Writing in the Times, she said: "If you run a presidential-style campaign with a woman who doesn't like media interviews, then you have to accept that it's better to do them and run the risk that they go badly than look like you are running scared.Furthermore, if you want to brag that your candidate is a bloody difficult woman, then she has to show some empathy to remind people she is human after all."3) Dodging the TV debates Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Home Secretary Amber Rudd and senior politicians from six other parties took part in the debate.With huge poll leads at the start of the campaign it was quickly decided that Mrs May would not take part in anything as risky as a TV debate with her main challenger, Jeremy Corbyn, or risk meeting too many members of the public in big rallies.That decision backfired when Mr Corbyn decided to take part in a seven-way debate with other party leaders - he did not make a big deal of her absence, but everybody else on the stage did.The Green Party's Caroline Lucas said: "You don't say it's the most important election of our lifetime and not be bothered to show up."Mrs May might have performed badly in the debate, but she arguably took a far bigger reputational hit by not taking part, as it opened her up to accusations she was running scared, or that she was complacently assuming victory.4) Underestimating the opposition Image copyright Reuters Sporting history is littered with underdogs triumphing because they wanted to win more than their opponents, or put in more effort.The same sometimes goes for politics.In this election Mrs May seemed like she would be happy to say "strong and stable" from dawn until the sun set over the fields of wheat she "naughtily" ran through as a child.There was little in the way of a positive message to entice floating voters.Her campaign team did not seem able to conceive of the idea that anyone would take Mr Corbyn seriously.They underestimated how well his anti-austerity message would go over with voters worn out by years of frozen wages and public spending squeezes.Many commentators, on the left and right, who had written Jeremy Corbyn off as vote-losing liability have had to eat their words since the election.Just about everyone underestimated his appeal, once he was given a chance to air his views unmediated by a largely hostile press.5) Manifesto policies Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign The turning point of the campaign, according to insiders, was Theresa May's U-turn on social care.Team May were apparently so confident of victory that they thought they could tackle the looming problem of social care costs - an issue parties scrapping to win elections have generally shied away from.But within hours the main thing many people knew about the Conservative programme for government was that it included a "dementia tax" that could lead to more people having to sell their homes to pay for care.The same went for means-testing the winter fuel allowance and ending the "triple lock" that guarantees a minimum 2.5% increase in the state pension.Mrs May might have got away with the rapid U-turn on social care - something that is almost unheard of the middle of an election campaign - if she had owned up to it but she continued to insist that nothing had changed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: This is the right way forward Anna Soubry, an anti-Brexit Tory MP said this was the moment that she lost her "strong and stable" reputation.Some Conservative MPs have suggested, off the record, that the 2017 manifesto was the worst the party has ever published.Ms Soubry said it was more a problem of "appalling" presentation - not properly explaining the social care changes, which would actually have benefited many less well-off people - and allowing people to think free school meals for poor children were being axed, when in fact the plan was to end the free lunches for all infants, which benefits the better-off.6) Not reacting to the Labour surge Image copyright Reuters Nick Timothy, pictured, who was forced out as Theresa May's policy adviser after the election result, suggests Team May were not even aware that there was a surge in Labour support as polling day approached.In his resignation statement, he said this was "because modern campaigning techniques require ever-narrower targeting of specific voters, and we were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour".Instead of pushing their message on the NHS and the energy price cap to get wavering Labour voters on side, they doubled down on what they thought was their strongest suit - Brexit and "strong and stable leadership" in contrast to a "coalition of chaos" under Mr Corbyn.7) May's personality Image copyright Getty Images People knew very little about Theresa May before the campaign started - she had been home secretary for a long time but had not courted publicity like some of her cabinet colleagues.An introvert, by Westminster standards, who does not like talking about her private feelings, she tended to come across as ill-at-ease on the TV sofa.Like Hillary Clinton in last year's US elections, she was not a natural on the campaign trail either.As Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts pointed out at one event, she tended to look a bit miserable, or as he put it, a "glumbucket'.Mr Corbyn, on the other hand, looked like he was enjoying himself.At the end of the campaign, Mrs May had to rely on Boris Johnson, a natural political showman, to whip up the crowds.8) Negativity and the youth vote Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May spent a lot of time attacking Jeremy Corbyn's credibility and, as Nick Timothy has acknowledged, not enough time setting out her "positive plan for for the future".There are shades of Clinton here again, who focused heavily on attacking her opponent's fitness for office rather than explaining what she would do with power.Conservative attacks on Mr Corbyn's anti-terror record will have sounded alarm bells with older readers of Conservative-supporting newspapers.They may have meant less to anyone under 30, who were more interested in what the Labour leader had to say about their future rather than who he was holding meetings with decades ago.Labour countered Tory attack ads on Facebook with upbeat messages and celebrity endorsements.Labour's successful push to get out the youth vote was a decisive factor in some seats, although there is still some debate about the size of the surge in voting among 18 to 24-year-olds.The Tory campaign was widely criticised for being negative and uninspiring.9) Fox hunting and 'the same old Tories' Image copyright EPA Image caption Anti-hunting protesters marched on Downing Street It may simply have been a repetition of a longstanding Tory policy but Theresa May's vow to hold a free vote on bringing back fox hunting is thought by some to have harmed her efforts to seal the deal with Labour voters flirting with the Conservatives.It came up a lot on the doorstep, according to some reports, helping to "re-toxify" the Conservative brand among voters in traditional Labour areas, which Mrs May was banking on to win a big majority.Like the social care U-turn, or the pledge to bring back grammar schools, it may have given anyone flirting with backing the Tories for the first time in their lives a reason not to switch their vote.10) Events Theresa May wanted the election to be about Brexit but the terror attacks in Manchester and London changed the course of the campaign.Suddenly it was all about security and anti-terror policy.This should have put the former home secretary in a strong position, and her statements on the attacks struck a suitably prime ministerial tone.Labour's criticism of cuts to police numbers gave them a line of attack against Mrs May - but the pause in campaigning that followed the terrorist incidents resulted in a sombre and strangely off-kilter ending to the election.Here is a selection of your views: "Ignoring remain voters - too much focus on "no deal is better than a bad deal" and complaining that Remain voters were "citizens of nowhere" alienated the 48%.Playing so much to the UKIP vote backfired in many areas of the country.Evidence for this: the swing to Labour from Tories was much larger in Remain voting areas than Leave voting ones," Sue, York."Jeremy Corbyn was reckless and irresponsible in the promises he was making particularly to the youth voters.Promising to give 'free university' at a cost to the UK of 11.5 Billion a year, is an example of the 'money tree' that pays for all !Corbyn could afford to be reckless in his election promises because he didn't expect to win or be PM."Ron, Stoke-on-Trent."The Conservatives underestimated the collapse in the number of votes for the UKIP party.It must have been apparent that these votes would go somewhere and not necessarily all to the Conservative Party.Clearly some of these went to the Labour Party.The Labour Party will always have a strong backing in the cities and these extra votes from the UKIP party helped Labour get more seats.This should have been anticipated and calculated before Mrs May called the election so some of her advisers and backroom staff got it clearly wrong and miscalculated - or was it Mrs May just determined to call the election whatever?," Jeff "Definitely Fox Hunting swayed me.I left the Labour Party as a member when JC became leader.I didn't think he was electable (and he still might not be) and predicted a Labour wipe-out with him at the helm.But as the election went on I was slowly taken back into the fold by his positive campaign.I'd always agreed with his policies, just him as a leader I had doubts over.The more he engaged though the more I cheered, and once the manifestos where published it was game over for the Tories.But yes, the fox hunting was the initial game changer (as it was announced early on) - and then everything else just fell into place," Ian, Chester."I'm surprised that more hasn't been made of the proposed boundary changes, which would have reduced MPs from 650 to 600.If May had forced these through and then called the election she would have undoubtedly won a majority, as they massively favour the Conservatives.One report suggested that under the new boundaries Labour could be 10% ahead of the Tories and still not have a majority," Andrew, Loughborough."The Tories did not lose their majority over the stance favouring a hard Brexit.They lost seats because the majority accept that Brexit will happen and all the other issues of economic and social policy were more important issues in the election.Mrs May needs to ignore the pro Remain Major, Cameron and Clarke who are using the situation to try to reverse their defeat in the Referendum," Ian "You've laid out some good reasons but as you state, both the Conservative and Labour vote increased...... why?Because of a huge amount of tactical voting especially driven by social media.A lot of the "Remainers" had been horrified about the way that she'd embraced a Hard Brexit and even though Labour supported Brexit, they felt that not voting Tory would potentially hinder this outcome.Labour need to bear this in mind too.As a lot of people like me "lent" them their vote," Paul, Newcastle-under-Lyme "Was there any evidence to suggest that tactical voting also played a part in the demise of the Conservative majority?Were voters were more likely to vote for their second choice party if it meant stopping a Tory candidate from winning their constituency?Clearly this could have been a case in constituencies where non-contest agreements were forged e.g.Brighton Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), and in Twickenham where there was an absence of any campaign leaflets from any parties other than Lib Dems and Conservatives," John, London I am surprised by your list of reasons for the Conservative election results.For me this is very much about Brexit and Theresa May's stance.She was a remainer but since being elected has used a rhetoric which concerns much of the UK population.So this result is a protest against hard Brexit which will damage the UK economy beyond repair.It is also the young peoples's recognition that their vote matters.Had they voted in the referendum the result would have been remain, and they are angry and want their voices heard, Louise, Hampshire "The media, including the BBC, displayed an attitude of sneering contempt towards Jeremy Corbyn ever since he was elected Labour Party leader right up to the recent election campaign.Even the Guardian only endorsed Corbyn at the last minute, when it sensed which way the tide was running.This must raise serious questions about how 'free' our media really are, and who plots their editorial course.Time for another independent enquiry, perhaps?," John, Coventry "Another nail in the coffin of May's majority is her too-cosy relationship with Trump and particularly her failure to unreservedly condemn him for pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement.Saying that she was 'disappointed' was nowhere near strong enough," Ron, Cambridgeshire "It will be a rare day a Conservative calls another election without a 35 point lead in the polls.No wonder Labour is cambering for another election, Labour would rather enjoy another election in the next six months.Whereas, as a postman, I would not."Paul, Lincolnshire Everyone is tired of austerity, even those who are managing well.It's interesting how many of the affluent, metropolitan elite voted Labour, even though they were the ones who would be paying the bulk of the extra taxes.Whether they would have voted the same way if they'd thought he actually stood a chance of winning is a different question.Paul, London
Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger

Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen were also involved.It had a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities.Who funded the campaign: Vote Leave raised 2.78m.Its largest supporter was businessman Patrick Barbour, who gave 500,000.Former Conservative Party treasurer Peter Cruddas gave a 350,000 donation and construction mogul Terence Adams handed over 300,000.Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to leave: UKIP leader Nigel Farage was not part of Vote Leave.His party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.
Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?:::::Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when her party was left with 318 MPs and Labour had 262.Here's what we know so far.The list will be updated as new appointments are made.Prime Minister - Theresa May Image copyright Reuters Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for.The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.She had previously been home secretary for six years.Theresa May: Full profile Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance First Secretary of State - Damian Green Image copyright AFP Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state.As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command.It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Image copyright PA Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Image copyright Reuters Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye.During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis Image copyright Reuters David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary".The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister.Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon Image copyright AFP Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox Image copyright AFP Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade.He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.He told reporters he was "delighted" to keep the job he has held since July last year."It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."Justice Secretary - David Lidington Image copyright PA Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992.He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Leader of the House of Lords -

the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Image copyright Reuters Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life".But in a tweet he admitted there were "challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better".Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.Education Secretary - Justine Greening Image copyright PA Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities.She is part of the most diverse Parliament yet as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.She has been MP for Putney since 2005.Transport Secretary -

David Gauke Image copyright AFP A sideways step for David Gauke, with the PM appointing him as the new work and pensions secretary.He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role.Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005.He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected.Communities Secretary -

David Mundell Image copyright Reuters David Mundell will continue as secretary of state for Scotland.He is one of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be in Parliament after this snap election.Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet secretary.Conservative Party chairman and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - Patrick McLoughlin Image copyright AFP Patrick McLoughlin remains as the Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.He left his role as transport secretary in 2016 but has been an MP since 1986.The former miner also served as chief whip after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.Business and Energy Secretary - Greg Clark Image copyright PA Greg Clark keeps his job as secretary of state of business, energy and industrial strategy.The role, when it was created by Labour's Gordon Brown, was originally called the Department of Energy and Climate Change.Last year, it was merged into the new department and lost the "climate change" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.International Development Secretary - Priti Patel Image copyright Reuters Priti Patel remains as International Development Secretary.She was promoted from her role as employment minister, which she held for a year, in 2016.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of "divide and rule politics" during the referendum campaign for claiming that "biased" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.In other appointments:
