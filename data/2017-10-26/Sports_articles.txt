Nikita Kucherov, Steven Stamkos - who else? - power Lightning past Red Wings:::::TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov became the seventh set of teammates in NHL history to start the season with point streaks of at least 11 games, and the surging Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Detroit Red Wings 3-2 on Thursday night.Kucherov got his 12th goal in the first period, and setup Stamkos' power-play goal from the low left circle that put Tampa Bay (9-1-1) up 2-1 at 6:22 of the third.The duo also tied Martin St. Louis' team season-opening point streak set in 2009-10.Tampa Bay's Andrei Vasilevskiy made 29 saves in his 100th NHL game and 50th win (50-33-8).Frans Nielsen had two goals and Jimmy Howard stopped 35 shots for the Red Wings (4-6-1), who have lost six straight (0-5-1).Detroit has lost nine straight games against Tampa Bay.After Brayden Point made it 3-1 at 17:04, Nielsen cut the deficit to one on the power play with 1:49 to play.Nielsen opened the scoring during a short-handed 2-on-1 at 14:18 of the first.The Red Wings have just four first-period goals this season.Two minutes after Nielsen's goal, Kucherov tied it at 1 from the top of the right circle during a power play setup by a too many men on the ice penalty on Detroit.Tampa Bay's top-ranked NHL power play went 2 for 6.Detroit converted one of five chances.Vasilevskiy made strong saves on Henrik Zetterberg in both the first and second periods, while Howard had a nifty glove save on Kucherov's shot midway through the second.NOTES: Vasilevskiy is 5-0-0 against the Red Wings.Detroit LW Andreas Athanasiou, who agreed to a one-year contract Oct. 20, was in the lineup for the first time.Tampa Bay C Cedric Paquette (upper-body injury) missed his fourth straight game and is expected to be out two more weeks.UP NEXT Red Wings: Complete a three-game trip Saturday night at Florida.Lightning: Host Anaheim on Saturday night.
Game 2 of World Series gives fan an Instant Classic:::::LOS ANGELES (AP) George Springer screamed with joy as he circled the bases after hitting a two-run homer in the 11th inning.Would it be enough?Was this the final plot twist on one of the wildest nights in postseason history?Yes, it was barely and the Houston Astros won a World Series game for the first time in their 56 seasons.Charlie Culberson hit a two-out homer in the bottom half off Chris Devenski, who then struck out Yasiel Puig in a tense, nine-pitch at-bat for the win.The Astros outlasted the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-6 in a Hollywood thriller Wednesday to tie the Series at one game apiece.Wasnt that the best game ever!?Alex Bregman proclaimed to no one in particular in the Astros clubhouse.On a night of dramatic swings and a World Series-record eight home runs, Marwin Gonzalez stunned the Dodger Stadium crowd with a solo shot off dominant Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen on an 0-2 pitch in the ninth that made it 3-all.Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa hit consecutive home runs against Josh Fields in the 10th to build a 5-3 Astros lead, with Correa flipping his bat to celebrate.But there was more.Much, much more.This is an instant classic and to be part of it is pretty special, Astros starter Justin Verlander said.Puig homered off Ken Giles starting the bottom of the 10th and Enrique Hernandez knotted the score 5-5 with a two-out RBI single .Devenski entered and, with Hernandez at second, made a wild pickoff throw that appeared headed toward left-center field before it struck second base umpire Laz Diaz.An incredulous Hernandez put both hands on his helmet, unable to advance, and was stranded when Chris Taylor flied out.We were pretty unlucky at the beginning of the game when Taylor dove in center field and (the ball) hit him in the face or head, Astros manager A.J.Hinch said.I felt like the baseball gods were returning the favor, by having an umpire standing in the way there.Cameron Maybin, who had entered in the 10th, singled leading off the 11th against losing pitcher Brandon McCarthy, a surprise addition to the Dodgers World Series roster who was pitching for the first time since Oct. 1.Maybin stole second and Springer hit a drive to right-center for a 7-5 lead, just the third 11th-inning home run in the Series after shots by Kirby Puckett in 1991 and David Freese in 2011.Springer, an All-Star leadoff man, broke out of his slump with three hits and a walk after going 0 for 4 with four strikeouts in the Series opener Tuesday.His decisive drive made the Astros the first team to hit three extra-inning home runs in a postseason game.Devenski retired Corey Seager and Justin Turner on lineouts in the bottom half.Puig checked his swing on a 2-2 pitch the Astros jumped when first base umpire Gerry Davis signaled no swing and Puig fouled off two more.Devenski threw his fifth straight changeup, and Puig swung over it as the Astros ran onto the field to celebrate after finally closing out a back-and-forth game that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes.It was an emotional roller coaster, said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who removed starter Rich Hill after he threw only 60 pitches in four solid innings and struck out seven.After another steamy night in a Santa Ana heat wave, the series shifts to Texas and resumes Friday night at Houstons Minute Maid Park, where the retractable roof has not been open for a game since June 9.Lance McCullers Jr. starts for the Astros and Yu Darvish for the Dodgers, who acquired him from Texas at the July 31 trade deadline.Houston is 2-5 on the road in the postseason but 6-0 at home, where the Astros have outscored the Red Sox and Yankees by a combined 31-7.We didnt expect these guys to lay down.Its a very good ballclub over there, Roberts said.Well be ready to go.Before Gonzalezs home run, the Dodgers had an 85 percent chance of winning, according to Fangraphs.After Correas long ball, the Astros were a 93 percent favorite.Verlander, wearing an undershirt, entered the dugout at one point and screamed at his teammates that the game was not over.All of a sudden, two runs seemed like it was the Grand Canyon, he said.I was just trying to remind these guys two runs is nothing.Bregmans RBI single in the third gave Houston its first lead of the Series, a hit that might have turned into a three-run, inside-the-park homer had the ball not caromed off the bill of Taylors cap directly to left fielder Joc Pederson.Los Angeles had just two hits through seven innings but led 3-1 behind Pedersons fifth-inning solo homer and Seagers tiebreaking, two-run drive in the sixth against Verlander.It was Pedersons first home run since July 26.Jansen entered with a 3-1 lead trying for his first six-out save in a year after Bregman doubled leading off the eighth against Brandon Morrow, a ball that ticked off the glove of a diving Puig in the right-field corner.Furious that he didnt make what would have been a sensational catch, Puig slammed his mitt to the ground.Correas RBI single off Jansen ended a record 28-inning postseason scoreless streak by the Dodgers bullpen.Gonzalez, choking up on the bat, seemed an unlikely candidate for a tying homer.He had not driven in a run in his 45 plate appearances since Houstons playoff opener, and the blown save was just the second for Jansen this year.The Dodgers had been 98-0 in 2017 when leading after eight innings, including the postseason.I didnt make my pitch, Jansen said.You cant beat yourself up about that.As the slanting sun illuminated the green hills of Elysian Park behind center field and the ochre-tinted San Gabriel Mountains beyond, retired Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully took the mound for the ceremonial first pitch .The 89-year-old, who left the booth in 2016 after his 67th season, charmed the crowd when he began somewhere up in heaven, Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Gil Hodges are laughing their heads off at his presence on the mound.He feigned an arm injury and turned the ritual over to Fernando Valenzuela, who helped the Dodgers win their 1981 title.The game-time temperature was 93 degrees down 10 degrees from the opener.Celebrities in the sellout crowd of 54,293 included golfers Tiger Woods and Fred Couples, and former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.Houston improved to 10-0 in nine starts and one relief appearance by Verlander, the 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner obtained in a trade from Detroit at the Aug. 31 deadline to be eligible for the Astros postseason roster.Afterward, players were exhausted.When that last out is made, you finally breathe, Springer said.Thats an emotional high emotional high to low to high again.But thats why we play the game.And thats the craziest game that Ive ever played in.And its only Game 2.
Prescott's Cowboys, Cousins' Redskins now in wild-card hunt:::::LANDOVER, Md.(AP) -- Carson Wentz's Philadelphia Eagles are the class of the NFC East, while Eli Manning's New York Giants are looking toward 2018.That puts Dak Prescott's Dallas Cowboys and Kirk Cousins' Washington Redskins thick in the middle of the fight for a wild-card spot.Prescott at 24 in his second NFL season and Cousins at 29 in his third full season as a starter face off Sunday in the first of their two matchups this season, which could go a long way to determining whose team makes the playoffs."We're 1-0 in our division now, and it's important to go get another win," Prescott said."That's our only focus."The Cowboys and Redskins are each 3-3 as their quarterbacks continue to evolve in different ways.Cousins continues to throw for 300 yards a game, as Prescott develops the various facets of his game."The most impressive thing about Dak last year was he looked like a 10-year veteran with the poise that he has and the command of the offense -- very similar to what I see in Carson Wentz," Redskins coach Jay Gruden said."They're very similar-type quarterbacks: very effective, very smart."Wentz has already beaten the Redskins twice this season after Prescott defeated them twice as a rookie.Cousins is 0-4 in meaningful games against Dallas.Almost halfway through this season, Cousins has 1,637 yards passing and 12 touchdowns, but plenty left to prove on the franchise tag for a second consecutive time.However, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett is a believer."He can make any throw on the field," Garrett said."He really cuts the ball loose and allows them to not only move the ball efficiently but also make a lot of big plays, and that's what he's been able to do.It's a different supporting cast around him since he's been the starter, but he's certainly been a constant for them."Meanwhile, Prescott is adjusting to opponents' adjustments and running more as defenses anticipate his plan throwing the ball."I think he definitely became a better player," said running back Ezekiel Elliott, who's eligible to play at least one more game as the case over his suspension is fought over in court."Obviously he's a threat as a runner and he's done an awesome job this year just using his feet to extend plays and make big plays downfield."Some things to watch as the Cowboys visit the Redskins: 43 View Gallery Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports | Matthew Emmons ONE MORE FOR ELLIOTT: With another hearing scheduled for Monday and a ruling possible next week, Elliott could be playing his final game of the season -- or he could be eligible for every game the rest of the way."I take it week by week," Elliott said."Every week I prepare like I'm going to play."Elliott hasn't missed a game yet after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him in August following a yearlong investigation that he had multiple physical confrontations in the summer of 2016 with Tiffany Thompson, his girlfriend at the time.The 22-year-old has 540 yards and four touchdowns."To me, Zeke's handled it really, really well," Garrett said."Obviously there's a lot of things going on off the field with him, but you wouldn't know it if you were around him each and every day."BRYANT VS. NORMAN: Assuming Josh Norman returns from a broken rib that sidelined him the past two games, it'll re-ignite the rivalry between the Washington cornerback and Dallas receiver Dez Bryant.Norman has had his on- and off-field battles with other receivers such as the Giants' Odell Beckham Jr., and he and Bryant get fired up to face each other."They're both highly competitive guys, and they both want to win," Gruden said."I have no problem with that.If it becomes a penalty or get thrown out of the game, obviously we have an issue."FULL STRENGTH: Dallas' defense had everyone it figured to be counting on for the first time last week against the 49ers.The Cowboys recovered two fumbles (special teams had a third) to end a three-game streak without a takeaway and had five sacks.All-Pro linebacker Sean Lee missed the previous two games, and the Cowboys lost both at home despite scoring at least 30 points each time.Lee and Anthony Hitchens, who missed the first four games because of a preseason knee injury, have boosted the linebacking group, and defensive end David Irving has three sacks in two games following a four-game suspension.INJURED REDSKINS: Gruden cut a day of practice off his team's usual schedule because of all the injuries that built up, most notably along the offensive line.Left tackle Trent Williams, center Spencer Long and right guard Brandon Scherff all have knee injuries and right tackle Morgan Moses has sprains in both ankles.On defense, linebackers Zach Brown (back) and Preston Smith (groin) are the most banged up, but not the only ones as Washington's depth is being tested.NO MR.RELIABLE: The Cowboys' Dan Bailey, the most accurate in NFL history among kickers with at least 100 attempts, will miss the first game of his seven-year career with a groin injury sustained during the game in San Francisco.Mike Nugent, a 12-year veteran, will replace him for at least a game and probably more.Bailey's career success rate of 89.9 percent is about 9 percentage points better than Nugent.The discrepancy is much larger from 50 yards and beyond -- 69 percent for Bailey, 39 for Nugent.
Astros - Dodgers set for Game 3 as World Series shifts to Houston:::::HOUSTON -- On numerous occasions, Houston Astros manager A.J.Hinch has referenced his psychology degree from Stanford and the role it plays in fulfilling duties in the dugout and the clubhouse, tasks that run the gamut from game strategy to manipulating the psyches of his players.While the former requirement comes with the glare of a white-hot spotlight, the latter is no less taxing, particularly on a talented team with a weakness as glaring as the Astros' bullpen.Thanks to their madcap 7-6, 11-inning victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday night, the Astros evened the series at a game apiece despite another unsightly showing by their bullpen, with closer Ken Giles nearly fitted with goat horns.Giles squandered a stunning late-inning power display by the Astros, who rode solo homers from Marwin Gonzalez, Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa to a 5-3 lead going into the bottom of the 10th inning.Giles, who breezed through a perfect ninth inning, subsequently allowed two runs in the 10th and needed scuffling right-hander Chris Devenski to bail out both him and the club."Roles are softly defined, but I think Ken Giles is going to get another save in this series," said Hinch, who used the word "fabrication" to denounce a published report that he was involved in an altercation at a Pasadena, Calif., hotel bar following Game 1."I think he's going to get some really big outs.I think when the crowd is standing in this ballpark over the next couple of games, if we can have the lead and he's the right matchup, he's going to get the last out."He's done it awfully well this year, and again I reiterate, just because somebody has a bad day at work does not mean they need to be condemned and sent away."Right-hander Lance McCullers Jr. will get the start for the Astros when they host Game 3 on Friday night at Minute Maid Park.Hinch doesn't have many obvious options for high-leverage situations should McCullers fatigue in the middle innings.Giles (0-1, 8.22 ERA over six games) has struggled mightily this postseason, allowing opponents to post a 1.015 on-base-plus-slugging percentage.But Devenski (1-0, 8.44 ERA), an All-Star who staggered throughout the second half, hasn't fared any better.Opponents have produced a .905 OPS against Devenski over seven games this postseason.Right-handers Will Harris and Joe Musgrove have filled high-leverage roles during the season, but in the playoffs, Musgrove has pitched to a 7.36 ERA while Harris' allowed OPS stands at .905.That Hinch stuck with Devenski even after Devenski allowed a solo homer to Charlie Culberson in the 11th inning Wednesday reflects his unyielding belief in his players, through performances good and bad."It definitely meant a lot for me," Devenski said."I'm glad he's had my back like that throughout the whole year, through my ups and downs.It was very special, and I felt like I built up some momentum, and we'll keep it rolling."Right-hander Yu Darvish will start for the Dodgers in Game 3, introducing an element thus far unique to this World Series: familiarity.Darvish is 5-5 with a 3.44 ERA over 14 career starts against the Astros, all made while with the Texas Rangers.He logged 89 innings with 118 strikeouts and a 1.067 WHIP with Texas against Houston before his non-waiver deadline trade to the Dodgers.He made two starts vs. the Astros 10 days apart in June, surrendering four runs on eight hits and four walks with 12 strikeouts over 12 innings.Darvish split those decisions, with Texas winning 6-1 in Houston."I feel like it doesn't really matter," Darvish said Thursday of his history at Minute Maid Park."It's better to know that I've pitched here before.But tomorrow's game, it could be totally different from my previous outings here.Maybe it will give me a little bit of an advantage, but it really doesn't matter."How deep Darvish pitches into Game 3 could depend on a number of factors, with Dodgers manager Dave Roberts facing criticism for his reliance on the bullpen.In Game 2, Roberts pulled starter Rich Hill after the left-hander worked four effective innings.Eight Dodgers relievers later, Houston completed a stunning rally that not only shifted the series locale, but also series momentum."I just feel that in a seven-game series you're going to have to lean on everyone," Roberts said."But extending your 'pen to an extreme amount right now in Game 2 or Game 1, understanding you still have to win four games in a seven-game series, you still have to be very careful with that."Roberts plans to start Joc Pederson in left field again Friday.Normally a center fielder, Pederson started in left Wednesday even though he has made only two career regular-season starts at the position.
Whacky World Series: Homers fly, Dodgers-Astros even at 1:::::HOUSTON (AP) -- As a couple of Astros loosened up in the outfield, the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park made its slow crawl Thursday, turning the bright sun into shade.That might be the only way to keep balls from flying completely out of the yard at this power-packed World Series.A day after Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Houston combined with the Los Angeles Dodgers for a Series-record eight home runs in the Astros' 7-6, 11-inning win, the baseball world was still marveling over the moonshots.So were the players who launched them."Actually, when I was getting off the plane with (Carlos) Beltran, I was talking to him, and I was like, what was going through your head when Altuve hit the homer?He was like, `We were going crazy in the dugout,'" Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said."Then I was like what about when Correa hit his, what about when they hit theirs?And they hit theirs," he said, laughing."We were just going back and forth."After a Major League Baseball season that set a record for the most home runs, the World Series is off to a flying start.Already a whopping 11 homers -- six by Los Angeles -- as the sides split the first two games at Dodger Stadium.At this rate, they'd shatter the Series record of 21 in 2002 when Barry Bonds and Giants lost to the Angels in seven games.The curveballing Lance McCullers Jr. starts Game 3 for Houston on Friday night against Yu Darvish, and the roof will be shut -- exactly how the Astros like it.The highest-scoring team in the majors is 6-0 at its thumping home this postseason.The top hasn't been open since early June in order to block out the Texas summer heat.Rain is in the forecast, and the final call on whether to close the roof rests with MLB.That decision is based in part on what the home team normally does during the year."We want it closed.We've got to have it closed," reliever Chris Devenski said."I feel the electricity when it's closed is so much better.And we love playing here.We have so much excitement being here and the electricity and the vibe.And I feel like we feed off of it."The Astros had plenty of energy Wednesday night, too.Marwin Gonzalez hit a tying homer off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen in the ninth inning, Altuve and Correa connected back-to-back in the 10th and George Springer hit a two-run shot in the 11th.There were five home runs solely in extra innings."Yeah, last night hurt," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.After a few Astros casually limbered up, Los Angeles held a full, relaxed workout.With the roof closed and the park empty, sounds echoed from every corner of the park.Whistles, hoots, singing, the crack of the bat.It was all loud."Hey!"Yasiel Puig shouted, clanking a drive off a distant metal railing in left-center.In the outfield, a couple players bantered with stadium workers high above.Jansen whooped it up, playing third base and trying to make behind-the-back stabs at practice grounders.Jansen was having fun, less than 24 hours after Gonzalez tagged him.The Dodgers had been 98-0 this year when leading after eight innings, the lone club in the majors without a loss in those situations.Roberts said he checked with Jansen after the game."I just wanted to -- it doesn't happen very often that a game is blown when he takes the baseball.So I just wanted to come back, circle back with him, make sure he was in a good state of mind, which he was," Roberts said."And it's baseball, things like that happen.But he was obviously disappointed but prepared for tomorrow," he said.
Packers offense will use bye week to get back on track:::::GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Someone named "Aaron" is still making big plays out of the Green Bay Packers backfield.With Aaron Rodgers out indefinitely with a right collarbone injury, the hard running of rookie Aaron Jones will have to do for now in Green Bay.Jolted by the loss of the two-time NFL MVP, the Packers are in transition.A bye this week gives coach Mike McCarthy more time to find ways to get the team back on track under backup Brett Hundley .A once high-octane offense hit a speed bump last week in Hundley's first NFL start against the New Orleans Saints .Forget about thinking Super Bowl, the Packers must regroup quickly just to keep pace in the NFC North."Is the game plan as big as it was the week before?Absolutely not," McCarthy said."We need to be more creative and make sure we're giving (Hundley) the things that he needs."Packers Coverage This might be McCarthy's biggest challenge since the Packers last had to play an extended period without Rodgers, a seven-game stretch in 2013 when the quarterback had a left collarbone injury.Back then, they were 5-2 when Rodgers went down during a Monday night game in a loss to the Bears, what would be the start of a five-game winless streak.They recovered and still made the playoffs in part after getting consistent production from the running game behind then-rookie starter Eddie Lacy.Lacy is now in Seattle, but McCarthy may have found a viable alternative in Jones.The fifth-round draft pick had 131 yards on 17 carries against the Saints, and the Packers ran for 181 yards overall.And to think Jones was inactive for the season opener against the Seahawks ."Everything's happening fast," Jones said about his emergence."I don't know another way to explain it, I'm definitely enjoying it."Jones shot up the depth chart after then-starter Ty Montgomery (ribs) and second-stringer Jamaal Williams (knee) were knocked out of a 35-14 win over the Chicago Bears last month.Montgomery hasn't been productive since his return playing with a flak jacket, while Williams is healthy again.McCarthy turned to Jones to start against the Saints, and the 5-foot-9 slasher set an early tone with a 46-yard touchdown run."You always want to be able to run the ball, that makes it easier (for) any quarterback," Jones said after the game.Except the Packers weren't able to capitalize by taking more deep shots or hitting play-action passes after establishing the run with Jones.The plan in part with Hundley was to take advantage of his ability to play outside the pocket.Hundley might be in his third year in the system, but the Vikings game, when he replaced the injured Rodgers, was really the first time he had meaningful snaps in the regular season.Against the Saints, Hundley ran for a 14-yard touchdown, and finished 12 of 25 for 87 yards and an interception."It's tough.It's all about building chemistry with your quarterback when you've only had a week to do that," receiver Randall Cobb said."It's going to be important for us to continue to build confidence in him to throw it to us in different situations."Part of the emphasis for Hundley moving forward will be getting him more comfortable in the pocket."You look at how many dropback passes he had, there's where the majority of our time clock things were, we weren't very clean there," McCarthy said."The action passing game, the footwork was perfect and we had protection issues on two of them."You have to take in all the information.You can't let him feel the weight of the world, it's part of playing the position, I get that," McCarthy added."Just stay in tune with what he's being asked to do."The job might be easier if the Packers were able to get the ball more to their collection of playmaking receiving threats.Jordy Nelson is tied for the NFL lead with six receiving touchdowns, while Davante Adams is tied for second at five.Cobb is a threat to turn short passes into long gains.Tight end Martellus Bennett has had several drops this season but still provides an athletic, 6-foot-7 target over the middle.Together, the four players combined for just seven catches for 57 yards with no scores against the Saints."Jordy Nelson, Davante, Marty, Randall Cobb, those guys have got to touch the ball.We didn't get that done," McCarthy said."Now, how many times have we run for 180-plus yards?Not very often.You're supposed to win those games.So, we have a lot to build off of."
Ender Inciarte, R.A. Dickey named NL Gold Glove finalists:::::Ender Inciarte and R.A. Dickey are on the short list to receive defensive hardware this offseason.The two Atlanta Braves veterans were named National League Gold Glove finalists at their respective positions on Thursday afternoon.Inciarte, 26, is looking to repeat as the NL's representative in center field while Dickey, the 43-year-old knuckleballer, is looking for his first Gold Glove since his 2013 campaign in the American League with the Toronto Blue Jays.For the fourth consecutive season, Inciarte graded out as one of the premier defensive outfielders in baseball.Since his first full season with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2014, the Venezuelan product has logged 69 defensive runs saved, trailing only Kevin Kiermaier (Rays), Jason Hayward (Braves, Cardinals, Cubs) and Mookie Betts (Red Sox) among all MLB outfielders.Per Statcast data, only Twins standout Byron Buxton logged more outs above average in the outfield last season.Ender Inciarte's first at-bat after receiving his Gold Glove?A home run, naturally.Way to go, Ender!#ChopOn pic.twitter.com/1ahRcNVwGK FOX Sports: Braves (@FOXSportsBraves) May 1, 2017 Inciarte also made his first All-Star appearance and became just the fourthplayer in Atlanta Braveshistory to reach the 200-hit plateau in a single season.Cincinnati speedster Billy Hamilton and Washington's Michael Taylor were tabbed as the NL's other two finalists in center field.Meanwhile, Dickey led all Braves players in defensive runs saved with seven in what could be his final campaign in a long, successful career the 2012 National League Cy Young Award winner finished only behind Tyler Chatwood (Rockies) and Mike Leake (Giants) in that defensive category.The other two finalists among NL pitchers: Arizona's Zack Greinke and Milwaukee's Zach Davies.
Boilermakers return numbers, size, experience -- and a desire to go deeper into March:::::Matt Painter spent August getting a sneak peek at his new team.No, Purdue hasn't changed much.The Boilermakers have four starters and four seniors returning and still have enough size and versatility to defend their Big Ten title -- even without Caleb Swanigan.They also have perhaps the most valuable commodity in college basketball: veterans who know what it takes to succeed and the will to finish their mission."People always talk about experience, but I think what's more important than that is the experience of having success together," Painter said."I think those guys are going to have to have those qualities for us to be successful."Make no mistake, losing Swanigan hurts .Last season, the 6-foot-9, 250-pound forward averaged 18.5 points and 12.5 rebounds per game and led the nation with 28 double-doubles.He was a first-team All-American and finished third in the national player of the year voting.But without him, Purdue could have a better overall team than the one that got blown out by Kansas in the NCAA Tournament regional semifinals.This year, the goal is to go all the way to the Final Four.And it all starts with 6-8 forward Vincent Edwards, who put his NBA dreams on hold to give it one more shot.The senior does a little bit of everything, as he demonstrated at the World University Games (19.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists).He's the only active player in the nation withmore than 1,000 points, 500 rebounds and 300 assists.The Boilermakers also bring back three starting guards -- Dakota Mathias, P.J.Thompson and Carsen Edwards.Mathias is a 3-point specialist and all-conference defensive player.Thompson, a senior like Mathias, has the two best single-season assist-to-turnover ratios in school history.And Carsen Edwards, no relation to Vincent, is expected to improve his scoring (10.3 points) after being the only Big Ten freshman to record at least 45 3s and 35 steals in 2016-17."Sometimes, he is so aggressive that it leads to tough shots," Painter said after Edwards went 11 of 16 from the field and scored 30 points in Saturday's open scrimmage."Today, he did a great job of playing within himself.That led to the good shots."The Boilermakers also have size.Isaac Haas,a 7-foot-2 senior center, was second in scoring last season (12.6 points) despite playing only 19.5 minutes per game.This year, he's expected to become a full-time starter.Will it all be enough to win another title or advance deeper in the postseason?"It's going to be a challenge," Painter said."When you have those types of challenges, you know, you would much rather have experienced players, especially talented ones like we have."Here are some other things to watch this season: 90 View Gallery USA TODAY Sports | Denny Medley DE-FENSE:When Painter overhauled the program following a second straight losing season in 2013-14, he rebuilt on the core principles of rebounding and playing defense.Though his old-school approach seems somewhat antithetical to today's trendy small-ball style, Painter is sticking to his plan."I think our ability to shoot is probably the No.1 thing that jumps out," he said."But we're going to have to be able to compete on both ends if we're going to be in a good position at the end of February."GOING BIG:The Boilermakers might not have a dominant inside player like A.J.Hammons or Swanigan this season.But they could still have one of the nation's biggest front lines.Along with Haas, Painter has 7-3 Matt Haarms, a redshirt freshman from The Netherlands, and 6-10 Jacquil Taylor, a junior who has been battling a chronic foot injury.Look for Haarms to become a major factor off the bench."Going against Caleb Swanigan and Isaac last year in practice really helped him," Painter said."He has gotten stronger and better."VERSATILE GUARDS:Purdue isn't just deep at guard.It's versatile, too.The three starters each made at least 47 3s last season and showed they were more than just shooters.Thompson and Edwards shared the team lead for steals (36), while Mathias had a team-high 133 assists and averaged 3.9 rebounds.ON SCHEDULE:Purdue should have a pretty good notion of where it stands in early December thanks to a rugged early schedule.The Boilermakers visit Marquette on Nov. 14, then head to The Bahamas, where they'll play Tennessee before potential matchups with Villanova and perhaps Arizona.When they return, they host Louisville on Nov. 28 and visit Maryland on Dec. 1.Purdue opens the season Nov. 10 against SIU-Edwardsville.
Chiefs and Broncos both will try to get their mojo back Monday:::::KANSAS CITY, Mo.-- The Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos appeared to be the class of the AFC West, and maybe the entire league, just a couple of weeks ago after going a combined 8-1 to start the season.They're a combined 0-4 since then.The Chiefs were humbled by Pittsburgh before dropping a heartbreaker in Oakland, which snapped their 12-game division winning streak.And the Broncos were embarrassed by the Giants before getting shut out last week by the Chargers -- the first time they've been blanked in 25 years.Now, what looked as if it would be a showdown for league supremacy Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium has turned into a game matching two teams desperate to get back on track."Guys are frustrated.We know we can play better and we want to play better," Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian said."Guys are a little frustrated.That's a good thing, I think.Me specifically, I have to play better.I know that.I think this week, more than ever, is a really big week for us."That's because the division race is wide open nearing the midway point.The Chiefs (5-2) are still on top, while the Broncos (3-3) are just a half-game ahead of the Chargers and Raiders."Every week the games just get bigger and bigger," Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib said."Until you win the Super Bowl, games just get bigger and bigger.This is our next game, and it's a huge game for us."It's just as huge for the Chiefs, whose five straight wins sent them soaring to the top of just about every NFL power ranking.But their high-powered offense was effectively shut down by Pittsburgh, and their suspect defense was exposed in their last-second loss to the Raiders.Still, veteran quarterback Alex Smith is playing at a high level.Running back Kareem Hunt has gone over 100 yards from scrimmage in an NFL-record seven straight games to begin his career.Tyreek Hill has not lost an ounce of the speed that has made him one of the league's most dynamic players.Defensively, Justin Houston and Marcus Peters are still making life miserable for quarterbacks."A lot of fingers can be pointed and all of that, but the reality is you're 5-2 and a pretty good football team," Chiefs coach Andy Reid said."There's always a little positive within the negative.It's hard right now, because you went 5-0 and then you have two losses and it seems like the whole world is falling apart.But in reality, that's not the case."It might be if the Chiefs lost to the Broncos at Arrowhead Stadium.As the bitter rivals prepare for a prime-time matchup, here are some things to know: 104 View Gallery Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports | Aaron Doster JAMAAL IS BACK:The Chiefs' career rushing leader, Jamaal Charles, will return to Kansas City for the first time as a member of the Broncos.He was released last offseason when the Chiefs needed to save salary cap space and signed a one-year deal with Denver."It'll be great to be back where I started at," he said."It'll be great to come back, but hearing the crowd will be different for me."ERRORLESS ALEX: One reason Smith is having an MVP-caliber season has been his mistake-free play.He has thrown 15 touchdown passes without an interception, and needs five more TD tosses to match the league record for most without a pick to start a season set by Peyton Manning in 2013."To be honest, there's no time to reflect," he said."You're just coming off a loss and you're in the middle of the season and all that stuff means nothing at this point.That stuff's for after the season.Two in a row, we've got a long time to think about this and hopefully get back healthy."SPEAKING OF QBS:Broncos coach Vance Joseph insisted Siemian remains his starter, despite a series of poor performances.But with Brock Osweiler up to speed and Paxton Lynch returning to practice for the first time since late August, when he sprained his shoulder, the lease on Siemian could be short."He's still working through the injury," Joseph said of Lynch."Brock's looked fine.Brock's very engaged, very smart and a great leader.He looked fine in practice."GETTING HEALTHY: The Chiefs could be buoyed by the return of three starters this week.Right guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif (knee injury), center Mitch Morse (foot injury) and cornerback Steven Nelson (concussion) were all at practice this week and could be on the field Monday night.STRENGTH VS.STRENGTH: Might as well call it weakness vs weakness, too.The Chiefs have the NFL's top rushing offense while the Broncos have the league's second-best run defense, and Kansas City has the No.3 overall offense while the Denver defense is ranked No.1.On the flip side, the Broncos have had trouble moving the ball and the Chiefs' defense is ranked 29th in the league."We plan on taking care of the run game because that's what their team thrives off of," Broncos linebacker Shane Ray said."It's a division rivalry, so it's going to come down to who wins the fourth quarter."
Game 2 of World Series gives fan an all-time ending:::::LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Springer screamed with joy as he circled the bases after hitting a two-run homer in the 11th inning.Would it be enough?Was this the final plot twist on one of the wildest nights in postseason history?Yes, it was -- barely -- and the Houston Astros won a World Series game for the first time in their 56 seasons.Charlie Culberson hit a two-out homer in the bottom half off Chris Devenski, who then struck out Yasiel Puig in a tense, nine-pitch at-bat for the win.The Astros outlasted the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-6 in a Hollywood thriller Wednesday to tie the Series at one game apiece."Wasn't that the best game ever!?"Alex Bregman proclaimed to no one in particular in the Astros clubhouse.On a night of dramatic swings and a World Series-record eight home runs, Marwin Gonzalez stunned the Dodger Stadium crowd with a solo shot off dominant Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen on an 0-2 pitch in the ninth that made it 3-all.Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa hit consecutive home runs against Josh Fields in the 10th to build a 5-3 Astros lead, with Correa flipping his bat to celebrate.But there was more.Much, much more."This is an instant classic and to be part of it is pretty special," Astros starter Justin Verlander said.Puig homered off Ken Giles starting the bottom of the 10th and Enrique Hernandez knotted the score 5-5 with a two-out RBI single .Devenski entered and, with Hernandez at second, made a wild pickoff throw that appeared headed toward left-center field before it struck second base umpire Laz Diaz.An incredulous Hernandez put both hands on his helmet, unable to advance, and was stranded when Chris Taylor flied out."We were pretty unlucky at the beginning of the game when Taylor dove in center field and (the ball) hit him in the face or head," Astros manager A.J.Hinch said."I felt like the baseball gods were returning the favor, by having an umpire standing in the way there."Cameron Maybin, who had entered in the 10th, singled leading off the 11th against losing pitcher Brandon McCarthy, a surprise addition to the Dodgers' World Series roster who was pitching for the first time since Oct. 1.Maybin stole second and Springer hit a drive to right-center for a 7-5 lead, just the third 11th-inning home run in the Series after shots by Kirby Puckett in 1991 and David Freese in 2011.Springer, an All-Star leadoff man, broke out of his slump with three hits and a walk after going 0 for 4 with four strikeouts in the Series opener Tuesday.His decisive drive made the Astros the first team to hit three extra-inning home runs in a postseason game.Devenski retired Corey Seager and Justin Turner on lineouts in the bottom half.Puig checked his swing on a 2-2 pitch -- the Astros jumped when first base umpire Gerry Davis signaled no swing -- and Puig fouled off two more.Devenski threw his fifth straight changeup, and Puig swung over it as the Astros ran onto the field to celebrate after finally closing out a back-and-forth game that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes."It was an emotional roller coaster," said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who removed starter Rich Hill after he threw only 60 pitches in four solid innings and struck out seven.After another steamy night in a Santa Ana heat wave, the series shifts to Texas and resumes Friday night at Houston's Minute Maid Park, where the retractable roof has not been open for a game since June 9.Lance McCullers Jr. starts for the Astros and Yu Darvish for the Dodgers, who acquired him from Texas at the July 31 trade deadline.Houston is 2-5 on the road in the postseason but 6-0 at home, where the Astros have outscored the Red Sox and Yankees by a combined 31-7."We didn't expect these guys to lay down.It's a very good ballclub over there," Roberts said."We'll be ready to go."Before Gonzalez's home run, the Dodgers had an 85 percent chance of winning, according to Fangraphs.After Correa's long ball, the Astros were a 93 percent favorite.Verlander, wearing an undershirt, entered the dugout at one point and screamed at his teammates that the game was not over."All of a sudden, two runs seemed like it was the Grand Canyon," he said."I was just trying to remind these guys two runs is nothing."Bregman's RBI single in the third gave Houston its first lead of the Series, a hit that might have turned into a three-run, inside-the-park homer had the ball not caromed off the bill of Taylor's cap directly to left fielder Joc Pederson.Los Angeles had just two hits through seven innings but led 3-1 behind Pederson's fifth-inning solo homer and Seager's tiebreaking, two-run drive in the sixth against Verlander.It was Pederson's first home run since July 26.Jansen entered with a 3-1 lead trying for his first six-out save in a year after Bregman doubled leading off the eighth against Brandon Morrow, a ball that ticked off the glove of a diving Puig in the right-field corner.Furious that he didn't make what would have been a sensational catch, Puig slammed his mitt to the ground.Correa's RBI single off Jansen ended a record 28-inning postseason scoreless streak by the Dodgers' bullpen.Gonzalez, choking up on the bat, seemed an unlikely candidate for a tying homer.He had not driven in a run in his 45 plate appearances since Houston's playoff opener, and the blown save was just the second for Jansen this year.The Dodgers had been 98-0 in 2017 when leading after eight innings, including the postseason."I didn't make my pitch," Jansen said."You can't beat yourself up about that."As the slanting sun illuminated the green hills of Elysian Park behind center field and the ochre-tinted San Gabriel Mountains beyond, retired Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully took the mound for the ceremonial first pitch .The 89-year-old, who left the booth in 2016 after his 67th season, charmed the crowd when he began "somewhere up in heaven, Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Gil Hodges are laughing their heads off" at his presence on the mound.He feigned an arm injury and turned the ritual over to Fernando Valenzuela, who helped the Dodgers win their 1981 title.The game-time temperature was 93 degrees -- down 10 degrees from the opener.Celebrities in the sellout crowd of 54,293 included golfers Tiger Woods and Fred Couples, and former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.Houston improved to 10-0 in nine starts and one relief appearance by Verlander, the 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner obtained in a trade from Detroit at the Aug. 31 deadline to be eligible for the Astros' postseason roster.Afterward, players were exhausted."When that last out is made, you finally breathe," Springer said."That's an emotional high -- emotional high to low to high again.But that's why we play the game.And that's the craziest game that I've ever played in.And it's only Game 2."
Astros' epic win lifts Houston amid hurricane recovery:::::HOUSTON (AP) -- Paul Daulong hopes the Houston Astros jersey his daughter gave him after Hurricane Harvey's flooding devastated the family's home will be a good luck charm as his beloved baseball team tries to win its first World Series.So far, it seems to be working.Daulong started wearing the jersey after the Astros trailed the New York Yankees three games to two in the American League Championship Series.They won the next two games in Houston to advance to the fall classic against the Los Angeles Dodgers.He forgot to wear it during Game 1 of the World Series, which the Astros lost, but remembered to put it on for Wednesday's Game 2, which they won in extra innings."Normally I'm not real superstitious," he said this week from his dust-covered home, a gutted structure held up by exposed wooden beams but devoid of furniture and appliances."But I'm wearing it now and I'm not taking it off."The Daulongs and others in the Houston area impacted by Harvey have used the Astros' championship run as a source of inspiration to slog through difficult days filled with tiring repairs, bureaucratic red tape and uncertainty about the future."It gives you a positive note to start thinking about," said Paul Daulong, 70."It's been nothing, other than the last week they fixed the fireplace.So it's frustrating.With the Astros winning, it makes you feel good."Amid the Astros' quest, the city has continued rebuilding from Harvey's devastating flooding, which inundated some areas with more than 50 inches of rain in late August.Officials have estimated that more than 136,000 homes and structures were damaged during Harvey in Harris County, which includes Houston.Officials say it will be months before all of the debris covering many front lawns is removed.Nearly 100 people still remain in an American Red Cross shelter in Houston and nearly 9,000 families in Harris County who were displaced by Harvey are still living in hotels.Mary Daulong, 69, said she and her husband -- who are temporarily living in an apartment -- have scheduled their rebuilding activities at their home around Astros' games."We would work here until it was dark.Now we cannot.Whatever time the Astros come on, is when we stop working here," she said.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in the aftermath of Harvey, the Worlds Series isn't just about the Astros."Quite frankly, they are carrying the city on their shoulders and on their backs and in their mitts," said Turner."The storm may have come, but it hasn't dampened our spirit, our enthusiasm."Astros manager A.J.Hinch said the team understands its responsibility to represent Houston and bring awareness "to the things that are needed to rebuild our great city.""It gives the city something to rally around and gives people something to cheer for that otherwise may not have a lot to be hopeful for," said Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.Houston resident Tom Flores, 70, said while cheering on the Astros in the World Series won't make up for people losing their homes, it still gives people some hope."I got friends of mine who lost their home and everything but they are still Astros fans and this does take a little bit of the sadness off," he said.An event like the World Series can be a powerful source of motivation for a community dealing with adversity, said Tim Bono, a lecturer in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department at Washington University in St. Louis."It'll be important for people in Houston to continue to direct attention toward that and say, `Hey, look how we all came together to cheer on our sports team.Let's continue to do that to support each other and to especially direct resources for those areas that still need our help in recovering from the aftermath of the hurricane," Bono said.Paul Daulong said the Astros provided a good example for the community by going through their own rebuilding process after several losing seasons."We have totally put the Astros ahead of the problems that are occurring right now," he said."We just gotta keep our heads up and make sure that just like the Astros are going to come through against the Dodgers, we'll make it back as well as we can."-- -- AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.
Vikings, Browns next to square off in London:::::CLEVELAND (AP) -- Hue Jackson's going back to London, the lone European stop on his extensive coaching resume.The food never became appealing to him, but Jackson won a championship during his stay.He'd settle for win on his return.With Jackson suffering through another painful, winless season in his second year in Cleveland, his future has become uncertain as the Browns travel across the Atlantic to host the Minnesota Vikings at Twickenham Stadium.It's a home game, 3,800 miles from FirstEnergy Stadium for the Browns, and for Jackson, it's a homecoming of sorts after spending part of 1991 as an assistant with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football.Jackson was in England for more than three months, and remembers those times fondly."We won the World Bowl and had a great time, a good experience," he said."The food was different, the living arrangements were different, but it was fun.It was a good time."It's been anything but fun for him this season as the Browns (0-7) have failed to show any significant progress following a 1-15 season.In fact, it could be argued they've gotten worse.Jackson's handling -- or mishandling -- of rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer, his team's excessive penalties and some questionable in-game decisions have increased pressure on the coach and heightened speculation he'll be fired.Jackson, who is also handling offensive coordinator duties, has at times turned defensive during interviews in recent weeks while maintaining his conviction that he and Cleveland's analytics-heavy front office will get things turned around.But time is running out, and the 1-22 record over two seasons can't be ignored.Yet, while outside pressure builds, Jackson's players say he has maintained a positive front, still pushing, still motivating, still unwavering."It's tough for him," said offensive guard Joel Bitonio."He wants to win.He's been stressing winning and to not win and have the record he's had is tough.It's been hard for him, and you can tell.But that's the thing that makes him a great head coach is he comes to those meetings, he's very energetic, he's ready to coach, he's on to the next week."On Sunday, Jackson will square off with Vikings coach Mike Zimmer, one of his closest friends.They were together on Marvin Lewis' staff in Cincinnati.Zimmer said it's been tough to see Jackson suffer, but he thinks his friend has his team on the right track."Hue is a heck of a football coach.He is tough.He is smart.He is a great competitor," Zimmer said."I know that it is taking him a little bit longer than what he has anticipated, but he is going to get that thing turned around.That is the kind of guy he is.He will never stop or relax until he gets it all right."The Browns have a bye next week, and Jackson has to hope it won't be a bye-bye week for him.In the past three years, at least two teams (Oakland 2014, Miami 2015) have fired their coaches on the way back from London.NO JOE PRO For the first time since the 2006 season finale, the Browns will have someone other than Joe Thomas at left tackle.The iron man Pro Bowler suffered a season-ending triceps injury last week, snapping his streak of consecutive plays at 10,363.Spencer Drango will fill in for Thomas, and will have to deal with Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen, third in the NFL with nine sacks, including at least one in each game.With a sack against the Browns, Griffen would become only the third player to record a sack in each of his team's first eight games, joining Dwight Freeney (2009) and Robert Mathis (2005) of Indianapolis.NO GARRETT Cleveland will also be missing rookie standout Myles Garrett because of a concussion.The defensive end was placed in protocol earlier in the week after complaining of symptoms two days after the Browns' overtime loss to Tennessee.When he's been healthy, Garrett has been a force, recording four sacks in three games.He missed the season's first four games with a sprained ankle.JET LAG REMEDIES Only 10 players from Minnesota's roster remain from the team's visit to London in 2013, a win over Pittsburgh.Zimmer was hired the following year, so this will be a new experience for much of the team, beginning with the five-hour time difference.Players were given advice from sleep experts on time zone adjustment and given special glasses to wear for smartphone viewing in order to minimize the stimulation from the bright screen.The Browns chartered a jet that will have enough room for players to get some sleep."It's all football.They've got to do it.We've got to do it," Vikings cornerback Terence Newman said.VAST IMPROVEMENT After ranking last in the NFL in 2016 in rushing, the Vikings have made major strides with their ground game, even after the loss of rookie Dalvin Cook to a season-ending knee injury.They're tied for eighth in the league with an average of 124.6 yards per game.-- -- AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in Minneapolis contributed to this report.
Cardinals' sole Gold Glove finalist is a familiar one: Yadi:::::ST. LOUIS -- For all the excitement over the breakout seasons from several young Cardinals in 2017, it's an old-timer who made the list of finalists for a National League Gold Glove Award in 2017: catcher Yadier Molina.Molina is seeking his ninth Gold Glove.He had won eight in a row from 2008-15 before missing out last year.The other NL finalists at catcher are San Francisco's Buster Posey and Cincinnati's Tucker Barnhart.Molina, 35, also is a four-time Platinum Glove winner, denoting the top fielder across all positions.
Twins' Buxton, Dozier named Gold Glove finalists:::::Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton and second baseman Brian Dozier were named American League Gold Glove finalists Thursday, while Joe Mauer was a notable snub following a strong season at first base.The winners will be announced at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7.Buxton joins fellow center field finalists Kevin Pillar of the Toronto Blue Jays and Lorenzo Cain of the Kansas City Royals.Dozier, Dustin Pedroia of the Boston Red Sox and Ian Kinsler of the Detroit Tigers are the finalists at second base.
Lions face challenge in Steelers' pass rush:::::DETROIT (AP) -- A break in the schedule gave Detroit's beleaguered offensive line a chance to rest and recover.Now comes one of the season's biggest challenges -- a matchup with the sack-happy Pittsburgh Steelers."There's no one guy to really clue in on.They've got quite a few," quarterback Matthew Stafford said."Their guys off the edge do a great job.Their guys in the middle push the pocket well, and they're covering guys down in the back end.It goes hand in hand."The AFC North-leading Steelers are tied for second in the NFL with 24 sacks, so Sunday night's game will be quite a test for Stafford and the Lions.Detroit has allowed 17 sacks in its past three games, two of which were losses, and it remains to be seen how much last week's open date helped the Lions refresh.Detroit added offensive linemen T.J. Lang and Rick Wagner in the offseason, but Lang missed the team's most recent game at New Orleans on Oct. 15 with a back injury.Tackle Taylor Decker hasn't played yet this season following shoulder surgery, and Greg Robinson -- another new addition -- has had his struggles.Stafford has been knocked around of late, and now the Lions (3-3) have to face a Pittsburgh team that's allowing only 147 yards passing a game, the lowest mark in the NFL.Perhaps the most impressive development in the Steelers' pass rush has been their ability to be effective without sending extra pressure.Pittsburgh's four fourth-quarter sacks against Cincinnati last week came when the Steelers just sent four men after Andy Dalton while dropping seven into coverage."When those guys (up front) are hot, it makes it that much easier to play linebacker and defensive back," Pittsburgh middle linebacker Ryan Shazier said.The Steelers (5-2) have a comfortable two-game lead in their division, and their impressive defense is complemented by the usual offensive standouts.Le'Veon Bell is second in the league in rushing, and Antonio Brown is the NFL leader in yards receiving."He's quick as you could possibly think a receiver should be," Lions coach Jim Caldwell said."He can make you miss.He can run away from you.I mean, he can do it all.So, yeah he's going to challenge every single conceivable defensive technique that you can possibly place in front of him."Here are a few more things to watch when the Lions host the Steelers: A CHANCE TO BE ELI-TE After Martavis Bryant's social media outburst following Pittsburgh's victory over Cincinnati, the talented but enigmatic wide receiver indicated he'll be inactive this weekend.That should mean more opportunities for Eli Rogers and Justin Hunter.Rogers was benched earlier in the season after fumbling a punt against Chicago but returned to the lineup against the Bengals, catching his first pass since Week 2.Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger described Rogers' play of late as a "resurgence."While Rogers works almost exclusively in the slot, the 6-foot-4 Hunter may have the best chance at taking over Bryant's role as a downfield threat.RETURN THREAT Detroit already had a dependable kicker coming into the season in Matt Prater, and now the Lions have a legitimately dangerous returner in rookie Jamal Agnew, who has taken two punts back for touchdowns already this season.TAKING IT AWAY Detroit got off to a 3-1 start in large part because of a plus-9 turnover differential.Since then, the Lions are minus-3 in that important statistic.Detroit turned the ball over five times in a loss to the Saints , although the Lions did have three takeaways of their own in that game, and their defense still has Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin's attention."I've been really impressed that they're extremely opportunistic," Tomlin said."Passes get tipped in the NFL every weekend and oftentimes fall harmlessly to the ground, but boy, I think they've got nine interceptions.I think six of them are off of tipped passes, that's not by circumstance."THE OTHER KILLER B?The Steelers' "Killer Bs" (Bell, Brown and Ben) better make way for another addition.Kicker Chris Boswell set a Heinz Field record by making five field goals against Cincinnati, and his reliability has helped Pittsburgh overcome some shaky performances inside the red zone.The Steelers are 30th in red zone touchdown percentage, with only 42 percent of their trips inside the opponent's 20-yard line resulting in a TD.IN A RUT Detroit DE Ziggy Ansah had three sacks in a win over the New York Giants in Week 2, but he has only one since."Just give him time," Caldwell said."He's a tough guy, and does a nice job at what he does.Let's see where he ends up."-- -- For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP -- NFL .
Jets host Falcons in homecoming for Dan Quinn:::::EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- This road game has the feel of a homecoming for Dan Quinn.The Atlanta Falcons coach grew up about 5 miles away from where the New York Jets' training facility stands.And the Jersey boy spent plenty of afternoons as a fan at the Meadowlands, the site of the stadium where he'll be coaching Sunday."It's always a favorite thing of mine because of growing up there is where my love of football began," Quinn said."So watching games, before MetLife, at old Giants Stadium, going there watching games, watching the Giants and the Jets on TV every Sunday and Monday night, so it's always kind of a cool spot for me."Quinn was a defensive line coach for the Jets in 2007, when the team was based at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.The following season, the franchise moved its headquarters to Florham Park, New Jersey -- just down the road from the Morristown native's home."My wife liked to joke it was like `Everybody Loves Raymond,' where my brother, the police officer, he lived down the street, another brother was across the street and so it was a lot of fun to be there during that time," Quinn said."Even growing up, the Giants even had training camp over at Farleigh Dickinson (University), so it was always meant to have a pro team in that area."The 47-year-old Quinn went to Seattle as an assistant head coach and D-line coach in 2009 before moving to the University of Florida in 2011 to be the Gators' defensive coordinator and defensive line coach.After two seasons there, Quinn rejoined Pete Carroll's staff in Seattle as the Seahawks' defensive coordinator.He became a hot name in coaching circles, largely because of the success of Seattle's smothering defense.In 2015, the Jets were looking for a new coach -- and Quinn appeared to be a perfect fit.New York was also impressed, however, by then-Arizona defensive coordinator Todd Bowles.With the Seahawks going to the Super Bowl for the second straight year, the Jets had to decide whether to wait for Quinn's season to be over -- without a guarantee that he'd join them.Or, they could immediately go with their equally strong option in Bowles.Well, the Jets hired Bowles, and Quinn joined Atlanta a few weeks later -- leading the Falcons to the Super Bowl last season."We were still kind of right in the middle of our stuff, and fortunately we were able to keep playing, so it made it certainly more challenging for anybody the more we were playing," Quinn said."But, no, things worked out as they should have, and Todd is doing a great job there and I am really happy here."Here are some things to know about the matchup between the Falcons (3-3) and Jets (3-4) at MetLife Stadium: AFC EAST GRIND: Atlanta is completing a punishing tour of the AFC East that already has included home losses to Buffalo and Miami and last week's loss at New England.Meanwhile, the Falcons still have not played an opponent from their NFC South division.They finally play their first division rival next week when they visit Carolina.Falcons running back Devonta Freeman said the lesson he has learned from the schedule is "every game is going to be like a Super Bowl in this league.It's going to be a grind, every game, in the NFL."SQUANDERING LEADS:The Jets have had big leads in their past two games against New England and Miami, only to blow them and lose.New York held a 14-point advantage heading into the fourth quarter at Miami last Sunday, but couldn't stop backup Matt Moore as he led the Dolphins to a 31-28 victory .It echoed the previous week's game, when the Jets jumped out to a 14-0 second-quarter lead, only to see Tom Brady storm back and beat them 24-17 ."At some point, we've got to develop some killer instinct to finish ballgames," Bowles said.MISSING TAKEAWAYS:A key to the Falcons' slow start has been their inability to create turnovers.They have only three takeaways: a fumble recovery by cornerback Desmond Trufant and interceptions by Trufant and linebacker Deion Jones.Adding to the turnover margin frustrations: The Falcons have had three interceptions negated by penalties."Certainly disappointing," said Quinn, who added those missed opportunities are missed possessions by Atlanta's offense.FLYING FALCON: Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan has thrown for a touchdown in 25 consecutive games, the NFL's longest active streak.He has a good chance of keeping that going Sunday against a Jets defense that ranks 20th against the pass.Ryan has also passed for 200 or more yards in 61 straight games, the longest streak in league history.NO JOSHIN': Despite his fourth-quarter interception that cost the Jets the game last week, Josh McCown has been mostly efficient this season.The 38-year-old veteran QB ranks second in the NFL with a 69.2 percent completion rate.Last week he joined Al Dorow of the 1960 New York Titans as the only players in franchise history with three or more TD passes and at least one TD run in a game.-- -- AP Sports Writer Charles Odum in Flowery Branch, Georgia, contributed.
Cowboys, Redskins meet in hunt for wild-card:::::LANDOVER, Md.(AP) -- Carson Wentz's Philadelphia Eagles are the class of the NFC East, while Eli Manning's New York Giants are looking toward 2018.That puts Dak Prescott's Dallas Cowboys and Kirk Cousins' Washington Redskins thick in the middle of the fight for a wild-card spot.Prescott at 24 in his second NFL season and Cousins at 29 in his third full season as a starter face off Sunday in the first of their two matchups this season, which could go a long way to determining whose team makes the playoffs."We're 1-0 in our division now, and it's important to go get another win," Prescott said."That's our only focus."The Cowboys and Redskins are each 3-3 as their quarterbacks continue to evolve in different ways.Cousins continues to throw for 300 yards a game, as Prescott develops the various facets of his game."The most impressive thing about Dak last year was he looked like a 10-year veteran with the poise that he has and the command of the offense -- very similar to what I see in Carson Wentz," Redskins coach Jay Gruden said."They're very similar-type quarterbacks: very effective, very smart."Wentz has already beaten the Redskins twice this season after Prescott defeated them twice as a rookie.Cousins is 0-4 in meaningful games against Dallas.Almost halfway through this season, Cousins has 1,637 yards passing and 12 touchdowns, but plenty left to prove on the franchise tag for a second consecutive time.However, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett is a believer."He can make any throw on the field," Garrett said."He really cuts the ball loose and allows them to not only move the ball efficiently but also make a lot of big plays, and that's what he's been able to do.It's a different supporting cast around him since he's been the starter, but he's certainly been a constant for them."Meanwhile, Prescott is adjusting to opponents' adjustments and running more as defenses anticipate his plan throwing the ball."I think he definitely became a better player," said running back Ezekiel Elliott, who's eligible to play at least one more game as the case over his suspension is fought over in court."Obviously he's a threat as a runner and he's done an awesome job this year just using his feet to extend plays and make big plays downfield."Some things to watch as the Cowboys visit the Redskins: ONE MORE FOR ELLIOTT: With another hearing scheduled for Monday and a ruling possible next week, Elliott could be playing his final game of the season -- or he could be eligible for every game the rest of the way."I take it week by week," Elliott said."Every week I prepare like I'm going to play."Elliott hasn't missed a game yet after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him in August following a yearlong investigation that he had multiple physical confrontations in the summer of 2016 with Tiffany Thompson, his girlfriend at the time.The 22-year-old has 540 yards and four touchdowns."To me, Zeke's handled it really, really well," Garrett said."Obviously there's a lot of things going on off the field with him, but you wouldn't know it if you were around him each and every day."BRYANT VS. NORMAN: Assuming Josh Norman returns from a broken rib that sidelined him the past two games, it'll re-ignite the rivalry between the Washington cornerback and Dallas receiver Dez Bryant.Norman has had his on- and off-field battles with other receivers such as the Giants' Odell Beckham Jr., and he and Bryant get fired up to face each other."They're both highly competitive guys, and they both want to win," Gruden said."I have no problem with that.If it becomes a penalty or get thrown out of the game, obviously we have an issue."FULL STRENGTH: Dallas' defense had everyone it figured to be counting on for the first time last week against the 49ers.The Cowboys recovered two fumbles (special teams had a third) to end a three-game streak without a takeaway and had five sacks.All-Pro linebacker Sean Lee missed the previous two games, and the Cowboys lost both at home despite scoring at least 30 points each time.Lee and Anthony Hitchens, who missed the first four games because of a preseason knee injury, have boosted the linebacking group, and defensive end David Irving has three sacks in two games following a four-game suspension.INJURED REDSKINS:Gruden cut a day of practice off his team's usual schedule because of all the injuries that built up, most notably along the offensive line.Left tackle Trent Williams, center Spencer Long and right guard Brandon Scherff all have knee injuries and right tackle Morgan Moses has sprains in both ankles.On defense, linebackers Zach Brown (back) and Preston Smith (groin) are the most banged up, but not the only ones as Washington's depth is being tested.NO MR.RELIABLE:The Cowboys' Dan Bailey, the most accurate in NFL history among kickers with at least 100 attempts, will miss the first game of his seven-year career with a groin injury sustained during the game in San Francisco.Mike Nugent, a 12-year veteran, will replace him for at least a game and probably more.Bailey's career success rate of 89.9 percent is about 9 percentage points better than Nugent.The discrepancy is much larger from 50 yards and beyond -- 69 percent for Bailey, 39 for Nugent.-- -- Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon in Frisco, Texas, contributed.
Watt shares plans for $37 million in donations:::::HOUSTON (AP) -- J.J. Watt has announced plans for how the more than $37 million he raised in the wake of Hurricane Harvey will be distributed.The Houston Texans defensive end will divide $30.15 million of the donations between Americares, Feeding America, SBP and Save the Children.The money will go toward rebuilding child-care centers and homes and providing food and health care to those affected by the storm.He'll hold onto $7 million for now and distribute it next year after his group assesses the continuing relief efforts.Watt began the fundraising campaign in the days after the storm with the goal of raising $200,000, but kept upping the target as donations poured in from more than 200,000 people.Watt says: "You have truly shown what is possible when everyone bands together for one common cause.While we are going to do some truly incredible things with this $37 million to make it stretch as far as possible, it is only one small step in the massive recovery effort that lies ahead."
Broncos and Chiefs meet Monday looking to get back in win column:::::KANSAS CITY, Mo.(AP) -- The Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos appeared to be the class of the AFC West just a couple of weeks ago, and maybe the entire league, after going a combined 8-1 to start the season.They're a combined 0-4 since then.The Chiefs were humbled by Pittsburgh before dropping a heartbreaker in Oakland, which snapped their 12-game division winning streak.And the Broncos were embarrassed by the Giants before getting shut out last week by the Chargers -- the first time they've been blanked in 25 years.Now, what looked as if it would be a showdown for league supremacy on Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium has turned into a game matching two teams desperate to get back on track."Guys are frustrated.We know we can play better and we want to play better," Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian said."Guys are a little frustrated.That's a good thing, I think.Me specifically, I have to play better.I know that.I think this week, more than ever, is a really big week for us."That's because the division race is still wide open nearing the midway point.The Chiefs (5-2) are still on top, while the Broncos (3-3) are just a half-game ahead of the Chargers and Raiders."Every week the games just get bigger and bigger," Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib said."Until you win the Super Bowl, games just get bigger and bigger.This is our next game and it's a huge game for us."It's just as huge for the Chiefs, whose five straight wins sent them soaring to the top of just about every NFL power ranking.But their high-powered offense was effectively shut down by Pittsburgh, and their suspect defense was exposed in their last-second loss to the Raiders.Still, veteran quarterback Alex Smith is playing at a high level.Running back Kareem Hunt has gone over 100 yards from scrimmage in an NFL-record seven straight games to begin his career.Tyreek Hill has not lost an ounce of the speed that has made him one of the league's most dynamic players.Defensively, there's still Justin Houston and Marcus Peters making life miserable for QBs."A lot of fingers can be pointed and all of that, but the reality is you're 5-2 and a pretty good football team," Chiefs coach Andy Reid said."There's always a little positive within the negative.It's hard right now, because you went 5-0 and then you have two losses and it seems like the whole world is falling apart.But in reality that's not the case."It might be if the Chiefs lost to the Broncos at Arrowhead Stadium.As the bitter rivals prepare for a primetime matchup, here are some things to know: JAMAAL IS BACK:The Chiefs' career rushing leader, Jamaal Charles will return to Kansas City for the first time as a member of the Broncos.He was released last offseason when the Chiefs needed to save salary cap space and signed a one-year deal with Denver."It'll be great to be back where I started at," he said."It'll be great to come back, but hearing the crowd will be different for me."ERRORLESS ALEX: One reason Smith is having an MVP-caliber season has been his mistake-free play.He has thrown 15 touchdown passes without an interception, and needs five more TD tosses to match the league record for most without a pick to start a season set by Peyton Manning in 2013."To be honest, there's no time to reflect," he said."You're just coming off a loss and you're in the middle of the season and all that stuff means nothing at this point.That stuff's for after the season.Two in a row, we've got a long time to think about this and hopefully get back healthy."SPEAKING OF QBS:Broncos coach Vance Joseph insisted Siemian remains his starter, despite a series of poor performances.But with Brock Osweiler up to speed and Paxton Lynch returning to practice for the first time since late-August, when he sprained his shoulder, the lease on Siemian could be short."He's still working through the injury," Joseph said of Lynch."Brock's looked fine.Brock's very engaged, very smart and a great leader.He looked fine in practice."GETTING HEALTHY: The Chiefs could be buoyed by the return of three starters this week.Right guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif (knee injury), center Mitch Morse (foot injury) and cornerback Steven Nelson (concussion) were all at practice this week and could be on the field Monday night.STRENGTH VS STRENGTH: Might as well call it weakness vs weakness, too.The Chiefs have the NFL's top rushing offense while the Broncos have the league's second-best run defense, and Kansas City has the No.3 overall offense while the Denver defense is ranked No.1.On the flip side, the Broncos have had trouble moving the ball and the Chiefs' defense is ranked 29th in the league."We plan on taking care of the run game because that's what their team thrives off of," Broncos linebacker Shane Ray said."It's a division rivalry, so it's going to come down to who wins the fourth quarter."
Overplayed Clippers take on the deep Blazers:::::PORTLAND, Ore. -- Depth is a concern for the Los Angeles Clippers, but it is a decided strength of the Portland Trail Blazers, who face the Clippers Thursday night at Moda Center.The Clippers (3-0) started the season with only four guards on their 15-man roster, and the gamble backfired when starting point guard Milos Teodosic went down with plantar fasciitis of the left foot.The 6-foot-5 Serbian is out indefinitely.The shortage was a factor as coach Doc Rivers was pressed to play all of his starters -- guards Austin Rivers and Patrick Beverley, center DeAndre Jordan and forwards Blake Griffin and Danilo Gallinari -- big minutes in a 102-84 victory over Utah on Tuesday night."Too many minutes, really, by everyone," Rivers said."The first thing I saw when I looked at the stat sheet: I didn't like the minutes.That'll change.I've just got to expand (the rotation).With (Teodosic) out, that hurts us."Veteran Lou Williams will get first call off the bench in the backcourt; next up are rookie guards Sindarius Thornwell and Jawun Evans."One of those two will play," Rivers said."They both are ready.Sindarius has a chance to be an elite defender in this league, though maybe not right away.The minutes will help him.So we're just going to plug him in."Even with Teodosic down, the Clippers' bench has provided 40.3 points per game, tied for eighth in the league.The Blazers (40.8) are seventh, getting strong performances from forwards Evan Turner (13.3) and Ed Davis (8.8 points along with 9.3 rebounds).In Portland's 103-93 win over New Orleans on Tuesday night, the Blazers (3-1) got a lift from reserves Davis (12 points and 10 rebounds, including six off the offensive glass), Turner (13 points, seven rebounds), Pat Connaughton (eight points, six rebounds), rookie Caleb Swanigan (five points, eight boards) and Meyers Leonard (five points on 2-for-2 shooting, two boards in six minutes)."We have so many guys we can count on," starting point guard Damian Lillard said."Each game we've played, guys have come in and gotten the job done.They're helping us produce wins.When you're doing that over a period of time, you see you're a deeper team.The longer we can sustain that, the better we'll be as a team."Davis has been a consistent producer in Portland's four games, grabbing 16 offensive rebounds while shooting 58.3 percent.The 6-foot-10 veteran, who is in the final year of a three-year, $21 million contract, underwent shoulder surgery in March and missed the rest of the 2016-17 season.The shoulder had been bothering him for some time, and he vowed he would come back an improved product."It started as soon as I got my shoulder fixed," he said."It changed from that day.I took five days off all summer."Paying tribute to Davis' work ethic, some teammates have taken to calling him "Shirt-Off Ed.""Dame (Lillard) started it one day when I had my shirt off in the weight room," Davis said."I work hard for my body, man.I've got to make sure people see it."The Clippers game will be the second of 10 home dates for Portland over the next 11 games.The Clippers have owned the Blazers of late, sweeping a three-game series last year and winning 10 of the last 14 meetings.Forward Blake Griffin averaged 25 points, 12.7 rebounds and 4.3 assists against Portland a year ago.
Baltimore Ravens QB Joe Flacco out after big hit:::::BALTIMORE -- Joe Flacco is out of Thursday night's game with a concussion after taking a vicious shot to the head from Miami Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso.Flacco looked glassy-eyed as he got up and held the left side of his face while he walked into the locker room for evaluation with 3 minutes remaining in the first half.The Ravens' sideline erupted when Alonso's hit dislodged the helmet of Flacco, who was sliding after a 9-yard run.It also left Flacco with a cut on his ear that required stitches.Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso sent Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco to the locker room with this hit.AP Photo/Nick Wass Baltimore coach John Harbaugh came onto the field yelling at Alonso, who was flagged 15 yards for unnecessary roughness.Ryan Mallett took over for Flacco and threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ben Watson to put Baltimore ahead 20-0.Flacco was in the midst of his best game of the season.He completed 10 of 15 passes for 101 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game.NFL rules allow any player, including quarterbacks, to end a play without contact by declaring himself down.Thursday night, Flacco attempted to do so by sliding feet first.In those situations, according to the NFL rulebook, the ball is dead "the instant he touches the ground with anything other than his hands or feet."The rule instructs defenders to "treat a sliding runner as they would a runner who is down by contact" and "pull up when a runner begins a feet-first slide."It allows flexibility for a defender who might not be able to avoid contact, but still prohibits the kind of contact Alonso initiated on Flacco."If a defender has already committed himself," the rule states, "and the contact is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender makes forcible contact into the head or neck area of the runner with the helmet, shoulder, or forearm, or commits some other act that is unnecessary roughness."That's undoubtedly what referee John Parry saw when he penalized Alonso for unnecessary roughness.The rulebook provides referees with the option to eject players in situations where the contact is flagrant, but Parry elected not to.The NFL defines "flagrant" as "extremely objectionable, conspicuous, unnecessary, avoidable, or gratuitous."Al Riveron, head of officiating for the NFL, told CBS that the league will not have a comment on the play tonight.This is not unusual; the league rarely comments right away, instead choosing to watch the film before talking about a ruling.ESPN's Kevin Seifert contributed to this report.

Joe Girardi not returning as manager of New York Yankees:::::Buster Olney joins SportsCenter to break down the Yankees' decision to part ways with Joe Girardi after 10 years as the franchise's skipper.(1:15) Joe Girardi will not be back next season as manager of the New York Yankees, the team announced Thursday.Girardi just completed the final season of a four-year, $16 million contract.Sources told ESPN's Buster Olney that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman recommended to owner Hal Steinbrenner that the team change managers.In an email to local media outlets, Girardi said: "With a heavy heart, I come to you because the Yankees have decided not to bring me back."He went on to thank the Steinbrenner family and Cashman.Editor's Picks The simple truth in the Bronx: It was time for Joe to go Despite six postseason appearances and a title, Yankees manager Joe Girardi wasn't beloved.With the team's ALCS exit, a clean break was for the best.Who should the Yankees pick to replace Joe Girardi?New York's next manager will have to deal with huge expectations heading into 2018.Is the right fit someone with previous ties to the Bronx?1 Related "I want to thank Joe for his 10 years of hard work and service to this organization," Cashman said Thursday in a statement."Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, and we've decided to pursue alternatives for the managerial position."As Hal Steinbrenner and I mentioned to Joe directly this week, he has been a tremendous Yankee on the field and away from it, as a player, coach and manager.He has a tireless work ethic, and put his heart into every game he managed over the last decade.He should take great pride in our accomplishments during his tenure, and I wish Joe and his family nothing but success and happiness in the future."New York said Cashman and other team officials will not discuss the decision during the World Series.Girardi, 53, and the Yankees came within one game of going to the World Series this year, losing to the Houston Astros in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.In 10 years at the helm, Girardi won one World Series and made the playoffs six times.He has talked extensively about how the talent at the major and minor league levels could bode well for the Yankees in years to come, but now Girardi will not be a part of that future.Catcher Gary Sanchez, one of the young stars of this season's team, tweeted his gratitude to Girardi.Thank you Joe.For all your help and support.Will always be grateful to you.// Gracias Joe, por tu ayuda y apoyo.Siempre agradecido.Gary Sanchez (@ElGarySanchez) October 26, 2017 Former Yankees captain Derek Jeter reacted to the news of Girardi's departure, saying, "I've played with Joe.He was a coach, manager.He's probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.And it's unfortunate, but this is a business.You learn that."I think when you first come up as an athlete, as a professional athlete, when you're younger you're just playing the game.The longer you play you realize this is starting to become a business.So there's some things at times [that] are unpopular or not popular, but it's part of the business."One of the complications of Girardi's departure is there is not an obvious candidate to replace him.Internally, bench coach Rob Thomson is highly respected, but it is unclear whether the Yankees would go with a lower-profile candidate.First-base coach Tony Pena has managed in the majors before.The Yankees are expected to look externally as well.Cashman will favor a candidate who has a good feel for the clubhouse and a willingness to use advanced statistics, and one who can handle the extreme expectations of fans and media in New York.Cashman's contract also was up at the end of the season, but he is expected to return after building a strong roster and farm system.Though the Yankees advanced deep into the playoffs, Girardi had the lowest moment of his managerial career.He was held responsible for a loss in Game 2 of the AL Division Series in Cleveland after he failed to ask for replay review on a strikeout that was incorrectly called a hit batsman.The Yankees stormed back to win the final three games of the series and then nearly came back from a 2-0 deficit against the Astros in the ALCS.After the Yankees lost in the ALCS, Girardi professed his love for managing but said he would once again discuss his situation with his wife and three children, asking them what they thought was best for their family.He has expressed similar sentiments on previous occasions when his contract was up, but has always returned to the team.Girardi has had aspirations to work in baseball operations, possibly in the commissioner's office.He could return to broadcasting.Girardi, a Northwestern graduate, also has a passion for college football; although he has said it is a long shot, he has spoken about serving as an athletic director somewhere.After managing the Marlins for one year, Girardi took over the Yankees in 2008.He won a World Series in 2009 and finishes his Yankees tenure with a regular-season record of 910-710 (.562).As a catcher, Girardi played for 15 years in the big leagues, winning three World Series titles in four years with the Yankees.In his statement, Girardi concluded: "Finally, I'd like to thank the Fans for their great support as a Player, Coach and Manager and the lasting memories of their passion and excitement during the Playoff Games, especially the final six games which will remain in my heart forever."Girardi visited Astros manager A.J.Hinch in his office after Game 7 of the ALCS to give encouragement."He's a real class act," Hinch said."It's a shame to see so much turnover because of the work, the blood, sweat, tears poured into these jobs.And I don't think anybody goes through more than what Joe does in New York."Information from The Associated Press was included in this report.
2017 World Series -- A.J. Hinch of Houston Astros refutes report of hotel altercation:::::HOUSTON -- Astros manager A.J.Hinch denied a published report that he was involved in a heated altercation at the team hotel after Game 1 of the World Series in Los Angeles earlier this week, calling the story "some nonsense'' and "ridiculous.''According to the website TMZ.com, Hinch was sitting in the bar at the team's Pasadena hotel following Houston's 3-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night when some hotel guests arrived on the premises and began "talking trash'' about the Astros.TMZ, citing unnamed sources, said Hinch "snapped'' and began yelling and cursing in the middle of the bar.TMZ cited a witness who said the confrontation turned physical and that police were summoned to address the situation.Hinch denied the content of the report when meeting with reporters during an off-day at Minute Maid Park on Thursday.The Dodgers and Astros, tied at 1-1, will resume the World Series on Friday with Game 3 in Houston."First off, there was no altercation,'' Hinch said."And it's a shame I get asked about some nonsense, some fabrications and some non-stories and I have to respond to it on a national stage.But to reiterate, there was no altercation.That's as far as I'm going to go.It's ridiculous.''When pressed on the details of the TMZ report, Hinch replied, "Fabrications really suck.And I'm not going to address any of it.''A baseball source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the fans at the bar cursed and were disrespectful to women in the Astros' traveling party.The unruly patrons were asked to leave the bar, the source said, and Astros security people called the police after the fans made threats on their way out the door.TMZ said no arrests were made and that police did not file a report of the incident.
Anquan Boldin considering return, Buffalo Bills letting agent shop him:::::Retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin has expressed interest in playing again and the Buffalo Bills have given his agent permission to explore trades with other teams.In a letter obtained by ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Bills granted Tom Condon, agent for the 14-year veteran of the NFL, permission to speak with other teams "for the sole purpose of discussing a trade for Anquan."The letter, dated Thursday, mentions Boldin's desire to be in closer proximity to his home in Florida and his family.Boldin announced on Aug. 20, less than two weeks after signing a one-year deal with the Bills, that he was leaving football to focus on social activism.Anquan Boldin, a 14-year veteran, walked away from the game with 1,076 receptions for 13,779 yards and 82 touchdowns.AP Photo/Tony Avelar He told SiriusXM Radio the next day, "Do I feel like I can still play?Of course.My passion for the advocacy work that I do outweighs football at this point, so I'm not coming back to play for a contender or to do anything else.I'm done with the game of football."Boldin told ESPN at the time, "Football has afforded me a platform throughout my career to have a greater impact on my humanitarian work, and at this time, I feel drawn to make the larger fight for human rights a priority.My life's purpose is bigger than football."In their letter granting permission to seek a trade, the Bills noted that Boldin might not make visits, undergo a physical or try out with other teams at this time.The Bills reserved the right to have ultimate say on trade compensation and the designated club.The trade deadline is Tuesday, so there is a finite window on any talks.Drafted by the Arizona Cardinals, where he played his first seven seasons, Boldin walked away from the game with 1,076 receptions for 13,779 yards and 82 touchdowns.He won a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in the 2012 season.He also played for the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions.Boldin, 37, has spent parts of the past two years on Capitol Hill fighting for criminal justice reform.He has teamed with current Philadelphia Eagle Malcolm Jenkins in trips to Washington to speak with members of Congress, to push a social media campaign for the Clean Slate Act and to help organize a players coalition of approximately 40 players who perform community work on a grassroots level.ESPN's Jim Trotter and Mike Rodak contributed to this report.
Chicago Cubs fire hitting, pitching and third base coaches:::::The Chicago Cubs decided they needed to begin a major overhaul Thursday, dismissing pitching coach Chris Bosio, hitting coach John Mallee and third base coach Gary Jones after falling short of another trip to the World Series.The team quickly moved to hire Jim Hickey, who worked as manager Joe Maddon's pitching coach in Tampa Bay and remained with the Rays after Maddon moved to Chicago, as a replacement for Bosio, according to multiple reports.Hickey was let go by the Rays after the season.The team also hired former Red Sox hitting coach Chili Davis for the same position in Chicago while also bringing in former Red Sox third base coach Brian Butterfield to replace Jones Joe Maddon thinks Chili Davis' approach will help the Cubs drive runners in.Michael Ivins/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images "It's about someone else being able to add something different or new," manager Joe Maddon said on a conference call."The guys that are not going to be here next year are fabulous.These are really horrible conversations."The Cubs ranked second in run scoring in the National League but averaged just 2.5 runs per game in the playoffs, which ended in a five-game defeat to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.Maddon cited situational hitting as a problem all season, and the Cubs think they may have addressed it with their new coach."Chili has a good method regarding situations in general," Maddon said."We're just looking for a slightly different voice with a little bit different approach that we feel can augment our hitters moving forward."The Cubs were near the bottom of baseball this year in getting a runner home from third with less than two outs, though they did improve in situations in the second half.The Red Sox were top 10 in the same category and first in baseball in moving a runner from second to third with no outs."A lot of it is based on availability," Maddon said of hiring Davis.Davis and Butterfield became available when John Farrell wasn't retained in Boston, otherwise Mallee and Jones might still be with the Cubs.That wasn't the case with Bosio, who wasn't going to be brought back."We just thought it was time for a different voice at this particular moment," Maddon said."I don't want to get too deeply into it."The Cubs were last in unintentional walk rate, but Bosio's dismissal had more to do with behind-the-scenes issues than any performance-based statistic.Only last week Maddon had backed his entire coaching staff, but the Cubs were still playing when he was asked if he wanted them all to return."That was a really awkward question," Maddon said."We're in the playoffs, and I thought that was the only way I could respond."The Cubs also promoted minor league hitting coordinator Andy Haines to assistant hitting coach.That job was left vacant when Eric Hinske left for the hitting coach position with the Los Angeles Angels."The guys that are leaving are near to my heart," Maddon said.Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
Joe Torre confirms wrong call made on passed ball in NLDS Game 5 between Cubs, Nationals:::::Upon further review, the men in blue blew it.On Thursday, MLB's chief baseball officer Joe Torre confirmed that the umpiring crew made the wrong call on a crucial passed ball in Game 5 of the National League Division Series between the Chicago Cubs and Washington Nationals.The critical play occurred in the top of the fifth inning, when Chicago's Javier Baez swung at strike three from Nationals ace Max Scherzer, who had come on in relief to start the frame.The swing would've resulted in the third out, but the pitch got by Washington catcher Matt Wieters, allowing Baez to reach first and extend the inning.Nats ace Max Scherzer allowed four runs, two unearned, in the critical fifth inning of Game 5 against the Cubs.Patrick Smith/Getty Images Wieters argued that because he was struck by Baez's backswing, the play should have resulted in an out, ending a Chicago rally that had already produced two runs off of Scherzer.Had the umpires agreed with Wieters, the inning would have ended with the Cubs holding a 5-4 edge.Instead, Baez reached, and Chicago scored twice more to take a 7-4 lead before winning by a final score of 9-8 to eliminate Washington and advance to the National League Championship Series.Exactly two weeks after the fateful play, Torre admitted that crew chief Jerry Layne and his fellow umps got it wrong."You know, the whole rule interpretation -- there's rules, and then there's instructions to the umpires," Torre said, appearing Thursday on SiriusXM radio with host Chris Russo."There's separate books.And what Jerry's feeling was, that the interference didn't take precedent over the fact that the ball was already past [Wieters] when the contact took place.Editor's Picks Don't blame Dusty Baker for the Nationals' failures -- look at ownership Cursed?Please.That the team in the nation's capital hasn't met postseason expectations isn't because of its manager -- it's because it is a bad organization."However, the rule states that when contact is made -- in other words, when the bat came around and hit the catcher's mask -- it's a dead ball.It's a dead ball.And that's the one thing that should have taken precedence."MLB rule 6.03 states the following: "If a batter strikes at a ball and misses and swings so hard he carries the bat all the way around and, in the umpire's judgment, unintentionally hits the catcher or the ball in back of him on the backswing, it shall be called a strike only (not interference).The ball will be dead, however, and no runner shall advance on the play."According to Torre, Washington manager Dusty Baker had the power to have the play overturned in the moment."If you've got a question, a rule question -- not a judgment question but a rule question -- if you don't like what the umpire's telling you, ask him for a rules check.And they can do that.They can go to the replay center on the headset and check a rule."Last Friday, eight days after Washington's second consecutive NLDS Game 5 loss under Baker, the Nationals announced they were parting ways with the 68-year old skipper, whose contract had expired.In two seasons in D.C., Baker guided the Nats to 192 wins and a pair of division titles.The Nationals are currently interviewing candidates to replace Baker, including Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez and Mets hitting coach Kevin Long.Pitching coach Mike Maddux, who served in Washington under Baker, was thought to be a potential candidate, but on Thursday the St. Louis Cardinals announced that they've hired Maddux as their new pitching coach.
Marshawn Lynch of Oakland Raiders practices with Oakland Technical High School football team:::::ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch kept busy during his one-game suspension by spending some time practicing this week with the football team at his alma mater, Oakland Technical High School.Sporting his Raiders helmet as cameras rolled for his reality show, Lynch showed off some fancy footwork and a nasty stiff-arm on an unsuspecting prepster.It took four, five or six Bulldogs players to bring him down on another play.Lynch posted video of the practice on his Instagram account.Just keep workin it will happen no matter what!!!!Yes lawd!!!!A post shared by Shawn Lynch (@beastmode) on Oct 26, 2017 at 12:05am PDT Lynch was suspended by the NFL for making contact with an official during the Raiders' Week 7 win over the Kansas City Chiefs.Raiders offensive coordinator Todd Downing said he had not yet seen Lynch's Instagram video.Asked how he felt about Lynch working out with a high school team during his suspension, Downing said, "To be honest with you, I'm so focused on this situational Thursday.We have third down, red zone, all of that going in today.I was dialed in on Buffalo."I don't really know what it was.I know that he loves football and he's a football junkie.I wouldn't expect anything different.We're excited to go put on a good showing with Buffalo and meet up with him after that."The Raiders play at the Buffalo Bills on Sunday and will fly to Florida after the game and spend the week practicing at the IMG Academy in Bradenton before playing the Miami Dolphins on Nov. 5.Head coach Jack Del Rio did not speak Thursday, but he was asked Wednesday about when and how Lynch would rejoin the Raiders."We've got people that will handle that part," Del Rio said."Right now, we're just focusing on Buffalo."Lynch has rushed for 266 yards and two touchdowns on 72 carries for a career-low 3.7 yards per rush.
Hate: Fantasy football picks, sleepers, busts for Week 8:::::In Week 4 of this season, I wrote a "Love/Hate" column with this premise: I sent a text to a bunch of my friends and colleagues here at ESPN and here's what the text said: Editor's Picks Week 8 fantasy football rankings Fantasy football rankings from Matthew Berry, Field Yates, Mike Clay, Eric Karabell and Tristan Cockcroft for Week 8 of the NFL season.Best, worst matchups at all fantasy positions Matchups are a driving force behind weekly lineup decisions in fantasy football.Here are the most and least favorable matchups at QB, RB, WR and TE for Week 8 in the NFL.Top streaming options for fantasy football Week 8 Which widely available players should you pick up and start for Week 8?Our experts compile the best options at every position.2 Related Doing a goofy thing for my column tomorrow where I am asking various colleagues to ask me one question -- a self-made interview, if you will -- and I will answer them in my column with attribution.So, if you have a moment, can you ask me one question?Ask anything you want ... about me, about fantasy, about you, about literally anything you might be slightly curious about me or anything else.I'll print under your name and answer.That cool?I got so many amazing questions that, well, we had to cut some of them for length back in Week 4.But the column was well received and I wanted to do something light this week after the past few weeks.(Thank you again for all the messages that keep coming in.I will get to all of them eventually, I swear.It means so very much to me.)Anyway, here are some more of the unedited questions I got back and my responses.Eric Karabell (ESPN Senior Writer, Fantasy Hall of Famer): If your child said he or she wanted to follow your footsteps into the fantasy life as writer and personality, what would you say?TMR: Great question.The boys all play fantasy, though none seem obsessed with it the way I was when I was 14 (and playing in my first game).Obviously, I would support them as much as possible and tell them I would help however I could.But you want your kids to be happy and I have to believe entering this field, where people have such a strong opinion of me (both positive and negative), would be tough on anyone with my last name.So I'd warn them about that, I'd tell them they need to be great, because there is certainly a lot more competition, and analysis has gotten far more advanced than when I was starting out (and while my name might get them in the door, if they aren't any good they won't last long).And finally, I would tell them to read this column I wrote a few years ago about how to break into the industry.Trey Wingo (NFL Live host, upcoming Golic & Wingo radio show, voice of a robot on an ESPN2 show I like a lot): What was your favorite line that you ever wrote for any of the shows that you worked on?TMR: Another tough one.I spent 15 years in Hollywood and wrote on more than 100 episodes of sitcoms, plus a lot of movies that never got made (and, ahem, one that did).A lot of it runs together.The two things I co-wrote overall that I loved the most was a pilot for a reboot of "The Muppet Show" -- I am a Muppet freak.Maybe you've seen a show recently that seems to be inspired by it.I wrote about that here -- and a screenplay called "Undercover Elvis," which was an action comedy with the following premise: "What if all the crazy insane stuff you know about Elvis actually makes sense once you realize he's actually the world's greatest secret agent?"We wrote it more than 15 years ago, before similar ideas came about and we got universal praise for the script at the time.But my favorite line that I can remember is a dumb one.We were in the writer's room for "Married ... With Children" and we were doing a scene between Al and Griff (who worked at the show store with him).It was an insult-off, each of them going back and forth with each other, each insult more outrageous than the last.And we couldn't get out of it, because the lines were so good it led to this point where you couldn't go past and we couldn't just end it.We were so stumped, especially since there are only so many insults you can use.We must have been on that joke for an hour, the whole room pitching different insults to end this scene.Eventually, I pitched, after Griff and Al deliver a string of amazing insults back and forth, this happens: Griff (stumped): Oh yeah?Well ... your mama.Al: My wife!So, so dumb and yet, cracks me up to this day.Brought the house down on show night, too.Watch The Fantasy Show every weekday The Fantasy Show with Matthew Berry airs at 5 p.m.ET on ESPN2 every weekday.We will, however, be on ESPN on Mondays during the season.There are also late night re-airs (check your listings and set those DVRs) and replays are always available on WatchESPN by clicking on the NFL tab.Tedy Bruschi (ESPN NFL Analyst, legend): In all the fantasy leagues you've been a part of, what victory gave you the best feeling?TMR: There were some "expert" leagues while I was trying to establish myself and there have been some nice big-money wins before I got to ESPN (I don't really play for money these days), including one that helped me buy my first wife an engagement ring, but probably the best feeling was winning the "ESPN War Room" league that we play here internally.Many of the faces you watch every day (Trey, Adam Schefter, Chris Mortensen, Field Yates, Stephania Bell and so on), along with NFL producers and former NFL players.It's a 16-team league and almost everyone in the league talks to players and coaches every day as part of their job.So it's super competitive, it's 16 teams and I'm just the guy with some nerdy stats.Because I'm the fantasy guy, I'm always the big target in every league I play in, so to win that league, against super-smart people who are great, plugged-in players that I have so much respect for?That was awesome.Wendi Nix (NFL Live host): What would do for a living if you weren't a fantasy analyst?TMR: Well, I was a screenwriter in a previous life and I enjoyed aspects of that, but if it all went away today I would probably be an entrepreneur.I love the challenge of building something.I had a blast building my old Talented Mr. Roto site and I do it a bit on the side now with the Fantasy Life website and app.I really enjoy the challenges of that, so I'd probably do that.Also, weird, but I have this idea of one day writing a Broadway musical.Just a weird thing I'm sort of fascinated by, despite the fact I don't write music.It would be a twist on the musical, of course, because my mind is wired weird, but yeah, that would be fun to try one day.Basically, I enjoy being creative and solving problems.Kevin Neghandhi (SportsCenter anchor): What was your most satisfying sleeper pick of all time?(The one that you took a big gamble on and it turned out to be right.)TMR: Tough one.Lots come to mind, including two recent ones that I'm particularly fond of.I was all-in on Kareem Hunt this year, even before Spencer Ware's injury, and last year I was hyping Terrelle Pryor in Cleveland (a QB-turned-WR?For the Browns?)and people thought I was nuts, but he wound up as a top-20 WR.But I've made a zillion calls, good and bad.So if I have to pick one, probably my favorite would be Week 5 of 2009.It is Sunday morning, we are on Fantasy Football Now and we get word that Cowboys WR Roy Williams was a surprise inactive.And I said people needed to pick up and start a young wideout they'd never heard of named Miles Austin.Talented kid, all he needed was a chance and today, against Kansas City, was his chance.All morning long, I'm out on a limb for him and this is fairly early in my ESPN career, so I am still trying to establish credibility.That day, Austin goes for 10 receptions, 250 yards and two touchdowns.Giddy up.Dianna Russini (NFL reporter): Have you ever had an NFL athlete give you a hard time about your "predictions"?TMR: Not that much, actually.Maybe it's because I'm not around that many players or maybe they just don't care (or understand) fantasy in a way to get upset.I've actually gotten more thanks from players who weren't well known on the national stage and I would mention them or give them some pub.I can tell you that at different ESPN parties, both Steven Jackson (when he was with the Rams) and Matthew Stafford (early in his career) both have given me good-natured crap multiple times over the years about comments I made about them early in their careers.Both are great guys to meet in person.Matthew Berry's Fantasy Life By fantasy players, for fantasy players.As a gift or just for yourself, gear up and show your pride about the game we all love.-- TMR Michael Smith (The Six): What's your favorite thing to do with your kids?TMR: Great question.I love doing anything with them ... and it's tough, because I have five.The 19-year-old is in college now, and now that's he's an adult, my wife and I actually love going to dinner with him and his longtime girlfriend.It's nice to have more of a normal conversation rather than parent-to-kid type talk.The 17-year-old likes a lot of the same shows my wife and I do, so we often watch "Big Brother" (during the summer -- Paul got jobbed!)together.The three of us now have another drama show we watch and love together, though I am not going to say which one, because we are two episodes behind and I don't want you guys spoiling anything.Any time I can take the 13-year-old fishing or to a game is great.He's an avid fisherman and sports freak, so whether it's picking out a fishing rod or bait (I know nothing, he teaches me) or just seeing a game, that's always fun.And with my twin daughters, who just turned 6, well, anything.They are still excited when I come home, you know?Happy to have me push them on a swing.Anything.Seeing the world through their eyes is always magical.Michele Steele (ESPN reporter): I got my 23andMe results back recently.Do I have the musculature of an elite power athlete yes or no?TMR: Obviously.Michele: I have a genetic muscle composition common in ELITE POWER ATHLETES.I just want everyone to know.TMR: This made me laugh.I love Michele Steele.I love all my friends, actually.Thank you to all who participated!And I still had some left over, so who knows ... there may be a Part III at some point!Let's get to it.As always, thank you to Jacob Nitzberg of ESPN Stats & Information, and "Thirsty" Kyle Soppe of ESPN Fantasy for their help.My weekly reminder that this column is written in the middle of the week, often before all the injury news and other mitigating factors are in, so please, always check my rankings on Sunday morning, as those are my definitive answers about who I would start over whom.This column is geared toward PPR leagues (ESPN's default format) and is about players I believe will exceed or fall short of weekly expectations, whatever those may be.Here we go: Quarterbacks I love in Week 8 Cam Newton averaged 26.6 fantasy points per game in Weeks 4-6, but just 10.2 per game in his other four games.Which Cam will we get on Sunday?Daniel Bartel/Icon Sportswire Cam Newton, Panthers: In the very small sample size of Cam Newton after a 2017 news conference issue, he's elite that weekend.Maybe he's extra motivated, maybe he's just a really good quarterback or maybe, just maybe, it's one game we are cherry-picking.Real talk, however, is I like Cam this week against a Bucs squad that allows 20 points per game to opposing QBs.They've allowed top-four fantasy QB finishes to Eli Manning, Case Keenum and Carson Palmer this season, and part of their issue is getting to the QB.The Bucs are dead last in the NFL in pressure percentage, a number that is unlikely to get better after facing the mobile Newton.Not for nothing, but Cam is completing 66.5 percent of his passes this season when not under pressure.He's coming off back-to-back games with 50-plus rushing yards, which makes him an easy top-six play for me this week.Others receiving votes: You already were starting Carson Wentz in season-long leagues, but against a 49ers team that has given up the second-most yards per attempt the past five weeks, he's worth paying for in DFS, too.... Jameis Winston is averaging more than 344 passing yards per game over his past four full games, and he should have another nice game against a Panthers squad that is blitzing at the second-highest rate in the league.Since the start of last season, Winston leads the NFL in touchdown passes against the blitz.... Tyrod Taylor certainly does not have the most talented receiving corps around, but that should be OK against a Raiders squad that is the only team in the NFL without an interception on defense, that has allowed 10 passing TDs and a 68.9 percent completion rate, fourth highest in the league.... Those going streaming this week should consider Andy Dalton, who has multiple touchdown passes in three of four games under Bill Lazor and gets a struggling Indy team that is allowing the second-most passing yards a game and sixth-most points to opposing quarterbacks during the same time frame (since Week 3)....If you're still searching after Dalton, Case Keenum gets Cleveland, potentially Stefon Diggs back and the chance to impress London.You could do worse and probably have.Quarterbacks I hate in Week 8 It's hard to hate anyone this week with so many guys banged up and six teams on a bye, but I will say, I am less enthused about ... Matt Ryan, Falcons: Disappointing is probably the kindest thing I could say about Ryan's fantasy season so far, especially since he was drafted fourth among quarterbacks.Unfortunately, I don't love his chances at a big game on Sunday.The game is on the road, where Ryan has traditionally played worse and while Josh McCown has been surprising everyone, you'll never guess who else is not nearly as terrible as you think.Did you guess the Jets' defense?You looked ahead, didn't you?It's the Jets' defense that has the third-most interceptions this season and is allowing opponents to complete passes at the ninth-lowest rate in the NFL.Ryan has five (of six) games this season without multiple touchdown passes, so it's hard to generate much excitement for him here.He's merely a midtier QB2, even in a tough bye week.Others receiving votes: Ben Roethlisberger certainly looked better last week than he has, but he's not out of the woods yet.The Steelers hit the road to face the Lions (#RoadBen alert!), a team that has played pretty well at home this year (other than getting lit up by Cam Newton).The Lions are in the top 10 in terms of fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks and they've had two weeks to prepare for this game.Big Ben is merely a QB2 until we see it with more consistency....Even in a desperate week, I feel you'll have better streaming options than Jacoby Brissett, who goes on the road to face a Bengals squad that is getting pressure on opposing QBs at the second-highest rate.Behind a shaky offensive line, that's, what's the phrase ... not ideal.Running backs I love in Week 8 Jay Ajayi, Dolphins: The always dangerous Thursday night guy, but I am putting him here because I am the only one of our rankers with Ajayi in the top five this week.So, by Friday morning I have a chance to be more wrong than others.During the past three weeks, Ajayi is tied with Melvin Gordon for the second-most touches in the league (behind Le'Veon Bell) and that volume should continue against a Ravens defense that has allowed a RB to reach double-digit fantasy points in each of the past six games, and has allowed a 100-yard rusher in three of the past four games.Joe Mixon has scored double-digit PPR fantasy points just twice this season, but the matchup doesn't get much better than Sunday versus Indianapolis.Joe Sargent/Getty Images Others receiving votes: You had me at San Francisco.I expect the Eagles to be up big in this game and running in the second half against a Niners squad that has allowed a running back to reach double-digit fantasy points in all seven games this season.In fact, the 10 total RBs to score double-digit fantasy points vs. San Francisco is the most in the league this season.So I expect both Wendell Smallwood -- the 49ers have given up the most receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns to opposing running backs this year, too -- and LeGarrette Blount (I think he scores) to be top-20 plays this week....Speaking of bad defenses, the Colts have given up the most rushing touchdowns in the league this season, so, you know, Joe Mixon, if ever there were a week ... Game flow should work in Mixon's favor here as well.... With the passing game for Baltimore close to nonexistent and the Dolphins' line playing well and getting pressure, expect even more quick dump-offs for Javorius Allen, who now has 31 catches in the past six weeks.The only running backs with more during that stretch: Christian McCaffrey and James White....It's always a little dangerous to trust a Patriots running back, but with 25 touches during the past two weeks, I'll roll the dice with Dion Lewis as a flex play against a Chargers team allowing 4.9 yards per carry this season, second most in the NFL.Running backs I hate in Week 8 Doug Martin, Buccaneers: Just like quarterbacks (or any position for that matter), it's hard to really "hate" any running back matchup this week.It's very ugly out there, so this week especially, anyone with a pulse, you know?But I have Martin just outside of my top 20 for the same reason I like Jameis Winston this week.I believe Tampa throws here, not runs, as the most rushing yards by a player vs. Carolina this season is 67 (LeGarrette Blount in Week 6).The Panthers have allowed the 10th-fewest yards per rush to opposing RBs this season (3.6) and the second-fewest yards before contact per carry to opposing RBs (1.32).Obviously there's always a chance he scores, but Martin is merely a flex for me this week.Others receiving votes: The most rushing yards by any player in a game against Cleveland this season is 66 (Javorius Allen in Week 2) and the Browns have allowed only two rushing touchdowns to running backs this season and none since Week 3, so I'm not sold on Latavius Murray's chances at a repeat performance this Sunday.Remember, Murray was averaging just 2.37 yards per carry prior to last week....Even in a bye-week situation, I can't see using any Seattle running back until we get some sign of success, so I'm trying to look elsewhere if I have Eddie Lacy or Thomas Rawls.... After being out-snapped last week by Marlon Mack, Frank Gore has expected game flow and a tough matchup with Cincy's eighth-ranked run defense the past four weeks to contend with.... Man, it is brutal out there.Sorry I don't have more names for you, but honestly ... anyone with a pulse this week.Pass-catchers I love in Week 8 Demaryius Thomas is still looking for his first touchdown of the season.This could be the week, as he hopes to bounce back from a disappointing Week 7.Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports Demaryius Thomas, Broncos: I know it's been an up-and-down season for Thomas, but I like him quite a bit on Monday night.The Chiefs defense has allowed a league-high 13 wide receiver touchdowns this season, including 11 in just the past four weeks.With Emmanuel Sanders not playing or limited with injury, I expect an even heavier target share for Thomas, and, as Mike Clay points out in his excellent WR/CB matchup column, Thomas should run about half his routes against Terrance Mitchell, at least based on Thomas' 2017 usage.Well, as Mike points out, players who have lined up against Mitchell have been targeted 69 times (second most), racked up 613 receiving yards (most), scored five touchdowns (second most) and have 127 fantasy points (most).Others receiving votes: It's been an inconsistent year for Alshon Jeffery as well, especially considering how well Wentz and the Eagles' offense is playing.But Jeffery is worth the price in daily, as well against a Niners squad that has given up a receiving score to a wide receiver in six of seven games this season and has allowed four receivers to reach 100 yards.I'd say on Sunday, Jeffery has a good shot at making it five....Speaking of good matchups, the Patriots have allowed a touchdown to an opposing tight end in five of seven games this season.With his snaps continuing to increase, I like the Chargers' Hunter Henry this week as a top-10 play.... Minnesota's Kyle Rudolph is the latest winner of "who gets to play tight end against the Browns."...Carolina's Devin Funchess has cooled off a bit, but with at least eight targets in five straight games in a matchup you know I like Cam Newton in, I'm back on Funchess....So far, Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky hasn't thrown that much, but against the Saints he's probably gonna have to.Enter TE Zach Miller, who has received 12 of 42 targeted passes from Trubisky (28.6 percent), and when lining up in the slot this season, Miller has received 22 out of 54 targets.Small sample size and all, but that's still a 40.7 percent target share against a Saints team that allows the third-most yards and touchdowns to the slot this season.Miller is firmly on the TE2 radar this week....Assuming he plays, JuJu Smith-Schuster will see an increased target and snap share with Martavis Bryant not expected to play for Pittsburgh, and with CB Darius Slay having his hands full with Antonio Brown, JuJu should see some favorable coverage.Pass-catchers I hate in Week 8 For the last time, also slim pickings here with six teams off this week and, of the teams that are playing, many have bad quarterbacks, but: Will Fuller V, Texans: Fuller has been red-hot since making his return to the field, but the scoring rate is unsustainable, considering the lack of targets he gets.Because he's expected to play a lot of his snaps against Richard Sherman on Sunday, it doesn't appear likely Fuller gets into the end zone against a Seahawks team that has allowed just four wide receiver scores in its past nine games, dating back to last year (ding!).In the past four weeks, Seattle is the No.1 scoring defense in the NFL, making Fuller merely a WR4 for me this week.Others receiving votes: As you can tell, I'm down on the Colts this week, meaning it should be another long Sunday for T.Y.Hilton and Donte Moncrief, as the Bengals, among many other impressive stats, allow the lowest overall completion percentage to wide receivers this season....The Bucs allow the seventh-fewest receptions per game to opposing tight ends this season.In fact, only two tight ends have more than two receptions in a game against them this season.The matchup, along with his recent quiet production, makes Ed Dickson a tough play as anything other than a touchdown-dependent TE2.... One of the Redskins' pass-catchers will have a good game.I just don't know who it will be, as Kirk Cousins spreads the ball around.So other than Jordan Reed, it's hard to trust Terrelle Pryor Sr. or Jamison Crowder.I do like Josh Doctson, but until we see it, he's hard to trust blindly.... What can I say?Very bleak week.Defenses to consider streaming in Week 8 Cincinnati Bengals (vs. IND, 43 percent available); Atlanta Falcons (at NYJ, 75 percent available); New Orleans Saints (vs. CHI, 52 percent available).Matthew Berry, The Talented Mr. Roto, is all Q&A'd out.He is the creator of RotoPass.com, the founder of the Fantasy Life app and a paid spokesperson for DRAFT.
Growing up Grier: The nation's most prolific QB and his way-more-famous brothers:::::MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Without YouTube, Justin Bieber might never have become a star.Without MySpace, Adele's voice might never have been noticed.And without Vine, Will Grier probably would've remained more famous than his two younger brothers.The quarterback of Davidson Day's football team, Will was the big man on campus.He had, after all that previous season, passed for a national record 837 yards and 10 touchdowns in a state playoff game.But, in 2013, driving to their high school in the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, with his brothers Nash and Hayes, Will's standing as the most well-known sibling of the family changed in the blink of a six-second Vine video.Nash had downloaded the app shortly after its release, and began making videos, which usually featured his brothers and especially starred his then-4-year-old half-sister, Skylynn.To this day, nobody really knows how or why, but those Vines went viral, making Nash, then only 15, another overnight internet sensation.A post shared by Nash Grier (@nashgrier) on Dec 13, 2013 at 1:39pm PST "Nash was in the front seat refreshing his page, and his follower count, it was unreal," Will said."He'd hit refresh and it would be 22,000.And he'd hit refresh again and it would be 25,000."We couldn't conceptualize what was happening."Will has moved on, as the big man of another campus.Having put a messy departure from Florida behind him, he has propelled West Virginia into the thick of the Big 12 title race, as he leads the country with 26 touchdown passes.Yet even though he's one of the top quarterbacks in college football, Will toils in relative anonymity compared with his three siblings.Nash went on to become the most recognizable personality on Vine with social media followings rivaling Bieber.Hayes followed Nash's path, and as an internet star himself, became the youngest male contestant ever on "Dancing With The Stars."Not even a teenager yet, Skylynn has 1.2 million followers on Instagram.In 2014, Time Magazine named Nash one of its "25 Most Influential Teens," alongside Sasha and Malia Obama and Kylie and Kendall Jenner.The following year, the magazine selected him one of the "30 most influential people on the internet," along with Barack Obama, Beyonc, Jimmy Fallon, Taylor Swift, J.K. Rowling and Kim Kardashian.Editor's Picks From 7th-grade phenom to failed QB to elite receiver He was offered a scholarship by Lane Kiffin at age 13 and considered a bust by 18.But now, at 21, David Sills has reinvented himself as one of the best wide receivers in the country for West Virginia."If we walked down the street," Will said, "I'd be the least famous, completely."Yet while Nash and Hayes are living the celebrity life in Los Angeles, Will is living a rather quiet one, especially for a star college athlete.He has a wife, Jeanne, and an 11-month-old daughter, Eloise.That has prompted his West Virginia teammates to affectionately dub him, "Old Man.""I, 100 percent, feel like an old man, but I love it," said Will, laughing."I watch the news, I'm up early.But when it comes to the team, I'm still one of the guys."One of the guys.And one part of a unique family.As one of the top quarterback recruits in the country, Will cast an enormous shadow over his younger brothers."I looked up to him big-time," said Hayes, who wore the jersey number 7 because Will did."I wanted to be just like him growing up."At one point, Nash was introduced before one of his lacrosse games as "Will Grier's little brother."Even though Will would pass for a national-best 77 touchdowns his senior year, the script was beginning to flip.Their father Chad, also Will's high school coach, first noticed the shift when he handed a sporting goods cashier his credit card, and caught him inspecting the last name.Chad assumed he was going to invoke Will.Instead, the cashier asked if he was related to Nash.Within months, Nash's Vine following had ballooned past a million, which gained him an appearance on "Good Morning America," where he hung out with Sylvester Stallone on air.The Grier brothers idolized Will's success playing football.Grier family That was only the beginning.Parade Magazine named Will its player of the year, and invited him to a banquet in New York City that would be hosted by Pro Football Hall of Fame lineman Anthony Muoz.Afterward, Will, Nash and their father were walking through Times Square when they noticed a pack of girls dashing right for them.For a moment, Chad thought they were coming for an autograph from the son who had just been honored as the best high school football player in the country.Instead, they made a beeline for the other."It was surreal, the things that were happening," Chad said."Sometimes you go: Is this real?Is this really happening?"How real it was had hit Nash a couple weeks earlier when he had gone to Iceland with his grandmother to promote a new app.He posted a Vine that he would be at a mall in Reykjavik later that afternoon.When he arrived, there were several thousand teenage fans already waiting."It ended up getting crazy," said Nash, who got separated from his grandma in the crowds."We had to basically evacuate the place, we didn't really get to talk to anybody.We showed up and it was chaos."As prolific as Will was as a quarterback, he said Hayes was the "most naturally gifted athlete" in the family.But Hayes gave up sports to join Nash on the "Magcon" meet-and-greet tours, where his own celebrity surged.He currently plays Noodle Nelson on the Hulu TV show "Freakish."Last year, he released a novel, "Hollywood Days With Hayes.""Nash was doing all this stuff like traveling," Hayes said."I was getting in his videos a little bit.... And I loved doing that, because it was so cool to me.I was like, maybe I can take this social media thing to the next level."While the careers of Nash and Hayes were exploding on the internet, so too was Will's on the gridiron.As a redshirt freshman with the Gators, he went 5-0 as a starter, culminating with a dramatic comeback against Tennessee in which he threw two touchdowns in the game's final four minutes.Two weeks later, he was summoned to coach Jim McElwain's office.Soon, Will's career at Florida would effectively be finished.Will Muschamp had recruited Will to Florida, but Muschamp had been fired after Will's first year, and replaced with McElwain.Unaware anything might be wrong, Will assumed McElwain just wanted to chat with his quarterback.Instead, Will was told he had tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance found in an over-the-counter supplement.The penalty of the offense carried a one-year suspension."I was blindsided," Will said."I had no idea I was doing anything wrong."When Will first showed up at Florida, he weighed 188 pounds.He wasn't crazy about the Gatorade-based protein drinks offered at the stadium, because of their sugar and carbohydrates.Knowing he'd need to gain weight to withstand the pounding of the SEC, he visited a nutrition store in Gainesville in search of protein powder.Will says he checked online to make sure what he bought wasn't banned by the NCAA, but he never double-checked with Florida's training staff."I'm by the book, I follow the rules, I thought I was following the rules," he said."But I was young, I was careless with it."McElwain told reporters that Will would be allowed to continue practicing with the team, then, according to Will, told him to take some time at home in North Carolina.Upon returning to Gainesville, Will didn't feel welcomed.At Florida, Grier had a 5-0 record before being suspended.Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports "[McElwain] didn't really invite me back to the stadium, and it felt weird the times I would go up there," Will said."There was this idea that I knew what I was doing, which was not the case.The players would come over to my house, but it was weird to go to the stadium with the staff.The dynamic was just off."Will even offered to play scout-team quarterback the week of the SEC championship game to help prepare Florida's defense for Alabama.He was turned down for that, too."He loved being a Gator.He loved the place, the school, the people, he was proud to be a Gator.He was all in," Chad said."I didn't realize he had been ostracized.I underestimated the impact of what he was going through, and the fact he wasn't doing good.He was in a dark place."After revealing to his dad that he'd been cut off, Will asked if he'd come with him to meet with McElwain "to figure this out."When McElwain showed up more than two hours late to their appointment, Chad knew it was a bad sign.McElwain said Will was welcome to stay, but also suggested a fresh start elsewhere might not be a bad idea.After the meeting, Chad told his son, "I don't think he wants you.'"McElwain later insinuated that the Griers had asked for a "guarantee" that Will would get the job back once he was eligible to return.They vehemently contest that."I was expecting a 10-minute meeting: 'Hey, we care about your son, he's important to the program,'" Chad said."Just wanted to know he was wanted there, because there was no plan.How are you going to help and develop him, even though he's going to have to sit out?"The last thing we asked for was a guarantee."As rocky as the first meeting with McElwain went, Will wasn't quite ready to let go."I wanted to stay....So I went back and met with him, just one-on-one," Will said."But it felt like this staff wanted to move on, which is fine, there's no hard feelings toward that.They have their own recruits, their own guys."Toward the end, when Will agreed to leave, McElwain printed out prepared releases for schools he could transfer to, which precluded the SEC, rival Florida State and future opponent Michigan.And, as Will put it, "left it at that."Nash has been to the Grammys, the White House Correspondents' Dinner and even Dolce & Gabbana fashion week in Milan; Will plays board games, like Bananagrams, for fun.meet my niece, Eloise A post shared by Hayes (@hayesgrier) on Jan 3, 2017 at 3:47pm PST Hayes has palled around with Nick Carter and Chaka Khan at "Dancing With The Stars"; Will spends evenings studying, or watching Netflix with Jeanne.Nash and Hayes have lived in Hollywood; Will lives with his family in a townhome away from West Virginia's campus."It's a crazy concept.We live such different lifestyles," Hayes said."But it's awesome.Everyone is so proud of him."With a family at home, Will has given up drinking and partying.But he has a pingpong table to entice his teammates to still come over and hang out."They know they're not going to see me out in these clubs and bars or anything," he said."Obviously, I want to spend every minute with my daughter that I can.But they know if they ever need anything, I'm there for them."Will and Jeanne have been there for each other, as well.The two were getting serious at Florida just as his football career there came crashing down.A couple months later, Jeanne found out she was pregnant."That shook both of our worlds," Will said."We had to make a decision.But it was a no-brainer for both of us.We felt like we had a responsibility, and this was a sign that we needed to commit to this and make this work.It was important for us to do this thing as a family and she's been awesome, very supportive.It's been a good deal."After a second visit to Morgantown, the two committed to West Virginia together.Over the summer, he proposed, and Jeanne gave birth to Eloise in the fall."I always laugh because I get my parenting advice from Will," said West Virginia offensive coordinator Jake Spavital, who became a dad over the summer."He's a great father and great husband."Will has been a great quarterback, too.He's averaging more than 350 passing yards per game while completing two-thirds of his passes.He also has 21 more touchdown passes than Florida's quarterback contingent combined."We believed in him and his abilities," said West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen, whose team is 5-2 and ranked 22nd in the polls."It's worked out pretty damn good."It also has worked out for the entire Grier clan, as West Virginia game weekends have become a reunion of sorts for the family, including Will's dad; his stepmom, Nila; his mom, Elizabeth Grier-Floyd; his stepfather, Johnnie Floyd; Skylynn; Jeanne; Eloise; and even his two brothers.Nash flew in for the home opener, Nash and Hayes attended the Texas Tech game and both are planning to come back for Oklahoma State on Saturday."West Virginia games are like a holiday for us," Hayes said."We literally have the whole family there -- my dad's side, my mom's side, everyone."Sitting together in the stands, the family comprises an Instagram follower total that reaches 18 million.But in another way, it's also like high school.At least for a few hours, Will again is the family's biggest star."Going to West Virginia and watching him play and compete," Nash said, "it's one of my top three favorite things.It's insane."And I'm a superfan."
Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant has a new, post-basketball obsession:::::Text response times.That's all you need to look at on Kobe Bryant's phone to see how much he cares about being a businessman.At all hours of the night, Bryant is texting and listening to the latest returns from one of the companies he's invested in.He's putting in hours like he did on the basketball court.The same wiring that made him push his game to the limits has him focusing on board rooms when the rest of the world is sleeping."Text at 3 in the morning, and he responds a minute later," said Mike Repole, founder and chairman at BodyArmor, a sports drink brand that Bryant invested in in 2014."That's when I realized he was as psychotic as I was.I don't think either of us sleep.""We are obsessive," Bryant said."We wouldn't want to be doing anything other than what we are doing.That's where obsession comes in -- when you care about something 24 hours a day."In 2013, Bryant teamed up with investor Jeff Stibel to partner on investments.Three years later, the two announced a $100 million media, tech and data fund.Bryant says there's nothing to talk about or celebrate until they cash out of some of the companies they've invested in, which include a real estate data and analytics company and a restaurant reservation brand.But how hands-on Bryant is can be seen with BodyArmor.Last week, he attended the National Association of Convenience Stores conference in Chicago.Athletes who go to conferences are usually there to take pictures and sign autographs.Bryant will take a picture, but only after he's briefed on who he's being introduced to.Then he'll deliver his take on why this drink is different.Bryant hasn't just been along for the ride of BodyArmor's growth from $3 million in sales in 2012, when he first started talking about a deal, to the nearly $200 million today.He has contributed significantly, whether it be through storytelling, writing or inserting his former athlete's perspective on a product.He has also been dreaming every day to take a piece of the pie from the stalwarts in the category: Gatorade and Powerade.And it's more than that.Bryant's brain can process only being No.1 in the space, and he already has a year (2025) for when he hopes BodyArmor tops the sport drink giants."I told him from the start: Only one out of 100 brands make it and that we had a 1 percent chance," Repole said."What was sick about it was that somehow made him more excited.""When I was a kid, I had plenty of people telling me what the odds were for me to make the NBA," Bryant said."Worse than these."Bryant is an investor in BodyArmor, a sports drink company.BodyArmor Bryant is a gifted writer and storyteller, and he has more experience with advertising and marketing than most know.For years, while still playing, Bryant was a major partner in California-based ad firm Zambezi, but he chose to keep it quiet."The sports industry is very competitive," Bryant said."If everyone knew I was part of an agency, I'm not sure we would have got the business that we won."In 2009, when Bryant was in the NBA Finals, Zambezi wrote an ad for Dwight Howard and vitaminwater that ran during the games."I wrote that s---," Bryant said.His "Obsession is Natural" philosophy was turned into a BodyArmor commercial that he wrote and voiced earlier this year.His "Dear Basketball" poem that he penned for the Players Tribune at the start of his last season was turned into an animated short and has been critically acclaimed.He won't say the word "Oscar" because he doesn't want to jinx it, but odds are he has already thought of whom he'd thank."I got tired of telling people I loved business as much as I did basketball because people would look at me like I had three heads," Bryant said."But I do."When Repole talks to Bryant about the evolution of bottle caps, he might laugh, but he listens, absorbing how he did when he was learning basketball.Nike executives have long said that, of any of the athletes they work with on signature shoes, Kobe is the most demanding."He's obviously one of the most intense athletes on the court," Nike chairman and CEO Mark Parker said Wednesday at the company's Investor Day."But off the court, he's equally as intense.He's got a million ideas."It was Bryant who pushed Nike to change the basketball shoe game in 2008, when the two collaborated on a low top.Bryant pushed Nike as much as any athlete had."I'm a pain in the butt to work with sometimes," he said.The shoe was a success and helped Nike begin to adjust to a fashion world that was looking for a low-cut basketball sneaker."Nike really gets better with athletes that are demanding," Parker said."Rising to meet those expectations and exceed them have made us better."Bryant at a promotional event organized by Nike in Paris.Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images Being a student of this new game extends to his practice of calling on big names in business, from Oprah to Apple chief design officer Jony Ive, and studying how they work."I've found at the core of it is a love for what they are doing and also understand that, as leaders, it's their job to enhance what is around them," Bryant said."How they go about doing it, how they motivate and how they challenge is all different, but the end result is the same."Bryant's favorite book is "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho, in which a young boy is promised a future treasure by a soothsayer.In his quest for greater riches, which turns out to disappoint him, he learns more about enriching himself from within.Bryant's life now is very much about both finding riches to add to the roughly $500 million he grossed on and off the court during his career and directing his competitive might into business."He's going to be a lot better entrepreneur and at business than he was at basketball," Repole said."That's pretty scary."
Joe Girardi managed the Yankees the only way he knows:::::Joe Girardi stood outside his office after his final victory as manager of the New York Yankees, his state-trooper arms folded across his chest.He was up three games to two on the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series, and I asked him how much his legacy would change if he won a championship with his young and likable team.I asked him whether he realized he might become kinda lovable, like his predecessor Joe Torre, if he pulled off a parade with a Yankees team the rest of the country actually didn't despise."I don't ever worry about my legacy," Girardi said."When I think about my legacy, it's what I do with my family.That's what I worry about, because they're the people that really know me and understand....I don't ever worry so much about how people view me."I've been around enough coaches and athletes over 30-plus years to know when someone is giving the same answer publicly that he or she would give privately.And without a doubt, this was Joe Girardi's truth on and off the record.He's not a charmer or a storyteller or an easy figure to hug.He's a grinder with a binder out of East Peoria, Illinois, and he believes more than anything in an honest day's work.Girardi got that from his parents, Jerry and Angie.His father was a bricklayer, electrical supplies salesman, restaurant owner and grade school coach.His mother was a school psychologist who fought a vile disease with the heart of a thousand lions."Diagnosed with cancer when she was 43 and given three months to live," Girardi said in March of 2010."She lived with it six years.That's tough."The manager was sitting at a card table in his spring training office back then, growing more emotional by the syllable."My mom," he said with a sigh."She died 26 years ago, and I'll always remember her last words to me before she passed.She said, 'Just don't forget me.'"And no, he never did.Girardi grew emotional three times in my presence in his 10 years as Yankees manager -- talking about his mom, talking about his dad and thanking me for writing a story about his old man over the weekend when he died during the 2012 playoffs.Jerry, an Air Force man in the Korean War, had been a long-suffering victim of Alzheimer's."I saw what my father did just to feed us all," Girardi said."The toughness I saw in my parents showed me you have to work through adversity and not let it affect what you do."Jerry once broke his thumb trying to change a spigot on a bathtub, and it ended up bleeding all over the bathroom."But he taped it up and finished the job," Joe said."That's what my mom did, too.She finished the job.That's what I saw every day."Girardi was about family and work, work and family.He attacked his playing and managing careers with the same intensity with which he attacked his busboy duties at his family's restaurant, the same way he attacked wind sprints in high school football practice.As a Yankees catcher in 1996, the start of the Torre-Jeter-Rivera dynasty, he made the cover of Sports Illustrated -- closer John Wetteland was pictured jumping into his arms.Joe's boyhood friend, Jeff Giebelhausen, happened to be driving by the Girardis' home a few days later, and sure enough there was Joe breaking a sweat as he was cleaning up his old man's yard."Seeing him with rake in hand," Giebelhausen said, "I think Joe was enjoying that moment as much as he enjoyed winning the World Series."The ruling Steinbrenners and general manager Brian Cashman adored Girardi's work ethic, and the GM picked the former catcher over franchise icon Don Mattingly to succeed Torre.Mattingly predicted that succeeding Torre in the Bronx would be tantamount to succeeding UCLA legend John Wooden in Westwood, and Girardi found out his runner-up wasn't wrong.Torre wasn't the greatest tactician of all time, but he majored in the human heartbeat.Nobody could ever manage the big-city noise and the relentless failure that defines the game of baseball like Joseph Paul Torre.Torre's strength was Girardi's weakness.Yankees executives thought Girardi logged more hours than Torre and that he rightfully embraced the new-school analytics they wanted emphasized over old-school instinct.In his first year, 2008, when he failed to extend the franchise's 13-year playoff run in the final season of the old Yankee Stadium, Girardi was a tense and distant figure who had uneasy relationships with players and the media.Cashman and the team's PR man, Jason Zillo, urged him to become more user-friendly and consider some of the personality tweaks Giants coach Tom Coughlin used to move from almost-fired tyrant to embraceable Super Bowl champ.In danger of getting himself run out of town, Girardi agreed in the spring of 2009 to loosen up.He called Zillo into his office for a 90-minute meeting and broke out a yellow legal pad filled with notes on the kinder, gentler tweaks he was prepared to make.The Yankees won the World Series that fall, and the hundreds of millions of dollars they'd spent on free agents represented the chief reason why.But Girardi's softer approach helped, and it was noticed.Just as his failure to take additional steps along those lines was noticed.Ultimately general manager Brian Cashman, left, decided he wanted the Yankees' young stars to be nurtured and further developed by someone else.Kathy Willens/AP Photo He lost himself in his job, devoting hour after hour and day after day to the study of video and stats and tendencies.Girardi prepared more like a football coach, and, hey, he was only following Torre's instructions.After the Yankees beat the Astros in Game 5 last week, Girardi remembered the day he was offered the biggest job in the sport."I called Joe and asked him in a sense for his blessing," Girardi said, "and he said, 'I'm going to tell you right now: You have to be yourself.'And that's what I've always tried to do.I can't be Joe Torre.My personality is different from Joe's....I just had to do it my way, and that's what I've tried to do."Girardi's way was good for a Yankees record, over 10 seasons, of 200 games north of .500.He didn't win a second championship (Torre won four), but he did lead this year's team to places it wasn't expected to reach.The Yankees were supposed to be about tomorrow.They were supposed to be about Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez and Greg Bird growing old together and starting their own dynasty in a year or two.Girardi deserves his share of credit for expediting the process and landing his team one victory short of the World Series.The man who hired him, Cashman, decided he wanted those young stars to be nurtured and further developed by someone else.I'd spent a lot of time around the Yankees from 1995 through 2015, and after reconnecting with them during the ALCS, it became clear that some in the organization still weren't thrilled with the relationship -- or lack thereof -- between the manager's office and the clubhouse.The thumbs-down Yankees sure looked loose and fun during October, but the notion that the players won the Cleveland series for Girardi after his review-system blunder in Game 2 wasn't one management felt was based in fact.As it turned out, Girardi needed to win the World Series to save his job and prove he could reach his players the way his bosses wanted them reached.These are pinstriped millennials, after all.Cashman praised Girardi's "tireless work ethic" after firing him Thursday, and Girardi responded in his own statement by thanking people up and down the organization, by thanking the fans and, yes, by thanking the news media, too.He's a good man, Joe Girardi.He won the World Series in 2009, and on the delirious ride back to suburbia, he stopped on a highway to help at an accident scene and stayed with a woman until the police arrived.But as Yankees manager, he wasn't warm or personable.Trying to wrap your arms around him was like trying to wrap your arms around a thorn bush.His college coach at Northwestern, Ron Wellman, once said of his former player, "Joe's not going to sacrifice his values and his beliefs for anything or anyone.He's going to bring a consistency and intensity every day."That intensity wore people out in the Bronx, and that's OK. Girardi did a pretty damn good job.Good luck to the guy who can replace Bill Belichick the way Girardi replaced Torre.He's not worried about his baseball legacy, anyway.Girardi cared only to honor his dying mother and father by working his ass off.By those terms, he just earned another ticker-tape parade.
The simple truth in the Bronx: It was time for Joe to go:::::Although Joe Girardi was a good manager for the New York Yankees during his decade on the job, it was time for him to go -- for his sake and, to a lesser extent, for the franchises.After 10 years at the helm, Girardi is out in the Bronx.His four-year, $16 million contract has run out, and there will not be another one.He leaves behind a young, stacked roster that includes budding star Aaron Judge, a full farm system and very possibly a few championships rings.A dynasty is perhaps on the horizon at Yankee Stadium, and Girardi could have done a good enough job to lead it.A manager makes a difference, but never forget, Joe Torre became a genius only after he connected with the Core Four.Whoever is next for the Yankees already has the most important ingredient: a really talented, young roster.The possibilities?Rob Thomson, the teams bench coach, is well-respected inside and outside the organization.He would be the most likely internal candidate, though third-base coach Joe Espada has been impressive as well.Joe Girardi departs a Yankees team that he took to the postseason six times in 10 seasons.Shanna Lockwood/USA Today Sports Externally, the candidates are not as obvious, but GM Brian Cashman values someone who will use advanced metrics, has a good rapport in the clubhouse and can handle the New York media.This is probably a good move for Girardi; he's a man who always stresses family first, and he's leaving a job that has ground him down and kept him away from his loved ones for most of the year.If he had stayed, with one title in his back pocket and more possible, he might have had a chance to be a Hall of Fame manager, like the man he replaced.Instead, Girardi's time at the helm will be looked upon as solid but not spectacular.Girardi was never beloved like Torre was.Girardi might have had an all-time mess-up with his terrible decision not to ask for a replay review on a strikeout that was incorrectly called a hit batsman in Game 2 of the ALDS -- easily the lowest point of his managerial career.But more often than not, he made the right decisions (sorry, Twitter).As for Girardis players, they seemed rather indifferent about him, despite the win one for the skipper narrative trumpeted by some after Girardis division series failure.Girardis workmanlike approach to everything left him somewhat distant from the guys he led.He usually wouldnt reveal the essence of his conversations with his players to the media, and his players never really acted as if he spoke to them that much.Maybe their contact was more frequent than a media member could glean, but it didnt seem that way.With Girardi having no use for social media, the press, TV and radio were his conduit to fans, and his lack of openness left him largely unpopular toward the end of his tenure.ESPN Stats & Info Girardi was a good company man, though toward the end, he and Cashman didn't always agree.During the season, there was a clash over the ineffective Chris Carter, whom the Yankees' analytics staff thought of more highly than Girardi did.Girardi finally won, but sources said Cashman and Girardi didn't get along as well as they had in years past.There were times when Cashman seemed unsatisfied with how Girardi handled the media, recently and most notably after Girardi didnt immediately take full ownership after his ALDS Game 2 failure.Although Girardi did have a $200 million roster for a decade, he had to lead the team through some tough situations.He made the playoffs six times, steering the end of the Yankees Core Four dynasty and navigating the chaos that was Alex Rodriguez.Every time Girardis contract has been up, he has spoken about his family.There was a pull to go home and be with them.He has two daughters, one college-aged and one in middle school, and his son, Dante, is in high school and might be a future pro prospect.Girardi often stayed after games to throw BP to his son.If he doesnt pursue another job right now -- my guess is he wont -- there will be plenty of time for him to tutor his son.This will be a welcome change for Girardi.For so many years, the Yankees job seemed to wear on Girardi.He denied that he lost weight during the season, but he often looked different by August than he did in February.Interestingly enough and perhaps tellingly, this year Girardi seemed a bit calmer, more at ease.Maybe he knew this was it for him.He might be harder to replace than it appears.But this was the right time for him to go.
11 World Series home runs, 11 bad pitches?:::::Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy looks back on the home run he gave up to George Springer in the 11th inning and says he's feeling "numbness" now but that emotion will turn into "frustration."(0:33) The dominant story of this World Series -- a home run explosion that has acquainted most of America with the, uh, definitely not juiced baseball -- has camouflaged another feature of this Series: The pitching has been absolutely incredible.At least, during the other 138 at-bats that have not resulted in a home run, it has been incredible.Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers batters, who collectively hit .234/.307/.304 on non-homers during the regular season, have hit just .135/.199/.159 on non-homers in this series.Pitchers' WHIP in this World Series (including the homers) is 0.97, the same as Chris Sale's was this season.Both offenses punished the league in the regular season, giving opposing pitchers a 1.43 WHIP and 4.89 ERA.And in this series, the combined ERAs are just 3.92, despite an unprecedented frequency of homers.Of course, not allowing homers is one of the first things they teach in pitcher kindergarten.So we can't say the pitching has been great without addressing the "except for ..." qualifier.What are these homers coming on?Terrible pitches?Awful execution?Mistakes?Or is this just great hitting magnified by hot weather, historically strong lineups and a probably juiced baseball?Let's look at the 11 home run swings through Games 1 and 2 to see how many egregious mistakes we can count.Except when noted, "target" refers to the catcher's glove location at the start of the pitch, but be aware that catchers' visible targets don't always correlate precisely to where the pitcher is actually aiming.Count: 0-0 Pitch: Probably a cut fastball Target: Low/away These plots are all from the catcher's view, so that pitch is low and inside.How bad of a mistake was it?Not that bad.Keuchel almost always throws his cutter low and in to righties, which is usually the strongest indication of a pitcher's strengths and intentions.Brian McCann's glove was set up low and away, but I wouldn't be surprised if he and Keuchel actually wanted the pitch in, and the "target" was allowing for the pitcher's movement.A few inches further in than it ended up would be Keuchel's real sweet spot -- where opponents' batting averages drop by half when he gets it off the plate inside.But given the circumstances, Keuchel might have reasonably thought he was stealing a strike.Results aside, it looks like a pretty savvy pitch call: It's the very first pitch of the World Series, and Keuchel and McCann chose a pitch that (A) Keuchel can throw in the strike zone to get ahead, in case Taylor is taking all the way; (B) isn't the far, far, far more predictable sinker, just in case Taylor comes out hyped up and ready to sit on a pitch and ambush; and (C) isn't as dangerous when left up as the sinker, just in case Keuchel is a little overamped and takes a pitch or two to settle down.You can't "results aside" everything, though.Taylor hit the pitch about 450 feet.So, if nothing else, we can say it was one capable of being hit 450 feet.The pitch -- assuming it was a cutter -- didn't cut.(If it was a four-seam fastball, as some reports had it, it was unusually straight, according to PITCHf/x.)In execution, it was a pitch that should have been more surprising than it apparently was and that wasn't poorly located, but that didn't have any real sharpness to it.So how bad?Not that bad.If you described this pitch to me before it was thrown, I'd be shocked to find out it was hit 450 feet.Count: 1-1 Pitch: Fastball Target: Inner half or inside That's classified as "Zone 6" by PITCHf/x, which corresponds to the upper-inside ninth of the strike zone.Kershaw has had a lot of success throwing fastballs into Zone 6 in his career; similar pitches to righties have yielded a .368 slugging percentage, lower than six of the other eight squares in the strike zone, with one of his highest whiff/swing rates.Bregman, further, is a low-fastball hitter.But it's also just barely in Zone 6; that pitch is closer to the center of the strike zone than the edge of it.Kershaw is perhaps least predictable on 1-1.He throws his fastball, slider and curve with almost equal frequency in that count, so Bregman couldn't confidently sit on that velocity.That he turned around on that velocity up and in is tremendous hitting.Kershaw, a very demonstrative reactor on the mound, didn't immediately frown.It doesn't look like he immediately realized it was a mistake, or a home run.Not a great pitch, but he gets away with worse all the time.So how bad?Not that bad.Count: 1-2 Pitch: Cutter Target: Low and in Baseball Prospectus' Matt Trueblood broke this pitch down in excellent detail: The cutter up was not just a mistake, but a mistake that Keuchel had just made twice in the previous five pitches, and in a situation in which he should have been especially careful.It's also hard to believe that Turner managed to hit that pitch as high as he did and keep it from going foul.(It was his first up-and-in homer of the year, according to Inside Edge.)Keuchel's reaction: "Kind of frustrated at myself for not making a little bit better pitch."That seems right.It was a mistake, a poorly conceived pitch, but also no meatball.So how bad?Pretty bad, if not inevitable.Count: 2-1 Pitch: Slider Target: Inner half, down How bad a mistake?That's a true meatball, a middle-middle slider to a power hitter who had the platoon advantage.Verlander, behind in the count, might have been trying to steal a strike with the pitch, but we're in an era when more pitchers than ever are throwing more secondary pitches in more hitters' counts.(Including Verlander!)Pederson obviously wasn't fooled by the pitch, and the location couldn't have been worse.So how bad?Really bad.Count: 1-2 Pitch: Fastball Target: Outside corner In July 2016, Verlander threw a very similar pitch on the same count to Joe Mauer, and Mauer hit a home run to almost the same spot.But that pitch was 93 mph.Here, Verlander's fastball was 97.Move the pitch one more inch away and it would've been an absolutely perfect pitch.An extraordinary swing by Seager, and maybe the most impressive homer of this series.So how bad?Not bad.Very good.Count: 0-2 Pitch: Cutter Target: High If there's one problem with throwing the world's best pitch -- a pitch so good you can throw it almost 100 percent of the time, whether the count is 0-2 or 3-0 -- it's that the batter won't be fooled when you throw a terrible one.Batters have only hit .213 when Jansen has thrown a pitch down the middle over the past three years and have slugged only .340.But this was a flat cutter.According to PITCHf/x, Jansen threw only three that were flatter all night, one of which went for a hard single, another was a 102 mph groundout and the third was the pitch immediately preceding this home run.No need to really overthink this one.On 0-2, with a high target out of the strike zone, Jansen wasn't trying to throw a flat cutter in the middle of the strike zone to a power hitting left-hander.So how bad?Very bad.Count: 2-0 Pitch: Fastball Target: Not obvious; maybe middle-down Altuve's power, especially on fastballs, tends to come on the inner half: Sam Miller Fields caught a lot of the plate, but on 2-0 he didn't have a lot of good options.A 97 mph pitch away from Altuve's power zone might have been as good as any other.So how bad?Not a great pitch, but you'd probably bet "single up the middle" before you'd bet "tiebreaking homer."Count: 0-1 Pitch: Knuckle-curve Target: Just generally down If Correa had swung through it, I'm not sure we would've all gasped and said that Fields got away with one.But that's a pitch Fields wants to keep below the strike zone.His catcher patted the ground about 10 times before Fields delivered the pitch.He mostly succeeds when he does get it down, and he mostly fails when he doesn't.So how bad?Pretty bad, but not inevitable.Count: 2-1 Pitch: Fastball Target: Right where the dot in the plot below is How big a mistake was that?Just consider the catcher's target, which was set up to catch this without moving.Giles' fastball isn't really capable of mistakes.So how bad?Not great, probably not quite bad.Count: 2-1 Pitch: Slider, probably Target: Low and middle-away The home run came on pitch No.4, which is hidden behind the identical pitch No.3 in the plot above.It's probably the most confounding of all of these home run pitches -- an entire article could be written about what just these two pitches were and why they were thrown.They appear to be sliders, not cutters, despite the labeling in the plot.They had slider velocity and closer to slider vertical movement.But until about a month ago, McCarthy never threw sliders.The sliders he threw against San Francisco on Sept. 23 appear to be the first he had thrown since 2009.He throws tons of cutters.Yet, it was (we think), that brand-new slider he went to -- not once, but twice in this huge moment.With a runner on second and nobody out in the tie game, perhaps he was trying to throw a slower pitch, down in the zone, so that it would be harder for Springer to go the other way.That makes some sense!Springer certainly swung like he was intent on going the other way and pushing the runner over to third.Of the 11 home runs, this is the swing that looks least like a home run swing.Rather, Springer just sort of sliced it, and it carried and carried.This doesn't look like a great pitch.It's also baffling, particularly coming immediately after the exact same pitch.I hesitate to judge something that I don't understand.So how bad?It's not great.It might be very, very bad.It's still surprising Springer hit it out.Count: 1-0 Pitch: Fastball Target: Low, away A meatball.Of course, you're facing Charlie Culberson with a two-run lead and Puig on deck.You throw meatballs.So how bad?Understandable pitch in an understandable location, but the definition of hittable.The takeaway These 11 home runs were anything but inevitable.Some came on pretty good pitches.A bunch came on the sorts of pitches that make up the vast majority of baseball games -- the pretty-okay pitches that miss their target by a bit but that don't end up in the stands.Only five came in hitter's counts, and only one came in a lopsided hitter's count: Altuve's, on 2-0.The fact that so many of these pitches ended up being home runs -- whether because of the ball or because of the depth and quality of these lineups -- is important to understanding a lot of what we've seen this postseason, and what we'll see for the rest of the series.It's the reason we're seeing managers do whatever they can to avoid using their middle relievers, the reason the hooks are so incredibly quick for starting pitchers in the middle innings and the reason pitchers and catchers are meeting on every third pitch.It's also the reason pitchers are throwing their breaking balls even when they're behind in counts, the reason they're nibbling and the reason somebody is snapping at the umpire on almost every pitch.The reason for all of it is that the version of baseball being played right now offers pitchers the smallest margin for error that we've ever seen.These are very good and great pitchers throwing well and absolutely dominating hitters for large chunks of these games.Yet, simultaneously, they're setting records for home runs allowed.It's no surprise they think the ball is juiced, and it's no surprise everybody on the field is acting like it.

Indianapolis Colts case for shutting down Andrew Luck for 2017, tanking for 2018 NFL draft, beyond:::::If the Indianapolis Colts could skip ahead and simulate the remainder of the 2017 season, you suspect they would happily fast-forward to February.Chuck Pagano's team has avoided the ignominy surrounding the 49ers and Browns by winning two of its first seven games, doing so specifically by beating those two teams by three points each.The Colts have lost their other five games by a combined 109 points.Football Outsiders believes that the Colts -- not their winless brethren -- are the worst team in football on a play-by-play basis.Editor's Picks Colts to play Andrew Luck when cleared The Colts will play Andrew Luck once he's cleared, regardless of the team's record.Chuck Pagano's seat is on fire after Colts shut out for first time since 1993 The Colts were manhandled in every facet of their 27-0 loss the Jaguars at Lucas Oil Stadium, failing to score for the first time since Dec. 26, 1993.Reasons for hope for every NFL team It was an ugly Week 7: The Cardinals lost Carson Palmer; the Browns lost Joe Thomas; and the Broncos and Colts saw their streaks of 20-plus years without a shutout end.But don't fret about this season just yet.2 Related The biggest problem for the Colts, of course, is that their franchise quarterback hasn't thrown a pass since New Year's Day.Andrew Luck underwent shoulder surgery in January and was supposed to return in July.Things changed.Luck's return kept getting pushed back further and further, and it quickly became clear the organization had no idea when he would be back.The team took him off the physically unable to perform list, implying that they believed he would be back before Week 7, but Luck didn't make his way back into practice until before Week 5.Shortly after, he stopped throwing because of soreness in his shoulder, and now there's no timetable for Luck's return.The Colts reportedly intend to insert Luck into the lineup if he's healthy enough to play this season, but it's difficult to understand why they're rushing to put their quarterback in the line of fire.According to the Football Power Index, their chances of making the playoffs are less than 0.1 percent.Their fill-in quarterback, Jacoby Brissett, has also been pleasantly surprising for a player who was acquired after being shopped by the Patriots in advance of a roster cutdown he likely wouldn't have survived in New England.All of this conspires to present an interesting opportunity for Colts general manager Chris Ballard.Indy is staring down a bunch of losses, but its long-term situation might look extremely promising after the coming offseason.The Colts aren't tanking -- it may not even be possible to tank in the modern NFL -- but they have less to gain by winning than anyone else in football right now.The Colts this season Things are going to get worse before they get better for these Colts.They don't get to play the 49ers or Browns again over the rest of the season.Their schedule is about to get significantly tougher.To this point, Indianapolis has enjoyed the league's sixth-easiest schedule, per Football Outsiders.Over the remainder of the season, they play the league's toughest slate of opponents, with seven of those nine boasting a record of .500 or better.They'll also be doing it without some crucial players, having lost their two most influential defenders on Sunday.First-round pick Malik Hooker, who has flashed playmaking ability to go along with his otherworldly athleticism, went down with a torn ACL and MCL against the Jaguars to end his season.Hooker and his three picks were joined on the shelf by free-agent addition John Simon, who has racked up 12 quarterback knockdowns so far, tying him for eighth in the league.The former Texans edge-rusher is week-to-week with a stinger.The offensive line is also a concern.Ryan Kelly, the team's first-round pick from a year ago, missed the first four games of the season with a foot injury.He came back just in time to welcome his replacement, Deyshawn Bond, and guard Jack Mewhort, the team's best interior lineman, to injured reserve.The Colts have had trouble protecting Luck when their line has been healthy; it's another thing altogether when they have a second-year undrafted free agent like Jeremy Vujnovich trying to protect the quarterback.Jacoby Brissett has thrown for 1,409 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions this season.Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images It seems foolish to risk Luck behind an offensive line that allowed Brissett to be sacked 10 times and knocked down a staggering 20 times last week.The inexperienced Brissett was likely responsible for a few of those hits, and the Jaguars have one of the league's best pass rushes, but the season is already essentially lost.If Luck were ready to return right now, it would be one thing.The Colts would still have nine games with which to work, and while they would still be in relatively dismal shape in a suddenly competitive AFC South, they could at least credibly sell the idea that a half-season of Luck and some favorable results from their rivals might be enough to win the South.Instead, there's no time frame for when Luck will even be able to resume throwing, let alone consider a return to playing.It will take several weeks for Luck to ramp up from throwing before being ready to suit up.Let's say three weeks pass before Luck starts throwing and three more weeks pass before he's ready to take the field.That would line up Luck to return against the Bills in Week 14, with just four games to go in Indianapolis' season.The FPI projects the Colts' record at that point to be 3-9.Unless the Colts go on an unexpected run over the next few weeks, what is the real benefit to bringing back Luck into the lineup behind a makeshift offensive line?Do we really need to know whether a guy who has taken more than his fair share of hits over the past few years can take a pounding?What if Luck gets hurt again, and it costs him meaningful time in 2018?If tanking means placing Luck on injured reserve and resisting the temptation to bring him back for a few meaningless games in December, the Colts should seriously consider tanking.The risk-reward ratio for bringing back Luck is wildly skewed against that decision.The risk-reward ratio for leaving him out, on the other hand, makes it clear that the Colts would have quite a bit to gain by leaving him wrapped in cotton wool for the rest of 2017.Andrew Luck received a cortisone shot in his surgically repaired right shoulder to help with the soreness.Joe Robbins/Getty Images The Colts in 2018 and beyond Our definition of tanking is when a team with little to no chance of contending purposefully plays a weakened roster, knowing that losing will make it more likely it comes away with a cornerstone piece for the future in the draft(s) to come.You might fairly raise moral questions about a team that doesn't try to win with all its heart every single time out, but the economic structures leagues have built in American sports -- the combination of a player draft alongside the artificially depressed salaries of young players -- incentivizes teams to either be very good or very bad.It's not going anywhere.In the NFL, teams most often tank or trade up to the top of the draft with one goal in mind: grabbing a franchise quarterback.The success of Jared Goff and Carson Wentz this season won't exactly disabuse teams of the notion that the place to find a franchise-altering quarterback is by drafting one as early as possible.This year's class seems particularly promising in that regard.ESPN NFL draft expert Mel Kiper's most recent Big Board includes three quarterbacks in the top six.Even if USC passer Sam Darnold, a third-year sophomore, decides to stay in school, it's reasonable to figure that the duo of UCLA's Josh Rosen and Wyoming's Josh Allen could be the first two picks, following the scripts of the 2015 and 2016 drafts, which also started 1-2 with quarterbacks.(While neither is having a Heisman-caliber season, quarterbacks have a way of rising up draft boards.)The Colts, of course, don't need a quarterback.Luck's contract realistically commits Indy to the 2012 first overall pick through at least 2018, and it would require some sort of seismic disagreement for them to move Luck out of town.It's safe to assume he isn't going anywhere.Indy could consider a move for the ridiculous Saquon Barkley, Kiper's No.1 overall prospect, or grab the best defensive player available, but there's a more palatable option available.The Colts are 2-5 and their star quarterback hasn't yet played.Should Andrew Luck just sit until 2018?Photo by Brian Spurlock/USA TODAY Sports Indy is projected to finish with the third overall pick in next year's draft, but if the Colts manage to jump into the top two, they should be in an enviable and rare position.They would have a top pick in a quarterback-laden draft without any need to take a quarterback.Ballard would be well-positioned to auction off his selection for a haul of draft picks.The Colts badly need young talent after previous general manager Ryan Grigson repeatedly failed to land useful players in the draft.While Indy came away with Luck and T.Y.Hilton from Grigson's debut in 2012 and used a second-round pick to acquire Vontae Davis, his other drafts failed to deliver useful pieces.No players are left on the Indy roster from the 2013 draft, while the Colts' first-round pick in 2014 was used to trade for Trent Richardson.Their 2015 first-rounder, Phillip Dorsett, went to the Patriots for Brissett.If the Colts hold a pick that would set up a team with a franchise quarterback, they could rebuild and add multiple desperately needed cheap pieces to their roster.The Browns probably won't need to trade up to grab a passer.The 49ers could have Kirk Cousins, a potential free agent, by the time the 2018 draft rolls around, but if the Colts pass them or the Browns in the standings (or if Darnold leaves school), it won't matter.Let's say the Colts finish with the second overall pick and have at least one franchise quarterback prospect available to them.They could extract a huge haul from one of a handful of teams that wouldn't otherwise have access to Rosen or Allen.I count nine teams that could be looking for a quarterback depending on whether players such as Cousins, Sam Bradford and Ben Roethlisberger leave town, and they would need to send a bevy of picks Indy's way.Here's what those trades could look like: Team Projected Pick Possible Trade Jets 4 2 for 4 + a second-round pick + fifth-round pick Cardinals 5 2 + a fifth-round pick for 5 + a second-round pick + 2019 third-round pick Giants 6 2 for 6 + second-round pick + 2019 second-round pick Broncos 13 2 for 13 + 2019 first-round pick Washington 15 2 for 15 + a fourth-round pick + 2019 first-round pick Bills 18 2 for 18 + a second-round pick + 2019 first-round pick Jaguars 25 2 for 25 + a second-round pick + 2019 first-round pick + 2019 second-round pick Saints 26 2 for 26 + 2019 first-round pick + 2019 second-round pick + Delvin Breaux Steelers 29 2 for 29 + a fourth-round pick + 2019 first-round pick + 2020 first-round pick The Colts also might have a second trade asset in Brissett, who is still under contract through the 2019 season and appears to have the upside of a high-quality backup, if not a cheap starter.They might want to keep Brissett around given Luck's propensity for injury, but it would be better to sign Brian Hoyer for nothing in free agency and reap the benefits of sending Brissett to a quarterback-needy team for a midround pick.Tanking with the intention of grabbing one player as opposed to the intention of acquiring a pick that you'll trade for several players also reduces the risk that comes with trading up.Teams that make these sort of massive tradeups often come to regret the move; while the Rams and Eagles feel good about Goff and Wentz right now, similar trades for Robert Griffin III and Ryan Leaf turned out to be colossal mistakes.If you're not going to draft a quarterback, it's usually going to be better for you to get three cracks at drafting players than just one.The last team to be in this situation was Tennessee, which drafted Marcus Mariota in 2015 and held the first overall pick in the 2016 draft.The Titans dealt the pick to the Rams, who sent two first-round picks and two-second round picks to Tennessee as part of the return for Goff.The Titans used one of those selections as part of the deal to draft Jack Conklin, who was a Pro Bowler as a rookie at right tackle.The other first-rounder they picked up came in as the fifth overall selection in this year's draft, with which Tennessee drafted injured wideout Corey Davis.Talented contributors such as Derrick Henry and Jonnu Smith also came out of that trade.Even if Goff continues to look like a superstar, the Titans will be plenty happy with Mariota and the boatload of picks they got to replenish their roster.This is why it's incumbent upon the Colts to finish with as high a pick as possible.If Darnold stays in school, the difference between the second and third overall picks could amount to multiple high draft picks.If only one of the quarterbacks projects to be a superstar, the Colts might end up needing the first overall pick to be in position for a franchise-altering swap.It's true that there are no guarantees the Colts will end up spinning a high draft pick into a mountain of selections.They could hold onto whatever pick they get.The Browns have shown how frustrating it can be when you make the logically sound decision to trade down and amass extra picks without actually doing a good job of drafting.It's also true, though, that there's virtually nothing the Colts can do this season to compete, with or without Luck in their lineup.They're at least another year away from matching up with the rest of the South, let alone powerhouses like the Patriots and Chiefs.There's no reason to rush back Luck.When he returns, the Colts will be much better for having surrounded him with a better offensive line, a deeper defense and likely a new head coach.Don't call it tanking.Call it patience.
A timeline of the Houston Astros' improbable Game 2 victory:::::The Astros become the first team in World Series history to hit three extra-inning home runs, getting homers from Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and George Springer in Houston's 7-6, 11-inning win in Game 2.(3:18) LOS ANGELES -- Wednesday was most definitely not just another night at the old ballyard.The festivities of Game 2 of the World Series started with Vin Scully inviting Fernando Valenzuela to throw out the first pitch and ended with Chris Devenski striking out Yasiel Puig in a nine-pitch battle to give the Houston Astros a 7-6 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in 11 innings.The rest of the game was so completely insane and ridiculous that you wouldn't believe what happened if you didn't watch it.Here's what went down.Note: Arash Markazi and Bradford Doolittle contributed to this piece.Top of the third inning Josh Reddick leads off with infield single and Justin Verlander sacrifices him to second.George Springer lines a single to left, but Reddick gets a bad read and has to hold at third.Alex Bregman picks him up, however, with a line drive in the left-center gap that drops in front of a diving Chris Taylor.Reddick scores, but the ball bounces off the bill of Taylor's cap right to left fielder Joc Pederson.What could have been a triple or even inside-the-park home run is instead an RBI base hit.Score: Astros 1, Dodgers 0 Astros' win expectancy: 66 percent Bottom of the fifth Verlander is dealing.He has thrown 44 pitches through four innings, hasn't allowed a hit and is pitching like a baseball god wanting to carry this entire team on his back.Pederson steps in with two outs.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game that Pederson started in left field -- he'd made only two starts there all season -- because of his ability to hit velocity like Verlander's.So, of course he hits a 2-1 slider out to right-center for his first home run since July 26.Score: Dodgers 1, Astros 1 Dodgers' win expectancy: 51.4 percent Top of the sixth Roberts starts burning through relievers.He pulled starter Rich Hill after just four innings.Kenta Maeda got four outs and then Tony Watson came in, threw one pitch and got a double play.Ross Stripling would face one batter in the seventh inning before getting pulled.This rapid-fire bullpen usage would come back to haunt the Dodgers.Roberts: "I just felt that right there at the top of their order coming up, and with the way our bullpen has been throwing, you look back behind that, we had three scoreless innings after that."Score: Dodgers 1, Astros 1 Dodgers' win expectancy: 57.2 percent Bottom of the sixth Verlander had fanned four batters in the first four innings, but just one since.Maybe the Dodgers were seeing the ball a little better once the sun went down behind the San Gabriel Mountains.With two outs, Taylor walks on a 3-2 slider.Corey Seager fell behind 0-2, then drives a 1-2, 97 mph fastball out to left field for a home run.Astros manager A.J.Hinch: "Justin Verlander was very good.We don't even talk about him.He starts the game and gives up two hits and has to exit, National League-style.Then the game got really interesting."Hinch pinch hits for Verlander in the seventh, but the ace would later return to the dugout.Verlander: "This team, since I've been here, and I know it hasn't been that long, but two runs is nothing.And all of a sudden two runs seemed like it was the Grand Canyon.And I just kind of -- I don't even know if anybody heard me, but I was just trying to remind these guys two runs is nothing."Score: Dodgers 3, Astros 1 Dodgers' win expectancy: 84 percent Around the eighth A grass fire breaks out in the vicinity of Dodger Stadium.Separately, an apartment fire in nearby Echo Park also started.The Los Angeles Fire Department responded on the ground and in the air.Better image of brush fire in relation to Dodger Stadium- sight of the World Series.No one in danger, no evacuations either.@KCBSKCALDesk pic.twitter.com/PzIDFJ8ICT Tara Finestone (@tarawallis) October 26, 2017 Top of the eighth Brandon Morrow had allowed just three extra-base hits all season -- all doubles -- but Bregman lines a hit into the right-field corner.Puig dashes over like Superman and nearly makes a spectacular catch, but the ball glances off the tip of his glove and into the stands for a ground-rule double.He slams his glove down in frustration.Dodgers' win expectancy: 79 percent.Kenley Jansen enters, and with one out Carlos Correa hits a single up the middle to score Bregman from third base.The L.A. bullpen's 28-inning scoreless streak ends.Correa: "Just trying to get that run in there and make it a one-run game and give us a chance."Score: Dodgers 3, Astros 2 Dodgers' win expectancy: 74.5 percent Top of the ninth Jansen is trying to close it out.He'd blown one save all season, and the Dodgers were 98-0 when leading after eight innings.Marwin Gonzalez leads off and homers on an 0-2 pitch -- only the third home run Jansen has allowed in his career on an 0-2 pitch.It was also the first game-tying home run in the ninth inning by a road team in the World Series since Dwight Evans hit one for the Red Sox in 1975.Gonzalez: "It was a mistake.He doesn't usually make a mistake."Hinch: "Marwin Gonzalez kicked it all off.We're not here if Marwin Gonzalez doesn't hit a ball to center field against the best closer in baseball."Dallas Keuchel: "I was thinking we just need to score a run somehow.I wasn't expecting a home run, so that was impressive, but Marwin has been doing that all season."Gonzalez: "The momentum completely changed in the dugout.We knew we could win this game.The next inning, everybody woke up and [Jose] Altuve and Correa homered."Springer: "Believe it or not, I was actually in the tunnel.And I heard everyone start going crazy.And the ball -- I heard them scream."Score: Astros 3, Dodgers 3 Astros' win expectancy: 50 percent Chris Taylor watches Marwin Gonzalez's game-tying home run in the ninth inning sail over the fence.EPA/MIKE NELSON Top of the 10th Before this game, there had been just 17 extra-inning home runs in World Series history.We would see five over the next two frames.Josh Fields replaced Jansen and was immediately greeted by rockets from Altuve and Correa that sailed over the fence in left-center.Correa watched his, and then flipped his bat.Gonzalez: "It was a good moment."Puig: "I loved it.It was a little bit higher than the bat-flips I normally do.He was happy.That's the way you should play in the World Series."Jansen: "I don't care about that, man.It's just a style of baseball.As a pitcher, [you can] do whatever you want to.You take me out, I don't care.You got me."Roberts: "Correa put a good swing on it and he does what he does.And our guy kind of went the other way.So I'm not too concerned about that."This made the Astros just the second team in World Series history to hit a tying home run in the ninth and go-ahead homer in the 10th (the first was the 2001 Yankees).Score: Astros 5, Dodgers 3 Astros' win expectancy: 93.5 percent Sometime in the 10th A fan leaps into the Astros' bullpen.Brad Peacock: "I didn't know what was going on until it was over.The security guards came in and got the guy.I saw him get led away in handcuffs.I don't know what he was doing.I think he was going after the security guard.He wasn't coming after us."Collin McHugh: "The game was crazy.It was back and forth, one of the craziest games I've ever been a part of, so why not throw that in there too?"Bottom of the 10th Ken Giles can't close it.Puig homers, Houston's win expectancy is still at 81.8 percent and Logan Forsythe walks with two outs and moves up on a wild pitch.Enrique Hernandez ties it up with a two-out single to right -- the first Dodgers hit that wasn't a home run -- with Forsythe making a perfect slide to evade the tag.Keuchel: "Just crazy.We hit two home runs off a former teammate to give us the lead and then they come back and tie it up.Unbelievable."Hinch: "This was a hard game to finish, obviously, for both teams.And some really, really key hits that honestly it's hard to put into one game, let alone one series."Score: Dodgers 5, Astros 5 Dodgers' win expectancy: 60.2 percent Top of the 11th Roberts has one reliever left, not including Clayton Kershaw and Game 3 and 4 starters Yu Darvish and Alex Wood.Brandon McCarthy, who wasn't on the roster the first two rounds and had pitched just six innings since the end of July, comes in.Cameron Maybin, who had double-switched into the game, leads off with a single to center.Maybin: "This is the kind of game you dream about getting the opportunity to play in, so I just wanted to get a rally started and take advantage of my chance."Score: Astros 5, Dodgers 5 Astros' win expectancy: 58.1 percent Springer stepped in.Maybin steals second.Springer: "The at-bat by Cam was absolutely huge.And him stealing second made it easier on me.The goal for me was to get him to third base, because we've got the MVP of the league up."Springer didn't get him to third; he got Maybin home.And himself, after clocking a two-run homer to right-center off a 2-1 cutter, located at the knees but over the middle of the plate.Verlander: "I was watching George's home run on the TV, the same spot I was watching Marwin's, as superstitious as we are.Obviously it was extremely emotional.And I was in the exact same spot as George's home run because, why not?The inning before we scored a couple of runs, I'm going to be in the same spot."Correa: "We give a belt to the best player of the game.We gave it to Marwin.Without that home run, the rest of it doesn't happen."Gonzalez: "I was surprised.I was yelling to give it to Springer since he hit the last one."Score: Astros 7, Dodgers 5 Astros' win expectancy: 93.5 percent Bottom of the 11th The Dodgers weren't done, not on this night.Charlie Culberson, who entered the game as a sub, homered with two outs off Devenski and pumped his arm as he rounded second base.Keuchel: "Culberson acted like he won the World Series."Score: Astros 7, Dodgers 6 Astros' win expectancy: 97.8 percent That set up one final confrontation between Puig and Devenski.Puig took two strikes but then worked the count full.The ninth pitch was a changeup.Puig swung and missed.Correa: "The last out I almost had a heart attack.[Devenski] was making good pitches and [Puig] kept making good swings."Verlander: "I've been part of some pretty exciting games, but with all that this one entailed to be in the World Series and to be down a game, the roller coaster of emotion.This is an instant classic, and to be able to be part of it is pretty special."Maybin: "Nobody says these games are going to be easy."Keuchel: "There's not going to be another Game 2 of the 2017 World Series, so we're going to enjoy it, celebrate tonight, go home and get some rest."It was the first World Series win in Astros history.Hinch said that's not the one that's meaningful to him.Hinch: "Not the first one, the fourth one.I think the fourth one, that will be the one to bring home to the city."Final score: Astros 7, Dodgers 6 Astros' win expectancy: 100 percent
Scary-good player for each team:::::Don't get spooked, but Halloween is right around the corner.That means we're three weeks into the season, and trends are beginning to solidify.For this week's Power Rankings -- voted, as always, by ESPN's panel of 20 experts -- we kept in the holiday spirit to identify the scariest player on every team.How we rank: We use a panel of voters , and these rankings reflect who voters think would win head-to-head matchups.Higher-ranked teams would be favored against lower-ranked teams.A run of wins doesn't guarantee a jump, and a couple of losses doesn't guarantee a fall.Previous rankings: Preseason | Week 1 | Week 2 Record: 7-1-0 Week 2 ranking: No.6 The scariest player on the Golden Knights?Whoever is in net.The Knights are down to their third-string goalie, 23-year-old rookie Oscar Dansk, and somehow haven't suffered a drop-off.Marc-Andre Fleury, Malcolm Subban and Dansk have combined for a .930 save percentage and a 2.32 goals-against average.Record: 8-1-1 Week 2 ranking: No.3 Nikita Kucherov surpassed Alex Ovechkin as the NHL's goal-scoring leader with 11.Kucherov is coming off a season in which he scored 40 goals and racked up 45 assists -- without Steven Stamkos in the lineup.Yeah, this 24-year-old could be spooky-good.Record: 7-1-1 Week 2 ranking: No.11 If I'm an opposing team, I'm scared of Adrian Kempe.Why?He's helping ease the loss of Jeff Carter (out indefinitely with a leg laceration).Promoted to second-line center between Tanner Pearson and Tyler Toffoli, Kempe still needs work on faceoffs (he lost 13 of 15 in a Tuesday night win against the Ottawa Senators).But the 21-year-old's five goals through nine games, including the game-tying score against Ottawa, show he's here to stay.Record: 7-2-0 Week 2 ranking: No.1 The Leafs are a balanced team.Of the 20 skaters in their lineup this season, only fourth-line center Eric Fehr -- who was waived earlier this week -- did not record a point.The most dangerous player remains Auston Matthews, who has warded off all sophomore slump chatter with seven goals and five assists in nine games.Record: 5-3-2 Week 2 ranking: No.2 Let's chalk up the four goals Corey Crawford allowed on 29 shots to the Golden Knights on Tuesday as a one-off.Vegas has been spooking everyone this season!Entering that game, the Chicago goaltender had been scary-good with a 5-2-0 record, 1.86 goals-against average and .945 save percentage.Record: 7-2-1 Week 2 ranking: No.9 There's someone besides Vladimir Tarasenko scaring teams around the league: 25-year-old Jaden Schwartz, who plays fast and fearless and is third in the NHL with 14 points.Perhaps what's scariest is the 1-2 punch of Schwartz and Tarasenko, who post nearly identical average ice time (19:29 and 19:31) and lead the team with plus-7 and plus 8, respectively Record: 6-2-0 Week 2 ranking: No.4 Nineteen-year-old Jesper Bratt was a sixth-round pick in 2016.He's 5-foot-10, a buck-75, and perfectly embodies why the Devils have been an early surprise sensation.Bratt was supposed to be sent back to juniors, but has surpassed expectations with versatility and production (six points in eight games) as New Jersey averages a stunning 3.75 goals per game.Record: 6-3-1 Week 2 ranking: No.7 What made Penguins fans nervous through the first two weeks?Sloppy and inconsistent defense.Especially with backup goalie Antti Niemi waived and top-six defensemen Matt Hunwick and Justin Schultz sustaining concussions, the pressure is on No.1 goalie Matt Murray.Good thing is, Murray can be scary-good himself when he gets into a rhythm.Record: 6-3-0 Week 2 ranking: No.5 Columbus has two of the best young defensemen in the game (Seth Jones, Zach Werenski) and a balanced crop of forwards that awaits Artemi Panarin to fully blossom in a Blue Jackets uniform.And yet the most dangerous player has to be Sergei Bobrovsky (see: 34-save performance Wednesday night).Record: 4-1-4 Week 2 ranking: No.12 Erik Karlsson is so feared on defense, players on the No.3 team in this week's Power Rankings (the Kings) squabbled over who had to cover him: neither Dustin Brown nor Drew Doughty wanted the assignment.That offseason ankle surgery didn't change a thing; apparently Karlsson never needed that chunk of bone in his ankle anyway.Record: 4-4-1 Week 2 ranking: No.8 The Capitals have been shaky after a hot start.Washington's defensive depth (or lack thereof) is at risk of being exposed and now must replace second-line winger Andre Burakovsky, who is out six to eight weeks after thumb surgery.Alex Ovechkin has a way of taking over a game and keeping this team afloat.His 10 goals lead the team by far: T.J. Oshie has six goals, and no other Capital has more than three.Record: 4-3-1 Week 2 ranking: No.19 The captain, Ryan Getzlaf, made his season debut on Tuesday after sitting out with a lower-body injury.The still-banged-up Ducks were energetic, relentless and played sound hockey in a 6-2 win over the Flyers with him in the lineup.That's no coincidence.Record: 5-4-0 Week 2 ranking: No.13 First a disclaimer: Downplay any potential drama between Ben Bishop and coach Ken Hitchcock over the goalie being pulled in a loss to the Avalanche last week.That feud won't linger.What should keep heating up: Jamie Benn, who has 11 points in nine games as the Stars have won four of their past five games.Record: 5-4-0 Week 2 ranking: No.14 Anyone who wrote off Claude Giroux after this offseason is looking foolish.The 29-year-old has made the move from center to left wing look seamless -- even though he hasn't played the position since 2007-08, his rookie season.The sneaky-good Flyers are benefiting from a resurgent Giroux and his 11 points through nine games.Record: 4-3-2 Week 2 ranking: No.10 The Predators might still be working through a hangover from last season's Stanley Cup run -- and who can blame them?Their scariest player is Filip Forsberg, who is having the best start of his career.Forsberg is the first Nashville player to score seven goals in the team's first nine games.Record: 4-4-0 Week 2 ranking: No.22 The Sharks are finally at .500 after a shaky start.One forward has been scary-good lately: Logan Couture.The 28-year-old has nine points in his past four games, including a hat trick against the Islanders.Record: 4-3-0 Week 2 ranking: No.16 The Jets have settled a goalie controversy -- this is Connor Hellebuyck's team now, not Steve Mason's -- and survived early-season growing pains to come out of the first three weeks above .500.Nikolaj Ehlers is showing why he deserves his recent extension with six goals, but the most dangerous player on this roster is Patrik Laine.Record: 5-3-1 Week 2 ranking: No.26 Sharks backup goalie Aaron Dell still might be spooked by Josh Bailey's highlight goal last week.Bailey, who has picked up after a career season (56 points in 2016-17), intercepted a pass, deked Joe Pavelski, then stick-handled in front of the net, sliding the puck through his own legs -- a la Marek Malik -- before scoring a beauty.Record: 5-4-0 Week 2 ranking: No.21 Matt Duchene is the scariest player on this team, both for his production now (he's tied for the team lead with eight points) and in the future as trade bait.Record: 5-3-1 Week 2 ranking: No.29 Thirty-one-year-old Derek Dorsett has been the biggest surprise for a team that went 4-1 on its latest road trip.After undergoing neck surgery, Dorsett wasn't a lock to make this roster in training camp.Now he's eating big minutes and matching it with production (five goals in nine games).Record: 3-3-1 Week 2 ranking: No.27 The Bruins have seesawed through an inconsistent start.As they battle through injuries -- to nearly all of their centers, goalie Tuukka Rask and now defenseman Adam McQuaid (who is out for eight weeks) -- it seems fitting that 40-year-old Zdeno Chara is the steady, imposing force on defense.Chara's offensive production is dwindling, but he still leads skaters in average ice time (22:50) and is a team-high plus-6.Editor's Picks Ovechkin among those busting expectations Expectations for Alex Ovechkin were, uh, tempered compared with previous seasons.After all, he was coming off a career-low goals total.He and a few others around the league are redeeming themselves with stellar early results.Which young player would you build a team around?If you could construct a franchise around a current top-20 scorer, who would you choose?While slick-shooting Auston Matthews is a popular choice among our panelists, Greg Wyshynski says that Jack Eichel's swagger sets the Sabres center apart.Small-sample stars, stragglers: Which trends will continue?Is the cause of a strong or weak start to the season based on luck?Teammates?Ice time?Or is it a sign of the player's trajectory?We assess 10 players off to a hot start, and 10 off to a cold start, and whether those trends will continue.2 Related Record: 2-3-2 Week 2 ranking: No.17 Among the injury-stricken teams, perhaps the Wild have it worse.The latest: Zach Parise underwent back surgery and is out until Christmas.Charlie Coyle and Nino Niederreiter are both still out.The scariest person in the Wild organization: the poor team doctor who has to deliver this news.Record: 4-5-1 Week 2 ranking: No.18 The scariest player on the Red Wings is defenseman Mike Green, whose 11 points ties Shayne Gostisbehere and Alex Pietrangelo as tops among D-men.After a surprising 4-1 start, Detroit has staggered through a 0-4-1 stretch in their past five games.Somebody wake up the power play (5.9 percent in the five-game slide).Record: 5-5-0 Week 2 ranking: No.15 Mikael Backlund was a breakout star last season with 53 points, and it would be scary if he caught fire again.Backlund is part of the Flames' promising 3M line (along with Matthew Tkachuk and Michael Frolik) which last week celebrated its one-year anniversary as a unit.Record: 3-3-1 Week 2 ranking: No.20 Jeff Skinner could be a 40-goal scorer this season.He has accounted for five of the team's 17 goals so far -- and dating back to last season, has scored 22 goals in his past 25 games.The Hurricanes were lauded by many in the league as one of the toughest teams to play last season, but are struggling to get going.Can't get enough hockey?Watch out-of-market regular season games LIVE and on-demand in HD with NHL.TV.Annual, monthly, and single-team plans are available.Blackouts and restrictions apply.Learn more and subscribe to get NHL.TV today!Record: 3-6-2 Week 2 ranking: No.30 Poor Jack Eichel.He's an exceptional talent buried on a team constantly looking for its footing.At least Eichel is earning his $80 million extension with 1.1 points per game.Record: 3-5-0 Week 2 ranking: No.28 Allowing five goals to the moribund Canadiens last week wasn't a great look.An upcoming five-game homestand could get the Panthers going.Teams should be scared if James Reimer (filling in for the injured Roberto Luongo) can post solid performances in relief.Record: 2-5-1 Week 2 ranking: No.24 If you saw Connor McDavid undress Blackhawks defensemen Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook last week with a spin-o-rama, no-look pass to set up Patrick Maroon for a goal, you know exactly why McDavid is the scariest player on this team -- and for the future of the NHL.Record: 2-6-2 Week 2 ranking: No.23 After an inauspicious start (which is putting it kindly), only one player is standing out on New York's roster: Mika Zibanejad.The 24-year-old is a burst of energy for a team that's slogging.Even after a five-game goal drought, Zibanejad has accounted for six of New York's 25 goals; no other Ranger has more than three goals.Record: 2-6-1 Week 2 ranking: No.25 Nothing has gone Montreal's way so far.The Habs have scored only 18 goals (five of them coming in a 5-1 win against Florida on Tuesday, the Canadiens' second win).But opponents are always wary of Carey Price.When Price is on, he can single-handedly do damage control.Record: 0-8-1 Week 2 ranking: No.31 It's hard to find any bright spots in the Coyotes' winless start, but rookie center Clayton Keller could be one.He has dazzled with sharp passing, toe drags and a strong hockey IQ.Here's a scary thought: The Coyotes have such a good young core, they could post winning seasons soon.Just not this year.
Biggest injury questions for all 32 teams in Week 8:::::Jeff Saturday says that Jay Cutler's injury doesn't change his opinion about the Dolphins' future at all, agreeing with head coach Adam Gase that QB Matt Moore played better than Cutler in Miami's win over the Jets.(1:01) NFL Nation reporters assess the biggest injuries across the league for Week 8.AFC East | AFC North| AFC South | AFC West NFC East | NFC North | NFC South | NFC West AFC EAST Buffalo's secondary could be without two starters for Sunday's game against the Raiders, who gained 417 receiving yards last week against Kansas City.Safety Jordan Poyer (knee) and cornerback E.J.Gaines (hamstring) are both considered day-to-day, but they did not practice Wednesday.If they can't go, expect the Bills to start Trae Elston at safety and Shareece Wright at cornerback.Buffalo has allowed 350 passing yards per game since Week 5, the most in the NFL.-- Mike Rodak Quarterback Jay Cutler suffered multiple rib fractures last week and is not expected to play Thursday night against the Ravens.Backup Matt Moore likely will get his first start of the season while Cutler will get 10 days to rest before Miami's next game.-- James Walker Editor's Picks NFL Insiders predict: Week 8 upsets, flops, NFC South race, more Can the Saints create more separation in the NFC South?Are the Chargers or Dolphins for real?Which fantasy running back should you consider benching?Our experts weigh in.The case for Cardinals signing Colin Kaepernick outweighs the case against With Carson Palmer out for an extended period, it's natural to wonder if the Cardinals should sign Colin Kaepernick.Let's break down the situation.1 Related Linebacker Dont'a Hightower (shoulder) was knocked out of Sunday's win over the Falcons in the third quarter and wasn't at practice Wednesday, which could put his status in question for Sunday.The Boston Herald reported, citing sources, that Hightower won't play this week.His presence on defense has settled things down for others, so it would be a significant loss.With the bye week after Sunday's game, that could also factor into the decision-making process for the Patriots with some injured players, which includes wider receiver Danny Amendola (knee) and defensive tackle Malcom Brown (ankle).-- Mike Reiss Cornerback Buster Skrine is dealing with his third concussion in the past two years.Assuming he doesn't play Sunday, the secondary will be unsettled against Julio Jones & Co. Skrine is the only experienced slot corner on the roster.Chances are they'll use Darryl Roberts in the slot, with Morris Claiborne and the seldom-used Juston Burris on the outside.-- Rich Cimini AFC NORTH It looks like the Ravens will get back two receivers in Jeremy Maclin (shoulder) and Breshad Perriman (concussion) for Thursday night against the Dolphins.Maclin wasn't wearing a red non-contact jersey for the first time in three weeks, and Perriman was a full participant in Wednesday's practice.There's more uncertainty with wide receiver Mike Wallace, who has been limited in practice after suffering a concussion last Sunday.-- Jamison Hensley The Bengals look like they're finally getting wide receiver John Ross back after he practiced fully Wednesday, but they could be down two others after Tyler Boyd (knee) and Cody Core (concussion) missed practice.Linebacker Kevin Minter is also a question after missing practice with an elbow injury, although coach Marvin Lewis said Minter will not need surgery.-- Katherine Terrell The beleaguered Browns followed up the loss of Pro Bowl left tackle Joe Thomas (ruptured triceps tendon) with the announcement that 2016 first overall pick Myles Garrett has a concussion.With the team leaving for London on Thursday night, it's possible Garrett doesn't even make the trip.That will be decided in the next 24 hours.-- Pat McManamon JuJu Smith-Schuster (concussion) is crucial to the game plan with Martavis Bryant out, and though he practiced in full Wednesday, he must clear the final stages of the protocol to play in Detroit.Smith-Schuster said he's not feeling any ill effects, so clearance might be a matter of time.The Steelers are still waiting on right tackle Marcus Gilbert (hamstring) to perk up.-- Jeremy Fowler AFC SOUTH Cornerback Kevin Johnson said his "goal" is to play against the Seahawks.The starting cornerback has missed four games with a sprained MCL.Left tackle Chris Clark is sidelined with a calf injury, but coach Bill O'Brien said Clark is "day-to-day" more than "week-to-week."Duane Brown, who returned Monday from his season-long holdout, could play Sunday in Clark's place.-- Sarah Barshop Linebacker John Simon has been the Colts' best defensive player this season.But coach Chuck Pagano said it's unlikely that Simon will play against Cincinnati on Sunday because of a stinger in his neck.Pagano made it sound like Simon could miss more than one game after he suffered the injury against Jacksonville last weekend.Simon has a team-high three sacks to go with an interception that he returned for a touchdown.-- Mike Wells The bye week comes at a perfect time for the Jaguars because left tackle Cam Robinson is dealing with a sprained ankle and he would be unlikely to play if the Jaguars had a game this weekend.Running back Leonard Fournette (ankle) and center Brandon Linder (illness) -- who both didn't play last week -- are hopeful to be cleared to return for the Jaguars' game on Nov. 5 against Cincinnati.-- Mike DiRocco The Titans will use their bye week to get several of their injured stars -- quarterback Marcus Mariota, running back DeMarco Murray, wide receiver Corey Davis and tight end Delanie Walker -- closer to 100 percent.Davis has a good chance of returning Week 9 against Baltimore after missing the past five games with a hamstring injury.Walker will be the injury to watch as its uncertain whether he'll miss time with a right ankle bone bruise that appeared worse when he hurt it than it turned out to be.Getting Murray and Mariota off their hamstrings for a week should help in the long term.-- Cameron Wolfe AFC WEST Offensive tackle Menelik Watson, who missed last week's loss to the Chargers with a calf injury, returned Wednesday and took part in what coach Vance Joseph called a "jog-through," given it's an extra practice this week since the Broncos play in Kansas City on Monday night.Both Watson and his backup, Donald Stephenson, missed the shutout to Los Angeles and as a result the Broncos played Allen Barbre, who had been splitting time at guard and right tackle.Both Barbre and left tackle Garett Bolles had difficult days against the Chargers' Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram.Watson has had some struggles in pass protection this season, but his work in the run game has been a key part of Denver's success running the ball over their first four games.-- Jeff Legwold Starting cornerback Steven Nelson, who hasn't played all season after having core muscle surgery, returned to practice this week, giving him a chance to play against the Broncos on Monday night.Nelson's return would be welcomed by the Chiefs, who have struggled defensively most of the season.If Nelson starts, the Chiefs could move Terrance Mitchell to third cornerback, a role he excelled in last season.But Mitchell has given up a lot of plays as the starter.They could also move Phillip Gaines, who is struggling as the third cornerback, to the bench.-- Adam Teicher Starting right tackle Joe Barksdale is playing with a painful turf toe injury for the duration of this season and was unable to play last week against the Broncos.Barksdale has missed two games this year because of the foot issue, and Rivers has been sacked five times in those games.Pass-blocking is Barksdale's strength, and the Chargers could use the LSU product this week when they hit the road to face the Patriots in the team's final game before the bye.Coach Anthony Lynn said Barksdale will be limited in practice this week.-- Eric D. Williams Cornerback David Amerson has had a rough go of it thus far this season and injured his right foot against Kansas City last Thursday night after being targeted four times in 18 coverage snaps against the Chiefs, and allowing four receptions for 109 yards and a touchdown, per Pro Football Focus.And yet, he is Oakland's best cornerback, and he missed practice on Wednesday and was seen Tuesday still walking with a limp.An injured Amerson means more Sean Smith, who lost his starting gig earlier this season, for better or worse.-- Paul Gutierrez NFC EAST With a large lead, the Cowboys pulled linebacker Sean Lee from the final moments of last week's game against San Francisco because of a quadriceps bruise and expected him to be limited in Wednesday's full-padded workout.Instead, Lee was able to go through a full workout without any issues, which is a good sign for Sunday's game against Washington.Left tackle Tyron Smith didn't practice because of back tightness, which has troubled him for the past three weeks, but he is also dealing with a slight hip strain.Like Lee, however, he is expected to play against the Redskins.-- Todd Archer Wide receiver Sterling Shepard tweaked his left ankle again late last week, forcing him to miss the loss to the Seahawks.Shepard said he should be fine after the bye when the Giants face the Rams, but he'll have to make it through a full week of practice before they know for sure.The shorthanded Giants need him to return.They need any weapon they can get.-- Jordan Raanan The Eagles lost two standouts, left tackle Jason Peters and linebacker Jordan Hicks, to season-ending injuries this week.That thrusts tackle Halapoulivaati Vaitai and linebacker Najee Goode into big roles for the first-place Eagles.Cornerback Ronald Darby (dislocated ankle) is nearing a return.He was limited to start the practice week.It's to be determined whether he'll suit up Sunday against the 49ers.-- Tim McManus Washington's offensive line is a mess -- four starters are dealing with an injury.The Redskins' two best linemen, and two of their best players, have issues: left tackle Trent Williams (knee) will need surgery at some point and isn't sure whether he'll make it to the end of the season and might sit a week or two at some point, while right guard Brandon Scherff suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain of his right knee Monday and might not play Sunday against Dallas.Center Spencer Long (knee/quad) and right tackle Morgan Moses (ankles) also are hurting.Moses likely will play and Williams has gutted it out the past two games, so it wouldn't be surprising at all if he goes, too.But Long and Scherff will be the ones to watch.It's not an ideal situation.-- John Keim NFC NORTH The only surprise addition to Wednesday's injury report was Bears guard Kyle Long, who missed practice because of his surgically repaired ankle.However, coach John Fox downplayed the development."I think [Long] just [needed] rest," Fox said."We've done that a couple times this season, but the key for him is getting to Sunday."The Bears are likely to be without wide receiver Markus Wheaton (groin), linebacker John Timu (ankle/knee), cornerback Sherrick McManis (hamstring) and linebacker Roy Robertson-Harris (hamstring) when they play at New Orleans on Sunday.-- Jeff Dickerson Golden Tate made a surprising appearance at Lions practice Wednesday, working in individual drills with a shoulder injury requiring a sling less than a week ago.His status at this point is nowhere close to clear for Sunday night against the Steelers, but it's at least a good sign he's able to do some work.Detroit had more good news with Glover Quin (concussion) participating in practice fully Wednesday.Barring a setback, his consecutive-games-played streak should continue.The bigger question is at left tackle, where Greg Robinson (ankle) and Emmett Cleary (ankle) both missed practice.If neither one can play, that could leave Brian Mihalik or Bryce Harris as Detroit's potential starting left tackle against Pittsburgh.Mihalik struggled in spot duty against New Orleans and Harris was signed a week ago.-- Michael Rothstein It's the bye week for the Packers, so there's no pressing injury concern.Instead, let's look long term at the prospects for quarterback Aaron Rodgers to come back from his broken right clavicle.The Packers are holding out hope that Rodgers can come back late in the season if they're still in the playoff race.At the earliest, he could play in Week 15 at Carolina.That would be after the eight-week window to return off injured reserve would open.Coach Mike McCarthy said he's been in regular contact with Rodgers since his surgery last week but added: "There's a reason why he's on IR.So it's at a minimum of eight weeks and worst-case scenario he would be lost for the season."-- Rob Demovsky Coach Mike Zimmer seemed optimistic that the Vikings would get several injured players back this week when they face the Browns in London.Cornerback Mackensie Alexander (hip) and guard Nick Easton (calf) were limited on Wednesday, as was wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who missed the past two games.In addition to a groin injury, Diggs was listed with an ankle injury, which is new this week.The offensive line played well against the Ravens despite losing Riley Reiff and Jeremiah Sirles to knee injuries, and while Zimmer doesn't think their injuries are serious, Reiff and Sirles joined Sam Bradford (knee) and Stephen Weatherly (knee) as non-participants on Wednesday.For the first time this season, QB Case Keenum is on the injury report with a chest injury.That'll be an important one to keep an eye on the next two days.While Zimmer said all four quarterbacks will be in London, it's doubtful Bridgewater would be activated to start if Keenum couldn't go.If that's the case, Minnesota would turn to Kyle Sloter.-- Courtney Cronin NFC SOUTH Maybe it's not a huge concern, but running back Tevin Coleman popped up as limited on Wednesday's injury report with a knee issue.It's unclear when Coleman suffered the injury, but anything that affects his ability to explode is worth monitoring.The Falcons haven't fully utilized Coleman as of late, particularly as a pass-catcher out of the backfield.We'll see if the knee injury limits his play against the Jets come Sunday.-- Vaughn McClure Middle linebacker Luke Kuechly appears on the path to be cleared from the concussion protocol that kept him out of last week's loss to the Bears and set to play on Sunday at Tampa Bay.While the Panthers played lights out defensively against Chicago, the Bucs have the No.2 passing offense in the NFL and Kuechly adds a level of communication that takes this unit to another level.-- David Newton Wide receiver Michael Thomas popped up on the injury report for the first time Wednesday with a knee injury.It's unclear how significant the injury is, since Thomas appeared to finish last week's game healthy and was in attendance for the start of Wednesday's practice.But if he is out or limited, it would be a big blow to the Saints since he is by far their No.1 target in the passing game (and commands a ton of attention from opposing defenses).Meanwhile, right guard Larry Warford is expected to miss multiple weeks with an abdomen injury.He is also a significant loss, since he was the Saints' top free-agent signing and has played well this year.Luckily it should be a smooth transition to experienced veteran backup Senio Kelemete.-- Mike Triplett Defensive end Noah Spence is done for the season with a shoulder injury, so that is no longer a question mark for 2017.What is, however, is how the Bucs will handle not having a true speed rusher.They did sign Darryl Tapp, but he's more of a rotational, run-stuffing defensive end.Beyond this year, the concern is how Spence can avoid having these problems.He suffered his fourth shoulder dislocation in about 13 months this past Sunday against the Bills and the second since undergoing surgery this offseason.-- Jenna Laine NFC WEST The bye has come at a good time for the Cardinals, who don't have any significant injuries to worry about on a week-to-week basis.With two weeks between games and then two games in four days followed by another long weekend, Arizona can be very healthy for the homestretch of the season, save for quarterback Carson Palmer and other major injuries.Arizona has a handful of lingering injuries to players like cornerback Patrick Peterson (quad tendon), defensive tackles Corey Peters (knee) and Robert Nkemdiche (calf) and running back Andre Ellington (quad).-- Josh Weinfuss The Rams' only injury concern during their bye week is center John Sullivan, who tweaked his left knee in last week's win over the Cardinals."He's like Gumby," coach Sean McVay said, "so I think he's going to be OK." The Rams are in a relatively good place with this.McVay credited his training staff for helping to avoid some of the soft-tissue injuries that creep up, but also added: "We've gotten some luck, too, because I think you look at just some of the injuries around the league, and they're unfortunately unavoidable with the collisions and the types of things that do occur."-- Alden Gonzalez The 49ers haven't had a ton of stability this year, but one area where they had managed it through the first six weeks was on the offensive line.But the injury bug finally bit there against Dallas as right tackle Trent Brown suffered a concussion and right guard Brandon Fusco is dealing with a biceps injury that coach Kyle Shanahan has said will make him questionable this week.Brown must go through the concussion protocol while Fusco will be day-to-day.If neither can play, the Niners' depth on the offensive line will be tested even more by a strong Philadelphia front.-- Nick Wagoner The Seahawks are hoping that center Justin Britt can make a quick recovery from the sprained ankle he suffered last week against the Giants.Coach Pete Carroll was noncommittal about Britt playing this Sunday against Houston, and said that if he's able practice at all this week, it could not be until Friday.Britt's absence would be another setback to an offensive line that is already missing Luke Joeckel.Not only is Britt that group's leader and best player, but his backup at center, rookie second-round pick Ethan Pocic, is competing to replace Joeckel at left guard.Continuity has been fleeting along Seattle's offensive line in recent seasons, and not having Britt would further disrupt it.-- Brady Henderson
L.A. Chargers' Melvin Ingram on the mic: Beats, rhymes and QB sacks:::::With 8 1/2 sacks through seven games, Chargers LB Melvin Ingram has proved his worth on the field.Off the field, though, you can find Ingram working just as hard pursuing a music career.(1:18) LOS ANGELES -- In a dimly lit studio in East Hollywood, Melvin Ingram bobs his head to a melodic beat on loop while writing lyrics on his smartphone.He shortens up one final verse and rehearses a few lines with fellow independent artist Lazaro Camejo, aka Bizzy Crook.Ingram then walks over to the soundproof booth, ready to record.The final product is "Letter to my Pops," a song paying respect to Ingram's late father, George Melvin Ingram Jr., who died of a heart attack in 1998.Ingram closes with two poignant lines: This is a letter to my pops.I know you're always looking down."I don't tell no lies in my music," Ingram said."All of my music comes from my heart, and it's my life, really.So that's just me talking to him in my own little way.It's like me venting."It means a lot writing music like that.You never know, somebody might be going through the same thing I'm going through.And when they hear what I've got going on, they might change what they have going on, or how they view a certain situation."Chargers pass-rusher Melvin Ingram and Lazaro Camejo, aka Bizzy Crook, film a music video for their song "Lifestyle."Kyle Grillot for ESPN Ingram's father certainly would be proud of his son's accomplishments on the field.Some NFL observers were surprised when Ingram, 28, signed a four-year, $64 million deal this offseason.Ingram totaled just six sacks in his first three NFL seasons because of injuries and uneven play.Since 2015, however, Ingram has 27 sacks, which ranks fifth in the NFL.The North Carolina product continues to prove his worth, with 8.5 sacks so far this season, emerging as one of the best sack artists in the game.However, while Ingram has gained recognition for sacking quarterbacks, his true love remains writing and producing his own music.While Ingram is represented by Roc Nation, he controls his music and is not signed by Jay-Z's company as a musical talent.But the connection allows Ingram to network with industry types who are part of the label and to learn the tricks of the trade.Some in the building believe Ingram has a future in the music industry.Taking a break from the sound booth at Melrose Sound Studios for a few minutes, Ingram said he developed a passion for music as a 10-year-old growing up in the small town of Hamlet, North Carolina; writing music and sports always went hand in hand."I'll never forget that football is what puts food on my table, but I'm just as passionate about music," Ingram said."And I know I'm good at what I do.I put my heart into everything I do, really.So they serve each other equally."Ingram has released two full-length mixtapes: "From Nothing to Something" and "Franchise Tag."His music plays regularly during practice on game days at the StubHub Center, and he spends about $15,000 annually on the pursuit of his music career."He's passionate about it," said Chargers running back Melvin Gordon, a good friend of Ingram's."He's got his own style.You can't really compare him to anyone.I think every rapper has got his own sound.And I think everything he talks about is real.Sometimes rappers talk about stuff that probably has never happened, [or] what they will have but don't have at the moment.But everything he says is real.Those are his cars he's rapping about."Music and football have been two of Melvin Ingram's passions since he was a little boy growing up in Hamlet, North Carolina.Kyle Grillot for ESPN Added right tackle Joe Barksdale, who plays guitar and also writes his own music: "He's got his own style.It's not like you cut him on and it sounds like somebody else.And I think the production value is pretty good, too."Pop culture website Complex.com named Ingram one of the best rappers in sports, along with Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell, Lou Williams of the Philadelphia 76ers and others.But Ingram believes he's tops on the list."I'm the best," Ingram said."Damian's nice.Damian really can rap, but there's a lot of people that try to do it that really can't rap.Another one I like Is Lou Will [Lou Williams].But me, I feel like I'm in a different lane, really."Ingram listed Jay-Z, Outkast and N.O.R.E.as his musical influences growing up.Rappers whom he's feeling now include Meek Mill, Drake and Future."I try to touch into every genre of music because there's a lot of music going on these days," Ingram said."But some of it I don't touch, though, because some of it is just crazy."
Meet the Division III QB kicked off his team for kneeling during the anthem:::::READING, Pa. -- The invitations have already started coming in for Gyree Durante, perhaps the nation's first college football player to be dismissed from a team for kneeling during the national anthem.Durante spent Tuesday at the statehouse in Harrisburg as a guest of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus and met several members of the Philadelphia Eagles, including Malcolm Jenkins and Chris Long.He'd also been invited to speak at a planned protest at his school, Albright College, the week before but that was cancelled.He might also attend a proposed student-led demonstration at Albright's football game Saturday."Some would say that I'm [an activist] and some would say that I'm not," Durante told ESPN.com."But I don't think I've done enough work to call myself that yet."What's clear is there's work for him out there if he's willing to embrace all of the opportunities, improbable as it all may seem for the reserved 19-year-old.Neither Durante nor Albright College would've seemed likely candidates to be near the center of a roiling national debate over freedom of speech, police brutality and the national anthem that peaked in recent weeks with a running feud between the NFL and President Donald Trump."Some would say that I'm [an activist] and some would say that I'm not.But I don't think I've done enough work to call myself that yet."Gyree Durante When Durante kneeled on the sideline in defiance of the team's agreed-upon plan for protest, he thrust himself and Albright into a spotlight all but unheard of for a football program almost as far from the big time as possible and this idyllic campus of 2,300 students nestled by the foot of Mount Penn.In many ways, Durante's stance -- and subsequent punishment -- by Albright inadvertently exposed why many college athletes have been absent from public activism that started anew with Colin Kaepernick and resulted in Trump criticizing the NFL for not penalizing players who kneel: Most have little leverage against their coaches and none of the protections collectively bargained by the pros."They're just going to get the pain," said Harry Edwards, famed sports sociologist and civil rights activist."Because they're unknowns.Who cares about" a Division III athlete, he said.Things came to a head the week before Albright's Oct. 7 game against Delaware Valley University, when the team's 24-member leadership council voted to kneel during the coin toss to show unity and stand during the national anthem.Gyree Durante was a backup QB for Albright until he kneeled during the national anthem and was kicked off his team.Courtesy of Gyree Durante Durante decided to take a knee during the anthem on his own and was kicked off the team two days later.Albright eventually backtracked as news of the dismissals made it into headlines around the country and many on campus balked at the punishment, including a rare public statement from school faculty."His dismissal is a threat to freedom of conscience and freedom of speech," the statement read.Albright president Jacquelyn Fentrow offered Durante reinstatement last week, saying in a written statement that "what we understood to be shared agreement among players, student leaders, and coaches has not been adequately supported."But Durante said he declined the president's offer after a brief meeting Wednesday with head football coach John Marzka and co-athletic director Rick Ferry."I don't think they were surprised," Durante said."I just felt like it was too late by that point."No officials at Albright -- including the school's president, athletic director and football coach -- were made available to comment despite several attempts by ESPN.com.Thus brought a close to what started off as a promising homecoming for Durante, who was raised in nearby Ephrata, about 20 miles south of Albright.The oldest of three children borne to a semi-pro basketball coach and an accountant, Durante was raised in a home where willfullness was one of the family heirlooms."No, we didn't walk outside with picket lines," said Ronnell Durante, his father."But I also taught my son that you don't have to surrender your thoughts and beliefs to people because it makes them uncomfortable."Gyree Durante and his family moved to South Florida for his final three years of high school, where he helped West Broward High School earn its first playoff berth as a senior but broke his leg near the end of the 2015 regular season.That injury meant the end of a handful of football scholarship offers at bigger schools like Marist and Lafayette.In stepped the coaching staff at Albright, which saw a steal in Durante -- an athletic and sturdily built prospect (6-foot, 195 pounds) who also excelled in the classroom.From Durante's perspective, Albright offered him the chance to go to school in an area with which he was already familiar and where family was only a short drive away.It seemed like a good fit."I respect Gyree with everything in my being.A lot of people I know think standing up for yourself is a great thing.It's just a shame that he lost his football career because of it."Albright freshman Isaiah Knox "They sold us on [Albright] because they said, 'We know you're athletic but that's not what's important to us,'" said his mother, Seidah Durante."I loved Albright, I loved the whole atmosphere.""I knew I would have a lot of support," Gyree Durante said.Little more than an hour northwest of Philadelphia, Albright's campus sits between the northern reaches of the Appalachians and a well-kept residential area in a city once dubbed the nation's poorest by the New York Times.It is not a place where anyone would go seeking attention or even entertainment; Albright is a place that prides itself on its intimate liberal arts education and relatively diverse student body (nearly 40 percent of students are non-white).That remoteness didn't make Albright immune to controversy: In October 2016 -- Durante's first semester -- two students were suspended for appearing in an online video showing one in blackface makeup and that mocked the Black Lives Matter movement."That caused considerable discontent," said Guillame de Syon, chair of Albright's history department."Like all campuses, we've had these things and we were reeling a bit."Meanwhile, Durante made a fairly seamless transition to college.He recovered fast enough from his broken leg to become the starting quarterback on the junior varsity; he posted a GPA over 3.0, earning distinction for the accomplishment at the team banquet; and he even dabbled a little in protest, kneeling during just one game with two other teammates.There was no censure for that flirtation with activism, Durante said.Marzka "talked to us as a team about it," he said."But there were no one-on-one meetings, no repercussions over it."Gyree Durante was kicked off his college football team for kneeling during the national anthem, but he has no regrets.Joel Anderson/ESPN.com That's what made Marzka's blow-up over the same demonstration a year later a surprise to Durante.In the first couple of games this fall, now as the top backup to the starting quarterback, Durante had raised a fist with a few other teammates during the anthem.But he decided a more drastic response was in order after Trump's speech to an Alabama crowd in September, when the president attacked protesting NFL players.He asked members of the crowd if they'd "love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he's fired'?""It definitely struck a nerve in me," Durante said.Durante was the only member of the team to kneel that week, a game at King's College in Wilkes-Barre on Sept. 30.Marzka, he said, erupted in anger at his protest."He started off calm," Durante said."And I said, 'Sorry, Coach, I hear what you're saying but I've got to do this.'That's when Coach started yelling at me."The rest of the game largely passed without incident: Durante, who usually got in for a few plays per game this season, never left the sideline.The next morning at Albright, Marzka beckoned Durante to his office.The meeting, according to Durante, started with Marzka going over the history of the anthem and closed with the coach telling Durante he thought the protest was disrespectful to the military, including his own family members who served."I told him I was doing it to protest systemic racism, discrimination, social injustice and I told him about what Trump said," Durante said."That's something I just can't stand for."Marzka, he said, was unmoved."He told me, 'You're not going to take a knee again.And if you take a knee, you're off the team.'I told him that was just a risk I was willing to take."Later that day, Marzka convened a meeting of the team's leadership council, which came up with what it considered a compromise.The council's plan included a statement that was read before the game, including the lines: "We storm this field behind the American Flag as a symbol of our commitment, our unity and the value we place on our freedoms.We both kneel and stand tall out of the mutual respect we have for each other and the value we place on our differences."Durante didn't find it sufficient and took a knee anyway, much to the chagrin of the coach and his teammates."I felt kinda like, 'Dang, I thought a lot of people would have my back.'I think a lot of the players that voted for the compromise were kinda intimidated by the coach."Kaska dismissed Durante two days later, just minutes before a team meeting and practice.Josh Powell, a freshman defensive end from Tampa, Florida, told NBC 10 that Durante broke his teammates' trust by kneeling."We trusted him throughout the week, after time and time again he told us he would stand," Powell said, according to NBC 10."When you can't have a player on a team that you can trust, he's got to go."Fentrow's subsequent statement offering reinstatement did little to clear up the reasoning behind his dismissal, and to many others, exposed issues that have long festered on the campus."We have a racial problem more serious than it appeared at first," de Syon said, responding to the president's statement."If we are serious as a liberal arts institution about respecting freedom of opinion and encouraging student exploration (i.e.applying the first amendment within the context of teaching), then we have serious work to do outside the classroom."Now that Durante has declined the offer to return to the team, he has found there's much stronger support for his fledgling activism outside of the locker room.Today he has become more popular than he ever was as a football player."It's surprising," he said."It's been pretty much all positive."In the school's cozy campus center, a black-and-white picture of him kneeling is prominently placed on one of the corkboards leading into the dining hall."I respect Gyree with everything in my being," said Isaiah Knox, an 18-year-old freshman."A lot of people I know think standing up for yourself is a great thing.It's just a shame that he lost his football career because of it."Durante has also gained fans from much farther away: Oakland A's catcher Bruce Maxwell, who last month became the first MLB player to kneel during the anthem, sent him a message on Instagram."Aye bro!!!Proud of you!," Maxwell wrote."I'm glad you took a stand!It's bigger than sports!"But even with all of the new attention and entreaties to devote himself more to activism, Durante said he just wants to finish out the semester and then resume his football career somewhere else.At least one nearby Division III school has already inquired about his interest, his father said.One recent evening, munching slowly on pizza at the off-campus apartment he shares with a sophomore running back, Durante seemed much more concerned with his accounting test that week than his speech at the protest."I'll probably just speak from my heart," he said."Grades come first.And then after that, we'll see."
College football playoff contenders final chance to make a strong first impression with the selection committee:::::The showdown between Penn State and Ohio State headlines a busy weekend of college football.But NC State visits Notre Dame in a game with playoff implications, and every top team will look to make a statement with the committee's first rankings imminent.(1:00) Perhaps no team in the country has a better opportunity than Penn State to impress the selection committee before it announces its first College Football Playoff ranking on Tuesday.The Nittany Lions will be in Columbus, playing right in front of one of the 13 committee members, Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith.Though Smith, one of three new committee members, has to recuse himself from all discussions and voting pertaining to the Buckeyes, he can certainly weigh in on Penn State.FiveThirtyEight CFP Predictor FiveThirtyEight will update its College Football Playoff projections after every game and new selection committee ranking.Projections Committee chair and Texas Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt saw Oklahoma State live on Sept. 30 when the Cowboys beat his Red Raiders 41-34.And you better believe new committee member Frank Beamer saw Clemson in person last month when the Tigers went into Lane Stadium and beat Virginia Tech, 31-17.How has his opinion of Clemson changed after its loss to Syracuse?This is the last chance for CFP contenders to make a first impression before the committee convenes in Grapevine, Texas, where the members will deliberate on Monday and Tuesday to determine the first of six rankings.Here's a look at the games this week most likely to impact the committee's top 25: 1.No.2 Penn State (7-0) at No.6 Ohio State (6-1) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.ET on FOX If Penn State wins: The Nittany Lions would emerge as the leader to win the Big Ten East and become the league's most legitimate playoff contender, while handing the Buckeyes their second loss of the season and knocking them out of the top-four debate.It would be a far different scenario from last season, when Penn State beat Ohio State, because this time the Buckeyes cannot trumpet a nonconference win like they had against Oklahoma last year.Saquon Barkley and Penn State can take control of the Big Ten East race with a win over Ohio State.AP Photo/Chris Knight A win would put Penn State in strong position to return to the Big Ten title game with a road trip to Michigan State up next.If Ohio State wins: The Buckeyes would earn their best win to date and take the lead in the Big Ten East.Right now, ESPN's Football Power Index gives Ohio State a 70 percent chance to win its division, but that would increase to 97 percent with a win over the Nittany Lions.While a loss wouldn't eliminate Penn State from CFP contention, it would make it very difficult to return to the Big Ten championship game and rob it of its best chance at a marquee victory.Having played Akron, Pittsburgh and Georgia State, Penn State doesn't have the kind of signature nonconference win probably needed to boost it into the top four without winning the Big Ten.Player to watch: Ohio State QB J.T.Barrett.He was held without a touchdown in the loss to Oklahoma.In five games since, he has a 72 percent completion percentage, 22 total touchdowns and a 93.8 Total QBR -- all best in FBS -- without committing a turnover.2.No.14 NC State (6-1) at No.9 Notre Dame (6-1) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.ET on NBC If NC State wins: The Wolfpack would go from CFP dark horse to contender, and the Irish would disappear from the conversation as quickly as they entered it.Having already lost to Georgia, Notre Dame has no wiggle room.It also doesn't have a conference championship game, and the committee will evaluate the Irish based on 12 games.As the only team in the ACC Atlantic still undefeated in league play, NC State still has a path to the conference championship game.For the Wolfpack to achieve bigger things, though, they have to beat the Irish.After a season-opening loss to South Carolina, not even an ACC title would be enough to pull NC State out of a two-loss hole.If NC State loses this game but wins the ACC, the league loses, too.If Notre Dame wins: The CFP's biggest X factor is still in play, as the Irish would have another win over a contender for a Power 5 conference championship.It would be their second straight win against an AP top-15 team, having defeated USC last week.Notre Dame still has road trips to No.8 Miami and No.20 Stanford looming, so every week is a must-win for the Irish.Player to watch: Notre Dame RB Josh Adams.This game will be determined by how Notre Dame's offensive line fares against the Pack's defensive line, and whether the former can pave the way for Adams, who ranks second nationally in yards per carry.His average of 9.21 per rush trails only Stanford's Bryce Love (10.27).3.No.3 Georgia Bulldogs (7-0) vs. Florida Gators (3-3) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.ET on CBS (In Jacksonville, Florida) Editor's Picks Notre Dame, the team everyone loves to hate, can disrupt the CFP It's hard to envision how an 11-1 Notre Dame would get left out of the College Football Playoff, which is a nightmare scenario for a Power 5 conference champion.Everything you need to know about the College Football Playoff Sure, the College Football Playoff doesn't start for another four months, but it's never too early to brush up on the rules and people who will be making the sport's most important decisions.1 Related If Georgia wins: The Bulldogs would be able to exhale after snapping a three-game losing streak -- all by double digits -- to the Gators.This is the third time in the past 35 seasons that Georgia enters this game undefeated -- the Dawgs lost the previous two (2002, 05).FiveThirtyEight predicts Georgia has a 39 percent chance to finish in the top four, the second-best chance behind Alabama (69 percent).If Florida wins: Here we go again.While a loss wouldn't knock Georgia out of the CFP or out of first place in the SEC East, it would raise doubts about whether the Bulldogs are truly top-four material.It would also add significant pressure down the stretch.Don't forget, Georgia still has to play at No.19 Auburn on Nov. 11.Players to watch: Georgia's defense.The Bulldogs are second in FBS in defensive efficiency and have held three opponents under 250 yards.Florida is second-worst in the SEC in offensive efficiency, ranking 73rd in FBS.4.No.4 TCU (7-0) at No.25 Iowa State (5-2) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.ET on ABC/ESPN2 and ESPN App If TCU wins: The Horned Frogs remain the only undefeated team in the Big 12.An ideal scenario for the league is to have an unbeaten TCU face a one-loss opponent in the conference championship game.The Cyclones are a much tougher out this season than in past years, as Oklahoma has learned.With a win at Iowa State, TCU's chances of winning the Big 12 increase from 37 percent to 41 percent.It would also be TCU's fourth Power 5 road win of the season.If Iowa State wins: Oklahoma would feel better about that home loss to Iowa State.For the Cyclones, it would snap its 11-game home losing streak to ranked opponents, and TCU's chances of winning the Big 12 sink to 27 percent.The Big 12 would also join the Pac-12 as the second Power 5 conference without any undefeated teams, and it would take some shine off of the new conference championship game.Player to watch: Iowa State LB/QB Joel Lanning.He's contributed in all three phases of the game, and in the past three games, Lanning has been in on 228 snaps (178 defense, 25 offense, 25 special teams), recording 32 tackles, 3.5 TFL, 1 sack, 1 fumble recovery, 74 rushing yards and 25 passing yards.5.Georgia Tech (4-2) at No.7 Clemson (6-1) Saturday at 8 p.m.ET on ABC/ESPN2 and ESPN App If Georgia Tech wins: The defending national champs would be done.If the Tigers lose to Georgia Tech, their chances of winning the ACC plummet to 32 percent,

Notre Dame defensive coordinator Mike Elko deserves credit for the Fighting Irish's turnaround:::::Brian Kelly says Notre Dame's goal for this season has always been a national championship.(1:05) SOUTH BEND, Ind.-- Mike Elko doesn't love to yell.He will do it, if needed, but he would rather teach defense through the whys and the hows.Elko is an inquisitive coach who likes inquisitive players.He wants Notre Dame defenders to ask why a play worked or how to read a certain formation, why a position switch will help or how to leverage an offensive lineman.Elko's goal is a defense that takes the field with comfort in the scheme and the calls and with detailed understanding of opposing offenses."How are we doing things?Why are we doing things?You have to be able to teach these kids conceptually," Elko told ESPN.com this summer."If they can't learn concepts, they're constantly going to be seeing things that they don't understand.You're asking them to do things that make sense to them.You're explaining why."[If] they feel they can do what you're asking, then they start having success."Notre Dame's success on defense under Elko is the single biggest reason the team finds itself in the top 10 and in the hunt for its first College Football Playoff berth, a year after going 4-8.Elko, plucked from Wake Forest by coach Brian Kelly to repair a disjointed unit, has the Irish taking the ball away (17 turnovers forced, tied for eighth nationally), keeping rushers out of the end zone (one rushing touchdown allowed, first nationally) and limiting points (16.4 PPG allowed, 12th nationally).Brian Kelly, left, came away impressed after Mike Elko's Wake Forest defense held Notre Dame to 282 yards and 15 first downs in 2015.Matt Cashore/USA TODAY Sports Through seven games, the Irish already have three more takeaways and four more sacks than all of last season.They are one of six FBS defenses to allow opponents to score touchdowns on less than 40 percent of their red zone possessions.They are thriving with a depth chart not packed with future NFL draft picks."For those that watched us last year compared to this year, we didn't trade for anybody," Kelly said after Notre Dame's 49-14 win over USC on Saturday."There was nobody on the waiver wire."Only Elko.The upgrades for Notre Dame's defense continue to grow.But it's important to know why and how things have changed.Not to mention: Who is this guy pulling the strings?Knowledge seeker For 15 minutes at every practice, every Notre Dame defender goes through ball-disruption drills.Even the linemen."At first, we were like, 'Aw, that's kind of nitpicking,'" defensive end Khalid Kareem said."But then it showed in the games.It worked."Elko doesn't do the drills to torture players.He structures everything with an educational purpose.He has found that if players know why they're drilling something, even something basic, they respond better.When they make great plays, they need to differentiate between being lucky to be in the right spot and visualizing how and why they got there."Players buy into what he says because it's not just about the moment," said linebackers coach Clark Lea, who came with Elko from Wake Forest."It's about the teachable moment.And he always circles back with a lesson involved."Kelly's response Tuesday to a question about linebacker Te'von Coney's improvement -- "He's trusting the teaching" -- could apply to just about any of Elko's players.Elko came to Notre Dame as one of only two FBS defensive coordinators with top-40 defenses in each of the past five years (at Wake Forest and Bowling Green).He's quick to note he had more talent than many think, especially at Wake -- linebacker Marquel Lee is starting for the Oakland Raiders as a rookie, Duke Ejiofor is the No.3-ranked senior defensive end on Mel Kiper's board."We had lower-recruited players, but we had some good players," Elko said."We taught a defense that they understood, and we weren't asking kids to just make plays and do things that they weren't capable of doing."Going from Wake to Notre Dame would seem like a no-brainer for a coach, but before accepting Kelly's offer, Elko studied the personnel.He wouldn't come if the defense looked years away from breaking through.He saw enough potential, especially among the younger classes, to make him believe he could flip it.After arriving, he made some key adjustments.He shifted Drue Tranquill, the team's No.2 tackler in 2016, from strong safety to rover, a safety/outside linebacker hybrid, where his skills better fit.Tranquill, slightly heavier but actually faster, leads the team in tackles for loss (5.5) and fumble recoveries (three), adding a forced fumble, an interception and a sack.There were also more subtle tweaks.Kareem, one of three players with three sacks, is playing more on the outside, rather than alternating from an interior position."It lets me be the edge rusher I was before," Kareem said."It allows me to play my game."An evolving scheme Coaches who studied Notre Dame's defense the past few years saw a unit lacking identity.One head coach told ESPN.com last fall that the Irish ran so many styles, he didn't know how the players could keep it all straight.Here's what offensive coordinators are saying about the Irish defense now: "Tremendous.Great scheme.Guys play hard.Few busts.Makes you earn any scoring drive.""They are very sound in what they do.The big thing is that the players understand it and they can play fast."After Notre Dame held USC to 14 points and forced quarterback Sam Darnold into mistakes when he wasn't running for his life, the easy response would have been to dial up the same plan for NC State.That's not Elko."Mike's greatest strength is his ability to adjust," said Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson, who had Elko on staffs at four schools."He always understood how players dictate the scheme; the scheme doesn't dictate the players.With [Ejiofor], he constantly moved him to get a good matchup with the pass rush.It wasn't, 'He's an end.He's gotta win.'It was, 'Hey, we're going to find a way to get him isolated.'"Elko's system is constantly changing.He expects coaches to come to meetings with opinions and ways to challenge him on certain strategies.If Lea doesn't feel good about how a linebacker is being used or how to fit a certain run play, he immediately goes to Elko.Linebackers coach Clark Lea says Mike Elko's defensive philosophy is "about the teachable moment.And he always circles back with a lesson involved."Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire "You have to be a thinker; you can't just be OK with the status quo if it's not going to help your players," Lea said."We don't ever want to put our players in a position where the answer is: Just play faster or play harder."Added Elko: "What [players] appreciate is a scheme that they can understand, a scheme they felt confident in their ability to execute, a scheme that allowed them to get lined up quickly and play."Elko sees game plans as a constant chase.The influx of run-pass option, spread concepts and tempo has offenses running more plays and rarely repeating them.Offenses don't show as many tendencies, but he latches on to the ones he sees.Notre Dame defenders knew Darnold was "loose with the football," end Daelin Hayes said.When Darnold dropped the first snap of the game, Coney was there to pounce on it.Kareem said he knew USC's offensive tackles were "leaners," allowing him to beat them to the outside.Hayes saw USC right tackle Chuma Edoga had been repeatedly beaten on the inside the week before against Utah, so he used speed to get Edoga to overset, allowing Hayes to scoot by."Guys are truly buying into the process," Hayes said, "becoming a great, detailed defense.That has been huge."Book smart, street smart In 2015, Notre Dame had a strong, balanced offense.The Irish averaged 7 yards per play and eclipsed 400 yards in every game but one.Elko's Wake Forest defense held Notre Dame to 282 yards and 15 first downs, also a season low.It stuck with Kelly.The coach also tracked how Elko's defenses forced takeaways and pressured quarterbacks, areas in which Notre Dame struggled in 2016.Kelly liked how Elko came up through college football's back roads, the FCS and lower divisions.Kelly didn't reach the Power 5 until his 25th year in coaching."It really is an indicator of your ability to teach and communicate," Kelly said, "and do more with less."After finishing college at Penn, where he played safety, Elko started his career at Stony Brook, which he calls one of two true destinations (Albany is the other) for aspiring East Coast coaches who want to get their feet wet.His title read graduate assistant.In reality, he coached the linebackers.In 2001, he landed his first coordinator job at the U.S.Merchant Marine Academy, a Division III program on Long Island, before joining Clawson at Fordham the following year."That was the first glimpse of where my vision of football was going to go," Elko said."That staff was living in the Bronx.We were young, hungry, smart, willing to work."Editor's Picks Notre Dame, the team everyone loves to hate, can disrupt the CFP It's hard to envision how an 11-1 Notre Dame would get left out of the College Football Playoff, which is a nightmare scenario for a Power 5 conference champion.How Clemson, Washington can still make the CFP Unlike nearly every other one-loss team, the Irish likely can't secure a spot in the College Football Playoff just by winning out.1 Related In Elko, Clawson saw a curious, instinctive coach who could relate to anyone.Sure, Elko had an Ivy League degree, but he didn't hang out with "the eating club group."He spent most of his free time playing pickup basketball around Philly.Elko spent 12 of the next 15 years with Clawson, who saw Elko in various roles: position coach, recruiting coordinator and defensive coordinator."Mike is book smart and street smart," Clawson said."A lot of coaches can get up there and draw plays up and tell you what they do.They can't understand why they do it.Mike always understood that."Because of the mostly off-the-radar path, Elko, 40, wasn't a splashy hire at Notre Dame.But much like Don Brown at Michigan, the move resonated in coaching circles.There's less surprise about Notre Dame's surge among those in the know.The Irish players aren't shocked, either.They understand how they got here, where they're going and why they'll get there.Elko wouldn't have it any other way."The roof," Kareem joked when asked about the ceiling for Notre Dame's defense."We're just playing free, just going after the ball and playing our ball."
Michael Porter Jr. is at Missouri to do what Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz could not:::::Missouri freshman Michael Porter Jr. leads the Tigers in scoring against Kansas, racking up 21 points and showing the skills that made him the No.2 prospect in the 2017 class.(0:42) COLUMBIA, Missouri -- Michael Porter Jr., the presumed savior for a Missouri team that endured a miserable eight-win season last year, rarely loses.He was the No.1 recruit in the country and headed for the likely No.1 spot in the NBA draft.Then, in August, Marvin Bagley III announced on SportsCenter his plan to reclassify and play for Duke this season.Just like that, Porter wasn't the No.1 prospect anymore."I mean, Marvin is a good player, but I don't see him being better than me," Porter said following a September practice at Mizzou Arena with a smile as bright as the diamond studs in his ears."But he's a good player, I think.I think once the college season starts, that's all that matters: How you perform on the court.We're gonna see."He does respect Bagley."Dude is nice," Porter added."I think he's a generational-type player as well."But Porter's focus isn't on Bagley.He's here for something bigger.He wants to be better than everybody in his class, in any class.And he wants to end Missouri's four-year absence from the NCAA tournament.His first unofficial game provided a snapshot of his ability to achieve that goal.On Sunday, in an exhibition game for charity against Kansas, even though he couldn't find an offensive rhythm -- he was 6-of-20 -- he kept shooting because Porter always assumes the next shot is good, no matter how many times he has missed.And that confidence is what NBA scouts love about the freshman."He has the size, athleticism, mentality and ability to score," one NBA scout told ESPN.com."He can create his own shot, and the way he does it translates to the NBA level.The NBA game is being played on the wing and to have a versatile and athletic wing that can play multiple spots is crucial."Porter believes he's the show this season.He is college basketball's must-see attraction.It's hard to argue, given how long he held the title of top incoming freshmen, reigning over other big names -- Arizona's Deandre Ayton, Texas' Mohamed Bamba, Duke's Wendell Carter.But that was before Bagley arrived in Durham.Still, Porter is not backing down.Last month, he wore cherry red shoes to a high school coaching clinic as peopled packed in to see a surefire NBA Lottery pick -- possibly the No.1 overall pick.He hollers after dunks.He screams "Gimme dat!"when he chases rebounds.""I mean, [Duke's] Marvin [Bagley] is a good player, but I don't see him being better than me.But he's a good player, I think.I think once the college season starts, that's all that matters: how you perform on the court.We're gonna see.""Michael Porter Jr. Porter plays with fire and flair.He hears his supporters -- and his doubters.He said his "pretty boy" look makes his critics think he's soft.But his efforts this season, he said, will prove them wrong."I'm not scared to play nobody, especially on the court," he said."I'll match up with anybody and not care who you are, how big you are.And, I think, once someone gets on the court with me, they'll feel that."He already has the swagger of a young man who knows he's capable of earning and banking an eight-figure contract in the NBA after his freshman season.And Porter would have earned millions no matter which school he'd pick to play what will likely be his one and only season of college basketball.But he came to Columbia to fulfill what believes is a destined, threefold mission: stay true to his family's spiritual values (his Instagram page says, "God 1st"), lead Missouri back to prominence and secure the top spot in next summer's NBA draft."It depends on what an NBA team needs: If they need a scorer, if they need a big man," he said."You don't have control over that.You just have to do your best in college.For me, I want to play so good, work on my game so much that it's unanimous.Even if they need a 5, they don't have a choice but to take me.That's my goal, to go No.1, but I've got some work to do, for sure."He will be surrounded by familiar faces.The Porters -- Michael Sr. and his wife Lisa -- have eight children.All 10 Porters are at Missouri, and given their faith, they think they are in Columbia at just the right time.Family over everything (peep how I'm the tallest @jontayporter) A post shared by Michael Porter Jr. (@mpj) on Aug 13, 2017 at 6:05pm PDT Two years ago student-led protests, including a threatened boycott by the Missouri football team, over racial bigotry broke out across campus.It lead to the ousters of the school president and chancellor and changed the national perception of the university and put the school in a financial bind.As a result of the lost tuition from the decrease in freshman enrollment, Missouri has been forced to cut more than 400 positions.Now, enrollment for this year's freshman class dropped by 35 percent.As a result, visitors can rent dozens of unused dorms.Part of Missouri's plan to rebuild its image is tied to the success of a basketball team that has gone, virtually overnight, from forgettable to buzzworthy."There has definitely been an excitement, especially around our core fan base," said Christian Basi, a university spokesman."There are a lot of individuals who are looking forward to watching.It's an exciting time to watch and to be preparing for Missouri basketball."The entire program revolves around one family.During a practice last month, Porter dominated with his brother Jontay, who reclassified to play alongside him this season.Michael Porter Sr., his father and an assistant coach who signed a three-year, $1.1 million deal in March, shouted instructions from the baseline.Bri Porter, plagued by knee injuries throughout her career, and Cierra Porter, second in scoring last season at 13.2 PPG, both play on the women's team.Robin Pingeton, Missouri's women's basketball coach, is their mother's sister."I feel like it's a special year for Mizzou basketball," said Jontay Porter, a five-star prospect ranked 25th in ESPN.com's 2017 class rankings."I wanted to be a part of it.I wanted to be with my dad and with my brother, be with my sisters.The hype is unreal around here right now.Mizzou fans are craving a good basketball team again.It's been a rough few years."Michael Porter Jr. comes from some pretty good basketball genes.Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports LISA PORTER IS A LEGEND on the Iowa basketball prep scene, where high schools women's teams played 6-on-6 until the early 1990s.Only forwards could shoot within that format.And the 6-foot-4 center had a reliable jumper.That's how she averaged 58.7 PPG and made 74 percent of her field goal attempts -- no, that is not a typo -- during her senior season at Jefferson High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa."She was a post and we fed her," said Larry Niemeyer, her high school coach."She shot probably 85 to 90 percent of the shots.When you had a stud, you rode her to the championship."She attracted offers from the powerhouses of her era.But the state's Miss Basketball picked Iowa, where she helped the Hawkeyes win their first Big Ten title and reach the Elite Eight.She was invited to the 1984 Olympic Trials and played professionally in France."She was tough ... tough," Michael Jr. said."She was 6-4.It was unguardable."Editor's Picks 2017 ESPN college basketball preseason All-America teams There are freshmen

country in addition to depth.Kansas and Wichita State have rosters filled with playmakers.But Duke has everything.SEC preview: It's not about just Kentucky anymore Sure, the Kentucky is the class of the SEC.That hasn't changed.But for the first time in a long while the Wildcats have company.And this year, in a change for the SEC, they could have a lot of company.2 Related After her playing career in France, she met Michael Porter Sr. at a basketball event in Cincinnati for Athletes in Action, a Christian ministry that uses sports as a tool for evangelism.Sometimes, the duo would dupe unsuspecting competitors in open gyms.Michael Sr. would pick his wife.The guys on the other team, assuming she posed no threat, would make the mistake of leaving her alone."She could shoot it," he said."I would take the ball out and throw it to her every time.We'd be up 8-0 before dudes would be like, 'Hey, man.Guard that girl!'"Their shared beliefs and sports backgrounds fueled their union.Lisa and Michael Sr. became evangelists and worked full-time in those roles for more than 20 years.Michael Sr.'s tool to preach his message?Music.For years, he toured the world as a gospel rapper named Rahlo.Backed by Campus Crusade for Christ, he sported dreadlocks and performed in London, Bulgaria, Jamaica, South Africa and other locations around the world.Sometimes, he'd take his children with him."When people look at my dad, they don't really think 'rapper' just because he's such a nice dude, such a cool cat, but he used to do his thing," Michael Jr. said."I remember going to Jamaica for one of his concerts back in the day.He could really spit some bars."He still makes a small sum each year off royalties for music he produced for TV shows like "Damages" and "Burn Notice" and the video game "NBA 2K7."But the lifestyle put him on the road for long stretches, far from a young family that quickly grew to include multiple small children.Michael Sr.'s mother and father divorced when he was young.And he understood the pain of a parent's absence and refused to recreate that experience with his children.So he decided to quit his music career to focus on fatherhood."My dad used to wake us up at 2:30, 3 o'clock in the morning to take us fishing on the GoldCoast," he said."All my kids fish.All my kids.I missed that when my father was gone.When I started having kids, I wanted to be there more to be a part of that developmental part of their lives."He went from rap to a role to coach, first as a volunteer assistant -- his wife signed him up without telling him -- with his oldest daughter Bri's youth squad.Then he began to teach the entire family.They learned every position.They worked on fundamentals for hours.And the Porter children blossomed.Their parents wanted their Christian tenets -- the siblings participate in weekly Bible study sessions -- to accompany the educational experience of their children.They decided that homeschooling, with Lisa Porter as the teacher, would allow them to continue "imprinting our values" while helping their pack earn scholarships.Lisa Porter said her eldest son never gave her trouble as long as she promised to let him play after he finished his schoolwork."When I was homeschooling him when he was younger, that was the greatest gift," she said."He just had this passion in him.He would be a really good homeschool student if he could go out after and get up shots.He'd get done with math, and he'd go out to the court.He'd get done with science, and he'd go out to the court."That philosophy helped Porter blossom into an elite recruit, coveted by every blue-chip program in America."That's how I got good," Porter said."It was that extra time I was able to put in."In 2016, Lorenzo Romar hired Michael Porter Sr., an assistant for six seasons with the Missouri women's team who worked for his sister-in-law.He received a six-figure pay raise (from $144,000 with Missouri to $300,000 with Washington) to become an assistant with the Huskies.In the early 1990s, Michael Sr. lived with Romar and his family.And the two developed a bond so strong that Romar became Michael Jr.'s godfather.Those family connections placed Romar in the best position to land Michael Jr. "It was never said, 'If you hire me, you'll get my son,'" Romar told ESPN.com."He never said that."Still, Michael Jr. committed to Washington and his godfather after the family moved to Seattle for Michael Sr.'s new job, proof of how much he values familiarity and family.By the spring, however, everything changed.Washington fired Romar after he finished 9-22 with a squad that produced the No.1 pick in the 2017 NBA draft, Markelle Fultz.Porter said that day altered his path."I went there to shoot and saw some of the coaches up there in the bleachers and a couple of them were crying," Porter said."No one thought they were going to get fired, especially with the class they had coming in.I went to dad's office and he was there with Lorenzo.'Man, they might be letting us go.'Ten minutes later, the athletic director finally called [Romar].It was a sad day, a very sad day, but I mean, I kinda consider it a blessing because I'm back here."WHEN MICHAEL PORTER SR. received a call from Cuonzo Martin, he and his wife wanted to be sure he wasn't just looking for a package deal."First of all, we made it clear at every opportunity that this job offer had to be about me," Michael Sr. told ESPN.com."I was not going to be pressuring my son to go someplace so I could have a job.It did not go down like that."But Michael Jr. had his own plan when he decommitted from Washington after Romar's firing and picked the Tigers.Lisa and I had much fun with Michael Jr. for his bday dinner!Happy 19 big head!Romans 12:1-2 pic.twitter.com/BIfLfYIJdb Michael Porter, Sr. (@coachporter8) July 1, 2017 He'd remembered sitting in the nosebleeds to watch Frank Haith's Missouri teams in a packed Mizzou Arena during the six years his father worked for his aunt and the women's team.He said he chose to follow his father back to Columbia to reignite the program he loved in his youth.The program fell on its face after the NCAA uncovered multiple violations under Haith.As a result, the school vacated multiple wins and surrendered scholarships."I remember going to games.I had tickets, but they were all the way up top because it was packed every game," Porter said."You take it back to the last few years, it has been sparse.But I know what Mizzou fans can be like.I know what they're capable of.It's just gonna be awesome to bring back that atmosphere."Somewhere in the upper deck, near his old seats, a young man with a black backpack had snuck into Mizzou Arena to watch a practice last month.It's a familiar scene.Everywhere he walks on campus, Porter is hounded by folks who want his autograph, his time or his photo."It's very frustrating sometimes," Porter said."You just want to go downtown, kick it with your guys and everywhere you go, heads are just turning, looking at you.You can't even act like a normal kid.You've got to act like you're always on your best behavior, even if you're not feeling good.You've got to keep up a certain image.You can't really be you all the time."For Porter, basketball is his release from the conflicts and drawbacks of sudden stardom.During a practice last month, Porter toyed with his teammates.He hit 3-pointers from the wing and the top of the key.He swatted shots on the other end and fought for every rebound.And then, on a fast break, he soared and seemingly paused in midair for what felt like forever before he flushed a dunk.Missouri basketball had changed."He tries to compete every time to win games and it's in his spirit, and I think that's what separates him from other guys his age," Martin said.Eight months ago, Kim Anderson lost his job after an eight-win season.Now, the Tigers will enter 2017-18 as a threat in the SEC and beyond."If you guard him with a guard, which we did almost the whole time, that's hard because he can take you to the post and he was able to do that a couple times," Bill Self told reporters after his team's 93-87 charity exhibition win over Missouri on Sunday."And if you guard him with a big, he's so good behind the arc that it puts a big in jeopardy."He intends to create matchup problems for the next five months and lead the Tigers to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2013.Michael Jr. said he's so inspired to lead Missouri back to the NCAA tournament that he will consider a return for his sophomore season if the team fails to meet its goal."I just want to leave a legacy in college," he said."I think we can do it this year, but if something goes wrong, I'm a team guy.I would come back and try to help the team next year."Few will trust that.But whoever thought Missouri would have a projected top draft pick and a top-five class after what happened last season?Who could have imagined Porter and his family returning to Columbia to save the program?Only a young star who believes everything happens for a reason."My end goal is to get as good as I can and impact a lot of people for the good," Michael Jr. said."I just think that's what I was born to do.God gave me the gift to do it."
Everyone is chasing the Duke Blue Devils in preseason power rankings:::::Two dates impacted the preseason Power Rankings more than anything else in the offseason: Aug. 14 and Sept. 26.Let's start with the second one.On Sept. 26 the FBI announced charges of fraud and corruption against 10 people in the college basketball world, including assistant coaches from Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State and USC.It led to Louisville removing Rick Pitino as coach and suspending McDonald's All American Brian Bowen.Miami and Alabama also came under investigation in the days following the initial news.Editor's Picks ACC preview: Duke has star power, but the Devils are not alone The Blue Devils are loaded with a returning Grayson Allen and prized freshman Marvin Bagley III.Can they win a conference race where Louisville's upheaval might be the biggest story of the season?2017 ESPN college basketball preseason All-America teams There are freshmen and seniors and everything in between, big names (Michael Porter Jr.), and familiar faces (Miles Bridges, Michigan State) and places (Duke).There is also one big, noticeable absence: a prominent school with zero representatives.1 Related Given that there's federal prison time at stake here, it might not be the first thing on people's minds, but of the top 12 teams in the preseason power rankings, four were impacted or mentioned in the investigation.It's unclear what the ramifications will ultimately be for any of these programs -- or any other program eventually involved -- but it will certainly be a cloud that hovers until it's resolved.Louisville is the team most impacted by the FBI investigation in the near-term, as Pitino was one of the best coaches in college basketball, winning two national championships and making seven Final Four appearances.Bowen would have also added perimeter scoring punch, with the ability to get points at all three levels.Acting coach David Padgett still has plenty of talent on hand, but the distractions might be too much for a Final Four appearance.Aug. 14 was Marvin Bagley III's decision to reclassify to 2017 and attend Duke over USC and UCLA.Bagley had been the No.1 prospect in the 2018 class, and his decision immediately vaulted the Blue Devils to the top of the rankings.He's that good, perhaps the best prospect to come out of high school since Anthony Davis in 2011.Bagley takes Duke to another level compared to everyone else in the nation.Their ceiling is simply higher, with four of the 10 best incoming freshmen and last season's preseason player of the year making up the starting five.They're not without issues, though, as we essentially said the same things last season -- when the Blue Devils had a drama-filled, roller-coaster season that ended with a second-round exit in the NCAA tournament.Arizona and Michigan State can make great cases to be preseason No.1.Sean Miller and the Wildcats possess nearly as much talent as Duke and have more experience at key positions, while their defense will likely be more consistent.Michigan State has the Tom Izzo factor, an elite player in Miles Bridges and options at every position.But preseason rankings should come down to talent and ceiling -- and Duke has the highest one in college basketball.1.Duke Blue Devils If everything comes together, Duke has the most talent in the country.There are a couple of things to watch in the early part of the season: How Grayson Allen develops into his role as a leader on a team with mostly freshmen, and whether Trevon Duval is able to keep all the scoring options happy on the offensive end.2.Arizona Wildcats Rawle Alkins' injury (broken bone in his foot) will hurt the Wildcats in the nonconference portion of the season, but Miller has more than enough weapons to fill the void.The biggest knock on Miller has been his lack of a Final Four, but with the depth and talent on his roster this season, 2017-18 should be when he gets over the hump.3.Michigan State Spartans The Spartans are deep and experienced, they have Izzo, and they bring back perhaps the nation's best returning player in sophomore forward Bridges.Turnovers were a major issue for Michigan State last season, though, and Cassius Winston and Lourawls "Tum Tum" Nairn are back at point guard.4.Kansas Jayhawks It's not easy to lose the Wooden Award winner and remain in the top five, but Bill Self brings back enough talent to do that without Frank Mason.Devonte' Graham leads a versatile perimeter group, and former top-10 recruit Malik Newman is eligible after transferring from Mississippi State.The development of Udoka Azubuike will be key.5.Wichita State Shockers The Shockers might struggle in the early going without Landry Shamet and Markis McDuffie, who each suffered injuries in the summer and could miss the start of the season.Gregg Marshall brings everyone back from a 31-win team, and there will be no bubble talk this season with the move to the American Athletic Conference.6.USC Trojans This might seem high for USC basketball, but Andy Enfield has as much talent as anyone in the country.All five starters return from last season, plus the Trojans welcome Duke transfer Derryck Thornton Jr. and McDonald's All American Charles O'Bannon Jr.They need Bennie Boatwright, who missed 17 games last season, to stay on the floor.7.Kentucky Wildcats John Calipari is used to having young teams, but this season is extreme, even for him.Of the top 10 guys on the roster, eight have never played a college game.The leading returning scorer, Wenyen Gabriel, averaged just 4.6 points last season.There will be growing pains, but Kentucky is again the SEC favorite.8.Villanova Wildcats It's a new day for Jay Wright and the Wildcats, with veterans Josh Hart, Kris Jenkins and Darryl Reynolds all moving on.The show never stops, with the next batch of stars ready to take their place.Jalen Brunson is still running point, while Donte DiVincenzo came on strong last season.Big man Omari Spellman gives the Wildcats a different look.9.Cincinnati Bearcats Scoring won't be a problem for the notoriously defensive-minded Bearcats, as three double-digit scorers return in the frontcourt and Jarron Cumberland slots in the backcourt.The key will be Sacred Heart transfer Cane Broome, who averaged 23.1 points as a sophomore but will need to be the point guard for Cincinnati.10.Minnesota Golden Gophers Richard Pitino went from the hot seat to a 5-seed in the NCAA tournament last season, and all five starters are back from that group.Nate Mason and Jordan Murphy lead the way among the veterans, but the arrival of ESPN 100 point guard Isaiah Washington has people excited.The New York native will bring swagger to the Gophers.11.Miami Hurricanes Perhaps Duke's biggest competition in the ACC, the Hurricanes will have one of the nation's best backcourts in Ja'Quan Newton, Bruce Brown Jr. and incoming five-star Lonnie Walker IV.Walker had knee surgery in July, but should be ready for the season.Miami was just 4-11 against top-50 teams last season; that needs to change.12.Florida Gators One of the elite defensive outfits last season, the Gators lose four key members of that Elite Eight team, and it might take Mike White some time to get everyone to buy in at that end of the floor again.Fortunately, Chris Chiozza and KeVaughn Allen return, and transfers Jalen Hudson (Virginia Tech) and Egor Koulechov (Rice) will help.13.West Virginia Mountaineers Bob Huggins will look to "Press Virginia" opponents into oblivion again this season after finishing in the top-two nationally in defensive turnover rate each of the past three seasons.Where will the half-court offense come from?Jevon Carter will lead the way, but the loss of Esa Ahmad for the first half of the season hurts.14.Xavier Musketeers The Musketeers are hoping the momentum of March's Elite Eight run will carry over to this season, especially potential All-American Trevon Bluiett, who averaged 20.4 points in the Big East and NCAA tournaments.Xavier also has an impressive incoming crop of players, led by freshman Paul Scruggs and Green Bay transfer Kerem Kanter.15.Seton Hall Pirates When the Pirates' trio of Khadeen Carrington, Desi Rodriguez and Angel Delgado announced they were returning to school instead of going to the NBA draft, Kevin Willard knew he had a top-25 team on his hands.Those three combined to score 48.2 points -- and Delgado, one of the nation's best big men, added 13.1 rebounds.16.North Carolina Tar Heels Three starters and five rotation members are gone from last season's national champions, but Roy Williams will look to prevent a huge drop-off.Joel Berry II is still running the point (eventually, since he is now out four weeks with a broken hand), and Elite Eight hero Luke Maye will have a bigger role.Beating out Kentucky and Arizona for Pittsburgh transfer Cameron Johnson was key.17.Louisville Cardinals The Cardinals would have been several spots higher, but the FBI investigation that led to the placement of Pitino on unpaid administrative leave and potential ineligibility of Bowen throws everything into question.On the court, Quentin Snider and Deng Adel are back, and there's a long list of potential performers.18.Northwestern Wildcats The streak is finally over.Making its first NCAA tournament appearance in program history last season, the Wildcats are now looking for more.Bryant McIntosh and Scottie Lindsey form one of the Big Ten's best backcourts, and the return of Aaron Falzon from injury should help with perimeter shooting -- one of Northwestern's weaknesses.19.Saint Mary's Gaels Randy Bennett has led the Gaels to a top-two West Coast Conference finish in 12 of the past 14 seasons -- with only one outright regular-season title to show for it.A second could be coming this season.Big man Jock Landale is a dominant option inside, and Emmett Naar leads a plethora of high-level perimeter shooters.20.Notre Dame Fighting Irish You can be fairly certain Mike Brey will have a superefficient offense that can spread the floor and make shots -- and everyone in the program will improve year over year.All-American forward Bonzie Colson and point guard Matt Farrell are entering their senior seasons and will look to go out on a high note.21.UCLA Bruins The Lonzo Ball era is in the history books now, and besides Ball, three other starters and shot-blocker Ike Anigbogu are also gone.Where does Steve Alford turn now?McDonald's All American Jaylen Hands and Aaron Holiday will have the ball in their hands, but he'll need Thomas Welsh to become a more consistent option.22.Gonzaga Bulldogs The Zags had the lead with 2:25 left in the national title game but came up short, and now Mark Few has a reloading job on his hands.Nigel Williams-Goss, Zach Collins, Jordan Mathews and Przemek Karnowski are all gone, but starters Josh Perkins and Johnathan Williams are back.Keep an eye on international forwards Rui Hachimura and Killian Tillie.23.Providence Friars Despite losing Kris Dunn after the 2015-16 season, Ed Cooley managed to lead the Friars to a fourth straight NCAA appearance last season.All five starters are back from that group, led by matchup problem Rodney Bullock.Providence also brings in top-40 recruit Makai Ashton-Langford, one of the best point guards in the 2017 class.24.TCU Horned Frogs The last time we saw the Horned Frogs, they beat Georgia Tech by 32 to win the NIT championship.With all five starters returning from that team, Jamie Dixon has high hopes for this season.There should also be improved depth, with the addition of talented freshmen R.J. Nembhard and Kevin Samuel.25.Texas A&M Aggies Talentwise, the Aggies deserve to be much higher in the preseason rankings.Robert Williams is a lottery pick, Tyler Davis is one of the best bigs in the country, and Admon Gilder and DJ Hogg are also back.A&M went just 16-15 last season with most of the same pieces.Improved point guard play is needed for this team to reach its potential.
CJ McCollum becomes Li-Ning's biggest signing since Dwyane Wade:::::PORTLAND -- CJ McCollum's rapid rise to stardom earned him a $106 million contract extension with the Portland Trail Blazers.The fifth-year guard also suddenly found himself among the most sought-after players by footwear brands this past summer, as his initial four-year sneaker deal with Nike was set to expire.Financial details aside, McCollum was looking for a brand that would feature him and allow him to be involved in curating his own products going forward.Outside of creating his own custom colorways of Kyrie Irving's shoe on Nike's iD website from time to time, developing his own product would be all new territory for the rising guard, who was named the league's Most Improved Player in 2015."I didn't know much about it at all, honestly," McCollum said of sneaker deals when he was first drafted."Watching from afar, and being a fan from afar, I didn't necessarily understand the negotiating side of it and the contract structure of how players go from rookie deals to the next deal.As you go through the NBA, you get a decent understanding of it."He has now become one of the more savvy players around the league, partnering with a growing list of companies and also sharing his own personality and perspective on his social media accounts.Across the globe, longtime Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning took notice and emerged as the most interested, most invested and most aggressive company -- eventually signing McCollum to a lucrative five-year endorsement deal that will make him one of the top-earning players signed to a Chinese company.While Li-Ning might be unfamiliar to some players, McCollum had a unique vantage point among the league's emerging stars.For starters, his older brother Errick had been a star himself in the Chinese Basketball Association for two seasons, leading the league in scoring with 39.6- and 37.5-point averages to close the 2015 and 2017 CBA seasons.His 82-point outburst in 2015 still ranks as the all-time single-game scoring record in China.Having visited the country twice, the younger McCollum was not only familiar with the region, but also the brand, as Li-Ning has been the CBA's official outfitter for the past five years."I was able to learn about it through him and his experience of seeing the previous years of the brand," said McCollum."From 2013 to 2017 now, I've seen how the brand has evolved and how the technology has continued to get better."After his four-year deal with Nike was up, CJ McCollum signed a long-term deal with Chinese brand Li-Ning this summer.Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images From the onset, there was a curiosity and interest from both sides.McCollum was looking to expand on his own brand throughout the region, while Li-Ning was looking to refresh its roster with younger, more explosive players."I was looking for a unique opportunity to go where I was wanted," said McCollum."Similar to college with different universities, there needs to be a mutual admiration.You want to go somewhere where you're wanted and where you can be utilized and have input in the brand.I felt like I was going to have those things and influence into my shoes.With the market four or five times the United States, it could be crucial in my development as a player, person and brand."Fans in China are frantic about the sport, and they still draw their influence from American stars, creating a dynamic where U.S.-born players like Klay Thompson, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett and Shane Battier could all enjoy huge popularity in China with domestic brands.After sponsoring the CBA via a five-year, $300 million partnership that expired this past spring, Li-Ning recently renewed with the local league for exactly half of the marketing commitment.The company's new $150 million pact over the same number of years means the brand is shifting strategy and will have more resources to allocate toward signing NBA players."On the performance side, Li-Ning wants to find more young talent from the league," said Fei Guo, Li-Ning's Basketball Sports Marketing Director."CJ is a guard, and we recognized that CJ has great leadership and the ability to dominate the game in the clutch."A summerlong recruitment Originally founded in 1990 by former Chinese Olympic gymnastics icon Li Ning, the brand has made inroads into basketball for more than a decade.It was the first Asian company to sign an NBA player to an endorsement deal, inking contracts with Damon Jones and Shaquille O'Neal in the mid-2000s.When Li Ning himself lit the flame of the Olympic torch during the 2008 Beijing Summer Games -- one of the sporting world's greatest guerrilla marketing moments, to the frustration of official sponsor Adidas -- the brand soon took on a new global visibility and momentum that saw it gain favor with athletes around the world.Editor's Picks Giannis Antetokounmpo's rise could land him big sneaker deal The Bucks' star forward played his first four NBA seasons with a bargain-basement Nike endorsement deal.That's about to change in a big way this summer.How the Big Baller Brand is trying to disrupt the entire sneaker industry From introducing a $495 signature sneaker to changing his shoes - and brand - every game at summer league, Lonzo Ball's entry into the signature sneaker market is like nothing we've ever seen.What does it all mean for the multi-billion dollar industry?1 Related "We were at the Beijing Olympics and Mr. Li Ning was the one that ended up flying over the 'Bird's Nest' and lighting the torch," Dwyane Wade said after joining the brand in 2012."They kind of blew up in 2008 and that moment really made the name known."As McCollum was sorting through brand presentations and offers, he also did a healthy amount of his own research.He phoned up the former Miami Heat star and Finals MVP often over the summer, picking the brain of the 12-time All-Star about his experience with the brand, the performance of the sneakers and nuances about touring in China.For Wade, who left Nike's Jordan Brand in 2012 to sign with Li-Ning, the move was not only about a major offer that included an equity stake in the company, but also ample creative control.Throughout their conversations, Wade wooed McCollum with his confidence in the product, along with anecdotes about the level of service and attention he receives, and how that compares to his experiences with Jordan Brand."I was just getting an understanding of his overall experience with it," McCollum said."He left at 29 when he went to Li-Ning.With me as a 26-year-old, our mindset and our approach to the situation is very similar."McCollum also got advice from Blazers teammate Evan Turner, who has a long-term deal with Li-Ning and happens to sit directly next to McCollum in the Blazers' locker room."I just kept it real with him, what I liked about the brand and how I thought we could get better," Turner said."As his star was rising, I told him I thought it'd be advantageous for him to partner with an up-and-coming brand."CJ McCollum is averaging a career-high 25.7 PPG this season.Jaime Valdez-USA TODAY Sports Turner, who signed a multimillion dollar deal with Li-Ning as a rookie in 2010, was in China this summer for his own promotional tour with fans.Thanks to technology, he made sure to bring McCollum along from Portland as best he could.The two FaceTimed throughout Turner's weeklong tour, giving McCollum a glimpse into the brand's approach and audience in China."The love he was getting shown there, and the love that they have for basketball, is unlike anything I've ever seen," McCollum said."If you have never been here, you might not really understand how amazing and how big basketball is," said Wade after his first tour with the brand."These fans in China love the sport, and they have more players playing than we have people living in the U.S." Building the McCollum brand "At the beginning, everything is about the sneakers on his feet," Guo said.The early meetings between McCollum and the Li-Ning representatives involved discussions on footwear technologies, branding, colors, materials and a potential logo, but the two sides are taking their time before making any big rollouts.To start the 2016-17 season, McCollum has been playing in the brand's Power 4, Sonic 5 and YuShuai 11 models.There's no signature shoe in stores just yet, as the two sides are focused on the more elementary starting points, like McCollum's preference for red shoes with splatter-painted midsoles.CJ McCollum has been wearing an assortment of Li-Ning sneakers.Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty Images "We're going through all of that now, trying to figure out the logos and how I want to incorporate it -- whether it be initials or actual symbols," McCollum said."It's a tough process, and it's one that we don't want to rush."In addition to the footwear and gear -- which has been inundating McCollum's house on a weekly basis since the contract became official -- the two sides have also discussed a long-term vision of how he and the brand could best work together on more impactful events and programs."I'm looking to bring some of the things that I do in the States over to China," McCollum said."We've already discussed the CJ McCollum Dream Center, functionalities of it, and partnerships with literation programs to continue to educate underserved kids and youth in different areas."From the brand's standpoint, those tours and programs can be expected to begin next summer and touch new regions in China, allowing McCollum to reach fans who otherwise might not have the access and ability to connect with NBA players.The goal is to "visit some cities that NBA players have never visited," Guo said.McCollum has already begun diving into the different platforms throughout China, where he can begin to extend his new partnership."Weibo, WeChat, CCTV and all those different networks allow you to connect better with the people in China," McCollum said."I'm really looking forward to better interject myself into that market."As someone who has built up his own brand in China -- perhaps well beyond what his stateside potential might've been -- Turner is pleased to see his recruitment efforts proved worthwhile."With what he can do to magnify his brand in China, he was smart enough and well aware of what that opportunity meant," Turner said."To have another teammate and another big-time player in the league to represent the brand, is always better for the brand.It shows how serious they are about making a big leap, not only in the NBA, but also in China."Nick DePaula is the creative director for Nice Kicks and former editor-in-chief of Sole Collector Magazine.
Ohio State Buckeyes, Penn State Nittany Lions resume Big Ten rivalry:::::Penn State coach James Franklin explains what it is like to experience a White Out game in Happy Valley and if he has had time to take everything in since taking the job.(3:39) It has been almost exactly 20 years since a Penn State football team sat atop the college football world.The school that helped give the Nittany Lions the last shove upward to a No.1 ranking, Ohio State, might be in position to boost their case for supremacy once again a generation later.No.2 Penn State travels to Columbus this week to face off against No.6 Ohio State in what is shaping up to be the most pivotal Big Ten game of the year.These two programs are no strangers to high stakes when they cross paths.They have met 31 times since the Associated Press starting ranking college football teams, and at least one of the two teams has been ranked in 30 of those games.It might not be considered a traditional rivalry, but the annual game between the Buckeyes and Nittany Lions has almost always delivered some drama."There was always a lot on the line," said former Ohio State running back Pepe Pearson, who took part in the halcyon days of this matchup in the mid-1990s.For the first seven seasons that Penn State was a member of the Big Ten (from 1993 to 1999), the winner of this game was ranked in the top five the following week.And usually, the loser wasn't far behind."We didn't do much trash-talking or anything, but we definitely knew about each other," Pearson said.In those days, the top players in Ohio and Pennsylvania got acquainted before college ball through the annual Big 33 all-star game, which pitted the two states' best high school players against each other at the end of every school year.Several of the stars from those games ended up crossing state lines to play in college, none more famously than Ohio native and Penn State star running back Curtis Enis."That's when I first got to know Curtis.We were both at the Big 33, and I remember I gave him a haircut," said Pearson, now an assistant coach at Marshall."He was big and strong and fast.We were two different types of backs."Pearson got his chance to shine in the rivalry first.He ran for 141 yards as a junior in 1996, when No.3 Ohio State blew away No.4 Penn State 38-7 in Columbus.The win bumped the Buckeyes to No.2 in the polls the following week and helped Pearson fully establish himself as a worthy replacement for Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George.Enis, who was overlooked by his home-state Buckeyes, was distraught.He said he "choked" after running for only 34 yards in that big game.The resentment grew even stronger when he received a letter from an anonymous Buckeyes fan a week later.The equivalent of a mean tweet in the pre-social media era, it read, according to Sports Illustrated: "You suck.We wouldn't want you at Ohio State anyway."Enis kept the letter for a full year.The night before the two teams met again in 1997, the story goes, he tore it to pieces in his hotel room.The following afternoon, he tore apart the seventh-ranked Buckeyes' defense for 211 yards and a game-winning touchdown in the Nittany Lions' 31-27 come-from-behind victory.Sophomore fullback Aaron Harris -- another Big 33 participant, from Pennsylvania -- provided Enis with a major assist.Harris bounced off several Ohio State tacklers on a 51-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter that sparked the comeback."I didn't really hear the crowd 'til I scored," Harris would later say in the book "Game of My Life: Penn State.""But that place erupted."The win, coupled with a Florida loss at LSU the same night, propelled Penn State from No.2 to No.1 in the rankings.The following week, Harris tore his ACL against Minnesota.A close win over the then-lowly Gophers caused voters to rethink the top ranking.Penn State dropped to No.2, then lost three of its last five games.They haven't reached the top of the polls since that 1997 campaign.This time around, the SEC juggernaut keeping Penn State from a No.1 spot is Alabama, and the Crimson Tide won't slip from that perch during their bye week, even if the Nittany Lions leave Columbus with their unblemished record intact.But a win against the Buckeyes would pad Penn State's rsum with the most impressive win among any of the College Football Playoff contenders who remain undefeated.Either way, the history between these two programs is reason to believe that Columbus is in for an impressive show on Saturday afternoon, and most likely for several more years to come.
Will the real J.T. Barrett please stand up:::::If Urban Meyer has said it once, he has said it, well, you know the refrain."The quarterback gets too much blame," Meyer said.Likewise, according to the Ohio State coach, quarterbacks also receive too much recognition.In other words, don't credit J.T.Barrett for all of the Buckeyes' offensive prosperity since a Week 2 loss to Oklahoma.And don't look entirely at him if things go wrong -- be it Saturday at Ohio Stadium when sixth-ranked Ohio State faces No.2 Penn State or next month in his final stretch of regular-season games.For that matter, don't blame Barrett for the Buckeyes' rare struggles of the past two seasons against Big Ten East rivals or in the College Football Playoff semifinal last New Year's Eve.Oh, if only it were that easy.Meyer, a 33-year coaching veteran, knows as well as anyone that Barrett, despite his record-shattering numbers, unquestioned leadership and dramatic rebound since that Sept. 9 loss, will be judged at the end of a complicated career largely by how the Buckeyes finish in their quest to reach a third College Football Playoff in four years.His legacy rides on the next six weeks.Maybe it's not fair, considering that Barrett owns 25 school records and three Big Ten marks -- including his responsibility for 126 touchdowns, 14th in NCAA history.With his next touchdown pass, in fact, Barrett will break the league record he shares at 90 with Drew Brees.Since a Week 2 loss to Oklahoma, J.T.Barrett has been the nation's best in QBR rankings and completed 72 percent of his passes with 18 TDs with no interceptions.The question is now can he continue that run against No.2 Penn State?Scott W. Grau/Icon Sportswire Unfair, sure, but it's reality at Ohio State, where the explosion of yards and points over the past five games are viewed with some skepticism because of the overmatched opponents and the way the Buckeyes and Barrett began this season.Barrett has led Ohio State on a stretch that stands out even in the rich history of this program.The Buckeyes' four straight 50-point games match a school record set in the quarterback's breakout redshirt freshman season of 2014, which ended with a national title as Barrett sat because of a broken ankle.Never before this winning streak has Ohio State accumulated 500 yards of offense or 300 passing yards in five straight games.And Barrett has been the best quarterback in the country since he faltered in the 31-16 loss to the Sooners.He completed 72 percent of his throws against Army, UNLV, Rutgers, Maryland and Nebraska, ranking No.1 nationally during those victories in raw QBR and Total QBR, which accounts for the level of competition, and first in passing efficiency.He's the only quarterback in the FBS to throw for more than six touchdowns since Week 3 without an interception; and Barrett has tossed 18 scoring passes."We'll see if we're having this conversation in a few weeks," Meyer said."If we are, that means we're a legitimate top offense."It means, too, that Barrett has put to rest talk that he feasts against subpar competition and falls short when the stakes rise.Such a perception was born in 2015 as Barrett faltered in a loss to Michigan State.He struggled late in the Buckeyes' 24-21 loss last year to the Nittany Lions, then completed barely 50 percent of his passes for 337 yards, with only two completions of 20 yards or more, while getting sacked 14 times in Ohio State's closing stretch against Michigan State, Michigan and Clemson."I've grown with him," Ohio State center Billy Price said."I know what he can do.I was there with him in '14 and went on that spurt with him."Price said his belief in Barrett and in the Buckeyes' offense stayed strong after Week 2.With a new set of offensive coordinators in Kevin Wilson and Ryan Day, the coaches had to get in sync with the personnel, Price said, allowing Barrett to best distribute the ball to his teammates.It has worked, Meyer and the other Ohio State coaches said, because of Barrett's practice habits.And the senior QB said he's not sure if he has ever played better or with more confidence than right now."The guy gets a lot of criticism," Wilson said."It comes with the territory.It comes with the position.It comes with where he plays.He gets a lot of notoriety.I think he knows that.And it's not like we're not sitting here, feeling that we've got things figured out."We've got nice momentum.I think J.T.'s a big part of that.But we're just now getting to the meat of our schedule."Penn State comes to Columbus this week with the top unit nationally in scoring defense and yards allowed per pass attempt."This is a good time to be cooking," Meyer said after the Buckeyes' last game, a 56-14 win at Nebraska on Oct. 14 as Barrett accounted for seven touchdowns.For his part, Barrett said the older Buckeyes and Meyer often reflect on the 2014 championship season.The offensive rhythm this year feels even better, he said.So much so that in the game at Nebraska, Barrett said, he failed to realize that Ohio State had not punted until he saw Drue Chrisman on the sideline late in the victory."I almost wanted to say I'm sorry," Barrett said, "but I didn't."He credits the offensive improvement to the Buckeyes' continued drive to improve in practice, a factor endorsed by Meyer.Wilson, who coached Indiana for the past six years before joining Meyer, said he gained respect for Barrett after watching him handle seemingly mundane tasks."And from afar, I had a lot of respect after competing against him," the coach said."What he brings in leadership and passion, what he brings in the way he prepares, I have great admiration for what he's giving our football team."With his legacy on the line, Barrett remains focused on practice habits, small improvement and daily work.Teammates have followed his example."On the sideline," Price said, "you can definitely feel that mojo.You can feel that momentum and confidence."All of it leads to an undeniable conclusion that might not, in this instance, upset Meyer's old axiom: As Barrett goes, so go the Buckeyes.
Week 8 NFL Power Rankings: Who's alive (or barely holding on) in every division:::::The Chiefs slipped from their perch at the top of the NFL Power Rankings, and that void was filled by the defending champs.But as the Patriots and Cowboys rise, the Falcons and Broncos are headed in the wrong direction.(1:00) Seven weeks are in the books, and a handful of division races still look (relatively) tight.But thanks to ESPN's Football Power Index, we have some clarity.Editor's Picks Best and worst QBs of Week 7: Bortles is No.1 ... for a day The Jags quarterback had his day in the sun, while C.J.Beathard struggled against America's team.What we learned (and didn't) in Week 7: Who's hot and who's not After four victories in a row, the Saints are heating up.Same with the five teams riding three-game winning streaks.But there are also a few teams going the other way, including the winless Browns and 49ers.We're all about streaks in Week 7's lessons.1 Related Here's a rundown of the Week 8 Power Rankings, as voted on by our power panel -- a group of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities -- with a breakdown of every team's chance to win its division, according to FPI.ESPN Stats & Information's John McTigue contributed the following information.Methodology: These rankings are based on which teams voters think would win head-to-head matchups.Higher-ranked teams would be favored against lower-ranked teams.Coming off a win doesn't guarantee a jump, and a loss doesn't guarantee a fall.Previous rankings: Week 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | Preseason 2017 record: 5-2 Week 7 ranking: No.3 84.0 percent.The AFC East might look closer than ever in the standings, but FPI still indicates the Patriots are the clear favorites to win the division.It'll take some big efforts from the Bills, Dolphins or Jets to top the team that has won 14 of the past 16 division titles.2017 record: 6-1 Week 7 ranking: No.2 86.4 percent.Carson Wentz leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (17) and already has surpassed his TD total from last season (16).He also has led the Eagles to their best start since 2004 and has given them the best chance of winning the NFC East.2017 record: 5-2 Week 7 ranking: No.1 88.7 percent.FPI might be singing a different tune if the Chiefs lose a third straight game in Week 8 to the Broncos, but for now, the Chiefs are an overwhelming favorite to win the AFC West.Despite the recent losses, they still have the second-most points per game and third-best point differential.2017 record: 5-2 Week 7 ranking: No.4 94.8 percent.The Steelers already are 3-0 in division play and the only team with a winning record in the AFC North.FPI gives them nearly a 95 percent chance of winning back-to-back division titles for the first time since 2007-08.2017 record: 3-3 Week 7 ranking: No.12 12.5 percent.The Eagles are making it difficult for everyone else in the NFC East right now, but Dallas still has two games in hand against them and five total division games left.The Cowboys' 12.5 percent chance of winning the division might seem low, but it could look much different in a few weeks.2017 record: 4-2 Week 7 ranking: No.5 77.8 percent.A win over the Rams in Week 5 has Seattle in the driver's seat for the NFC West, and the two teams won't meet again until Week 15.The Seahawks continue to win with defense, allowing a league-best 15.7 points per game this season.2017 record: 5-2 Week 7 ranking: No.9 21.8 percent.How do the Rams, who currently lead the NFC West and have the best point differential (plus-74) in the NFL, have a less than 22 percent chance of winning the division?In Los Angeles, it's all about who you know ... er, who you've beaten, and the Rams didn't beat the Seahawks.That puts L.A. in the back seat until it can beat Seattle or create more separation.2017 record: 5-2 Week 7 ranking: No.13 72.0 percent.Just two weeks ago, Minnesota's chances of winning the division were down to 21 percent.With Aaron Rodgers out, the Vikings are the favorite to win the NFC North now.Five of their next six games are on the road, though, so they'll need to improve on their 11-15 away record under coach Mike Zimmer to keep those chances high.2017 record: 3-3 Week 7 ranking: No.11 16.6 percent.The Texans have scored at least 33 points in four straight games, but they are just 2-2 in those contests.Rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson has brought

Done again? Another twist in the bizarre career of Martina Hingis:::::Martina Hingis announced that she will retire from tennis after her last match at the WTA Finals in Singapore.(0:52) Is she a proud athlete or is this another twist in the topsy-turvy career of Martina Hingis?It's a harsh but legitimate question now that she has decided to retire for a third time.On Thursday at a news conference in Singapore, Hingis unexpectedly announced she was walking away from the game again.The timing of the decision came in much the same way she traveled through the game for 23 remarkably successful and often bizarre years.Earlier in the day, she and partner Yung-Jan Chan had advanced to the final four of the WTA Finals, their 19th straight win.(Hingis will finish this event before hanging it up.)In September, Hingis won Grand Slam Nos.24 and 25, in doubles and mixed, at the US Open.So why now?She and Chan are the No.1 team in the world, after all.Martina Hingis won 25 Grand Slam titles, including two at this year's US Open, in her career.Clive Brunskill/Getty Images "I think it's perfect timing," Hingis said Thursday."You know, you want to stop on top and not when you're already going backwards."Give Hingis this: She knows what it looks like at the top, and she knows what it is to go backwards.The careers of most players are roughly bell shaped.Hingis' looks like a page torn from a seismograph during a day of unusual volcanic activity.This is a player who was mature enough at the age of 16 in 1997 to fall one singles match short of a calendar-year Grand Slam.Less than two years later, she was also one haughty enough to throw a tantrum, break down in tears and nearly get herself booed off the court at the French Open because of her unsportsmanlike conduct in a match with much-loved Steffi Graf.At the time, she had already played in eight Grand Slam singles finals, winning five.She wouldn't win another.Yet Hingis remained competitive and held the No.1 ranking, off and on, for 209 weeks until as late as 2001.She was quick, with plenty of touch, soft hands and a great tactical sense.But she was just 5-foot-7 and neither explosive nor muscular.The game began passing her by as the Williams era dawned.Hingis retired from tennis for the first time following her second ankle surgery, in May of 2003.She said she wanted to concentrate on her equestrian interests and to complete her education.But her real genius was for tennis, and she couldn't stay away long.She played sparingly in 2005 and mounted a full-blown singles comeback in 2006, where still just 26, she finished the year ranked No.7.Editor's Picks Hingis, 25-time Grand Slam champ, to retire Swiss star Martina Hingis, who has won 25 Grand Slam singles and doubles titles during her Hall of Fame career, is retiring after the WTA Finals.While injuries became an inhibiting factor the following season, Hingis was ultimately forced out of the game in November 2007 after she tested positive at Wimbledon for a metabolite of cocaine.She ended up suspended until October 2009.Afterward, Hingis remained at the fringes of the game, then reinvented herself as a main-tour doubles specialist, officially coming out of retirement in 2013 -- the same year she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.She would then win her first Grand Slam title since 2006 at the 2015 Australian Open, taking the mixed-doubles event with Leander Paes.The titles began to pile up soon thereafter.She and Sania Mirza won three majors together, before partnering with Chan to run through the draw in New York.Who knows, maybe there will be more to come.As Hingis wrote in her retirement declaration: "This isn't a good-bye.As history shows, I haven't been able to stay away from tennis for very long in the past."I'm not sure she meant that literally, but given her history, maybe we should read it that way.
How Lewis Hamilton can seal world title No.4 in Mexico:::::MEXICO CITY -- Lewis Hamilton's victory in Austin inched him to the verge of this year's championship crown.The Mercedes driver holds a 66-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel with three races, and 75 points, left to play for.The permutations for this weekend are simple -- much like he had to do for his first championship at the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, he must finish fifth or better.Unlike that dramatic Sao Paulo climax, where he passed Timo Glock for fifth at the penultimate corner, he has two more races to secure the handful of points he needs this season.Lewis Hamilton is on the brink of winning his fourth F1 world title after winning in Japan.Sutton Images By finishing fifth or higher, Hamilton will ensure he is at least 50 points ahead of Vettel with the final two races to space.Given Hamilton's recent form, it seems unlikely the championship will continue into Brazil without car failure or driver error.The close fight in Austin should have served as a reminder of how close this championship could have been.It's also likely Ferrari will be left wondering what might have been in Mexico City, where Mercedes is braced for a difficult weekend at the high-altitude circuit.With a resurgent Red Bull impressing every weekend, fifth position might well be a fair target for Hamilton and Mercedes this weekend.Though it features a long start-finish straight -- where Valtteri Bottas' Williams topped out at 372.54 km/h last year -- it also has two twisty, technical parts of the circuit likely to favour Ferrari and Red Bull.With Hamilton proving in Austin he has no desire to win the championship by collecting the points he needs to, all the ingredients are still in place for a classic contest.
Freddie Roach on cornering his first UFC fight, St-Pierre's contract and McGregor:::::Brett Okamoto discusses how legendary boxing trainer Freddie Roach has been involved with Georges St-Pierre's camp for his bout with Michael Bisping.(1:34) Legendary boxing trainer Freddie Roach will be in Georges St-Pierre's corner next week when he returns from a four-year absence to face Michael Bisping at UFC 217.The middleweight championship fight will mark the first UFC bout Roach has ever cornered.If things go according to plan, it won't be the last.Roach has known St-Pierre for years and actually helped negotiate his latest UFC contract.Starting last month, Roach flew from Los Angeles to Montreal on a weekly basis to be involved in St-Pierre's preparations for the fight.Editor's Picks Top storylines to watch at UFC 217 UFC 217 on Nov. 4 in New York is quite possibly the most exciting MMA card of the year.What are the major reasons to tune in?Our contributors give their picks.My life as a fighter: Jim Miller When Jim Miller fights on Saturday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, it will be his 28th appearance in the Octagon, a UFC record.The 34-year-old spoke with ESPN about the highs and lows of his career, including weight classes, injuries and what's next.Guide to UFC 217: Predictions and analysis Everything you need to know about UFC 217, which takes place Saturday, Nov. 4, in New York, headlined by a middleweight title fight between Georges St-Pierre and Michael Bisping.2 Related At 57, and with several active boxers still under his wing, Roach admitted it was a demanding schedule -- but he's meshed well with St-Pierre's team at Tristar MMA and is committed to the final chapter of the Canadian's career, however long that lasts."I've never been an elite MMA trainer, but Georges made me promise I would work his corner and I'm holding up to that," Roach told ESPN."This might be a little different than boxing, but it is combat sports and I know how to fight.I used to be a wrestler in high school.I was never a great wrestler but I have an idea on it and watching it during camp has given me a better idea.Everyone in the corner is real friendly with one another and I will give the best information I can in there on fight night, and it won't be strictly boxing."St-Pierre (25-2) has been a little coy on any plans that go beyond next weekend at Madison Square Garden.He's stated that, contractually, he must defend the UFC's middleweight title if he wins on Nov. 4 in New York.The former welterweight champion has also said he'll walk away if he loses, and that either way, he's not interested in calling out a money fight with the sport's biggest star, Conor McGregor.Roach has an inside track to St-Pierre's long-term plans, due to his role in contract negotiations.He declined to detail St-Pierre's ideal scenario, other than to say it currently involves three fights.He admitted, personally, he'd welcome a fight against McGregor."McGregor is a cocky kid and he did OK in his fight against Floyd Mayweather.I would just say OK," Roach said."I would enjoy that fight and I would like to see that fight happen.It's possible."Right now, we're just concentrated on this fight.The thing is, we have a three-fight contract with [UFC president Dana White] and we have to win every one for the contract to go on.If everything goes well and Georges wants to retire at the end, that's up to him.If he still has fight in him, and if I still have fight in me, we'll go on from there.I'm sure he'll receive many offers.Bigger and better offers."Freddie Roach will be cornering Georges St-Pierre at UFC 217 in New York City.Michelle Butalon/AFP/Getty Images Of course, defeating Bisping (30-7), a good boxer in his own right, must come first.Roach said he's happy with the progress St-Pierre has made in his striking and believes he can win in that area, but the game plan won't shy away from St-Pierre's well-known ground game."Everyone is talking about Bisping's size, but I say, 'Hey, I love fighting big guys,'" Roach said."Tall guys give you a bigger target obviously, and are a lot slower.I think this guy is made for us.He says he doesn't think we can outbox him.We can and we will outbox him."If a [standup fight] happens, then is happens.But the thing is, if we have other opportunities to do things Georges is more accustomed to doing, we will do that."Believe me, we're not going to be like Ronda Rousey, where someone told her she was a good boxer when she was winning every fight of her life on the ground.I'm not going to lie to my fighter.We've been working on everything and will take advantage of everything."
After a Decade, Joe Girardi Is Out as Manager of the Yankees:::::It will now be up to Cashman to find a new manager, although Cashman himself still has to sign a new contract with the club.The most likely internal candidate is Joe Espada, who worked as a special assistant to Cashman for one season before becoming the Yankees third-base coach in 2015.Espada, who is 42, has a strong relationship with several of the young, Spanish-speaking Yankee players.Cashman was developing a list of candidates on Thursday, according to the baseball executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.And that list will almost certainly include candidates from outside the Yankees organization as Cashman tries to figure out who is best suited to managing a young team brimming with talent while dealing with the media scrutiny that the Yankees attract.The decision to part with Girardi comes after a postseason run that was both exhilarating and painfully disappointing for the Yankees, ending with a loss in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.Two other managers the Washington Nationals Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox John Farrell lost their jobs this month after their teams were ousted from the postseason.Girardi now becomes the third.In his decade in the Bronx, Girardi compiled a 910-710 record and was the third-longest-tenured active manager in the major leagues before he was let go, behind the Los Angeles Angels Mike Scioscia and the San Francisco Giants Bruce Bochy.Photo In recent years, he was able to get aging Yankee teams to at least stay in the hunt for a postseason berth.And then came the 2017 campaign, in which Girardi found himself presiding over a younger and, at times, dynamic roster that began to exceed just about everyones expectations as the season progressed.It was a club that chased the Red Sox to the penultimate day of the regular season for the division title before ending up with a wild-card berth.And it was a club that then embarked on a postseason run that did not end until last weekend.Girardis unyielding manner be it his rigorous preparation or his sometimes-contentious back and forth with the news media was reflected in that run, in which the Yankees twice rallied from two-games-to-none deficits in postseason series only to ultimately fall short.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it was during the postseason run that Girardi also came under fierce criticism for his managing.It grew out of the Yankees Game 2 loss in the division series against the Cleveland Indians, a game in which Girardi declined to ask for a replay review of a hit-by-pitch call a decision that opened the door for an Indians comeback.Girardi, who made a rare admission the next day I screwed up, he said repeatedly at a news conference was afforded a reprieve when the Yankees rallied to win the next three games to advance to the A.L.C.S.against the Houston Astros.Still, the withering criticism that was directed at him after the Game 2 blunder seemed to affect him deeply and, for the first time, raised the notion that his decade in the Bronx had worn on him.And Saturday night, after the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros, Girardi had an almost fatalistic tone as he discussed his baseball future.Ive had 10 great years here, he said.I feel extremely blessed.God has been good to me, and well see what the future holds.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That same night, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi and did not single him out for praise.I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go, to be the last team standing, and we fell short, Cashman said.Though Cashman and Girardi have divergent personalities and far different interests, they had generally enjoyed a strong working relationship.I think he knows that he can speak his mind in a constructive way with me, and I can speak my mind in a constructive way with him, Cashman said at the start of the 2016 season.Theres an openness that is encouraged here.I acquire the talent, and Joe deploys the talent, and sometimes youll have disagreements on players capabilities that Ive acquired or strategies that hes employing.Photo Youve got to be able to work through those in a healthy manner to have a successful manager-general-manager relationship, and Im proud to say we have that, Cashman added.But at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, Girardi may have had some difficulties on that front.He became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchezs inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, a rarity for Girardi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And in the wake of Girardis botched replay decision, closer Aroldis Chapman liked a social media post that urged the Yankees not to bring Girardi back.Chapman later said he had done it inadvertently.Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to replace Torre, as manager, had a rocky first season in 2008, when the Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time since the strike-aborted season of 1994.But the Yankees made an immediate turnaround and won the 2009 World Series the 27th in franchise history in a new stadium.That championship also meant a change of uniform for Girardi.He switched to No.28 from No.27 because he wanted a visible reminder of the number of championships the Yankees had accumulated, along with the inference that another one would surely come soon enough.But it did not.In an interview before the start of the 2017 season, Hal Steinbrenner largely absolved Girardi for the disappointments the Yankees had encountered, including a failure to make the playoffs in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi?, Steinbrenner said.Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadnt made the playoffs in two to three years?Had he lost control of the team?Did the players no longer respect him?Is it a serious situation in that regard?And the answer to that in my opinion was no.There have been plenty of owners that have fired managers left and right and still arent winning, Steinbrenner added.So how well does that work?Girardi, who has three children, has long touted the importance of family.He skipped a game this season in Tampa to attend the high school graduation of his oldest daughter, and he made it comfortable for players and coaches to leave the team for significant events in their lives.And Girardi said last week that he would meet with his family after the season to gauge how they felt about him returning.Im not living my kids lives; Im not living my wifes life, he said.Im living, in a sense, my life, so I dont know what changes for them.Now, however, much has changed for Girardi.He is no longer the Yankees manager.
After Barrage of Home Runs in the World Series, Juicy Theories as to Why:::::That was basically the story of Game 2, when the Astros and the Dodgers combined for five home runs in extra innings something that had never been done in major league history, even in the regular season.Major leaguers combined for a record 6,105 homers in 2017, and the postseason has been no different.The very first batter, Minnesotas Brian Dozier, went deep to start the first wild-card game.In their National League Championship Series loss to the Dodgers, the Chicago Cubs scored eight runs on homers, and no runs any other way.Of the 17 runs scored in this World Series, 14 have come on homers.Everybodys swinging for the fences, said a weary Ken Giles, the Astros closer, who served up Yasiel Puigs 10th-inning blast in Game 2.Home runs this series have been the big play so far.We need to figure out a way to prevent it.On Friday, the series shifts to Minute Maid Park, where the Astros are 6-0 this postseason.Jose Altuve began the Astros playoff run with three homers there in the division series opener.The Dodgers also got a three-homer game in the playoffs, by Enrique Hernandez in the N.L.C.S.clincher.Teams generally must slug to win.The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the playoffs this season; the Astros were first, at .478, and the Dodgers were tied for seventh with the Cubs, at .437.If this World Series becomes one big home run derby, the Astros like their chances.If it comes down to a slugfest, my moneys on us, third baseman Alex Bregman said.We bang.Were the best-hitting team in baseball.Well step in that box ready to go every time.Its fun to be a part of an offense like this.Bregman homered off Clayton Kershaw in Game 1, the only blemish across Kershaws seven dazzling innings.It was typical of the way opponents have tried to handle Kershaw this month: With little chance of bunching hits together, they simply try to swing big.Photo The strategy is failing; while Kershaw has allowed all eight of his runs on homers this postseason, he is 3-0 with a 2.96 earned run average.He is scheduled to face Keuchel in Game 5 on Sunday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for Keuchels assertion widely shared by other pitchers around the league that the balls have been altered, Commissioner Rob Manfred has consistently denied it.He reiterated that stance before the American League wild-card game this month.Were using two different labs that have been looking at the ball on a continuous basis all year, Manfred said.Balls are within specs; theres been no movement even within the range of the specifications in terms of the baseball.Ive said before I think theres other issues causing the home runs other than the baseball principally, the way the games being played, the tolerance for strikeouts, power pitching, guys changing their swing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Manfred added that fans like home runs, a point that is hard to argue.Excitement surged through Dodger Stadium with each home run on Wednesday night, and the hitters reacted memorably: The Dodgers Joc Pederson joyously gestured to the crowd; Carlos Correa gleefully flipped his bat toward the Astros dugout; Puig gently placed his bat on the dirt; Charlie Culberson cavorted as if he were Joe Carter.Guys have been superaggressive, trying to get a fastball or attack a first pitch thats what Ive been seeing, said the Astros Chris Devenski, who gave up Culbersons two-out homer in the 11th but struck out Puig with a changeup to end it.Its baseball.It goes in streaks; it goes in spurts at times.The last time the World Series came to Southern California, in 2002, home runs were also the big story.The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 in Anaheim, 11-10, with the teams combining for six home runs, out of a record 21 for the Series.Players openly guessed that the ball was juiced then, too.Al Levine, a nonroster pitcher for the Angels, actually took a Ginsu knife and sliced open a World Series ball and a regular-season ball in the clubhouse during that game.He concluded that the World Series ball was wound tighter.When I cut them open, one was easier, definitely, Levine said then.The World Series ball was a lot tougher to get through.Troy Percival, the Angels closer who had given up a towering homer to Barry Bonds, put it this way: Its like throwing a smooth rock.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Predictably, baseball denied any shenanigans.By then, though, the owners and the players had agreed to implement steroid testing the next season.The program has gradually gotten tougher since then, including a provision that players suspended during the regular season cannot take part in the postseason.We have been fooled before, of course, but this generation of players seems to want a clean game.A widespread, coordinated cheating epidemic that consistently beats baseballs testing program seems a little hard to fathom.In any case, this World Series has so far reflected the game in 2017: dinger after dinger after dinger, breaking records and turning most players into awe-struck fans.I dont know what to tell you, man, Correa said.It was so much fun.
N.F.L. Picks: Steelers Over Lions; Cowboys Over Redskins:::::Detroits defense is not nearly as crisp as Pittsburghs, but it can be just as opportunistic.If Roethlisberger is at all careless with his passes, Detroit will make him pay for it.Golden Tates being limited, or possibly inactive, with a sprained AC joint takes some jolt out of the Lions offense, but this should be a close game.Pick: Steelers 49ers at Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Eagles by 13 The 49ers (0-7) are very bad.The Eagles (6-1) are very good.It is not hard to predict that Philadelphia will take care of business at home against a winless opponent, but a spread of 13 points is demanding a blowout, and San Franciscos plucky young defense may be up to the task of preventing that from happening.As good as the Eagles have been, they have kept things close in four of their six wins, and they have little reason to try to run up the score against an overmatched opponent.Pick: 49ers Texans at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., CBS Line: Seahawks by 5.5 Thanks to the emergence of Deshaun Watson, the Texans (3-3) have averaged 39.3 points a game over the last four weeks.The hype has been deafening, but in reality, he has yet to face a very challenging defense.That ends this week, as the Seahawks (4-2) are the type of team that has the combination of talent and veteran know-how to truly mess with a rookie quarterbacks mind.A victory might be too much to ask for, but Watson is talented enough to keep things close, making a 5.5-point spread a bit too generous.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Redskins, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Cowboys by 2 This game could be Ezekiel Elliotts last one for quite some time, as he has a court hearing on Monday that could determine the fate of his six-game suspension.Elliott seemed to be buckling under the weight of the looming punishment at the start of the season, but he has looked like his old self in the last two weeks, and it is no coincidence that the Cowboys (3-3) have righted the ship along the way.At a glance, the Redskins (3-3) seem to have a good run defense, but they have allowed so few yards because teams have chosen not to run against them, which wont be the case with Dallas in town.Pick: Cowboys Second-Tier Matchups Photo Bears at Saints, 1 p.m. Fox Line: Saints by 9 Relying on your teams defense to do all the scoring is not a sustainable strategy in the N.F.L., but that is what has been working for the Bears (3-4) in the Mitchell Trubisky era.The rookie quarterback has done almost nothing notable, averaging 116 passing yards per game, but has a 2-1 record despite having thrown just two touchdown passes in a three-game stretch in which his teams defense scored three.The Saints (4-2) are a tough team to play defense against, especially at home, but if Chicagos surge on that side of the ball has not been a mirage, it should be able to beat a 9-point spread.Pick: Bears Raiders at Bills, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bills by 2.5 There is nothing like crushing a well-regarded division rival to lift the spirits of a flailing team, and the Raiders (3-4) did just that with a come-from-behind win against Kansas City.Derek Carr returned to his 2016 form just in time to lead a game-winning drive.Unfortunately for Carr, the Bills (4-2) have a habit of making opponents miserable, and they can likely gut out an ugly win.With Marshawn Lynch suspended, Oakland will have a hard time controlling the clock.Pick: Bills Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Chargers at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Patriots by 7 This game will serve as an indication of whether the Patriots (5-2) fixed their problems in the secondary last week, or if Atlanta simply was not good enough to take advantage of New Englands biggest weakness.Philip Rivers does not have the same confidence problems that the Falcons have been dealing with, so he will probably challenge New England early and often.If this game were in Los Angeles, the Chargers (3-4) would stand a better chance, but the Patriots are incredibly tough to beat at home.Pick: Patriots Panthers at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Buccaneers by 2.5 Cam Newton has had two brutal games in a row.He has completed just 57 percent of his passes, and his five interceptions matched his total from the first five games combined.But watching the Panthers (4-3), it is easy to feel sorry for Newton as he is brutalized on play after play.Even the successful plays many of which have come with Newton running rather than passing end with big hits.The big quarterback rarely has extended stretches of ineffectiveness, and an important division game against the equally-struggling Buccaneers (2-4) should bring out the best in him.Pick: Panthers Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom-Tier Games Photo Dolphins at Ravens, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL Network Line: Ravens by 3 Cameron Wake, a defensive end for the Dolphins (4-2), managed to sum up Thursday Night Football in one convenient quotation.He told reporters this week: To be very honest, nobody is going to be ready the way they like to be.Theyll be as ready as you can be on Thursday night.With Matt Moore expected to start for the injured Jay Cutler, Miamis offense will run through the teams running back, Jay Ajayi, and that spells trouble for the Ravens (3-4), as they are ranked last in rushing yards allowed per game.Pick: Dolphins Vikings vs. Browns at London, 9:30 a.m., NFL Network Line: Vikings by 9.5 The Browns (0-7) will play their first game without tackle Joe Thomas since 2006, so Spencer Drango, a second-year player out of Baylor, will be protecting DeShone Kizers blind side against a Minnesota defense that is tied for sixth in sacks, with 21.It is understandable for the Vikings (5-2) to be road favorites in the neutral site of Londons Twickenham Stadium, but a spread of nearly 10 points is a lot to ask for from an underwhelming Minnesota offense.Pick: Browns Falcons at Jets, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 5 The Jets (3-4) followed a three-game winning streak with consecutive losses, but they played well in both games and lost them by a combined 10 points.They go into every game with a talent deficit, but Coach Todd Bowles has had them focused and prepared each week.There is no reason the Falcons (3-3) shouldnt mop the floor with them based on personnel, but the same thing was true in their recent losses to Miami and Buffalo.Unless the team has figured out what has been holding its offense back, this game could be close.Pick: Jets Colts at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bengals by 10.5 Jacoby Brissett endured a beating last week that few other quarterbacks have.He was sacked or hit on 31 of his teams 67 plays, and the Colts (2-5) spent the week arguing about whether it was appropriate for T. Y. Hilton, a wide receiver, to blame his teams offensive line for the blowout loss.The Bengals (2-4) do not have the players to replicate Jacksonvilles savagery, but they will try.A point spread of 10.5 points is enormous, but the Colts have lost by more than that in three of the last five weeks, with the other two games being wins against the two worst teams in the N.F.L.Pick: Bengals Mondays Matchup Broncos at Chiefs, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Chiefs by 7 The Broncos (3-3) scored 42 points in Week 2, and in the four games since, they have also scored 42 points combined.The Chiefs (5-2) are a division rival that not only has more talent than Denver, and home-field advantage, but also the motivation of having lost two close games in a row after a 5-0 start.Denvers defense can probably limit Alex Smith and the Chiefs to a few touchdowns and a bunch of field goals, but that should be plenty to outscore Trevor Siemian and the Denver offense.Pick: Chiefs.
Checking In on the Nonconformist New Orleans Pelicans:::::While the rest of the league is pivoting to sharpshooting guards and swingmen, the Pelicans have turned back the clock and are trying to win games an old-fashioned way with two very big men in the frontcourt, Cousins and Anthony Davis making their performances this season a major point of intrigue for N.B.A.fans.It really has become a guard-oriented league, the Pelicans coach, Alvin Gentry, said during an interview in his office at the teams practice court.Look at Washingtons backcourt and Portlands backcourt.Were bucking the trend and seeing if we can start a fad of our own by playing big guys and trying to take advantage of mismatches.It wouldnt be so much starting a fad as resurrecting an old one.The Houston Rockets reached the N.B.A.finals in 1986 on the backs of their formidable frontcourt, Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon, nicknamed the Twin Towers.Tim Duncan and David Robinson adopted the same nickname several years later when they turned the San Antonio Spurs into one of the leagues most consistently excellent teams, winning two titles.Photo But now, in a league dominated by the relatively diminutive Warriors, who work most of their magic far from the basket, pairings like the Twin Towers feel as quaint as Etonics and short shorts.Cousins joined the Pelicans in February, in a trade from the Sacramento Kings.So this is the first full season that he and Davis are together.Like Cousins, Davis is 6 feet 11 inches with a wingspan of more than 7 feet.Like Cousins, Davis spent one year at Kentucky before being selected in the N.B.A.s draft lottery.Like Cousins, Davis is an established All-Star who has spent most of his career with weak supporting casts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is deep skepticism leaguewide about whether the Pelicans strategy will be successful, primarily because of the lack of shooters surrounding Cousins and Davis and the teams failure to make the playoffs for the last two seasons.Rockets Coach Mike DAntoni recently said in an interview that it was no longer ideal to play two traditional centers at the same time, but it is possible to be successful playing two big men who are able to shoot 3-pointers.Neither Cousins nor Davis is a particularly dangerous 3-point shooter.But the Pelicans approach could eventually prove to be so far out of vogue that it confounds opponents.Theres very few bigs in the league compared to 20 years ago, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said, referring to the Pelicans as an anomaly.Who else is going to get two bigs like these guys?They present a challenge because they make us play a different style of defense than what weve grown accustomed to.Despite the teams 1-3 record entering Thursday nights game at Sacramento, the early results for the Cousins-Davis tandem have been promising.The Pelicans outscored their opponents by 19 points in the 87 minutes in which both Cousins and Davis were on the court.Last season, the Pelicans outscored opponents by 41 points in the 394 minutes their two big men played together.They have managed to produce big numbers without negating each other.In the 17 games Cousins played with New Orleans after the trade, he averaged 24.4 points and 12.4 rebounds.Davis averaged 28.3 points and 11.1 rebounds.Davis, who scored 35 points in the Pelicans loss to Golden State (as did Cousins), said he was encouraged by how well he jelled with Cousins on the floor.He said that he felt it was an improvement from previous games.We knew that we were bigger on the inside and we just wanted to play in the post and attack their bigs, Davis said.I think we did a good job of that because all their bigs were in foul trouble.Thats the way we want to play.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Pelicans didnt necessarily set out to revive an old lineup strategy.When they acquired Cousins from the Kings, they were 23-34 and in need of a shake-up.The initial thought in the Pelicans front office was simply to find a proven talent to complement Davis, who had made the playoffs only once in his first five seasons.Its really hard to get elite players, General Manager Dell Demps said.We had the opportunity to get elite players.Thats where it started.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cousins said he could have resisted the trade, but chose not to because he had never had an opportunity to play with a talent like Davis.He was willing to explore the partnership because a few other teams have enjoyed recent playoff success while playing two big men.San Antonio often pairs Pau Gasol with LaMarcus Aldridge.Memphiss Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph powered a long run of postseason appearances before splitting up this season.For that reason, Cousins is hesitant to call his pairing with Davis an experiment.Instead, he said he believed they were remixing an old tune.Demps pursued the pairing because he felt Cousins and Davis were versatile and multitalented enough to be a functional foundation.Theyre not typical bigs, Demps said.Theyre both really skilled.They can shoot, they can pass, they can handle the ball, they can make plays for other people.Now, the key is to make it all mesh.Cousins and Davis did not attend Kentucky at the same time.Their college coach, John Calipari, has developed a long list of modern big men centers and power forwards who can make plays, step out away from the basket to create space and even shoot 3s.We teach our bigs to start like guards and finish like bigs, Calipari said in a phone interview.I hate to give away trade secrets, but thats my mentality with my big guys.I dont want you to play like youre a big guy.You start like youre a guard.I want you to attack the basket, but I want you to finish like youre a big go dunk on somebody.I want you to rebound and block like youre a big guy.Cousins and Davis spent the summer working out together in Los Angeles and Las Vegas with their teammates Rajon Rondo another former Kentucky player who also played with Cousins in Sacramento and Jrue Holiday.In their workouts, it became clear that the double big man lineup would be successful only if supported by talented guards.Rondo, a starting guard, is sidelined for a month after hernia surgery, leaving New Orleans in desperate need of another playmaker and perimeter shooter.During my interview with Gentry in his office, he took a call from the veteran guard Jameer Nelson, who became a free agent last week when he was released by Denver.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I play guys that I think will help us win, Gentry said, pitching Nelson on coming to New Orleans.You could really help because youre a shotmaker, too.We could use someone that has confidence in their shot.Obviously, if we do well, a lot of the credit will go to the guys we added to this team.Gentrys pitch worked.Nelson signed with the Pelicans after clearing waivers and will now be asked to help address the Pelicans need for long-distance shooters who can help balance the floor.In his first game, New Orleans defeated the Los Angeles Lakers for its first regular-season win.It might take some time to get all the parts moving together, Gentry said, but when we do I think we are going to be very efficient and we can be a different kind of N.B.A.team.After spending six-plus losing seasons in Sacramento, Cousins has bought into his new coachs vision.Its going to work, Cousins said, peering over the top of his sunglasses.Im confident about that.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 2, Inning by Inning:::::Bottom 6th: Seager goes deep on Verlander.Justin Verlander needed just four pitches to retire Chase Utley and pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a pair of fly-outs to center to start the inning, but that is when the trouble started.He walked Chris Taylor his second walk of the game, both of which were drawn by Taylor and got ahead, 0-2, on Corey Seager, but a 97 mile-per-hour fastball was right down the middle and Seager wasted no time hitting it out of the park to give his team the lead.Justin Turner popped out to end the inning, but the mighty Dodgers bullpen now has a lead to work with, which could be a big problem for Houston.Waldstein: Did that seem like a familiar script?A two-out walk to Chris Taylor and then a two-run homer to left by the next batter?In Game 1 it was Justin Turner with the smash.In Game 2 it was Corey Seager, who went opposite field with a pitch that Verlander left up in the zone.And Seager knew it was gone or at least had a good chance right away because he was screaming as the ball left the bat.All of the Dodgers runs so far in the series have come on four home runs.Now L.A. is 12 outs away from taking a 2-0 lead in the series by beating the Astros two best pitchers, and the Dodgers have a favorable pitching matchup in Game 3.Top 7th: Dodgers bullpen stays strong.Ross Stripling was the fourth Dodgers pitcher of the game and he lasted just four pitches, each of which was a ball.The walk to the struggling Marwin Gonzalez resulted in yet another pitching change, with Brandon Morrow coming in to face Josh Reddick, and the right-hander came through in a big way by getting Reddick to ground into a double play.He allowed a single to Evan Gattis, who was pinch-hitting for Justin Verlander, but finished off the inning by inducing a grounder to short from George Springer.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Verlander now out of the game, his final line was six innings, two hits and three earned runs.He struck out five and walked two.Bottom 7th: Harris Keeps it close for Astros.With Will Harris on in relief for Houston, Cody Bellinger led off the inning and reached on a throwing error.He advanced to second on a curveball in the dirt that was ruled a wild pitch and went to third on a groundout by Yasiel Puig.But with the infield in to try to prevent a run, Joc Pederson struck out on five pitches.The infield returned to their normal positioning with two outs and Harris struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning.Photo Top 8th: Astros cut into Dodgers lead.Dave Roberts continued to be aggressive with pitching changes, but for the first time in the series he did not quite have the magic touch as the Astros narrowed the Dodgers lead to 3-2.After Alex Bregman led off the inning with a ground-rule double off Brandon Morrow, Roberts turned to his closer, Kenley Jansen, hoping for a six-out save.Jansen was able to get a groundout from Jose Altuve, but Bregman advanced to third on that play and then scored on a single by Carlos Correa.Jansen recovered to get a pop-out from Yulieski Gurriel and then ended the inning by striking out Brian McCann.Unless the Dodgers can extend the lead in the bottom of the 8th, Jansen will have just one run to work with in the ninth.Waldstein: The Astros finally break through against the Dodgers bullpen, which had not surrendered a run in 28 consecutive innings in the postseason.Jansen, who is being asked to get a 6-out save, was 41 for 42 in save opportunities in the regular season.He had one five-out save this year and earned a win in a two-inning performance in extra innings.He has a five-out save and a four-out save this postseason.Bottom 8th: Dodgers riding Jansen for six-out save.It was a quick inning for the Dodgers offense.Chase Utley flew out to left, pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor flew out to left to end the inning.The Dodgers are three outs away from a 2-0 lead in the series with their dominant closer, Kenley Jansen, trying to finish a six-out save.Photo Top 9th: Gonzalez breaks out of slump to tie game.Kenley Jansen only had one six-out save in his career coming into todays game, and he will leave with only one after he allowed a game-tying solo homer to Marwin Gonzalez to start the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the home run, Jansen got a quick out from Josh Reddick, who popped out to second, and retired pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center, but he allowed a two-out double to George Springer.With the go-ahead run on base, Jansen was able to stop the bleeding by retiring Alex Bregman on a grounder to short.With the Dodgers already having used five relievers, including their three best, they could run into manpower issues if this tie game stretches on for a while.Waldstein: It was only Jansens second blown save of the year.His first was July 23 in Atlanta when he gave up a game-tying, three-run home run to Matt Adams.But the Dodgers came back to win that game, 5-4, and are 98-0 when leading after 8 innings this year, including the postseason.Bottom 9th: Bellingers blast ends at warning track.Houston turned to their closer in the ninth and Ken Giles started things off by striking out Corey Seager.He retired Justin Turner on a grounder to short and narrowly escaped a walk-off home run when Cody Bellingers deep blast to right was caught at the warning track by Josh Reddick.This game is headed to extra innings.Photo Photo Top 10th: Back-to-back homers give Astros a lead.Houston badly needed its best hitters to start delivering, and Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa did that in a big way by starting the 10th inning with back-to-back home runs to give the Astros a 5-3 lead.The Dodgers ran out of top-shelf relievers, thanks to the aggressiveness of Dave Roberts in trying to protect a narrow lead earlier in the game, so Josh Fields came in for the 10th.Robertss aggressiveness had paid off throughout the postseason, but it backfired in Game 2, with Fields giving up the two home runs, and a double to Yulieski Gurriel, before being replaced by Tony Cingrani.Cingrani made quick work of the Astros, allowing just an intentional walk.Houston is now three outs away from victory.Waldstein: That was Altuves sixth postseason home run.Not too shabby.And Carlos Correa follows it up with another blast, the third by the Astros in the last two innings.Correa with an epic bat flip, too.This game, and the series, has pivoted in a hurry, and Dodger Stadium is very quiet.Photo Bottom 10th: Dodgers storm back to tie game.The Astros went ahead 5-3 in the top of the 10th, and sent their closer, Ken Giles, out for a second inning in hopes of finishing off the victory.The Dodgers had other plans.Yasiel Puig led off the inning with a home run, and after Giles struck out two batters, Los Angeles tied things up on a walk to Logan Forsythe and a single by Kike Hernandez.Chris Devenski relieved Giles, and with the winning run at second base, he got Chris Taylor to fly out to center to end the inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: I have been at some great World Series games, and this one now joins the list.Leads have been erased, home runs all over the place, blown saves, classic bat flips, and to top it all off, the second base umpire, Laz Diaz, gets hit in the upper leg with a pickoff attempt.Had it not hit him, Kike Hernandez certainly would have been on third base, and that might have changed how Dvensky would have pitched to Taylor.When Forsythe slid home for the tying run, the upper decks of Dodger Stadium were swaying slightly.I remember that from Shea Stadium in 1999 and 2000.A bit unsettling.Photo Top 11th: Springer goes deep to put Astros on top.Brandon McCarthy was not on the N.L.C.S.roster for the Dodgers, but he was added as an extra arm for the World Series.Because the team was officially out of relievers, he was on the mound to try to keep Los Angeles in the game in the 11th.Cameron Maybin led off the inning with a single and stole second before George Springer, who had been ice-cold coming into the game, hit a monster blast to right-center that once again put the Astros on top.McCarthy ended the damage there, getting three quick outs, but the Dodgers now have three outs to stay alive in what has become a wild game.Bottom 11th: One more home run, but not enough for Dodgers.Chris Devenski was back out for a second inning of work and he started things off by getting Corey Seager to line out to center.That brought up Justin Turner, and the postseason hero for the Dodgers hit a liner that looked like it might sneak through the infield before Alex Bregman ranged to his left and was able to snare it for the second out.That brought up Charlie Culberson, and the last man on the Dodgers bench hit a two-out solo homer to center to narrow Houstons lead to one run, but that was as close as Los Angeles would get, as Yasiel Puig struck out to end the game.
With a Crowd of Diverse Faces, Dodger Stadium Stands Out:::::Latino attendance can be seen in other ballparks, including Minute Maid Park in Houston, but the scene at Dodger Stadium seems to stand apart.Photo The diversity is fantastic, said Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers longtime Spanish-language radio announcer.When I first started in this job, the Latinos coming to the ballpark were about 8 to 10 percent.Now, he said, he believes the figure to be around 45 percent.It is the most of any park, he added.Oh, by far.But we have also seen many Japanese people and Korean people here, too.Jarrin, who is originally from Ecuador, has been broadcasting Dodgers games since 1959.He said he has seen a steady uptick in fans at Dodger Stadium who come from various backgrounds.Assumptions about someones ethnic identity can prove false, and much of the available evidence about the diversity at Dodger Stadium is anecdotal.Stan Kasten, the Dodgers president, said he had no statistical data regarding the ethnic composition of the fans at Dodger Stadium.Still, he said the team cherished that its fan base was noticeably diverse.We are very proud of it, Kasten said.This is the organization of Jackie Robinson.The Dodgers were at the forefront, not only of breaking the color barrier, but we historically scoured the globe to find players.The Dodgers were the first to build an academy in the Dominican Republic.Were a global team, and that is something thats reflected in the stadium, too.When the Dodgers brought Robinson to the major leagues in 1947, he became the first African-American to break through baseballs wall of segregation, and many African-American fans were drawn to the team.In 1980, the Dodgers introduced Valenzuela, a charismatic left-handed pitcher from Navojoa, Mexico, who energized fans on both sides of the border with his unorthodox windup and stellar pitching.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Valenzuela, who now does commentary on Dodgers games alongside Jarrin, left the Dodgers after the 1990 season.But the legacy of Fernandomania is still felt today.Photo People who were into soccer and boxing, they became big baseball fans because of Fernando, Jarrin said.Many of them still love the Dodgers.And more players would come along and attract fans from various communities to Dodger Stadium.In 1994, the right-handed pitcher Chan Ho Park became the first player from South Korea to join the major leagues, and he tapped into the large Korean-American community in the Los Angeles area.The next year, the remnants of Fernandomania gave way to Nomomania, named for Hideo Nomo, the whirlwind Japanese pitcher who became such an instant sensation that fans from Japan would fly to Los Angeles for a weekend just to see him pitch.The Dodgers currently have two Japanese players on their playoff roster, the pitchers Kenta Maeda and Yu Darvish.There are also two players from Cuba (Yasiel Puig and Yasmani Grandal); one from Puerto Rico (Enrique Hernandez); and a pitcher, Hyun-jin Ryu, from Incheon, South Korea.When Ryu was pitching this summer, I was sitting with like 20 Korean fans, said the 55-year-old Varela, who works for a health care firm in Los Angeles.We were all together and we had so much fun.In recent years, the team has acquired popular Mexican-American players like Nomar Garciaparra, who delighted many fans by walking to his at-bats to the song Low Rider, by War, and Adrian Gonzalez, who is on the team but not on the playoff roster.There is also building excitement for Julio Urias, a 21-year-old left-handed pitcher from Culiacn, Mexico, who is injured.Photo When fans arrive at Dodger Stadium they are greeted by signs written in English and Spanish.Along the top of the visitors dugout the word Welcome is painted in English, Japanese, Spanish and Korean, and some fans wear blue shirts that read, Doyers, an affectionate reference to the way first-generation immigrants in Los Angeles sometimes pronounced the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Dodgers early relationship with Angelenos of Mexican descent was fraught with animosity and distrust after some residents of Chavez Ravine, where Dodger Stadium now sits, were forcibly evicted first to make room for a public-housing development that was never built and then, in 1958, for the stadium.Some of those evictions were captured on television news programs.But over time, that episode was mostly forgiven as fans jumped aboard the Dodgers wagon.For many Mexican-Americans, it was another example of how they were uprooted and pushed around, said Eric Avila, a professor of history at U.C.L.A.and the chairman of the Csar E. Chvez Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.The Dodgers got off to a really bad start in Southern California.But in the end, people just loved baseball, and they eventually adopted the Dodgers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Avila called Valenzuelas electrifying rookie season in 1981 a tipping point.From that point forward, the Dodgers actually became an expression of Mexican-American identity in Southern California.The Mexican-American community went nuts for Fernando, he said.They claimed him and the Dodgers as their own.The Dodgers are also still popular among a segment of African-American supporters, especially older fans who were initially drawn to the team that Robinson played for.But as with the rest of baseball, the Dodgers have struggled to attract a substantial number of African-American fans to games.Curtis Granderson, a Dodgers outfielder who is African-American and has also played in Detroit and New York, said he noticed the fan diversity at Dodgers games to a certain extent.I know theres a heavy Hispanic population and a white population here, Granderson said.I havent noticed a heavy black population.That doesnt mean it doesnt exist.But those two have definitely stood out the most to me.It is definitely a diverse group, and it should be.This is the second-largest city in the U.S., and you hope everyone is supporting the Dodgers.Photo Despite the early resentment created by the evictions at Chavez Ravine, Walter OMalley, who owned the Dodgers, made sure to broadcast games on Spanish radio to spread the gospel of the team among the local Spanish-speaking population, and the broadcasts helped create more Latino fans.One of them was Juan Arrieta, who grew up in the Los Angeles area listening to Jarrin describe Dodgers games in Spanish because Arrietas father, a mechanic from Peru, did not understand English well at the time.It was only recently that Arrieta discovered that Jarrin is actually from Ecuador, just north of Peru.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I always just assumed he was Mexican, Arrieta said, acknowledging how people can mislabel others.Isnt that awful?Now a 45-year-old bartender living in San Diego, Arrieta and his wife, Diane, who is of Mexican descent, attend a handful of Dodgers games each year, and were sitting in the bleachers at Game 2 of the National League Championship Series.I think the big difference nowadays is that you see people spread around the stadium, Arrieta said about Dodger Stadiums diversity.It used to be that we would sit in the upper deck or out in the pavilion.Now its not segregated like that anymore.And its not just Latino.When Maeda or Ryu pitch, you see a lot of Asian fans at the game, too.Its a real melting pot.After Game 1 of the World Series ended and happy Dodgers fans were congregating in the parking lot waiting to leave, Varela came upon an older white man who said he was originally from Brooklyn and had been a Dodgers fan since then.He was sharing stories with a younger Mexican-American fan from Los Angeles, and the two men snapped photos of themselves together.It doesnt matter what color you are or where you come from or what religion you are, she said.What matters is we all love baseball, and that unites us.
Guatemalan Soccer Executive Gets 8 Months in FIFA Corruption Case:::::Judge Chen expressed little regard for the fact that Mr. Trujillos crimes were not considered crimes in his own country, noting that he had used the United States banking system and routed bribe money through a construction company in Seattle while also creating a sham construction contract, seeking to evade prosecutors even after the American case was announced in 2015.Still, in imposing a sentence that was less than a quarter of the recommended minimum, Judge Chen showed Mr. Trujillo, 64, leniency.As mitigating factors, she cited his age; his training as a lawyer, which she called a double-edged sword, suggesting he had been mindful of his lawbreaking; and the time he spent in three different United States jails in late 2015, when he was held in a high-security facility and at one point placed in solitary confinement.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That month spent in jail will be applied to his eight-month sentence, the judge said, making it an effective seven months Mr. Trujillo will spend in prison before he is ultimately deported back to Guatemala.The details of his restitution payment were not completed Wednesday, as the Guatemalan federation to receive the money has itself been suspended by FIFA.Prosecutors suggested that the money be held by a law firm for Concacaf soccers governing body for North and Central America and the Caribbean until Guatemalas federation is restored to good standing and can collect it.Its been more than 23 months of suffering and pain for my family and myself, Mr. Trujillo said tearfully on Wednesday, his wife, children, cousins and brother looking on.I am not the kind of person the government thinks I am.Mr. Trujillos punishment is likely to be closely interpreted by the more than 20 other defendants awaiting resolution in their own cases.A handful of others await trial, scheduled to begin next month, while others remain abroad and out of reach of the United States.Mr. Trujillos own arrest took place in Florida in 2015 the year American prosecutors announced their investigation into FIFA along with a series of initial convictions dating to 2013.It was only after the Disney cruise ship he had been on with his family docked that federal agents arrested him.I accepted this position because I loved soccer, he said Wednesday.Its now soccer that sees itself tainted, and its very painful for me to see Ive contributed to that taint.
Is Bridge a Sport? E.U. Court Says No:::::Bad news, bridge fans.The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that the card game is not a sport, even when played by multiple competing teams.Like many disappointments, this one traces its roots to a dispute on taxes.The courts decision came in response to a case filed by the English Bridge Union, based in Aylesbury, which organizes team-based bridge matches.The organization had argued that it should not have to charge tax on entry fees to its tournaments because bridge is a card-based mind sport.Entry fees for many sports competitions are exempt from value-added tax, or VAT, in Britain.But the British tax authority said bridge did not qualify because it did not involve much physical exertion.The European Court heard the bridge unions arguments against the tax authority, Her Majestys Revenue and Customs, in Luxembourg in March, the group said.On Thursday, the court sided with the tax authorities and said in a statement that bridge was not a sport because it was characterized by a physical element that appears to be negligible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The bridge union promotes a form known as duplicate bridge, which minimizes the role of chance by having teams score points based on how well each plays the same hands.The court agreed that this involves logic, memory and planning and may constitute an activity beneficial to the mental and physical health of regular participants.
How Did a Tiny Swiss Company Quietly Secure Valuable World Cup TV Rights?:::::In much of the Americas, soccer is followed with religious-like devotion, making Mountrigis 16-nation contract extremely lucrative.Yet until the global corruption inquiries, many people working in the industry had little knowledge of the tiny company that appears to have struck gold with FIFA.United States law enforcement officials helped reveal that Mountrigi is a wholly owned subsidiary of a giant Mexican television network, Grupo Televisa.Mountrigi paid about $190 million for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, Dunne said.The contracts for the 2026 and 2030 tournaments probably cost more, but much less than they would be worth today.Since the agreement, FIFAs new leadership has announced that the World Cup will be expanded to 48 teams from 32 in 2026 and that the tournament will most likely be staged jointly in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Most of FIFAs top management was removed in the aftermath of the corruption scandal, the biggest crisis since FIFAs creation 113 years ago.Current officials of the organization, which is based in Zurich, have declined to make public the details of the arrangement with Mountrigi.Mountrigi and Televisa both declined to comment.Mountrigi was supported in its dealings with FIFA by Alejandro Burzaco, an Argentine businessman, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Burzaco last year pleaded guilty to bribing soccer officials so that the company he ran would be awarded rights to the biggest regional tournaments.The company, Torneos y Competencias, also pleaded guilty, and agreed to pay $112.8 million to settle the case.Photo In court papers related to Torneoss guilty plea, prosecutors said an affiliate of a major broadcasting company headquartered in Latin America had helped to pay millions in bribes to get the rights in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay for the next four World Cups.Mountrigi, the Televisa affiliate, was awarded those rights and immediately sold them to Burzaco.Burzaco had over the years funneled millions of dollars in bribes to Julio Grondona, who was responsible for FIFAs finance committee and was one of its most powerful leaders until his death in 2014.Televisa said last year that neither its employees nor those of Mountrigi had ever paid any bribes nor any kickback to FIFA officials related to the acquisition of rights.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The rights in question are also under scrutiny in Switzerland, where a statement from the attorney generals office said an unnamed businessman had bribed FIFAs former secretary general Jrme Valcke in return for the award of media rights for certain countries at the FIFA World Cups in 2018, 2022, 2026 and 2030.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mountrigis rights, and those it sold to Torneos, are the only ones that match those described in the Swiss complaint.Niclas Ericson, the FIFA executive responsible for its television division at the time, did not respond to a request for comment.Burzacos lawyer, Sean Casey, declined to comment when asked if his client was the unnamed businessman accused in Switzerland.The Swiss attorney generals office said it could not comment.The Swiss also accused the Qatari businessman Nasser al-Khelaifi, who is the Paris St.-Germain soccer clubs chairman, of bribing Valcke in return for a separate package of rights to the 2026 and 2030 World Cups.Khelaifi, who denies the allegations, met with prosecutors on Wednesday.The United States has charged more than 40 individuals and businesses with a range of corruption-related crimes, and it has also brought to light details of sports rights deals that had traditionally been secured behind the scenes with little outside scrutiny.Since a powerful group of Brazilian and Argentine businessmen was exposed, some of the worlds largest sports rights companies, including WME-IMG and Lagardre Sports and Entertainment, have been able to enter a market that had been closed to them for decades.Beyond the rights it sold to Torneos as part of the agreement with Burzaco, Mountrigi has not signed deals in any of the other territories it has for the 2026 and 2030 events.That means the company can reap greater than planned profits from the expanded World Cup and a possible United States-led tournament in 2026.For FIFA, which is reliant on the quadrennial World Cup for more than 90 percent of its income of more than $5 billion, the deal might bring regret.Theyve expanded the World Cup and have got no chance of tapping into incremental value in all of the areas where that value is likely to have a large increase, Dunne said.
The Yankees Had a Steady Winner in Girardi. Now They Want More.:::::It is clear, though, that the Yankees viewed this moment as something of a pivot point.After coming so close to the World Series, they now expect to get there, and win, within the term of the next managers contract.Girardi took this group to the edge of a title, and now his successor they hope will haul it over the top.For all the niceties in the five-sentence statement from General Manager Brian Cashman announcing the move he praised Girardis work ethic and heart, and wished him well he gave no explanation for the move.Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, the statement said, leaving open the question of what Cashman considered to be lacking in Girardi.After a decade of working with him, Cashman knew precisely what he had in Girardi.He is said not to have held Girardis tactical blunder in the division series against him (Girardi failed to ask for a video review that could have prevented a Cleveland Indians grand slam), but he knows what kind of team he has built, and he decided not to have Girardi lead it.Photo To Cashman, Girardis style might not mesh well with a team of players in their 20s.The veterans Girardi managed for most of his tenure, essentially, were fully formed major leaguers before they played for him.A younger group may respond better to a manager who projects less tension and more outward calm.In the A.L.C.S., the Yankees got a close look at a manager who does that, one with renowned communication skills: A. J. Hinch of the Astros, who recovered from three losses at Yankee Stadium to take the final two games in Houston.Hinchs Astros also eliminated the Yankees in the 2015 A.L.wild card game, the Yankees only other playoff appearance in the last five years.He just believes in every single one of us, and he shows you that, Alex Bregman, the Astros 23-year-old third baseman, said on Thursday.He shows that he has confidence in everybody on our roster.Hes a motivator and a guy that you want to play for a guy that you want to run through a wall for.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Girardi speaks often of believing in his guys.But he showed no faith in Dellin Betances, a four-time All-Star reliever, when he yanked him after he had faced two batters in his final appearance of the regular season with a four-run lead in the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Betances had seemed to be turning around an inconsistent season, but after that outing he became a playoff afterthought.Twice Girardi pulled him after two batters in the postseason when the Yankees held a big lead, and by the fateful Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.after burning Chad Green for two and a third innings in Game 6 Girardi was left with limited options.Of course, the Yankees did not score in Game 7, so their pitching options made little difference.And bullpen management, in general, has always seemed to be a strength of Girardis, along with his meticulous preparation.Yet over Girardis tenure, managers increasingly became extensions of the front office, and the Yankees, with their increasing emphasis on analytics, were no different.If Girardi and Cashman were still in lock step on overall philosophy, game management or both their partnership would most likely still be intact.Instead, Cashman severed it, as the Washington Nationals did with Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox with John Farrell, both after having made the playoffs two years in a row.In one of his final acts on the job, Girardi made a point to seek out Hinch in the home clubhouse in Houston after Game 7 to congratulate him and wish him well.Hes a real class act, Hinch said on Thursday, adding later, I dont think anyone goes through what Joe goes through in New York.Girardi went through it all as a winner 10 seasons, 10 winning records and a somewhat puzzling departure.Fans once wondered how anyone could adequately replace Joe Torre, who won four championships.Now we could ask the same question about replacing Girardi, who won just one title but kept a stable, successful atmosphere for a decade.
Martina Hingis Is Retiring From Tennis (Again):::::Photo SINGAPORE Martina Hingis announced Thursday that she will retire from tennis at the end of this weeks WTA Finals, where she is playing in the doubles tournament with Chan Yung-Jan.Looking back now, its hard to believe that almost exactly 23 years ago I made my professional debut, Hingis, 37, said on her Facebook page.The years that followed have been some of the most rewarding years of my life, both personally and professionally, but I believe the time has come for me to retire, which I will be doing after my last match here in Singapore.The retirement will be Hingiss third in a long and illustrious career during which she claimed 25 Grand Slam titles five in singles, seven in mixed doubles and 13 in womens doubles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hingis first decided to end her career as a 22-year-old in 2003 because of persistent injuries after picking up all five of her major singles titles as a teenager.She won three Australian Opens, one Wimbledon and one United States Open from 1997 to 1999.
Fantasy Football: Who to Start in N.F.L. Week 8:::::Carson Wentz (PHI vs. 49ers) Few have ever doubted Wentzs potential, but even fewer expected him to be among the best fantasy quarterbacks so far this season.He has 11 passing touchdowns over his last three games, and only four interceptions on the season.His 21.7 F.P.P.G.is fourth best for his position, and this week he takes on the 49ers, who have yielded 24.0 F.P.P.G.to quarterbacks over the last five weeks and the second most total on the season.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also consider: Andy Dalton (CIN vs. Colts) Running Back LeGarrette Blount (PHI vs. 49ers) It has not always been pretty for Blount this season, particularly last week, when it took him 14 carries to earn 29 rushing yards.But he has been a borderline RB2/Flex option when you look at his entire season, averaging 8.3 F.P.P.G., good for 25th among running backs.He should be a very solid RB2 this week against the 49ers, who are even worse against opposing running backs than they are against quarterbacks.Eight backs have topped 10 fantasy points against them in seven games, and theyve given up a shocking 26.4 F.P.P.G.to the position this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Melvin Gordon (LAC at Patriots) He has looked like the RB1 that fantasy owners drafted him as for most of this season: His total of 14.9 F.P.P.G.is sixth best among running backs.He had only two poor performances, including last weeks against the Broncos (4.4 fantasy points).He should get back on track in a big way against the Patriots, who have not only allowed the fourth most rushing yards, but also the second most receiving yards, to running backs, and 20.4 F.P.P.G.to the position.Also consider: Jay Ajayi (MIA vs.Jets) Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin (CAR at Buccaneers) After a rocky start, Benjamin has been the eighth best fantasy receiver over the last four weeks (9.7 F.P.P.G.), even with last weeks rough game against the Bears (three catches for 65 yards).The Buccaneers offer an excellent opportunity for Benjamin to right the ship, as six receivers have topped 10 fantasy points in their six games played.Over all, their 28.4 F.P.P.G.yielded to the receiver position is the second most.If youre still not convinced, Benjamin will line up opposite to cornerback Robert McClain, who is the lowest rated player of the teams entire starting defense, according to ProFootballFocus.com.Demaryius Thomas (DEN at Chiefs) If any player is due to score a touchdown this week, it is Thomas, who has gone 12 consecutive games without one, dating to last season.But he is still averaging 8.4 targets per game this season, and his teammate Emmanuel Sanders might miss a second game in a row with an ankle injury.The Chiefs, despite the presence of the star cornerback Marcus Peters, have allowed the most fantasy points to the position in 2017 (30.4 F.P.P.G.)Also consider: Keenan Allen (LAC at Patriots); Nelson Agholor (PHI vs. 49ers) Tight End Jason Witten (DAL vs. Redskins) With six teams on a bye this week, Witten makes for an excellent streaming option against the Redskins, who have allowed a touchdown to the position in three of the last four games and the second most F.P.P.G.(11.7) over all.Witten has quietly been one of the better fantasy tight ends this season, with his 7.4 F.P.P.G.the eighth best so far this season.Also consider: Kyle Rudolph (MIN at Browns) Defense/Special Teams MIN at Browns; NO vs. Bears Kicker Jake Elliott (PHI vs. 49ers); Steven Hauschka (BUF vs. OAK).
Astros Even World Series With Dodgers in a Home Run Derby:::::Because no lead was safe on Wednesday, many fans were undoubtedly holding their breath in the bottom of the 11th.It was merited: Charlie Culberson hit a solo home run off Astros reliever Chris Devenski, trimming Houstons lead to one run.Photo But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else, Springer said.When the last out is made you finally breathe.Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2.Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesdays game without fraying some nerves.Two teams that competed for 27 outs, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said.An emotional roller coaster.The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece.They will return to action on Friday, with Houstons Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles it was 93 degrees at first pitch should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable.Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.Photo Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying, said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason.Doesnt seem like the case the last couple of nights.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregmans single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on.But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later.Seager, last years National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away.Facing the Dodgers stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puigs glove as he dived for the ball.Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.Photo This time was different.The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.Ill take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning, Roberts said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers.Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series.But he drilled a 94 m.p.h.cutter, Jansens trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.It was just flat, Jansen said.Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez.He didnt miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason.Altuve brought chants of M.V.P.when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.Photo Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot.The Astros dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.I loved it, said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations.He threw it higher than I normally do, and thats the way you should play in the World Series.Puig replaced the Astros euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th.Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch.Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddicks throw to home plate.As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski.And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez.It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate.Instead, it was a dead ball.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him, Hinch said with a smirk after the game.This all set the stage for a delirious 11th inning.McCarthy had not pitched since Oct. 1, and was making his postseason debut.He coughed up a single to Astros outfielder Cameron Maybin.Up came Springer, who struck out four times in Game 1 but was determined to slow his heart rate down in this moment.He did, slamming a ball to right-center field for a two-run lead, and the Astros held on to win a game for the ages.

N.F.L. Picks: Steelers Over Lions; Cowboys Over Redskins:::::Detroits defense is not nearly as crisp as Pittsburghs, but it can be just as opportunistic.If Roethlisberger is at all careless with his passes, Detroit will make him pay for it.Golden Tates being limited, or possibly inactive, with a sprained AC joint takes some jolt out of the Lions offense, but this should be a close game.Pick: Steelers 49ers at Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Eagles by 13 The 49ers (0-7) are very bad.The Eagles (6-1) are very good.It is not hard to predict that Philadelphia will take care of business at home against a winless opponent, but a spread of 13 points is demanding a blowout, and San Franciscos plucky young defense may be up to the task of preventing that from happening.As good as the Eagles have been, they have kept things close in four of their six wins, and they have little reason to try to run up the score against an overmatched opponent.Pick: 49ers Texans at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., CBS Line: Seahawks by 5.5 Thanks to the emergence of Deshaun Watson, the Texans (3-3) have averaged 39.3 points a game over the last four weeks.The hype has been deafening, but in reality, he has yet to face a very challenging defense.That ends this week, as the Seahawks (4-2) are the type of team that has the combination of talent and veteran know-how to truly mess with a rookie quarterbacks mind.A victory might be too much to ask for, but Watson is talented enough to keep things close, making a 5.5-point spread a bit too generous.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Redskins, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Cowboys by 2 This game could be Ezekiel Elliotts last one for quite some time, as he has a court hearing on Monday that could determine the fate of his six-game suspension.Elliott seemed to be buckling under the weight of the looming punishment at the start of the season, but he has looked like his old self in the last two weeks, and it is no coincidence that the Cowboys (3-3) have righted the ship along the way.At a glance, the Redskins (3-3) seem to have a good run defense, but they have allowed so few yards because teams have chosen not to run against them, which wont be the case with Dallas in town.Pick: Cowboys Second-Tier Matchups Photo Bears at Saints, 1 p.m. Fox Line: Saints by 9 Relying on your teams defense to do all the scoring is not a sustainable strategy in the N.F.L., but that is what has been working for the Bears (3-4) in the Mitchell Trubisky era.The rookie quarterback has done almost nothing notable, averaging 116 passing yards per game, but has a 2-1 record despite having thrown just two touchdown passes in a three-game stretch in which his teams defense scored three.The Saints (4-2) are a tough team to play defense against, especially at home, but if Chicagos surge on that side of the ball has not been a mirage, it should be able to beat a 9-point spread.Pick: Bears Raiders at Bills, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bills by 2.5 There is nothing like crushing a well-regarded division rival to lift the spirits of a flailing team, and the Raiders (3-4) did just that with a come-from-behind win against Kansas City.Derek Carr returned to his 2016 form just in time to lead a game-winning drive.Unfortunately for Carr, the Bills (4-2) have a habit of making opponents miserable, and they can likely gut out an ugly win.With Marshawn Lynch suspended, Oakland will have a hard time controlling the clock.Pick: Bills Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Chargers at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Patriots by 7 This game will serve as an indication of whether the Patriots (5-2) fixed their problems in the secondary last week, or if Atlanta simply was not good enough to take advantage of New Englands biggest weakness.Philip Rivers does not have the same confidence problems that the Falcons have been dealing with, so he will probably challenge New England early and often.If this game were in Los Angeles, the Chargers (3-4) would stand a better chance, but the Patriots are incredibly tough to beat at home.Pick: Patriots Panthers at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Buccaneers by 2.5 Cam Newton has had two brutal games in a row.He has completed just 57 percent of his passes, and his five interceptions matched his total from the first five games combined.But watching the Panthers (4-3), it is easy to feel sorry for Newton as he is brutalized on play after play.Even the successful plays many of which have come with Newton running rather than passing end with big hits.The big quarterback rarely has extended stretches of ineffectiveness, and an important division game against the equally-struggling Buccaneers (2-4) should bring out the best in him.Pick: Panthers Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom-Tier Games Photo Dolphins at Ravens, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL Network Line: Ravens by 3 Cameron Wake, a defensive end for the Dolphins (4-2), managed to sum up Thursday Night Football in one convenient quotation.He told reporters this week: To be very honest, nobody is going to be ready the way they like to be.Theyll be as ready as you can be on Thursday night.With Matt Moore expected to start for the injured Jay Cutler, Miamis offense will run through the teams running back, Jay Ajayi, and that spells trouble for the Ravens (3-4), as they are ranked last in rushing yards allowed per game.Pick: Dolphins Vikings vs. Browns at London, 9:30 a.m., NFL Network Line: Vikings by 9.5 The Browns (0-7) will play their first game without tackle Joe Thomas since 2006, so Spencer Drango, a second-year player out of Baylor, will be protecting DeShone Kizers blind side against a Minnesota defense that is tied for sixth in sacks, with 21.It is understandable for the Vikings (5-2) to be road favorites in the neutral site of Londons Twickenham Stadium, but a spread of nearly 10 points is a lot to ask for from an underwhelming Minnesota offense.Pick: Browns Falcons at Jets, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 5 The Jets (3-4) followed a three-game winning streak with consecutive losses, but they played well in both games and lost them by a combined 10 points.They go into every game with a talent deficit, but Coach Todd Bowles has had them focused and prepared each week.There is no reason the Falcons (3-3) shouldnt mop the floor with them based on personnel, but the same thing was true in their recent losses to Miami and Buffalo.Unless the team has figured out what has been holding its offense back, this game could be close.Pick: Jets Colts at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bengals by 10.5 Jacoby Brissett endured a beating last week that few other quarterbacks have.He was sacked or hit on 31 of his teams 67 plays, and the Colts (2-5) spent the week arguing about whether it was appropriate for T. Y. Hilton, a wide receiver, to blame his teams offensive line for the blowout loss.The Bengals (2-4) do not have the players to replicate Jacksonvilles savagery, but they will try.A point spread of 10.5 points is enormous, but the Colts have lost by more than that in three of the last five weeks, with the other two games being wins against the two worst teams in the N.F.L.Pick: Bengals Mondays Matchup Broncos at Chiefs, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Chiefs by 7 The Broncos (3-3) scored 42 points in Week 2, and in the four games since, they have also scored 42 points combined.The Chiefs (5-2) are a division rival that not only has more talent than Denver, and home-field advantage, but also the motivation of having lost two close games in a row after a 5-0 start.Denvers defense can probably limit Alex Smith and the Chiefs to a few touchdowns and a bunch of field goals, but that should be plenty to outscore Trevor Siemian and the Denver offense.Pick: Chiefs.

Week 8:::::Carson Wentz (PHI vs. 49ers) Few have ever doubted Wentzs potential, but even fewer expected him to be among the best fantasy quarterbacks so far this season.He has 11 passing touchdowns over his last three games, and only four interceptions on the season.His 21.7 F.P.P.G.is fourth best for his position, and this week he takes on the 49ers, who have yielded 24.0 F.P.P.G.to quarterbacks over the last five weeks and the second most total on the season.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also consider: Andy Dalton (CIN vs. Colts) Running Back LeGarrette Blount (PHI vs. 49ers) It has not always been pretty for Blount this season, particularly last week, when it took him 14 carries to earn 29 rushing yards.But he has been a borderline RB2/Flex option when you look at his entire season, averaging 8.3 F.P.P.G., good for 25th among running backs.He should be a very solid RB2 this week against the 49ers, who are even worse against opposing running backs than they are against quarterbacks.Eight backs have topped 10 fantasy points against them in seven games, and theyve given up a shocking 26.4 F.P.P.G.to the position this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Melvin Gordon (LAC at Patriots) He has looked like the RB1 that fantasy owners drafted him as for most of this season: His total of 14.9 F.P.P.G.is sixth best among running backs.He had only two poor performances, including last weeks against the Broncos (4.4 fantasy points).He should get back on track in a big way against the Patriots, who have not only allowed the fourth most rushing yards, but also the second most receiving yards, to running backs, and 20.4 F.P.P.G.to the position.Also consider: Jay Ajayi (MIA vs.Jets) Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin (CAR at Buccaneers) After a rocky start, Benjamin has been the eighth best fantasy receiver over the last four weeks (9.7 F.P.P.G.), even with last weeks rough game against the Bears (three catches for 65 yards).The Buccaneers offer an excellent opportunity for Benjamin to right the ship, as six receivers have topped 10 fantasy points in their six games played.Over all, their 28.4 F.P.P.G.yielded to the receiver position is the second most.If youre still not convinced, Benjamin will line up opposite to cornerback Robert McClain, who is the lowest rated player of the teams entire starting defense, according to ProFootballFocus.com.Demaryius Thomas (DEN at Chiefs) If any player is due to score a touchdown this week, it is Thomas, who has gone 12 consecutive games without one, dating to last season.But he is still averaging 8.4 targets per game this season, and his teammate Emmanuel Sanders might miss a second game in a row with an ankle injury.The Chiefs, despite the presence of the star cornerback Marcus Peters, have allowed the most fantasy points to the position in 2017 (30.4 F.P.P.G.)Also consider: Keenan Allen (LAC at Patriots); Nelson Agholor (PHI vs. 49ers) Tight End Jason Witten (DAL vs. Redskins) With six teams on a bye this week, Witten makes for an excellent streaming option against the Redskins, who have allowed a touchdown to the position in three of the last four games and the second most F.P.P.G.(11.7) over all.Witten has quietly been one of the better fantasy tight ends this season, with his 7.4 F.P.P.G.the eighth best so far this season.Also consider: Kyle Rudolph (MIN at Browns) Defense/Special Teams MIN at Browns; NO vs. Bears Kicker Jake Elliott (PHI vs. 49ers); Steven Hauschka (BUF vs. OAK).
Chris Borland Blasts N.F.L. for Hiding C.T.E. Risks:::::Photo Chris Borland shocked the sports world when he left the N.F.L.after his rookie season, saying the long-term health risks of playing football were not worth it.Now, Borland is going further, appearing in a public service announcement that denounces the N.F.L.for hiding the risks of catastrophic brain damage.In the announcement, Borland discusses his decision to leave the N.F.L., and how the league spent years trying to play down and discredit research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease known as C.T.E.that is linked to repeated head trauma.In the one-minute spot, which is now online and will be shown on various television channels, Borland said that the leagues efforts to suppress the risks of the disease is especially sad when you think about the fact that there are 5-year-old kids out there playing tackle football.Advertisement Continue reading the main story N.F.L.Commissioner Roger Goodell has said repeatedly that dozens of rules changes have made the game of football safer than ever before.The league has also committed to spending tens of millions of dollars to develop safer equipment and to pay for research into the effects of playing the game.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The N.F.L.did not immediately return a call for comment.Borland, who played one standout season as a linebacker with the San Francisco 49ers before abruptly leaving the league, is working with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an activist group of independent scientists who cite the N.F.L.in its Disinformation Playbook, a new website exposing the ways that some companies and trade associations sideline science.According to the group, the N.F.L.attacked the facts about concussions and C.T.E.similar to the ways the tobacco industry, fossil fuel companies and the makers of sugary sodas try to obscure health consequences of their products.
Two Teams, One Anthem: An N.F.L. Showdown:::::In fact, the vast majority of N.F.L.players chose the Cowboys way when it came to the anthem on Sunday, suggesting enthusiasm for mixing football and politics is waning.Eleven owners met with players and officials from the league and the players union last week to find a graceful way out of the impasse.Notably absent was Jones.He holds close two statistics: How many players are protesting and what the demonstrations are doing to the bottom line.Through Week 6, the N.F.L.is down slightly in TV ratings, though that can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the continuing decline of cable television subscribers.Last month, after President Trump called for any son of a bitch who knelt during the anthem to be fired, several owners stood with their teams for the anthem.None was as calculating as Jones.He linked arms with his team and knelt, then all rose before the anthem played.No matter.Jones said that the team office was inundated with calls, emails and letters objecting to the gesture.Photo Jones may have been in an ebullient mood after the game Sunday, giving atta-boys to his players for the rout that brought the Cowboys to 3-3.He was expansive on the three-touchdown performance of running back Ezekiel Elliott, who won a temporary injunction to hold off his six-game suspension by the N.F.L.for his role in a domestic-violence case.Still, the anthem controversy was on his mind.There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from this protest, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump on Monday tried to keep the fires burning, sending out a tweet that said, Two dozen N.F.L.players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.No leadership in NFL!What he overlooks is that over the past year, N.F.L.players have sustained a national dialogue about social justice that often only briefly pops up after police shootings or society-rending riots.Whether you like it or not, the N.F.L is among the most watched pieces of entertainment on the planet, with a massive platform.Many players have used it to provide poignant moments.The Seahawks Michael Bennett brought a military wife to tears of understanding as he exchanged views with veterans outside the gates of the teams practice complex.His teammate Doug Baldwin Jr. joined N.F.L.Commissioner Roger Goodell in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman in support of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2017.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Steelers Alejandro Villanueva, a West Point graduate with a Bronze Star for valor as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, memorably stood by himself with his hand over his heart during the anthem as his team waited off field.He then movingly explained why he could not turn his back on the flag and apologized to his teammates for botching the teams plans and making them look bad.None of it has done much good for Kaepernick or the team that he once took to the Super Bowl.Last week, he filed a complaint against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league.He is an activist now and has more than likely kissed away whatever slim chance he had to play in the N.F.L again.On Sunday, there were plenty of empty seats here and about half the filled ones were inhabited by fans wearing the blue and white of the Cowboys.Levis Stadium hasnt been a popular home for the 49ers since opening in 2014.Fans complain that the tickets are too expensive and the commute is too far from San Francisco.Still, it was a jarring sight on an afternoon that San Francisco legend Joe Montana and more than 30 members of the 49ers Super Bowl winning teams were here at halftime to honor another icon, Dwight Clark, who is battling the neurological disease A.L.S.It was Montana and Clark who teamed up for The Catch in 1982, one of the most famous plays in N.F.L history, a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone in the final minute to beat the Cowboys and advance to the Super Bowl.Those glory days seem like ancient history.In the locker room after the game, Kaepernick and social awareness meant little to a winless and beaten up team.C. J. Beathard, the rookie quarterback who was sacked five times, summed up the 49ers season like a 10-year veteran.Sure, it was a massacre, but hardly a last stand.Yeah, we are 0-7.Theres only one way to go, and thats up, he told reporters.And weve got a lot of season left ahead of us to get better, turn the season around and make something out of it.
Throw 7 Passes. Complete 4. Win Game.:::::Photo The Chicago Bears beat the Panthers on Sunday, 17-3, and they did it with an unconventional game plan.The rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubiskys final line was eyebrow-raising: 7 passes attempted, 4 completed.It was the fewest passes attempted in a winning effort in the N.F.L.since 2006, when the Panthers Chris Weinke also was 4 for 7, in a 10-3 win over the Falcons.It was the fewest completions in a win since 2011, when Tim Tebow was completed 2 of 8 passes in a 17-10 Broncos win over the Chiefs.What do all three games have in common?The head coach of the winning team was John Fox.Fox is not totally averse to the forward pass: He also coached Peyton Manning for three years in Denver.But there have been many not-quite-ready quarterbacks thrust into starting roles over the years, and only Fox steered them away from passing to such an extreme.And successfully.In Weinkes first game filling in for an injured Jake Delhomme in 2006, Fox let him throw 61 passes.In his next start he threw 28.After those games, both losses, Fox dialed all the way back for the seven-pass game.It resulted in Weinkes second career win, and first in five years.Delhomme returned the next week, and Weinke never won another game in the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tebow, who replaced the Denver starter Kyle Orton in 2011, was never a prolific passer, averaging 24 passes a start that season.But he never had a game quite like that 2-for-8 effort.It worked though, and was the second game in a six-game winning streak that helped the Broncos into the playoffs
The Seahawks Are a Little Dysfunctional. Theyre O.K. With That.:::::For much of the first half Sunday, Seattles offense was inept and bungling.And, of course, that led to a scuffle on the sideline.What would a Seahawks football game be without at least a little chaos on the bench?With Seahawks down by 4 points in the second quarter, a meeting of players from the sputtering offensive unit became heated, with receiver Doug Baldwin shoving the teams offensive line coach, Tom Cable, who had been addressing the players.Baldwin was shouting in the direction of his teammates not so much Cable and Pete Carroll, the head coach, came over in the middle of the episode, although no one appeared unnerved by the incident.Cable continued to talk to the players and Baldwin remained near his side.Apparently, the Seahawks are simply used to such displays.Doug is always fired up, Seattle wide receiver Paul Richardson said with a smile.He might have had an outburst but he went out and made plays.It was all to get us going, and it worked.Indeed, Baldwin caught a 22-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter that gave the Seahawks a lead they never relinquished.And Richardson was in the middle of a critical fourth-quarter sequence, wrestling for possession of the ball with the Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins after a pass into the Giants end zone.Collins and Richardson had something akin to simultaneous possession, which the game officials ruled to be a Seattle touchdown.The score and extra point put the Seahawks ahead by 17-7, which, given the current state of the Giants offense, amounted to an insurmountable lead.Photo The Giants gained just 177 yards Sunday and converted on only 2 of 12 third-down opportunities.A Seahawks turnover led to the Giants only touchdown.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Seattle receivers also dropped three passes, and quarterback Russell Wilson overthrew multiple targets on plays that could have resulted in touchdowns.The Seahawks also committed a staggering 15 penalties.It is failures like these that have many wondering, justifiably, what is wrong with the Seahawks.Yes, they have had some bad luck with injuries.But are they truly a championship contender if they struggled, even briefly, to overwhelm the immensely hobbled and downtrodden Giants?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.And is the sideline strife, however benign it might ultimately have been, a good thing?Seattle defensive lineman Michael Bennett conceded his team might confuse some fans.I dont know how to grade us right now, myself, Bennett said.But I dont have to.We take it week to week and we just won one more this week.Not surprisingly, Sherman is not worried.He saw a defense especially a deep, talented secondary that toyed with the Giants inexperienced wide receiving corps.Early in the game, Giants quarterback Eli Manning heaved a long, mighty pass toward Tavarres King, who was streaking down the right sideline.The football, spinning in a perfect, tight spiral, appeared destined for a touchdown, and King stretched out his arms within a few steps of the end zone.And then, in a flash, Sherman caught up with the descending football and flicked it away with one hand.Shermans play was almost a dismissive act, knocking down a deft pass inches from Kings hands.Just letting Eli know Im here, Sherman said.I was just saying that we werent going to let anything be caught deep.Not today.The Giants very rarely threw in Shermans direction again.Everybody should know the Seahawks are O.K., Sherman said.Of Baldwins eruption in the bench area, Sherman said it hardly raised an eyebrow on the team.To the outside world, its misunderstood, Sherman said.But we all look at the coaches as peers.Were in this together.Dougs not yelling at him, hes trying to be encouraging and trying to motivate everyone.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sherman grinned.It gave a spark, he said.Its all good.
Justin Timberlake Will Perform in Super Bowl Halftime Show:::::Photo The N.F.L.will revisit its most controversial Super Bowl halftime show by having Justin Timberlake, the singer who participated in the infamous wardrobe malfunction of 2004, perform during Super Bowl LII.Timberlake, a Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, became famous with the boy band N Sync before going on to solo success with hits like SexyBack, Cry Me a River and Rock Your Body.While he has largely transitioned to acting, Timberlake recently had another hit with Cant Stop the Feeling on the soundtrack for the animated movie Trolls.He also voiced the character Branch in the movie.Before his acting turn, Timberlake was part of the halftime shows for Super Bowls XXXV, in 2001, and XXXVIII, in 2004.At the performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII, which was held in Houston, he was on stage with Janet Jackson, and at the end of the performance he tore away part of Jacksons top.The incident, which was later described as a wardrobe malfunction, led to numerous complaints and a hefty fine by the F.C.C.The fine was eventually vacated by an appeals court.During an interview televised during NBCs Sunday Night Football broadcast, Mike Tirico asked Timberlake about whether the N.F.L.had addressed the incident with him.Timberlake smiled and said That wont happen this time.Timberlake continues the N.F.L.s trend toward courting a younger audience rather than going with older, safer performers.Other recent performers have included Lady Gaga, Beyonc, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry.
Jets Go From Rolling to Rolled in One Quarter Against Dolphins:::::Coach trusted me and the offense with that, McCown said, and we let him down.It was the second straight comeback victory for Miami (4-2), which overcame a 17-point deficit in the second half to beat Atlanta last week.The Dolphins have won 12 games in a row when the margin is seven or fewer points.The N.F.L.record for such a streak is 14 consecutive games.It sounds like a broken record, said defensive end Cameron Wake, who had two and a half sacks for the Dolphins, as they avenged a 20-6 loss to the Jets last month.Its a belief in one another.Weve been showing that over and over and over.Cutler left the game because of a chest injury with his team trailing 21-14 in the third quarter.After the Jets took a 28-14 lead on a 10-yard pass from McCown to Austin Seferian-Jenkins late in the period, Moore threw a pair of scoring passes to Kenny Stills to tie the game.That was fun, man, said Moore, who saw his first action of the season.Its always fun to get a win, and then when you can contribute and have a comeback like that, its fun for everybody.Against a defense that had not allowed more than 20 points in a game all season, McCown also threw for touchdowns of 29 yards to Kearse and 17 yards to Robby Anderson.Advertisement Continue reading the main story McCowns rushing touchdown came after an interception by Muhammad Wilkerson, the Jets 315-pound defensive lineman.With the Dolphins backed up at their 7-yard line during the second quarter, Wilkerson caught a pass that had been deflected by a blitzing Jamal Adams, and was tackled at the 1.McCown scored two plays later, giving the Jets a 21-14 halftime lead.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But the Jets were shut out over the final 16 minutes 41 seconds, and McCowns interception with 47 seconds left proved costly.I dont want to think about it.It makes me sick, McCown said.To come out on the road and get going like we did and then finish it like that is frustrating.There were signs of a Jets meltdown at the end of the game.Anderson, who scored his touchdown in the first quarter, appeared to angrily spike his helmet in the closing seconds, and Wilkerson was heard shouting from the Jets closed-door locker room after the game.A lot of frustration.You heard it, McCown said.There are a lot of emotions, and frustration is high on that list.The head of that frustration was, Lets rebound, and Mo did a good job of hammering that home.Cutler had thrown for two touchdowns before going to the locker room after being hit by Jets linebacker Jordan Jenkins in the third quarter.Some Miami fans cheered as Moore entered the game to replace Cutler, who drew boos during his Dolphins home debut two weeks ago.Moores fifth pass was intercepted by Marcus Maye, whose 33-yard return set up the score by Seferian-Jenkins, the third week in a row that the tight end has reached the end zone.Moore finished 13 for 21 for 188 yards and the two scores.Regrouping will be a challenge after the Jets lost a heartbreaker for the second week in a row.Last week, a disputed call contributed to a 24-17 loss to New England.The Jets will host Atlanta next Sunday.We have to develop a killer instinct, Bowles said.We had a 14-point lead; weve got to close the game out.
Heres What Happened in N.F.L. Week 7:::::Elliott takes advantage of delayed suspension as Cowboys smash 49ers.A temporary restraining order brought Ezekiel Elliott back to the Dallas Cowboys this week, and he took full advantage of his suspension being delayed yet again by scoring three touchdowns as the Cowboys demolished the San Francisco 49ers, 40-10.Elliott, who received a six-game suspension before the season as a result of a lengthy investigation into domestic violence allegations, has yet to miss a game, as the courts have repeatedly delayed the suspension.He won the latest legal round when a federal judge agreed to halt the suspension until Elliott can get a hearing before a presiding judge.His status for the rest of the year could be decided in the next two weeks.On Sunday, Elliott was again the centerpiece of the Cowboys offense, racking up 219 yards from scrimmage, running for two touchdowns and getting a third on a 72-yard catch-and run.Dak Prescott was nearly as good, completing 16 of 25 passes for 234 yards and three touchdowns.His first touchdown was a nifty one-handed grab by Jason Witten.His second was the 72-yarder to Elliott.His third moved Dez Bryant into a tie with Bob Hayes for the franchise record in receiving touchdowns.It was Prescotts third consecutive game with three or more touchdown passes and his numbers would likely have been higher if he was not taken out in the fourth quarter with the Cowboys up by 30 points.Photo Steelers Big Three are too much for the Bengals.The Cincinnati Bengals did their best to keep up with their division rivals, but the Pittsburgh Steelers pulled away in the second half of a 29-14 victory, which improved the teams record to 5-2.A week after their offense finally seemed to get right, the Steelers Big Three were at it once again.Ben Roethlisberger threw for 224 yards and two touchdowns, LeVeon Bell had 192 yards from scrimmage, and Antonio Brown had 65 receiving yards and a touchdown, with the stars leading an effort that produced 420 total yards.For fun, the Steelers added in a 44-yard pass from Robert Golden to Darrius Heyward-Bey on a fake punt in the fourth quarter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Steelers, who have sometimes struggled to maintain balance on offense, are now 16-0 all-time in regular season games in which Bell runs the ball more than 23 times.Andy Dalton had two passing touchdowns in the first half, but the Steelers made adjustments at halftime, and intercepted him twice in the second half while shutting out the Bengals in the games final 37 minutes.Dalton had just 34 passing yards in the second half.Anthem protests continue in Week 7.Days after the N.F.L.declined to change its rule on the national anthem, about two dozen players protested around the league.About two dozen players around the league protested during the anthems before the early games.Some players knelt, others sat, stayed in the tunnel or raised a fist.On Sept. 25, a day after President Trump said players should be fired for protesting during the anthem, more than 200 protested in a show of solidarity.This week, the Seahawks and 49ers led the way.Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett and seven Seahawks teammates did not stand before their game with the New York Giants.And in San Francisco, about a half-dozen 49ers knelt led by Eric Reid, Marquise Goodwin, rookie linebacker Reuben Foster, Eli Harold, Adrian Colbert and Kwaun Williams.All the Dallas Cowboys stood.David Irving, a defensive lineman for the Cowboys, had vowed to demonstrate during the national anthem despite Jerry Jones having said he would bench any player that knelt during the song.Irving walked back his comments on Saturday, and then offered a mild protest, raising his fist as the song was about to end.Seahawks start slow, then stifle Giants.Russell Wilson threw three second-half touchdown passes, and the Seattle Seahawks limited the Giants receiver-depleted offense to 177 yards in a 24-7 victory on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.The Giants had lost their first five games before stunning the Broncos last Sunday night in Denver.Wilson hit Doug Baldwin with a go-ahead 22-yard touchdown pass midway through the third quarter.Wilson added a 38-yard touchdown throw to Paul Richardson on a play that was reviewed because of simultaneous possession, and he put the game away with a 1-yard pass to Jimmy Graham with 2 minutes 14 seconds to go.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Seahawks (4-2) limited the Giants (1-6)

Press Advertisement Continue reading the main story Read Bill Penningtons Seahawks-Giants game report here.Cowboys turn to safety Jeff Heath for kicking duties.The Dallas Cowboys have continued to roll in the second half, adding two more touchdowns, including a 72-yard catch-and-run by Ezekiel Elliott his third touchdown of the game.But with the teams place-kicker, Dan Bailey, sidelined by a groin injury, they have had to rely on Jeff Heath, a safety, for extra-point attempts.Heath barely made his first attempt, with the ball sailing toward the right upright before going in, but he badly missed his second attempt, which came after a 2-yard touchdown run by Dak Prescott.The Cowboys are up 33-3 at the start of the fourth quarter.Broncos struggles continue against Chargers.The Denver Broncos lost to the undermanned Giants last week, and this week they were blanked by the Los Angeles Chargers, 21-0.Once again, Denvers offense has failed to make a dent, while the teams defense was unable to stop Philip Rivers and the Chargers passing attack.The defense was also forced to watch as the teams punting unit allowed a 65-yard return touchdown to Travis Benjamin.Photo Rams shut down Carson Palmer and Adrian Peterson.Last weeks turn-back-the-clock performances from Carson Palmer and Adrian Peterson are distant memories.Palmer was ineffective and broke his left arm, Peterson ran for just 21 yards and the Arizona Cardinals were crushed 33-0 by the Los Angeles Rams.The Cardinals were outclassed in virtually every aspect of the game, with the Rams gaining 425 yards to Arizonas 193, and 28 first downs to Arizonas 10.For the Rams, everything seemed to click.Todd Gurley ran for 106 yards and a touchdown, Jared Goff was fairly efficient, and Greg Zuerlein chipped in with four field goals and three extra points.Arizona came into the game with high hopes after piling up 38 points last week in a win over Tampa Bay.Palmer threw three touchdown passes in that game, and Peterson ran for 134 yards and two touchdowns.But this week, with the team having traveled to London to play in Twickenham Stadium, the Cardinals age caught up on them.Palmer had 122 passing yards and one interception before leaving with his non-throwing arm broken.Peterson got just 11 carries, but did nothing with them, as his longest run went for six yards.Photo Drew Brees is too much for short-handed Packers.Drew Brees threw his 500th career passing touchdown, and the New Orleans Saints fought back in the second half to beat the Green Bay Packers, 26-17.Forced to start a game without Brett Favre or Aaron Rodgers for just the eighth time in the last 25 years, the Packers got a decent first half from Brett Hundley, but as the game wore on the Saints chipped away, going ahead to stay when Wil Lutz hit a 44-yard field goal with 10:26 left in the fourth quarter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brees then put the game out of reach late in the fourth quarter by diving over a pile at the goal line for a 1-yard touchdown run.Hundley, who completed 12 of 25 passes for 87 yards and one interception did provide some excitement with a 22-yard touchdown run that involved him colliding with defenders at the goal line.But he was not able to consistently move the ball when his team needed conversions.Brees, whose 22-yard touchdown to Brandon Coleman was the 476th regular season score of his career (he has 24 playoff touchdowns) threw for 331 yards, becoming the first quarterback in N.F.L.history to surpass 300 yards against one opponent in seven consecutive meetings.The loss for Green Bay at home dropped the team to 4-3 and negated another strong performance by Aaron Jones, the rookie running back, who appears to have supplanted Ty Montgomery as the teams starter.Jones had 17 carries for 131 yards and got the first score of the game on a 46-yard touchdown.Photo Bears ride defense in victory over Cam Newtons Panthers.The Chicago Bears only got 153 yards from the teams offense, but a pair of defensive touchdowns by Eddie Jackson provided all of the scoring the team needed in a 17-3 victory over the Carolina Panthers.Jackson returned a fumbled pitch from Cam Newton to Curtis Samuel for a 75-yard score on Carolinas opening drive, and then early in the second quarter, he intercepted Newton and wove through the defense on his way to a 76-yard score.Mitchell Trubisky is now 2-1 as a starting quarterback, though he has his teams defense, running game and special teams to thank for it as he has yet to have more than 128 passing yards in a start.He did provide one highlight with a 70-yard pass to Tarik Cohen.Browns drop to 0-7 and lose ironman Joe Thomas.The Cleveland Browns dropped to 0-7 with a 12-9 overtime loss to the Tennessee Titans.Another loss seemed secondary when, for the first time in his 11-year N.F.L.career, Joe Thomas, the superstar left tackle for the Cleveland Browns, missed a snap because of injury.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thomas, who received a great deal of publicity earlier this season when he played in his 10,000th consecutive snap, injured his triceps at the end of his 10,363rd career snap and came out of the game after receiving medical attention on the field.After the game, Thomas said he still needed to get an M.R.I.and that it was too soon to tell if he would miss the remainder of the season.Trying to remain upbeat, Thomas told reporters It wasnt going to be an infinity streak.The No.3 pick in the 2007 draft, Thomas was playing in his 167th career game, all for the Browns.Long considered one of the best players at his position, the 10-time Pro Bowler has never played in a playoff game, and is incredibly unlikely to break that streak considering his teams winless start to the season.The Browns kept things close for much of the game, but DeShone Kizer threw two interceptions, both to Kevin Byard, and once again was benched, this time for Cody Kessler.In a game with no touchdowns, the Titans were just a tad better.The Browns official Twitter account seemed to have run out of optimism after the game.Jaguars, minus Fournette, roll over the Colts.It was an oddly-numbered week, so the Jacksonville Jaguars were dominant.The team has alternated wins and losses all season, and in a 27-0 win over the Indianapolis Colts they won easily on both sides of the ball.The Jaguars found out shortly before gametime that Leonard Fournette, the teams standout rookie running back, was not available because of an ankle injury sustained last week.But even without Fournette, who has scored a touchdown in each game of his N.F.L.career, the Jaguars managed 518 yards of offense against the lowly Colts.Blake Bortles threw for 330 yards and T.J. Yeldon ran for 122, but Jacksonvilles fearsome defense was even more dominant, with an incredible 10 sacks and 20 quarterback hits.
Marshawn Lynch Is Suspended for a Game After Shoving an Official:::::Photo Oakland running back Marshawn Lynch was suspended for one game without pay by the N.F.L.on Friday for shoving a game official during the Raiders victory over Kansas City on Thursday night.Lynch, who has the option of appealing the suspension, was ejected from the game after he shoved the line judge Julian Mapp.The scuffle started when Oakland quarterback Derek Carr was hit late on a run by Kansas Citys Marcus Peters midway through the second quarter.Raiders offensive linemen Kelechi Osemele and Donald Penn immediately confronted Peters, and Lynch sprinted onto the field from the bench to join the fray.Mapp tried to break up the fight, but Lynch pushed him and grabbed his jersey.Lynch also got a personal foul.Jon Runyan, the leagues vice president of football operations, wrote a letter to Lynch, saying: You made deliberate physical contact with one of our game officials as he was diffusing an active confrontation between players.You were disqualified for your inappropriate and unsportsmanlike actions.Your conduct included pushing the game official and grabbing his jersey.... You were not directly involved in the active confrontation that the game official was attempting to diffuse, nor were you a participant in the play that initiated the confrontation.You were the only player from either team who ran from the sideline to midfield to insert himself into a situation in which he was not directly involved.Lynch finished the game with two carries for 9 yards.The Raiders rallied to win, 31-30, on a touchdown pass by Carr on the final play, and Lynch was in the locker room after the game congratulating his teammates.Lynch came out of retirement this season and was traded from Seattle to the Raiders.Lynch said he wanted to make a comeback so he could give something back to Oakland, his hometown, before the Raiders moved to Las Vegas in 2020.
The Yankees Had a Steady Winner in Girardi. Now They Want More.:::::It is clear, though, that the Yankees viewed this moment as something of a pivot point.After coming so close to the World Series, they now expect to get there, and win, within the term of the next managers contract.Girardi took this group to the edge of a title, and now his successor they hope will haul it over the top.For all the niceties in the five-sentence statement from General Manager Brian Cashman announcing the move he praised Girardis work ethic and heart, and wished him well he gave no explanation for the move.Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, the statement said, leaving open the question of what Cashman considered to be lacking in Girardi.After a decade of working with him, Cashman knew precisely what he had in Girardi.He is said not to have held Girardis tactical blunder in the division series against him (Girardi failed to ask for a video review that could have prevented a Cleveland Indians grand slam), but he knows what kind of team he has built, and he decided not to have Girardi lead it.Photo To Cashman, Girardis style might not mesh well with a team of players in their 20s.The veterans Girardi managed for most of his tenure, essentially, were fully formed major leaguers before they played for him.A younger group may respond better to a manager who projects less tension and more outward calm.In the A.L.C.S., the Yankees got a close look at a manager who does that, one with renowned communication skills: A. J. Hinch of the Astros, who recovered from three losses at Yankee Stadium to take the final two games in Houston.Hinchs Astros also eliminated the Yankees in the 2015 A.L.wild card game, the Yankees only other playoff appearance in the last five years.He just believes in every single one of us, and he shows you that, Alex Bregman, the Astros 23-year-old third baseman, said on Thursday.He shows that he has confidence in everybody on our roster.Hes a motivator and a guy that you want to play for a guy that you want to run through a wall for.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Girardi speaks often of believing in his guys.But he showed no faith in Dellin Betances, a four-time All-Star reliever, when he yanked him after he had faced two batters in his final appearance of the regular season with a four-run lead in the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Betances had seemed to be turning around an inconsistent season, but after that outing he became a playoff afterthought.Twice Girardi pulled him after two batters in the postseason when the Yankees held a big lead, and by the fateful Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.after burning Chad Green for two and a third innings in Game 6 Girardi was left with limited options.Of course, the Yankees did not score in Game 7, so their pitching options made little difference.And bullpen management, in general, has always seemed to be a strength of Girardis, along with his meticulous preparation.Yet over Girardis tenure, managers increasingly became extensions of the front office, and the Yankees, with their increasing emphasis on analytics, were no different.If Girardi and Cashman were still in lock step on overall philosophy, game management or both their partnership would most likely still be intact.Instead, Cashman severed it, as the Washington Nationals did with Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox with John Farrell, both after having made the playoffs two years in a row.In one of his final acts on the job, Girardi made a point to seek out Hinch in the home clubhouse in Houston after Game 7 to congratulate him and wish him well.Hes a real class act, Hinch said on Thursday, adding later, I dont think anyone goes through what Joe goes through in New York.Girardi went through it all as a winner 10 seasons, 10 winning records and a somewhat puzzling departure.Fans once wondered how anyone could adequately replace Joe Torre, who won four championships.Now we could ask the same question about replacing Girardi, who won just one title but kept a stable, successful atmosphere for a decade.
After a Decade, Joe Girardi Is Out as Manager of the Yankees:::::It will now be up to Cashman to find a new manager, although Cashman himself still has to sign a new contract with the club.The most likely internal candidate is Joe Espada, who worked as a special assistant to Cashman for one season before becoming the Yankees third-base coach in 2015.Espada, who is 42, has a strong relationship with several of the young, Spanish-speaking Yankee players.Cashman was developing a list of candidates on Thursday, according to the baseball executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.And that list will almost certainly include candidates from outside the Yankees organization as Cashman tries to figure out who is best suited to managing a young team brimming with talent while dealing with the media scrutiny that the Yankees attract.The decision to part with Girardi comes after a postseason run that was both exhilarating and painfully disappointing for the Yankees, ending with a loss in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.Two other managers the Washington Nationals Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox John Farrell lost their jobs this month after their teams were ousted from the postseason.Girardi now becomes the third.In his decade in the Bronx, Girardi compiled a 910-710 record and was the third-longest-tenured active manager in the major leagues before he was let go, behind the Los Angeles Angels Mike Scioscia and the San Francisco Giants Bruce Bochy.Photo In recent years, he was able to get aging Yankee teams to at least stay in the hunt for a postseason berth.And then came the 2017 campaign, in which Girardi found himself presiding over a younger and, at times, dynamic roster that began to exceed just about everyones expectations as the season progressed.It was a club that chased the Red Sox to the penultimate day of the regular season for the division title before ending up with a wild-card berth.And it was a club that then embarked on a postseason run that did not end until last weekend.Girardis unyielding manner be it his rigorous preparation or his sometimes-contentious back and forth with the news media was reflected in that run, in which the Yankees twice rallied from two-games-to-none deficits in postseason series only to ultimately fall short.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it was during the postseason run that Girardi also came under fierce criticism for his managing.It grew out of the Yankees Game 2 loss in the division series against the Cleveland Indians, a game in which Girardi declined to ask for a replay review of a hit-by-pitch call a decision that opened the door for an Indians comeback.Girardi, who made a rare admission the next day I screwed up, he said repeatedly at a news conference was afforded a reprieve when the Yankees rallied to win the next three games to advance to the A.L.C.S.against the Houston Astros.Still, the withering criticism that was directed at him after the Game 2 blunder seemed to affect him deeply and, for the first time, raised the notion that his decade in the Bronx had worn on him.And Saturday night, after the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros, Girardi had an almost fatalistic tone as he discussed his baseball future.Ive had 10 great years here, he said.I feel extremely blessed.God has been good to me, and well see what the future holds.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That same night, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi and did not single him out for praise.I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go, to be the last team standing, and we fell short, Cashman said.Though Cashman and Girardi have divergent personalities and far different interests, they had generally enjoyed a strong working relationship.I think he knows that he can speak his mind in a constructive way with me, and I can speak my mind in a constructive way with him, Cashman said at the start of the 2016 season.Theres an openness that is encouraged here.I acquire the talent, and Joe deploys the talent, and sometimes youll have disagreements on players capabilities that Ive acquired or strategies that hes employing.Photo Youve got to be able to work through those in a healthy manner to have a successful manager-general-manager relationship, and Im proud to say we have that, Cashman added.But at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, Girardi may have had some difficulties on that front.He became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchezs inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, a rarity for Girardi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And in the wake of Girardis botched replay decision, closer Aroldis Chapman liked a social media post that urged the Yankees not to bring Girardi back.Chapman later said he had done it inadvertently.Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to replace Torre, as manager, had a rocky first season in 2008, when the Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time since the strike-aborted season of 1994.But the Yankees made an immediate turnaround and won the 2009 World Series the 27th in franchise history in a new stadium.That championship also meant a change of uniform for Girardi.He switched to No.28 from No.27 because he wanted a visible reminder of the number of championships the Yankees had accumulated, along with the inference that another one would surely come soon enough.But it did not.In an interview before the start of the 2017 season, Hal Steinbrenner largely absolved Girardi for the disappointments the Yankees had encountered, including a failure to make the playoffs in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi?, Steinbrenner said.Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadnt made the playoffs in two to three years?Had he lost control of the team?Did the players no longer respect him?Is it a serious situation in that regard?And the answer to that in my opinion was no.There have been plenty of owners that have fired managers left and right and still arent winning, Steinbrenner added.So how well does that work?Girardi, who has three children, has long touted the importance of family.He skipped a game this season in Tampa to attend the high school graduation of his oldest daughter, and he made it comfortable for players and coaches to leave the team for significant events in their lives.And Girardi said last week that he would meet with his family after the season to gauge how they felt about him returning.Im not living my kids lives; Im not living my wifes life, he said.Im living, in a sense, my life, so I dont know what changes for them.Now, however, much has changed for Girardi.He is no longer the Yankees manager.
After Barrage of Home Runs in the World Series, Juicy Theories as to Why:::::That was basically the story of Game 2, when the Astros and the Dodgers combined for five home runs in extra innings something that had never been done in major league history, even in the regular season.Major leaguers combined for a record 6,105 homers in 2017, and the postseason has been no different.The very first batter, Minnesotas Brian Dozier, went deep to start the first wild-card game.In their National League Championship Series loss to the Dodgers, the Chicago Cubs scored eight runs on homers, and no runs any other way.Of the 17 runs scored in this World Series, 14 have come on homers.Everybodys swinging for the fences, said a weary Ken Giles, the Astros closer, who served up Yasiel Puigs 10th-inning blast in Game 2.Home runs this series have been the big play so far.We need to figure out a way to prevent it.On Friday, the series shifts to Minute Maid Park, where the Astros are 6-0 this postseason.Jose Altuve began the Astros playoff run with three homers there in the division series opener.The Dodgers also got a three-homer game in the playoffs, by Enrique Hernandez in the N.L.C.S.clincher.Teams generally must slug to win.The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the playoffs this season; the Astros were first, at .478, and the Dodgers were tied for seventh with the Cubs, at .437.If this World Series becomes one big home run derby, the Astros like their chances.If it comes down to a slugfest, my moneys on us, third baseman Alex Bregman said.We bang.Were the best-hitting team in baseball.Well step in that box ready to go every time.Its fun to be a part of an offense like this.Bregman homered off Clayton Kershaw in Game 1, the only blemish across Kershaws seven dazzling innings.It was typical of the way opponents have tried to handle Kershaw this month: With little chance of bunching hits together, they simply try to swing big.Photo The strategy is failing; while Kershaw has allowed all eight of his runs on homers this postseason, he is 3-0 with a 2.96 earned run average.He is scheduled to face Keuchel in Game 5 on Sunday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for Keuchels assertion widely shared by other pitchers around the league that the balls have been altered, Commissioner Rob Manfred has consistently denied it.He reiterated that stance before the American League wild-card game this month.Were using two different labs that have been looking at the ball on a continuous basis all year, Manfred said.Balls are within specs; theres been no movement even within the range of the specifications in terms of the baseball.Ive said before I think theres other issues causing the home runs other than the baseball principally, the way the games being played, the tolerance for strikeouts, power pitching, guys changing their swing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Manfred added that fans like home runs, a point that is hard to argue.Excitement surged through Dodger Stadium with each home run on Wednesday night, and the hitters reacted memorably: The Dodgers Joc Pederson joyously gestured to the crowd; Carlos Correa gleefully flipped his bat toward the Astros dugout; Puig gently placed his bat on the dirt; Charlie Culberson cavorted as if he were Joe Carter.Guys have been superaggressive, trying to get a fastball or attack a first pitch thats what Ive been seeing, said the Astros Chris Devenski, who gave up Culbersons two-out homer in the 11th but struck out Puig with a changeup to end it.Its baseball.It goes in streaks; it goes in spurts at times.The last time the World Series came to Southern California, in 2002, home runs were also the big story.The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 in Anaheim, 11-10, with the teams combining for six home runs, out of a record 21 for the Series.Players openly guessed that the ball was juiced then, too.Al Levine, a nonroster pitcher for the Angels, actually took a Ginsu knife and sliced open a World Series ball and a regular-season ball in the clubhouse during that game.He concluded that the World Series ball was wound tighter.When I cut them open, one was easier, definitely, Levine said then.The World Series ball was a lot tougher to get through.Troy Percival, the Angels closer who had given up a towering homer to Barry Bonds, put it this way: Its like throwing a smooth rock.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Predictably, baseball denied any shenanigans.By then, though, the owners and the players had agreed to implement steroid testing the next season.The program has gradually gotten tougher since then, including a provision that players suspended during the regular season cannot take part in the postseason.We have been fooled before, of course, but this generation of players seems to want a clean game.A widespread, coordinated cheating epidemic that consistently beats baseballs testing program seems a little hard to fathom.In any case, this World Series has so far reflected the game in 2017: dinger after dinger after dinger, breaking records and turning most players into awe-struck fans.I dont know what to tell you, man, Correa said.It was so much fun.
Astros Even World Series With Dodgers in a Home Run Derby:::::Because no lead was safe on Wednesday, many fans were undoubtedly holding their breath in the bottom of the 11th.It was merited: Charlie Culberson hit a solo home run off Astros reliever Chris Devenski, trimming Houstons lead to one run.Photo But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else, Springer said.When the last out is made you finally breathe.Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2.Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesdays game without fraying some nerves.Two teams that competed for 27 outs, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said.An emotional roller coaster.The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece.They will return to action on Friday, with Houstons Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles it was 93 degrees at first pitch should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable.Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.Photo Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying, said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason.Doesnt seem like the case the last couple of nights.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregmans single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on.But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later.Seager, last years National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away.Facing the Dodgers stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puigs glove as he dived for the ball.Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.Photo This time was different.The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.Ill take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning, Roberts said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers.Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series.But he drilled a 94 m.p.h.cutter, Jansens trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.It was just flat, Jansen said.Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez.He didnt miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason.Altuve brought chants of M.V.P.when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.Photo Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot.The Astros dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.I loved it, said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations.He threw it higher than I normally do, and thats the way you should play in the World Series.Puig replaced the Astros euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th.Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch.Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddicks throw to home plate.As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski.And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez.It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate.Instead, it was a dead ball.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him, Hinch said with a smirk after the game.This all set the stage for a delirious 11th inning.McCarthy had not pitched since Oct. 1, and was making his postseason debut.He coughed up a single to Astros outfielder Cameron Maybin.Up came Springer, who struck out four times in Game 1 but was determined to slow his heart rate down in this moment.He did, slamming a ball to right-center field for a two-run lead, and the Astros held on to win a game for the ages.
The Dodgers Unsung Weapon: A Shutdown Bullpen:::::Seven have featured so far.Kenley Jansen is the closer, with four saves in the postseason.His WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) is a miserly 0.33, his earned run average a perfect 0.00.Jansen, 30, from Curacao, is an intimidating presence at 6 feet 5 inches and 275 pounds, and he has been an elite closer for the Dodgers for six seasons.But like many of his teammates, he is only now getting to throw in his first World Series.He and his setup man, Brandon Morrow, led the way with eight appearances each in the Dodgers nine games.Morrows nine and a third innings leads the team.He and Tony Watson are the hold men; Morrow has four and Watson three so far.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kenta Maeda, signed last year from the Hiroshima Carp, has been shifted to the bullpen for the playoffs.He has not given up a hit in five innings and has been credited with two wins.Tony Cingrani, Josh Fields and Ross Stripling round out the group.The Dodgers were a comfortable 14 games up in the N.L.West at the end of July but did not stand pat, bolstering their relief by landing Cingrani from the Reds and Watson from the Pirates.Though the relievers have been impressive, it cannot be too surprising to those who paid attention during the regular season.The bullpens E.R.A.was 3.38, the best in the N.L.Jansen finished tied for second in saves behind Tampa Bays Alex Colome.His win probability added, a stat that tries to determine how much players contribute to victories, was 5.7, the best of any pitcher in the game.Houstons relievers were also effective in Game 1 of the Series: Brad Peacock and Chris Devenski did not give up a run.But over all, the Astros bullpen has not been as dominant, surrendering nine runs, for example, in the seven-game A.L.C.S.Plenty of fans will tell you that pitching plays an outsize role in the postseason.And ask any Yankee fan about Mariano Rivera to understand just how important a good bullpen can be.With the kind of numbers their relievers are putting up, the Dodgers are holding a big edge as the Series continues.
With a Crowd of Diverse Faces, Dodger Stadium Stands Out:::::Latino attendance can be seen in other ballparks, including Minute Maid Park in Houston, but the scene at Dodger Stadium seems to stand apart.Photo The diversity is fantastic, said Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers longtime Spanish-language radio announcer.When I first started in this job, the Latinos coming to the ballpark were about 8 to 10 percent.Now, he said, he believes the figure to be around 45 percent.It is the most of any park, he added.Oh, by far.But we have also seen many Japanese people and Korean people here, too.Jarrin, who is originally from Ecuador, has been broadcasting Dodgers games since 1959.He said he has seen a steady uptick in fans at Dodger Stadium who come from various backgrounds.Assumptions about someones ethnic identity can prove false, and much of the available evidence about the diversity at Dodger Stadium is anecdotal.Stan Kasten, the Dodgers president, said he had no statistical data regarding the ethnic composition of the fans at Dodger Stadium.Still, he said the team cherished that its fan base was noticeably diverse.We are very proud of it, Kasten said.This is the organization of Jackie Robinson.The Dodgers were at the forefront, not only of breaking the color barrier, but we historically scoured the globe to find players.The Dodgers were the first to build an academy in the Dominican Republic.Were a global team, and that is something thats reflected in the stadium, too.When the Dodgers brought Robinson to the major leagues in 1947, he became the first African-American to break through baseballs wall of segregation, and many African-American fans were drawn to the team.In 1980, the Dodgers introduced Valenzuela, a charismatic left-handed pitcher from Navojoa, Mexico, who energized fans on both sides of the border with his unorthodox windup and stellar pitching.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Valenzuela, who now does commentary on Dodgers games alongside Jarrin, left the Dodgers after the 1990 season.But the legacy of Fernandomania is still felt today.Photo People who were into soccer and boxing, they became big baseball fans because of Fernando, Jarrin said.Many of them still love the Dodgers.And more players would come along and attract fans from various communities to Dodger Stadium.In 1994, the right-handed pitcher Chan Ho Park became the first player from South Korea to join the major leagues, and he tapped into the large Korean-American community in the Los Angeles area.The next year, the remnants of Fernandomania gave way to Nomomania, named for Hideo Nomo, the whirlwind Japanese pitcher who became such an instant sensation that fans from Japan would fly to Los Angeles for a weekend just to see him pitch.The Dodgers currently have two Japanese players on their playoff roster, the pitchers Kenta Maeda and Yu Darvish.There are also two players from Cuba (Yasiel Puig and Yasmani Grandal); one from Puerto Rico (Enrique Hernandez); and a pitcher, Hyun-jin Ryu, from Incheon, South Korea.When Ryu was pitching this summer, I was sitting with like 20 Korean fans, said the 55-year-old Varela, who works for a health care firm in Los Angeles.We were all together and we had so much fun.In recent years, the team has acquired popular Mexican-American players like Nomar Garciaparra, who delighted many fans by walking to his at-bats to the song Low Rider, by War, and Adrian Gonzalez, who is on the team but not on the playoff roster.There is also building excitement for Julio Urias, a 21-year-old left-handed pitcher from Culiacn, Mexico, who is injured.Photo When fans arrive at Dodger Stadium they are greeted by signs written in English and Spanish.Along the top of the visitors dugout the word Welcome is painted in English, Japanese, Spanish and Korean, and some fans wear blue shirts that read, Doyers, an affectionate reference to the way first-generation immigrants in Los Angeles sometimes pronounced the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Dodgers early relationship with Angelenos of Mexican descent was fraught with animosity and distrust after some residents of Chavez Ravine, where Dodger Stadium now sits, were forcibly evicted first to make room for a public-housing development that was never built and then, in 1958, for the stadium.Some of those evictions were captured on television news programs.But over time, that episode was mostly forgiven as fans jumped aboard the Dodgers wagon.For many Mexican-Americans, it was another example of how they were uprooted and pushed around, said Eric Avila, a professor of history at U.C.L.A.and the chairman of the Csar E. Chvez Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.The Dodgers got off to a really bad start in Southern California.But in the end, people just loved baseball, and they eventually adopted the Dodgers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Avila called Valenzuelas electrifying rookie season in 1981 a tipping point.From that point forward, the Dodgers actually became an expression of Mexican-American identity in Southern California.The Mexican-American community went nuts for Fernando, he said.They claimed him and the Dodgers as their own.The Dodgers are also still popular among a segment of African-American supporters, especially older fans who were initially drawn to the team that Robinson played for.But as with the rest of baseball, the Dodgers have struggled to attract a substantial number of African-American fans to games.Curtis Granderson, a Dodgers outfielder who is African-American and has also played in Detroit and New York, said he noticed the fan diversity at Dodgers games to a certain extent.I know theres a heavy Hispanic population and a white population here, Granderson said.I havent noticed a heavy black population.That doesnt mean it doesnt exist.But those two have definitely stood out the most to me.It is definitely a diverse group, and it should be.This is the second-largest city in the U.S., and you hope everyone is supporting the Dodgers.Photo Despite the early resentment created by the evictions at Chavez Ravine, Walter OMalley, who owned the Dodgers, made sure to broadcast games on Spanish radio to spread the gospel of the team among the local Spanish-speaking population, and the broadcasts helped create more Latino fans.One of them was Juan Arrieta, who grew up in the Los Angeles area listening to Jarrin describe Dodgers games in Spanish because Arrietas father, a mechanic from Peru, did not understand English well at the time.It was only recently that Arrieta discovered that Jarrin is actually from Ecuador, just north of Peru.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I always just assumed he was Mexican, Arrieta said, acknowledging how people can mislabel others.Isnt that awful?Now a 45-year-old bartender living in San Diego, Arrieta and his wife, Diane, who is of Mexican descent, attend a handful of Dodgers games each year, and were sitting in the bleachers at Game 2 of the National League Championship Series.I think the big difference nowadays is that you see people spread around the stadium, Arrieta said about Dodger Stadiums diversity.It used to be that we would sit in the upper deck or out in the pavilion.Now its not segregated like that anymore.And its not just Latino.When Maeda or Ryu pitch, you see a lot of Asian fans at the game, too.Its a real melting pot.After Game 1 of the World Series ended and happy Dodgers fans were congregating in the parking lot waiting to leave, Varela came upon an older white man who said he was originally from Brooklyn and had been a Dodgers fan since then.He was sharing stories with a younger Mexican-American fan from Los Angeles, and the two men snapped photos of themselves together.It doesnt matter what color you are or where you come from or what religion you are, she said.What matters is we all love baseball, and that unites us.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 2, Inning by Inning:::::Bottom 6th: Seager goes deep on Verlander.Justin Verlander needed just four pitches to retire Chase Utley and pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a pair of fly-outs to center to start the inning, but that is when the trouble started.He walked Chris Taylor his second walk of the game, both of which were drawn by Taylor and got ahead, 0-2, on Corey Seager, but a 97 mile-per-hour fastball was right down the middle and Seager wasted no time hitting it out of the park to give his team the lead.Justin Turner popped out to end the inning, but the mighty Dodgers bullpen now has a lead to work with, which could be a big problem for Houston.Waldstein: Did that seem like a familiar script?A two-out walk to Chris Taylor and then a two-run homer to left by the next batter?In Game 1 it was Justin Turner with the smash.In Game 2 it was Corey Seager, who went opposite field with a pitch that Verlander left up in the zone.And Seager knew it was gone or at least had a good chance right away because he was screaming as the ball left the bat.All of the Dodgers runs so far in the series have come on four home runs.Now L.A. is 12 outs away from taking a 2-0 lead in the series by beating the Astros two best pitchers, and the Dodgers have a favorable pitching matchup in Game 3.Top 7th: Dodgers bullpen stays strong.Ross Stripling was the fourth Dodgers pitcher of the game and he lasted just four pitches, each of which was a ball.The walk to the struggling Marwin Gonzalez resulted in yet another pitching change, with Brandon Morrow coming in to face Josh Reddick, and the right-hander came through in a big way by getting Reddick to ground into a double play.He allowed a single to Evan Gattis, who was pinch-hitting for Justin Verlander, but finished off the inning by inducing a grounder to short from George Springer.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Verlander now out of the game, his final line was six innings, two hits and three earned runs.He struck out five and walked two.Bottom 7th: Harris Keeps it close for Astros.With Will Harris on in relief for Houston, Cody Bellinger led off the inning and reached on a throwing error.He advanced to second on a curveball in the dirt that was ruled a wild pitch and went to third on a groundout by Yasiel Puig.But with the infield in to try to prevent a run, Joc Pederson struck out on five pitches.The infield returned to their normal positioning with two outs and Harris struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning.Photo Top 8th: Astros cut into Dodgers lead.Dave Roberts continued to be aggressive with pitching changes, but for the first time in the series he did not quite have the magic touch as the Astros narrowed the Dodgers lead to 3-2.After Alex Bregman led off the inning with a ground-rule double off Brandon Morrow, Roberts turned to his closer, Kenley Jansen, hoping for a six-out save.Jansen was able to get a groundout from Jose Altuve, but Bregman advanced to third on that play and then scored on a single by Carlos Correa.Jansen recovered to get a pop-out from Yulieski Gurriel and then ended the inning by striking out Brian McCann.Unless the Dodgers can extend the lead in the bottom of the 8th, Jansen will have just one run to work with in the ninth.Waldstein: The Astros finally break through against the Dodgers bullpen, which had not surrendered a run in 28 consecutive innings in the postseason.Jansen, who is being asked to get a 6-out save, was 41 for 42 in save opportunities in the regular season.He had one five-out save this year and earned a win in a two-inning performance in extra innings.He has a five-out save and a four-out save this postseason.Bottom 8th: Dodgers riding Jansen for six-out save.It was a quick inning for the Dodgers offense.Chase Utley flew out to left, pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor flew out to left to end the inning.The Dodgers are three outs away from a 2-0 lead in the series with their dominant closer, Kenley Jansen, trying to finish a six-out save.Photo Top 9th: Gonzalez breaks out of slump to tie game.Kenley Jansen only had one six-out save in his career coming into todays game, and he will leave with only one after he allowed a game-tying solo homer to Marwin Gonzalez to start the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the home run, Jansen got a quick out from Josh Reddick, who popped out to second, and retired pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center, but he allowed a two-out double to George Springer.With the go-ahead run on base, Jansen was able to stop the bleeding by retiring Alex Bregman on a grounder to short.With the Dodgers already having used five relievers, including their three best, they could run into manpower issues if this tie game stretches on for a while.Waldstein: It was only Jansens second blown save of the year.His first was July 23 in Atlanta when he gave up a game-tying, three-run home run to Matt Adams.But the Dodgers came back to win that game, 5-4, and are 98-0 when leading after 8 innings this year, including the postseason.Bottom 9th: Bellingers blast ends at warning track.Houston turned to their closer in the ninth and Ken Giles started things off by striking out Corey Seager.He retired Justin Turner on a grounder to short and narrowly escaped a walk-off home run when Cody Bellingers deep blast to right was caught at the warning track by Josh Reddick.This game is headed to extra innings.Photo Photo Top 10th: Back-to-back homers give Astros a lead.Houston badly needed its best hitters to start delivering, and Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa did that in a big way by starting the 10th inning with back-to-back home runs to give the Astros a 5-3 lead.The Dodgers ran out of top-shelf relievers, thanks to the aggressiveness of Dave Roberts in trying to protect a narrow lead earlier in the game, so Josh Fields came in for the 10th.Robertss aggressiveness had paid off throughout the postseason, but it backfired in Game 2, with Fields giving up the two home runs, and a double to Yulieski Gurriel, before being replaced by Tony Cingrani.Cingrani made quick work of the Astros, allowing just an intentional walk.Houston is now three outs away from victory.Waldstein: That was Altuves sixth postseason home run.Not too shabby.And Carlos Correa follows it up with another blast, the third by the Astros in the last two innings.Correa with an epic bat flip, too.This game, and the series, has pivoted in a hurry, and Dodger Stadium is very quiet.Photo Bottom 10th: Dodgers storm back to tie game.The Astros went ahead 5-3 in the top of the 10th, and sent their closer, Ken Giles, out for a second inning in hopes of finishing off the victory.The Dodgers had other plans.Yasiel Puig led off the inning with a home run, and after Giles struck out two batters, Los Angeles tied things up on a walk to Logan Forsythe and a single by Kike Hernandez.Chris Devenski relieved Giles, and with the winning run at second base, he got Chris Taylor to fly out to center to end the inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: I have been at some great World Series games, and this one now joins the list.Leads have been erased, home runs all over the place, blown saves, classic bat flips, and to top it all off, the second base umpire, Laz Diaz, gets hit in the upper leg with a pickoff attempt.Had it not hit him, Kike Hernandez certainly would have been on third base, and that might have changed how Dvensky would have pitched to Taylor.When Forsythe slid home for the tying run, the upper decks of Dodger Stadium were swaying slightly.I remember that from Shea Stadium in 1999 and 2000.A bit unsettling.Photo Top 11th: Springer goes deep to put Astros on top.Brandon McCarthy was not on the N.L.C.S.roster for the Dodgers, but he was added as an extra arm for the World Series.Because the team was officially out of relievers, he was on the mound to try to keep Los Angeles in the game in the 11th.Cameron Maybin led off the inning with a single and stole second before George Springer, who had been ice-cold coming into the game, hit a monster blast to right-center that once again put the Astros on top.McCarthy ended the damage there, getting three quick outs, but the Dodgers now have three outs to stay alive in what has become a wild game.Bottom 11th: One more home run, but not enough for Dodgers.Chris Devenski was back out for a second inning of work and he started things off by getting Corey Seager to line out to center.That brought up Justin Turner, and the postseason hero for the Dodgers hit a liner that looked like it might sneak through the infield before Alex Bregman ranged to his left and was able to snare it for the second out.That brought up Charlie Culberson, and the last man on the Dodgers bench hit a two-out solo homer to center to narrow Houstons lead to one run, but that was as close as Los Angeles would get, as Yasiel Puig struck out to end the game.
On the Mound, the Dodgers Rich Hill Is Part Curveball, Part Crazy:::::Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts agreed: Hes absolutely crazy.He sees red.Hes bordering on psychotic, but in the best possible way.General Manager Farhan Zaidi did, too: Rich Hill is as much a Jekyll and Hyde personality as Ive seen on and off the field.The Dodgers have reached their first World Series in 29 years with a well-rounded roster, a deep farm system, the largest payroll in the sport and shrewd moves by the front office.The one unit that ranked first in all of baseball this season was their starting rotation, which posted a 3.39 earned run average.Photo That would not have been possible without the rotations depth, beginning with Clayton Kershaw, the best pitcher of this generation.Then there is Alex Wood, who was an All-Star this season; the formidable Yu Darvish, who was acquired in a midseason trade; and Hill, a left-hander whom the Dodgers traded for last season and, after being duly impressed by how he pitched, gave him a three-year, $48 million contract over the winter.Since the Cubs drafted Hill in 2002, he has been with 10 major league organizations, including two where he only pitched in the minors.While he has always had that competitive fire, Hill admitted it may have grown with the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I really believe that effort and passion will beat talent every single time, he said.The 6-foot 5-inch Hill thrives on a funky delivery with his long limbs, a deceptive fastball that averages only 89 miles per hour and frequent use of one of the sports best curveballs.In 31 starts over a year and a half with the Dodgers, he has posted a 3.02 E.R.A.Hills controlled rage, as teammates call it, adds an extra wrinkle.People pay good money to come and watch a baseball game, and when I go out there Im giving everything I got every single time, Hill said.Whatever the results are, the results are going to be.If you come to watch a game where Im pitching, youre going to get that intense passion and understanding that the effort doesnt compromise.During a game, his facial expressions are something to behold.He scowls.He looks disturbed after rough innings, hands on his head, visibly frustrated.He rightfully looked distraught after losing a no-hit bid on a game-ending home run by the Pirates in the 10th inning of a game last August.After giving up a solo home run to Addison Russell of the Chicago Cubs in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series last week, Hill violently threw a cup of water onto the dugout floor and screamed.It was the only run he gave up in five innings, and the Dodgers later won the game, but his reaction was standard fare for Hill at least.If hes had a couple first innings where hes given up a run or two, then nothings safe, said Chris Taylor, the Dodgers leadoff hitter.Coolers arent safe.The gum tray, whatevers in there, you just kind of stay out of his way.But he does a great job of releasing that, and then he always seems to come back out there and give a quality outing.Photo Kenley Jansen, the Dodgers All-Star closer, said Hill was the nicest guy Ive ever met in baseball, period.He said he could sense that Hills competitiveness is derived from the setbacks he endured to get to where he is now.Jansen said that before heading out to the bullpen, he spends the first part of the game in the Dodgers clubhouse, where he can hear Hill screaming.Added Zaidi: If you happen to be hanging out in the clubhouse on days that he starts, you may hear noise rattling in the distance, and theres a good chance its Rich rearranging some equipment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Zaidi said Hills intensity was actually reassuring and can rub off on teammates during the game because you know the guy going out there taking the ball feels that passionately about the game and nobody else is going to let up when they see that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hill plays down his wild intensity when asked about it, perhaps because he is so easygoing off the mound.I cant really explain it unless Im standing in between the lines, he said.Its that boxers mentality of, when you get in the ring the other guy is trying to beat you.His on-field alter ego is so different than his off-field persona that his family will occasionally ask him about it.He just shrugs.Its a very difficult game, and its extremely hard to master, he said.But with the effort, intensity and passion, it makes it a heck of a lot easier to go home at night and know you gave everything that you could, rather then think back and regret.
Dodgers Overcome Heat, and Astros, in World Series Game 1:::::Over seven innings, Kershaw allowed three hits, did not walk a batter and racked up 11 strikeouts the most by one pitcher this season against the Astros, who had the fewest strikeouts of any team during the regular season.Houstons only run came on a fourth-inning home run by third baseman Alex Bregman, which soared into the left-field seats.Photo When Kershaw was done, Brandon Morrow retired the Astros in order in the eighth inning, and closer Kenley Jansen did the same in the ninth as the Dodgers seized a one-game-to-none lead in the Series.The record temperatures are not expected to abate for Game 2 on Wednesday, when the Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill will face the Astros right-hander Justin Verlander.If pitchers were forced to work in sauna-like conditions that were far different than the typically frigid World Series games played in the Midwest and Northeast, hitters did not mind.We treated it like a summer game in Cincinnati, Dodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger said.When its hot, the ball flies and we like that.The blistering heat, which shattered the previous World Series first-pitch record of 94 degrees set in 2001 in Phoenix when the Yankees played the Arizona Diamondbacks, did not dim the enthusiasm of the crowd, which relished the Dodgers first World Series appearance in 29 years.The visitors from Houston were relative newcomers to this stage, too.The Astros had been here only once before, in 2005, and they had the worst record in baseball as recently as 2013.To get to this Series, both franchises leaned heavily on analytics.The heads of baseball operations for each team the Dodgers Andrew Friedman and the Astros Jeff Luhnow had worked in the business world and arrived from other organizations where they had success through extensive use of data.Friedman constructed a perennial contender that reached the World Series as the general manager of the Tampa Bay Rays despite having one of baseballs smallest payrolls, while Luhnow helped feed talent to World Series teams as the St. Louis Cardinals head of scouting and player development.Photo After Luhnow was hired by the Astros after the 2011 season, the team endured several losing seasons to secure high draft picks to complement some of the young talent in the system, and it continued to make shrewd trades and free-agent signings.Friedman, who was hired after the 2014 season, took over a team that had won back-to-back division titles but had bigger ambitions under the Guggenheim Group, which had purchased the team for a record $2 billion two years earlier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Friedman set about drastically turning over the roster, the Dodgers continued to win.Only five players Turner, Kershaw, Jansen, and outfielders Yasiel Puig and Andre Ethier were on the major-league roster when Friedman arrived.The Dodgers now boast what is arguably the most versatile roster in baseball, allowing them to pick favorable matchups at their will.One of Friedmans most valuable finds has been Taylor, the utility player he plucked from the Seattle Mariners, who has reconfigured his swing and become a vital spark for the Dodgers offense, hitting 21 home runs in the regular season while playing center field and shortstop.Taylors home run, his third of the postseason, was the fourth leadoff homer in a World Series, the most recent one being Alcides Escobars inside-the-park home run for the Kansas City Royals two years ago against the Mets.I didnt overthink it, said Taylor, who modestly flipped his bat after he made contact.I was just going up there trying to get the barrel to the ball, thinking about being aggressive, and be ready to hit the first one.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts hoped the weather would help his hitters if they could get the ball up in the air against Keuchel.But he conceded before the game it would be a difficult chore against a pitcher whose late movement and pinpoint control had allowed him to have the highest ground-ball-to-fly-ball rate (2.12) among starting American League pitchers.Photo It just comes down to discipline, trying to get a ball up, out, over use the big part of the field like everyone talks about, Roberts said.Light air today its going to be hot so I think for us to try to get underneath it and try to put the ball in the air.With him obviously, its a tall task.If Keuchel, who had not allowed a leadoff home run in more than five years, was stunned by Taylors thunderbolt, he did not come unglued.He allowed only four more hits two singles to Corey Seager and one each to Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes and all but one were erased by a double play.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Keuchel did appear to be spooked by Taylor, who lined into a double play in his second at-bat and walked on five pitches with two out in the sixth.That brought up Turner, whose bushy, unkempt red beard, matches Keuchels distinctive facial hair that runs to the collar of his jersey.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Keuchel worked the count to 1-2 and came inside with a cut fastball that was belt high.Turner pulled his hands in and lifted a high, fly ball to left field.Astros outfielder Marwin Gonzalez drifted back on the ball as if he had a play on it, but after he reached the warning track and then the wall, he looked up helplessly as it landed in the pavilion.I didnt think it was going out by any means, Keuchel said.It wasnt an easy pitch to hit.I was trying to get in on him and I thought it did.He didnt square it up by any means.Turner acknowledged that he had gotten a helping hand from the weather.If its 10 degrees cooler, thats probably a routine fly ball, Turner said.Photo The home run upped Turners career postseason R.B.I.total to 26, tying the franchise record set by Duke Snider.Fourteen of those have come this season for Turner, the former Mets castoff.The two home runs were enough for Kershaw, who has won three Cy Young Awards but has had a spotty October rsum.He had been good but not dominant since his return in early September from a five-week stint on the disabled list with a sore back.On Tuesday, though, he was at his best, complementing his two best pitches a fastball and a knee-buckling curve with a sharp slider.His fellow Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy said Kershaw had been close but not all the way there.Tonight, McCarthy added, that looked like that was the genuine article.Kershaw allowed only three hits the homer to Bregman, a third-inning single to Josh Reddick and a seventh-inning single to Jose Altuve.And besides the hits, Kershaw allowed just three balls to be hit out of the infield.On a night when the air was as thin as it was hot, that proved to be the difference.
The Lakers? Who Are They? L.A. Is a Dodgers Town These Days:::::It takes quite a performance to rally the populace in a city where more stars are visible on the streets than in the sky and where entertainment is a profession for so many of its citizenry.But this years Dodgers have galvanized Los Angeles with their 104 regular-season victories; their relievers who have combined for 23 scoreless innings in the postseason; their presumptive rookie of the year, Cody Bellinger; their possible Cy Young winner, Clayton Kershaw; their tongue-wagging, bat-licking, hit-scorching man-child, Yasiel Puig; and their Mr. Red October, Justin Turner.For the first time in 29 years, the Dodgers are the last National League team standing in the postseason.For a proud franchise that won six championships in a 33-year span, the wait to return to the World Series has seemed biblical in its length.The end of the drought has made die-hard fans delirious and more casual followers of the team pretty fanatical, too.Photo And so minutes after Culberson caught a line drive off the bat of the Chicago Cubs Willson Contreras last Thursday night for the final out that clinched the pennant for the Dodgers, Cecilia Geers went on the StubHub ticket site on her computer in search of Series tickets.She found single tickets for sale in the top deck in left field for $750, which struck her as a bargain for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.Geers, a Los Angeles native, was born 30 days after the Dodgers final game of the 1989 season, when they finished 77-83, a far cry from the title they had won the year before.Throughout her childhood, Geers accompanied her father to a few games every season.It was almost always at his suggestion, and he sweetened the invitation by letting her eat whatever she wanted at the concession stands.And so she gorged on soft-serve ice cream in a miniature helmet, pizza, frozen lemonade and chocolate malts, even as team after team left her hungry for something more substantial.As she grew older, her tastes matured.For the past few years, Geers has appreciated the mastery of Kershaw and the mischievousness of the Cuban-born Puig, whom she follows on social media because hes hilarious, she said.In Geerss lifetime, the Dodgers havent exactly been a joke; before this year they had advanced to the postseason 10 times, including four trips to the National League Championship Series.But close didnt cut it when, in the same period, the Lakers were winning five N.B.A.titles, the Kings were winning two N.H.L.titles, and the Anaheim-based Angels and Ducks were each winning a championship.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was a reason that in January of last year, a headline in HuffPost read, Los Angeles is a Lakers Town.Of course, 21 months later that reads like fake news.The Lakers, seven years removed from their last championship season, are rebuilding, and Rachelle Tachiquin, who drives a black Honda sedan with a California vanity license plate that reads DGRFN81 gets thumbs-up and honks from fellow drivers with whom she shares the overcrowded roads.I have a lot of people stop and compliment me, said Tachiquin, who was indeed born in 1981, when the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the Series.This time around, she will get to see every Series game in her capacity as an usher along the third-base side of Dodger Stadium.Photo Geers, however, wont be there.She reached out to her parents and asked if they would buy her a ticket to one of the first two Series games as a gift for her birthday, which falls on Halloween.They found the $750 price that she quoted frightful, and so, along with likely millions of other Southern Californians, Geers will have to settle for watching the telecast.But just being able to watch the games on television is a treat; because of a continuing cable dispute much of the Southern California market does not have access to telecasts of Dodgers games during the regular season.Seeing a team you rooted for all your life finally make it, even though it wasnt as long a drought as the Cubs had, it was still my lifetime so its a really big deal, Geers said.So how much has Los Angeles changed since the Dodgers last World Series appearance?Theres less smog and more traffic, Mike Scioscia said with a laugh.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Scioscia was a member of the upstart 1988 Dodgers team that won the World Series in five games over the Oakland Athletics for the franchises second title of the decade.Since 2000, he has managed the Los Angeles Angels, whom he led to their first World Series crown in 2002 in the franchises 42nd season.Some of my friends are saying 29 years is long enough, Scioscia said Monday by telephone.I had to remind them that the Angels had to wait longer.But Scioscia understands.The Dodgers have always been a captivating force out here because of their history and tradition, he said.When they came here from Brooklyn they already had a national audience and the expectations are high because of that history and tradition.The franchise also arrived in Los Angeles with Vin Scully, who began broadcasting Dodgers games in 1950 and didnt stop until his retirement at the end of last season.The last time the Dodgers were in the World Series, Scully called the games for NBC.His voice was the cord that braided together generations of Dodgers fans.For many, this postseason has been akin to that first holiday meal without a beloved family member.Photo Not having Vin doing the games makes this postseason bittersweet, said Valerie Medina, who was waiting in line Saturday to enter the team store.She had made the trip the day before only to discover that the pennants and caps she sought had sold out.If he could come and do one game, that would be awesome.But Im glad for him that he gets to watch the games as a fan with his family.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Online petitions to bring Scully back for the World Series collected thousands of signatures, but Scully has been adamant about remaining outside the spotlight, declining through the Dodgers an interview request.He has attended a few of this seasons playoff games as a fan, and during one such visit to Dodger Stadium, Scully stopped in the broadcast booth of his longtime friend, Jaime Jarrin, who is concluding his 59th season as the teams Spanish-language broadcaster.Jarrin, who is from Ecuador and who from 1962 to 1984 put together a Cal Ripken-esque string of consecutive game broadcasts, described Scully as my teacher, my idol, my mentor and my friend.He said he told Scully, Even though you wont be here, youll be in my booth spiritually.Still around, too, is Tommy Lasorda, who is 90 and who managed the Dodgers to their two championships in the 1980s.Back then, he sometimes held court in a booth at the Pacific Dining Car, an old-time, downtown, 24-hour eating establishment where the waiters wear pressed jackets, the walls are paneled and the tables are covered in white linen.The owner of the restaurant is Wes Idol III, whose great-grandfather opened it in 1921.Idol has a personal tie to this years Dodgers.In the summer of 1995, he headed to Massachusetts with a friend named John Beaton Hill to interview baseball players for a screenplay.On that trip, Idol met his friends 15-year-old brother.That brother, Rich Hill, would grow up to be a major league pitcher who went through a great deal of adversity on the field before becoming a crucial member of the Dodgers starting rotation.And once in Los Angeles, Rich Hill was also reunited with his brother, who is now a filmmaker.Its the quintessential L.A. story; a man moves to the city in pursuit of his creative dreams.Years later, his brother joins him after an arduous baseball journey finally leads somewhere.And now the Dodgers could soon be champions.Yes, Rich Hill acknowledged.Its fun.A lot of other people in Los Angeles would seem to agree.
To Measure Jose Altuve, Just Watch Him Soar:::::Altuves all-around skills have made him, in the words of Astros Manager A. J. Hinch, the games perfect player.This season, he led the majors in hitting at .346 while delivering 24 homers, 32 stolen bases and his usual stellar defense at second base.Teammates and opponents marvel at his uncanny ability to strike any pitch, anywhere, with the barrel of the bat.He hit .500 for a whole month this year, Astros catcher Brian McCann said, referring accurately to Altuves torrid stretch from June 27 through July 27.Hes playing a different game.I did that in high school.As for the Hall of Fame, McCullers was not overstating things.Altuve, 27, has 1,250 hits in his career.Only three players in the top 10 list Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron had more hits through their age-27 season.Photo Dallas Keuchel, the Astros Game 1 starter on Tuesday, said Altuve had the best hand-eye coordination he had ever seen.They were teammates on the Tri-City ValleyCats, the Astros affiliate in Troy, N.Y., in 2009.Altuve was 19 then and in his third pro season after signing from Venezuela for just $15,000 (no other teams had shown interest).Keuchel remembers hearing Altuves nonstop chatter in the back of the bus and thinking it sounded as if he had not yet hit puberty.He sounded like he shouldnt even have been playing baseball, Keuchel said, but the more they played together, with the Lancaster JetHawks and the Corpus Christi Hooks, the more those hand-eye skills signaled stardom.I didnt know that he was going to actually be this good, Keuchel said.I thought he was going to be an All-Star, but to win the M.V.P., which he should and honestly, he should have been in the race the last three or four years and I couldnt be happier for the guy, because he is an all-American dude.An All-American dude, you could say, who represents the essence of the All-American game.Walk past an N.F.L.or N.B.A.star on the street, and chances are you could guess his profession.With most of the best baseball players, you would never know.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chris Sale, the strikeout king of the Boston Red Sox, is a string bean: 6-6 and 180 pounds.Dustin Pedroia, the longtime Boston second baseman whom Altuve called an inspiration, is easily shorter than his listed height of 5-9.The greatest pure hitters of modern times Tony Gwynn and Ichiro Suzuki could not have looked more different: Gwynn lumbering (in later years), Suzuki forever lithe.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.When physical outliers play with Altuves verve, their appeal can be irresistible.I bet kids disproportionately love Jose Altuve, like kids disproportionately loved Kirby Puckett and Ozzie Smith, said the broadcaster Bob Costas, citing undersized but spirited Hall of Famers.Their size makes them stand out, and their energy and joy transmits easily.If youre 9 years old, youre not deeply into analytics but you can deeply appreciate those guys.Naturally, Altuve grades high analytically: According to Baseball Reference, , only Mike Trout and Josh Donaldson have compiled more wins above replacement among position players over the last four seasons.This year Altuve ranked first, just ahead of Aaron Judge, the hulking Yankees slugger.Size can help, clearly, but for such highly specialized skills, it doesnt always matter.Not in baseball, if you have the ability, said Dave Hudgens, the Astros hitting coach.And the thing about Jose, too, is that pound for pound, he might be the strongest guy in the league.Incredibly strong.He squats 400 pounds, his core is really strong, and hes developed the knee-cock, which has enabled him to hit for more power.Photo Marwin Gonzalez, the utility player who led the Astros in runs batted in this season with 90, has known Altuve since they played in the Venezuelan winter league at 17.He remembers Altuve adding that power-hitting technique after already winning the first of his three major league batting titles, with a .341 average in 2014.Altuve hit seven homers that season, and 24 in each of the last two.Its never enough for him, Gonzalez said.He says that theres always room to get better, and I believe it.That first batting title heralded so much to come.Altuve clinched it on the final day of the season the very last day before the Astros made their move from 92-loss also-rans to a wild-card winner and a perennial contender.Of the 13 players the Astros used that afternoon against the Mets, only Altuve is on the World Series roster.Gonzalez was on the bench that day and remembers how teammates urged Altuve to sit out.He was hitting .340, three points better than Detroits Victor Martinez, who could not have closed the gap without a big day.He didnt want to win it that easy, Gonzalez said.He worked a lot for that.Everybody was telling him in the clubhouse, Just sit down, it wasnt necessary, you dont know when youre going to have that opportunity.Some players just win one batting title, and thats it.But he didnt listen to us.He went out there and competed, and thats what he does every day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Three years earlier at Citi Field, the Mets Jose Reyes had left the season finale after a first-inning bunt single ensured him the batting title.Altuve played the full game in 2014, went 2 for 4 and said he never considered asking out.I played 150-something games; I dont think the last one would have made the difference, he said.If you want to win something, I dont think it would be very honest if I would have sat down that day.If I sat down, it would have been automatic.I dont think Victor had any chance of catching me.Thats why I was like, We got to play fair.I have to go out there and play, because hes playing that day.As valiant final-day performances go, it does not quite rank with Ted Williams in 1941, when he risked losing a .400 average and instead rapped six hits in a doubleheader to finish at .406.But it symbolized something powerful in its simplicity: a desire just to play, for the sake of the game and the integrity of the competition.The baseball gods must have looked on approvingly.Altuves career has ascended ever since, and now he has reached another peak.
How the Dodgers Won World Series Game 1, Inning by Inning:::::Baseball has worked to improve pace over the last several years, and Game 1 could serve as the blueprint for speeding things up.In the two hour and 28 minute game the shortest World Series game since 1992 the teams combined to throw just 211 pitches.There were only two walks and nine hits, and beyond the three home runs nothing went for extra-bases.Perhaps most important to the pace, there was only one mid-inning pitching change.It helps to have two Cy Young Award-winning pitchers on the mound.- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Heres how the Dodgers won Game 1 of the World Series: Photo Top 1st: Clayton Kershaw delivers ...The 2017 World Series is underway.The first pitch of Game 1 was thrown by Clayton Kershaw at 8:11 p.m. Eastern.The 94 mile-per-hour fastball was fouled off by George Springer.Kershaw finished Springer off in four pitches, striking him out on a slider that dove toward the center fielders feet.Alex Bregman flew out to left, and Jose Altuve grounded out to shortstop, giving Kershaw a perfect inning on just nine pitches.Seven of his nine pitches were strikes.Waldstein: Clayton Kershaw looking sharp at the outset.As colleague Tyler Kepner pointed out, he recorded three outs on his three pitches: Fastball, slider, curve.Kepner, who is sitting beside me and will have fascinating insight all game, also noted that as much as people laud Kershaws curveball, his slider is really his most devastating pitch.Photo Bottom 1st: Taylor puts Dodgers on the board.Chris Taylor got the Dodgers on the board first, hitting Dallas Keuchels first pitch of the World Series well over the left field wall for a 1-0 lead.The breakout performer for the Dodgers, who has firmly established himself as the teams leadoff batter, was sitting on a fastball and got one right down the middle.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keuchel settled down to strike out Justin Turner on seven pitches.Cody Bellinger was retired on a groundout to second, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short to end the inning.For 10 of Keuchels 11 pitches he looked dominant, but he cant get back that first offering to Taylor.Top 2nd: Kershaw cruises through middle of order.Staked to a lead, Clayton Kershaw started off the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a fly ball to center field.He caught Yulieski Gurriel sleeping on a 94 mile-per-hour fastball that sailed right through the zone for strike three.And then he induced a ground ball from Brian McCann which second baseman Logan Forsythe fielded in shallow right field before throwing him out to end the inning.Kepner: The Dodgers ballpark organist played a few bars of Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones after Kershaw painted the black (hit the corner) to strike out Yuli Gurriel in the top of the second.Pretty sharp.Photo Bottom 2nd: Keuchel settles in after early disaster.Dallas Keuchel has continued to look strong since his first pitch of the game went for a home run.Kike Hernandez got things started in the half-inning by singling to left but Corey Seager, making his return to the team after missing the N.L.C.S.with back trouble, grounded into an easy double-play to erase the threat.Logan Forsythe was nearly out on a foul pop to right field that a diving Josh Reddick couldnt handle, but on the next pitch he ended the inning by popping out to center.Top 3rd: Astros get a base runner, but thats it.The Astros got their first hit of the game, but they were not able to do anything with the base runner.Clayton Kershaw started the inning by getting another called strike three, this time to Marwin Gonzalez, but Josh Reddick, the former Dodger, followed that up with a hard grounder to right that scooted just past Cody Bellingers glove for Houstons first hit.Dallas Keuchel, who seemed lost trying to bunt Reddick over to second, ended up striking out on a foul bunt attempt, and then George Springer flailed at strike three to end the inning.Kershaw now has five strikeouts.Photo Kepner: Josh Reddick went 0 for 22 before his first hit in the ALCS.So, naturally, he gets a left-on-left single against Kershaw in his first at-bat of the World Series.The fans here have been booing Reddick every chance they get, as he predicted.They didnt like him when he played here last year, and the feeling apparently is mutual.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats 5 strikeouts in 10 batters for Kershaw: two on sliders, two on fastballs, and one on a curveball.Even more impressive considering that the Astros had the fewest strikeouts in the majors this season.Bottom 3rd: Taylor hits it hard again.Too hard.The leadoff batter for the Dodgers reached for the third consecutive inning, as Austin Barnes hit a grounder through the infield into shallow left for a single.Clayton Kershaw, who has considerably more experience as a batter than Dallas Keuchel, showed him how the National League does things with a bunt that sent Barnes to second.But Chris Taylor, who started the game with a home run on the first pitch he saw, ended the inning by hitting a rope to shortstop Carlos Correa, who easily doubled Barnes off second base to end the inning.Kepner: It hardly seemed likely at the time, but the Dodgers got two Game 1 World Series starters in the same deal in Dec. 2014: Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes.The Dodgers got those two, plus pitchers Chris Hatcher and Andrew Heaney, from the Marlins for Dee Gordon, Dan Haren and Miguel Rojas.Photo Top 4th: Bregman takes Kershaw deep.The game is tied.Alex Bregman took Clayton Kershaws third pitch of the inning over the wall in left-center for a home run, evening the score at 1-1.It was the seventh home run that Kershaw has allowed this postseason.Going back to the regular season, he has now allowed at least one homer in nine consecutive games.After allowing Bregmans blast, Kershaw got consecutive called strike threes on Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa, with home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi giving him some help on a low slider that retired Altuve.Yulieski Gurriel swung helplessly at a slider to end the half-inning, and Kershaw is up to eight strikeouts.Waldstein: I spoke to Carlos Beltran yesterday and he was raving about Bregman.Beltran said Bregman just has an unquenchable thirst for the game and always wants to talk baseball.They often go over video of pitchers and Beltran said sometimes they do their video scouting back at the hotel.Bregman picked a really good guy to learn from.Bregman, at 23 years and 208 days, became the youngest American League player to hit a home run in the World Series since Manny Ramirez for Cleveland against Atlanta in 1995.Ramirez was 60 days younger.Bottom 4th: Dodgers struggle to hit Keuchel hard.It was a remarkably quiet half-inning for the Dodgers.Justin Turner popped out to first, Cody Bellinger grounded out to first, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short.Dallas Keuchel continues to induce soft contact to great effect.Kepner: Hes one section out of view from the center field cameras, but Scott Boras, the powerful agent who sits directly behind home plate in Anaheim, is here in the front row just to the third-base side of the plate.Boras represents both teams No.3 hitters Jose Altuve and Cody Bellinger.Neither has hit free agency yet; Bellinger is a rookie, and the Astros control Altuves rights on a bargain deal (signed with a different agent) through 2019.Here are Altuves salaries: 2014: $1.25M, 15: $2.5M, 16: $3.5M, 17: $4.5M, 18: $6M club option, 19: $6.5M club option.Advertisement Continue

perfect inning.Brian McCann grounded right into the shift to start things off, and then Kershaw got some help from his defense when Justin Turner handled an awkward bounce on a grounder from Marwin Gonzalez, throwing out Gonzalez easily at first.Kershaw then ended the half-inning by freezing Josh Reddick with a 95 mile-per-hour fastball for strike three.Waldstein: With two good pitchers doing their thing minus one home run each this game is moving along at a rapid pace.Kershaw is getting strikeouts and Keuchel inducing ground balls.Kershaw has nine strikeouts already against the team that struck out the least in baseball.His stuff is very crisp.Photo Bottom 5th: Double play gets Keuchel out of inning.Dallas Keuchel got his second strikeout of the game on a changeup to Kike Hernandez.Corey Seager followed that up by looping a single into shallow center, but Keuchel was able to get out of trouble quickly thanks to Logan Forsythe grounding into a double play to end the inning.Keuchel has been efficient all game, and has thrown just 55 pitches in five innings.Kershaw is at 66.Waldstein: Alex Bregman starts another double play, the third for the Astros through five innings, two of which were initiated by Bregman.I am sure most fans can guess why he wears No.2.Like most players today, it is because of Derek Jeter.Bregman said his mother was a Yankees fan, and

strikeout victim.In a moral victory, he drew two balls before being retired.George Springer was strikeout No.11 on a changeup that was nearly in the dirt, and Alex Bregman ended the half-inning with a groundout to short.Kershaw is the first Dodgers pitcher to have double-digit strikeouts in a World Series game since Sandy Koufax had 10 in Game 7 of the 1965 Series.Waldstein: As if Kershaw was not already dominating with his curve, slider and fastball, he drops a rare changeup on Springer for his 11th strikeout.He has retired nine in a row since the Alex Bregman home run.He is averaging an extremely efficient 11 pitches per inning, especially impressive considering all the strikeouts.Photo Bottom 6th: Turners shot gives Kershaw a cushion.Justin Turner hit a two-run home run to left field, giving the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.Dallas Keuchel needed just one pitch to get the first out of the half-inning, retiring Austin Barnes on a grounder to short.Clayton Kershaw also grounded out to short, but then Chris Taylor walked on five pitches.Turner made Keuchel pay for the base runner by crushing an 87 mile-per-hour cutter over the wall, with the crowd in Dodger Stadium exploding in cheers for the popular player.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keuchel was able to get out of the inning without any further trouble by striking out Cody Bellinger, but with the way Kershaw has been pitching, a two-run lead feels gigantic.Waldstein: Turner picks up where he left off.The last game here was Game 2 of the N.L.C.S.and Turner hit a walk-off, three-run home run to win Game 2 of that series.Tonight he blasts a two-run shot after Keuchel made the big mistake of walking Chris Taylor ahead of him with two outs.Turner has 4 home runs in the postseason, tied for second-most by a Dodger.Davey Lopes had the most, 5, in 1978.I think Turner is going to tie Lopess record.He also has 26 career postseason R.B.I.for the Dodgers.That ties Duke Snider, who collected all of his in the World Series.For Turner, 14 of his postseason R.B.I.have come this year, establishing a new Dodgers single-season postseason record.And yes, the Mets let him go for nothing.
How the Astros Became an American League Team:::::The Astros joined the A.L.in 2013 to balance the leagues with three divisions of five teams each.Since 1998, when Arizona and Tampa Bay joined the league as expansion teams and the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the National League, there had been a four-team division in the A.L.and a six-team division in the N.L.Photo The Astros were chosen as the team to switch in part as an effort to create a rivalry with the Texas Rangers in the A.L.West.Because the National League had, on balance, bigger cities, the move to the A.L.was considered a negative by many fans, so much so that the teams new owners were compensated $70 million to offset possible reduced television money.The Astros are the first team to make the World Series with each league.The only other team to switch leagues in modern times, the Brewers, has only one playoff series win since joining the N.L.The Astros N.L.high point was a World Series trip in 2005; they wound up being swept by the Chicago White Sox.Outside of that year, the Astros playoff record was poor in the N.L.: one series win in nine tries.Since moving to the A.L., their playoff series record is 3-1.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A division or conference switch in other North American sports is unlikely to cause a huge commotion.But baseball for many years kept a clean separation of its two leagues, making such a switch more disruptive.Most notably, teams from different leagues did not play one another in the regular season, adding a frisson to the rare times they did, like the All-Star Game and the World Series.Leagues also maintained distinct identities.They had separate league offices, and their umpires dressed differently (A.L.umps wore their chest protectors outside their uniforms).There were rules, large and small, that differed.Fans of the National League, founded in 1876, dismissed the American League, which became a major league in 1901, as the junior circuit.In recent times, rules have become standardized.The debut of interleague play in 1997 took away the most unusual quirk of the leagues.The only significant distinction left is the designated hitter rule, still controversial enough to start a barroom argument.As time moves on, the memories of the Astros as a National League team will fade, and any future trips to the World Series will probably not cause many double takes.
World Series Preview: A Matchup With No Underdog:::::The engine of each teams offense has a look all his own.Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner revels in his long, red hair and shaggy beard and hit .322 with a robust .945 on-base plus slugging percentage this season.Astros second baseman Jose Altuve is the shortest everyday player in the majors at 5 feet 6 inches but this season hes probably the best player, too.Altuve led the majors in batting average, at .346, and hit .400 in the A.L.playoffs.Jose Altuve is a perfect player, Astros Manager A.J.Hinch said this month, and who could argue?Other notables dot the lineups the newcomer Cody Bellinger and the old pro Chase Utley for the Dodgers; the homegrown sensations Carlos Correa and George Springer for the Astros and both pitching staffs include an ace yearning for a championship.The Dodgers Clayton Kershaw, 29, and the Astros Justin Verlander, 34, have won the Most Valuable Player Award, and will probably spend their golden years gathering on a stage in Cooperstown every July.But neither has a World Series title to his name.Kershaw, who will start Game 1 against another top left-hander, Dallas Keuchel, went 18-4 and led the National League in earned run average for the fifth time, with a 2.31 mark.He reached 200 strikeouts for the seventh time, and despite middling postseason numbers over all (6-7, 4.40 E.R.A.), the Dodgers have now won eight of his last nine playoff appearances.His desire to be great is relentless, said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, after the N.L.C.S was over.You watch how he prepares, you watch how he goes about his work every fifth day, and for all that he has put into this game, knowing how badly he wants to pitch in a World Series, Im overcome with joy for him that he gets to experience this.Kershaw has spent his entire 10-year career with the Dodgers, while the Astros are just getting to know Verlander, who joined them in a trade from Detroit on Aug. 31, moments before his eligibility for the postseason would have run out.Verlander has taken the mound nine times for Houston, postseason included and gone 9-0 with a 1.23 E.R.A.He brings elite pitching and star power to the World Series; his fiance, the supermodel Kate Upton, wore a 1980s-vintage Astros warm-up jacket, with the old rainbow design, to the on-field celebration after the final game of the A.L.C.S.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I just congratulated him, and told him I was proud of him and what he had done, said Nolan Ryan, an Astros executive and Hall of Fame pitcher, after Verlander was named the most valuable player of the series.He stepped up and hes a big part of this ball club.I enjoy power pitchers, and he was a real pleasure to watch.Verlander will start Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday, probably against the Dodgers Rich Hill.The series starters should also feature the All-Stars Yu Darvish (in his final performance or two before free agency) and Alex Wood for the Dodgers, and the Astros shutout duo from Game 7 against the Yankees, Charlie Morton and McCullers.Teams driven by stats or by names, they dont do anything, they dont get anywhere, Morton said in the raucous clubhouse after Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.Teams with grit, a tight-knit bond, those teams outperform expectations.That may be true, but both of these teams were expected to contend, and both fulfilled their promise all year long.Photo Leading Off With a Bang The Astros use their best power hitter, George Springer, in the leadoff spot.He went just 3 for 26 in the A.L.C.S., but bashed 34 homers in the regular season with a strong .367 on-base percentage.Hes an incredible tone-setter his presence, his energy, his knowledge of the strike zone, his threat to do exactly what he did tonight, Hinch said after Springer homered in a victory this summer.Hes a middle-of-the-order bat whos leading off the game, and once it rolls back around, you can see how productive he can be getting the most at-bats of the night.Dangerous Curves As fastball velocity rises in the majors, use of the curveball with its greater speed variation than the slider is also up.No two starters throw more curves than the Astros McCullers and the Dodgers Hill.McCullers, who silenced the Yankees with a flurry of curveballs to close out Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., threw curveballs on 47.4 percent of his pitches in the regular season, by far the most for any major leaguer with at least 100 innings.Hill ranked second, with 37.5 percent curveballs.McCullers throws the pitch much harder than Hill, with an average velocity near 86 miles an hour, compared to about 74 m.p.h.for Hill.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Unassuming Champions Besides Bellinger, no Dodger hit 30 homers or drove in 80 runs this season.But if their offense seems underwhelming, consider the lineup for their last World Series game, in 1988: Steve Sax, Franklin Stubbs, Mickey Hatcher, Mike Marshall, John Shelby, Mike Davis, Rick Dempsey, Jeff Hamilton, Alfredo Griffin.Nobody on that Dodger team had more than 25 homers or 82 runs batted in, but with stellar pitching (including two complete games from Orel Hershiser) and the timeliest of all timely hitting (Kirk Gibsons iconic homer to end Game 1), the Dodgers upset the Oakland As in five games.A Complete Player.Almost.Few players have ever matched the all-around skills and longevity of the Astros Carlos Beltran.He is one of five players with at least 2,700 hits, 400 homers, 300 steals and multiple Gold Gloves, along with Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Willie Mays and Andre Dawson.Yet only two of those players Rodriguez and Mays have won the World Series.Beltran lost in his previous appearance, with St. Louis in 2013.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Catching On While Houstons catcher is the seven-time All-Star Brian McCann, the Dodgers Austin Barnes keeps a lower profile.A backup to Yasmani Grandal for most of the season, Barnes emerged to start six of the Dodgers eight games in the playoffs.The team acquired him with Enrique Hernandez from Miami in a seven-player deal in December 2014 that sent second baseman Dee Gordon to the Marlins.Barnes, who by then had played part of just one season above Class A, supports the theory that minor league numbers translate to the majors: his on-base percentage in the minors, .388, matches his on-base percentage for the Dodgers, and his slugging percentage (.439 in the minors, .430 for the Dodgers) is nearly identical.Reminder of Home Jansen wears No.74, a number worn by only nine other players in major league history.For Jansen, it was not simply a high number assigned randomly one spring training.He chose it to honor the street address of his boyhood home in Willemstad, Curacao.His parents had struggled to keep the house after Jansens father suffered a stroke when Jansen was 12.Baseball success has taken care of the mortgage.The short story is I helped my parents save the house, Jansen said a few years ago.We had good times, good memories over there, and also we went through a lot of tough times with the 74.Thats why Im wearing it.Photo Name That Team Neither team began with its current nickname.For their first three seasons, the Astros were known as the Colt .45s, after a suggestion from a fan named William Neder, who wrote in a contest entry, The Colt .45 won the West and will win the National League.In the team logo, smoke rose from a pistol to form the C in Colts.In December 1964, with the Colt firearms company considering a lawsuit over merchandising rights, the team owner Roy Hofheinz changed the name to Astros to capitalize on the space race.The name and insignia will help dispel the image of Texas as a land of cowboys and Indians, Hofheinz said.The Dodgers went through several names in their early years in Brooklyn Atlantics, Grays, Bridegrooms, Superbas, Robins.In the 1930s, the name Dodgers for folks who dodged trolley cars on their way across busy Brooklyn streets finally stuck.Name That Tune Visitors to Minute Maid Park know the word coyotes has only two syllables: those are ky-oats who wail along the trail in the clap-along seventh-inning stretch anthem Deep in the Heart of Texas.Likewise, fans at Dodger Stadium from the South Bay to the Valley, from the West Side to the East Side groove along to Randy Newmans I Love L.A. after every win.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two No.32s Both teams have 10 retired numbers, including No.32 for a pitcher.The Dodgers 32 honors the Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, but the Astros honoree is far less known.In April 1964, before the Dodgers or most teams had retired any numbers, the Astros then still known as the Colt .45s retired 32 for Jim Umbricht, a top reliever in their first two seasons as an expansion team.After posting a 2.01 E.R.A.in 1962, Umbricht was found to have a malignant tumor in his leg.He returned after surgery and pitched well again, but died of lymphoma the next spring at age 33.Photo Familiar Faces If you miss seeing Mary Hart on Entertainment Tonight, for which she was a host from 1982 to 2011, you can still find her on TV, on the far right of your screen behind the home plate for games at Dodger Stadium with her husband, Burt Sugarman.In roughly the same seating location for the games at Houstons Minute Maid Park, youll see Nolan Ryan with his wife, Ruth.And youll almost surely see the ubiquitous Marlins Man a Miami lawyer and sports superfan named Laurence Levy in his trademark orange jersey and visor somewhere close by.An Orbit All His Own The Dodgers are one of just three teams without a mascot, joining the Yankees and the Los Angeles Angels on the no-fun list.Luckily, the Astros have Orbit, a fat and furry green prankster with little baseballs affixed to his antennas.Orbit, who likes to shed his shirt and streak across the field to celebrate winning streaks (get it?), is known for playfully teasing the players; he held a sign reading Im Not Touching You while hovering inches from the head of the notoriously twitchy Adrian Beltre.Orbit is a rival of the Tampa Bay Rays Chris Archer, who presented him with a formal Declaration of Unfriendliness after a series of madcap antics this summer.Common Alumni The Dodgers Hernandez and Josh Fields are former Astros, and Houstons Josh Reddick has played for Los Angeles.Outfielder Jimmy Wynn, known as the Toy Cannon, ranks fourth on the Astros career home run list and played for the Dodgers in the 1974 World Series.Don Sutton, the Dodgers career leader in wins, losses, shutouts and strikeouts, left the team as a free agent to join the Astros in 1981.He fractured a kneecap in his final start of that season and missed the playoffs, but several others have played in the postseason for both teams, including Fields, Reddick, Enos Cabell, Danny Heep, Jose Lima, Davey Lopes, Jeff Kent and Rafael Landestoy.Playoff History A meeting of former National League West rivals, this World Series feels a bit like the 2014 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos; for decades, the matchup occurred multiple times every regular season.But the Astros, who moved to the A.L.in 2013, did face the Dodgers in a playoff series after the strike-shortened 1981 season, when baseball staged a best-of-five series between the first- and second-half winners of each division.The Astros who had beaten the Dodgers in a one-game playoff to win the West the year before took the first two games in Houston but dropped the last three at Dodger Stadium.Nolan Ryan had no-hit the Dodgers two weeks before, but he lost the finale to Jerry Reuss, who spun a five-hitter against his former team to send Los Angeles on its way to a championship.
Mets Have a Clear Goal for Mickey Callaway: Fix Their Pitching:::::I think youre always taking a gamble, Alderson said.Youre always taking a risk on somebody.Nobody is the perfect candidate or the perfect interview, either.Theres always risk in choosing 1 out of 6 or 1 out of 36.But we feel very good.Callaway, who was Clevelands pitching coach for the past four seasons, directed a group that in 2017 posted the lowest combined E.R.A.in the majors (3.30), led the league in strikeouts (1,614) and issued the fewest walks (406).The won-loss record and E.R.A.of Clevelands starting staff (81-38, 3.52) was the best in baseball, and the teams ace, Corey Kluber, is a leading candidate to win the American League Cy Young Award, which he won in 2014.Callaway is also credited with the development of Trevor Bauer, who went from a sub-.500 pitcher in his first four seasons to having a 17-9 record in 2017.Clearly, the Mets are hoping Callaway can work similar wonders with their own pitching staff, which was decimated by injuries in 2017 and posted a 5.01 E.R.A., third-worst in the majors.People are reluctant to name pitching coaches as managers or former pitchers as managers, but in our situation, short-term, pitching is everything, Alderson said.I think it was a positive factor in this case.We evaluated the candidates and looked at Mickey and tried to look at the short term and long term, and we definitely think Mickey long-term has potential as a manager.And short-term, maybe there will be some growing pains, who knows?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But short-term, Alderson added, what is most critical for our success is the pitching, and I think that he has had so much success recently with a pitching staff definitely was a factor for us.Callaway emerged as the winner after a first round of interviews involving five other candidates a list that included Kevin Long, the Mets hitting coach for the past three seasons.Alderson said Long was disappointed not to be chosen, and it was unclear if he would return to the club in 2018.There may be another managerial opportunity out there that comes his way, so well just have to see what happens over the next few days, Alderson said.Hes been given permission to speak to one other team, but I dont want to disclose any of that because I dont know what theyre disclosing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But so impressed were Alderson and Fred Wilpon, the Mets owner, after a lunch meeting with Callaway that they canceled a second round of interviews to concentrate on him.The thing I want to emphasize is we werent only looking for a manager, we were looking for a leader, Alderson said.There seemed to be a real consistency between Mickeys approach and our approach and what he was looking for in the way of managing, and what we were looking for in the way of a leader in the clubhouse.Thats a visceral reaction, not one that you can put down on a checklist, but to me that said everything.Callaway acknowledged being somewhat unfamiliar with the Mets and their personnel while being fully aware of their troubled 2017 season.Im looking forward to getting to know everyone here and digging in deep to everything and everybody to see how I can assist them, he said.And for sure, the Mets need help.
For Game 1 of the World Series, Mother Nature Will Bring the Heat:::::All of this represents a drastic swing from recent World Series weather, especially considering that Game 2 of last years Series between the Indians and Chicago Cubs had a game-time temperature of 43 degrees in Cleveland.The unusual heat in Los Angeles also comes amid a period of extreme weather events around the country, such as the devastating hurricanes that have hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida; temperatures of over 100 degrees in Portland in August and San Francisco last month; and the wildfires that have raged through parts of California.For Angelinos, October is Santa Ana season, said William Patzert, a climatologist with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is about 10 miles northeast of Dodger Stadium.Santa Ana winds blow toward the Pacific Ocean when a high-pressure system builds over the Great Basin desert in Nevada.That pushes winds through the high desert and three mountain passes Cajon, Banning and Santa Clarita River at speeds ranging from 30 to 50 miles per hour.As they drop down into the basin where Dodger Stadium is, they tend to heat up and dry out, Patzert said.What were expecting in the next couple days is record-breaking heat.This could be not-so-welcome news for the starting pitchers in Game 1, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.Photo Dodger Stadium, which sits in Chavez Ravine in the hills just above downtown Los Angeles, is one of baseballs more pitcher-friendly ballparks especially at night.This is due to not only the stadiums dimensions, with its ample 385-foot power alleys, but also Los Angeless weather patterns.Normally, mornings bring an offshore flow, as warm air is carried out toward the ocean.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the afternoon, the winds often shift, bringing in a moist, heavier marine layer that benefits pitchers, weighing down long drives that might normally leave the ballpark.If that marine air is absent, replaced by warm, dry and thin air from the Santa Ana winds, it could be a boon for lineups with plenty of pop.The Astros were second in the American League with 238 home runs, while the Dodgers were fourth in the National League with 221.Keuchel, though, did not seem to mind.This weather is always beautiful, he said Monday.Its that dry heat.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Asked if it was hot enough to make him consider shaving his bushy, chest-length beard, Keuchel laughed.Well, if its hot enough for four wins, Ill shave it for sure, he said.For a long time, weather was less of an issue in the World Series.Until the postseason was expanded in 1969, the World Series wrapped up much earlier in October.And until 1971, when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn persuaded NBC to begin broadcasting some World Series games at night, postseason games were played exclusively during the day.Kuhn, sensitive to criticism over the move away from traditional day baseball, sat in the stands without an overcoat during Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, even though others around him shivered as they watched the Yankees play the Reds in Cincinnati.In 1979, Kuhn prohibited the Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates from wearing ski caps during warm-ups or in the dugout, even though it was 41 degrees at the start of Game 1.After Kuhn was long gone, the postseason calendar kept expanding.Division series were added in 1995 to supplement the league championship series that had begun 26 years before.And then a wild-card game was added for each league in 2012.The extended postseason action has created the opportunity for more bone-chilling nights when the Series takes place in cities like Boston, New York, Denver, Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia.After a frigid 2006 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers improvised to keep warm when the temperature dipped below 40 degrees, the New Era apparel company persuaded Major League Baseball to allow it to develop three types of cold-weather accouterments: knit ski caps, balaclavas and fleece-lined baseball caps with ear flaps, which drew comparison to cartoon character Elmer Fudds hunting cap.The gear came in handy in 2008, when the Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays had to play in wet, windy and cold conditions in Philadelphia.Dodgers outfielder Curtis Granderson pondered the weathers effects on the postseason in 2006, when he played for the Tigers.Since spring training, outside of maybe the first few weeks in April, its been nice weather all season, he recalled thinking that year.Now were trying to determine the best teams in baseball and its anywhere from 20 to 50 degrees colder than youve been playing all season long?Has anyone thought about this?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such considerations will not be necessary on Tuesday.Neither will the balaclavas, scarves and wool coats.The fans who fill Dodger Stadium are far more likely to be wearing tank tops and flip flops while they watch the Astros and Dodgers trying to beat each other and the heat.
My Field of Memories: I See the New Dodgers and Summon the Old:::::My angst goes way back to when baseball was baseball, when the World Series was played in Gods own sunlight, and the bad guys in pinstripes jumped up and down on my beloved Brooklyn Bums the great rivalry of this sport, two teams from the same city (more or less) meeting in six World Series in one tense decade.Photo So much history.So much pain.The humble, scorned and wacky outer-borough Dodgers had played and lost two earlier World Series before finally meeting the Yankees in 1941 a harbinger of hideous things to

The Yankees Have a Consolation Prize: The 2018 Season:::::On the player front, C. C. Sabathias contract is up, Masahiro Tanaka can opt out of his and, because of new rules governing the signing of international players, the chase for the Japanese two-way talent Shohei Otani who could fill a spot in the rotation and a gaping hole at designated hitter will not simply be a matter of emptying the treasure chest.While Cashman seems unlikely to be going anywhere the principal owner Hal Steinbrenner has shown little inclination to fire people with far less merit the case of Girardi is more complicated.He just completed his 10th season with the Yankees, and though he shepherded the club through several transitional years while keeping the team competitive and was duly praised for his work this season, questions remain about whether his relentless style amid the attendant scrutiny of New York has a shelf life.Photo And at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, it is fair to wonder how deeply the 53-year-old Girardi connects on that level.Girardi became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchezs inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, something Girardi rarely if ever had done in the past.Asked to assess Girardis work this season, Cashman said: I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go to be the last team standing and we fell short.Asked if he would recommend bringing Girardi back, Cashman said, My recommendation will be to talk to our owner and sit down and find out whats next.While the barrage of criticism over a rare tactical blunder by Girardi he chose not to ask for a video replay that might have stemmed Clevelands comeback victory in Game 2 of the division series largely subsided once the Yankees dispatched the Indians and went on to nearly win the A.L.C.S., it left Girardi shaken.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the wake of incident, there were even moments where Girardi seemed somewhat fatalistic about his future with the team.And Girardi, too, will be asking some questions not just of Steinbrenner and Cashman, but of his family.It is a ritual each time Girardis contract expires, most recently occurring after the 2013 season.Back then, he had a quick conversation with his wife and three children the oldest is now a college freshman to hear what they had to say about his job.He will do so again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Im not living my kids lives; Im not living my wifes life, he said recently.Im living, in a sense, my life, so I dont know what changes for them.Girardi said Saturday night that he would speak with Cashman after gauging his familys feelings.Thats not my concern right now, he said.Ive had 10 great years here.I feel extremely blessed.God has been good to me and well see what the future holds.The same can be said for several other Yankees.Sabathia, who is 37, said Saturday night that he wanted to return to the Yankees in 2018 Of course, he said but at what price?It will be nowhere near the $25 million he earned in the final year of his contract, but Sabathia is extremely prideful and, after his recent resurgence, he may find suitor willing to pay more than the Yankees next season.Photo Another free agent who wants to return is third baseman Todd Frazier, a midseason acquisition who quickly established himself as a voice in the clubhouse and who played with aplomb in the playoffs.But with top prospect Gleyber Torres likely to make his debut at some point next season, the Yankees do not seem eager to commit to a multiyear deal to keep Frazier around.Tanakas performance in the playoffs he had three dominant outings may have raised his value enough after a lackluster regular season to prompt him to opt out of the remaining three years and $66 million on his contract.Its the first time for me being in this situation, Tanaka said through an interpreter on Saturday night.I dont fully understand how its going to work out, but obviously, Im going to talk to my agent.How the financial pieces fit together has rarely been as great a concern for the Yankees as it is now.Steinbrenner has said getting below the luxury-tax threshold for the first time it will be $197 million next year is an objective, if not an edict.It would allow the Yankees to shed the onerous new penalties for repeat offenders that go into effect next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Yankees, who carried a payroll of close to $220 million this season, will shed nearly $70 million with the expiration of the contracts of Sabathia ($25 million), Matt Holliday ($13 million), Alex Rodriguez ($21 million) and Michael Pineda ($7.4 million).They could pare payroll even further if they find a suitor for Chase Headley, who has one year and $13 million left on his contract, or a taker for Jacoby Ellsbury, even if they have to eat a large chunk of the three years and $66 million remaining on his deal.(Ellsbury has a full no-trade clause, but it is hard to imagine him not being open to waiving it to get to a place where he could play regularly.)On the other side of the ledger, eight players are due for raises through arbitration.It is those young, talented and mostly affordable players, though, who form the foundation of the Yankees optimism.Theres a lot of pieces that are here that have a chance to have exciting times ahead, Cashman acknowledged.And then he added a cautionary note: I think people in my chair, if youre trying to be good at what you do, you never assume anything.The team down the hallway on Saturday night is proof of that.The Astros arrived ahead of schedule in 2015, knocking off the Yankees in the wild-card game before a crushing collapse against the Kansas City Royals in the division series.Though the Astros returned for the 2016 season both optimistic and resolute, they got off to an awful start and never fully recovered, missing the postseason entirely.Ultimately, the future is never promised, Cashman said, as promising as it may be.
Dave Roberts Seeks a Different Shade of Postseason Glory:::::Thats where it really flipped for me, Roberts said, where I was like, Ive got to do this and Im going to do this, Lord willing, as long as I can.Last season, his first as the Dodgers manager, Roberts was named the National Leagues manager of the year.Now he has guided the Dodgers to their first N.L.pennant in 29 years, ending the franchises longest stretch without a World Series appearance.Fittingly, the final out of the N.L.Championship Series in Chicago was a line drive to shortstop Charlie Culberson a fill-in for Corey Seager, the All-Star who has been sidelined with a back injury.With Culberson and Chris Taylor, who also plays the outfield, Roberts nimbly covered the absence of Seager, who is expected to be active for the World Series.The Dodgers roster of multiposition players gives Roberts extraordinary flexibility and matchup advantages.He has a lot of weapons, a lot of interchangeable parts, and hes not afraid to pinch-hit for a guy in the middle of the game, Black said.So from the other side, if you try to set up the right pitcher on the right hitter, a lot of times it cant happen, because hell make that move and he does it with his bullpen, too.Joe Maddon, the Cubs manager, said the key to beating the Dodgers was to get an early lead and keep them from deploying their many options.Theyre prepared, Maddon said, adding later, Once you get behind and theyre able to fulfill the script, then its really difficult, because they do match up well.Yet the Cubs actually held a lead in four of the five N.L.C.S.games against Los Angeles, but were outscored by 20 runs over all and batted just .156.The Dodgers bullpen fired 17 scoreless innings in the series.Photo And when Roberts had to go off script, he did, pulling back a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning of Game 3 to let Yu Darvish bat with the bases loaded against the erratic Carl Edwards Jr.The serendipitous result: the first bases-loaded walk by a pitcher in the postseason since Larry Christenson drew one in 1977.On four pitches, no less.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That was probably 99 percent gut, Roberts said, smiling, though he based the feeling on logic.The Dodgers already had a two-run lead, he explained, and Darvish was pitching well.He knew it would not have been easy for a pinch-hitter most likely the struggling Curtis Granderson to put the bat on the ball, anyway, and recognized that the Cubs had been struggling with control.There is a walk in there, Roberts said, regardless of who is in the batters box.Roberts, whose parents are African-American and Japanese, is the first minority manager in Dodgers history and one of just three minority managers currently in the majors, with Rick Renteria of the Chicago White Sox and Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox, who was hired on Sunday.In other ways, though, Roberts, 45, fits the profile of a modern manager: recent playing experience, a college education (U.C.L.A.), a willingness to work closely with an analytically minded front office and an unflappable nature to handle the increasing demands of the news media.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Experience still matters; no manager has won the World Series in his first managing job since Ozzie Guillen of the Chicago White Sox did it 12 years ago.But Robertss familiarity with Los Angeles, where he also played for parts of three seasons, has perhaps reduced the learning curve that often greets a first-time manager.Especially in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles if any one of those four places becomes your first opportunity, theres a lot thats going to come at you awfully quick, said Jim Tracy, Robertss manager with the Dodgers from 2002 to 2004.If youre not prepared for that, or youre lacking in people skills and dealing with the media, I dont know if its going to go well for you.But he has all of that.You engage yourself with David Roberts for any period of time, and youll swear hes never had a bad day in his life.The Dodgers had plenty of bad days late in the season, losing 16 of 17 games from Aug. 26 through Sept. 11.They dropped 12 games in the N.L.West standings, but had built such a big lead that the division title was not in much doubt.Still, the team needed a calm leader.Every day we came to the park, we thought that was the day it was going to end, and it took a little bit longer than that but you couldnt tell it from Doc at all, said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president for baseball operations, referring to Roberts by his nickname.He was communicating with the media twice a day.It would have been really easy for him at some point along the way to crack, and he didnt at all.And it wasnt just his public persona, either.It was also the way he handled things in the clubhouse.Roberts also seems to have solved the riddle of outfielder Yasiel Puig, who often confounded the previous manager, Don Mattingly.Asked in August about the Dodgers success, Puig without prompting credited Roberts for unifying the team.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He has a lot of charisma, Puig added, through an interpreter.Likewise, when asked generally about Roberts during the N.L.C.S., the ace Clayton Kershaw praised Robertss handling of Puig.Yasiels probably one of the main things that youve seen, said Kershaw, who will start Game 1 of the World Series.I think Yasiels really responded to Doc as manager.Doc has really kind of taken him aside and really given him the attention that probably he needed at first to gain that trust.Puig, a five-year veteran, bashed a career-high 28 homers this season, never grumbling about often batting eighth.He hit .414 (12 for 29) in the N.L.playoffs while showing off his colorful persona, often kissing his bat before using it and flipping it after making contact.After years of postseason angst, the Dodgers look carefree.And with four more victories, their manager will be revered on another coast, forever.
Mets Hire Mickey Callaway, Indians Pitching Coach, as Manager:::::In addition, Callaway will now become one of the youngest managers in the majors.That in itself will mark a significant change for the Mets, who had the oldest manager in the majors in 2017 in Terry Collins, who turned 68 in May.Collins stepped down last month after seven years in the job.The longtime Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen was also not retained for next season.Photo Callaway will also be only the second manager Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson has worked with in New York.While Collins was not as well versed in modern baseball analytics as Alderson is, and although there was friction between Collins and the front office during his tenure, he and Alderson worked relatively well together and took the Mets to the World Series in 2015.Now Alderson will start over with Callaway, who will give the Mets a new perspective as they try to deal with their vexing pitching problems, many of which have involved physical setbacks to young pitchers with considerable talent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The victims in 2017 included Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz, Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler.Only Jacob deGrom went unscathed.It was a key reason the Mets had a team E.R.A.of 5.01 in 2017, the second worst in team history.Meanwhile, the Indians had a team E.R.A.of 3.30 in 2017.Clevelands talented pitching staff was one reason the Indians made it to the World Series in 2016 and finished with 102 victories this season before losing in a division series to the Yankees.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Callaway is from Tennessee and played in college at the University of Mississippi.In his major league career, he generally worked out of the bullpen, spending time with Tampa Bay, Anaheim and Texas.He pitched professionally in South Korea and Taiwan before retiring as a player.As a coach, he worked his way up through the Indians farm system before landing the major league pitching coach job in 2013.Over all during Callaways tenure, the Indians ranked fourth in the majors in E.R.A.and were No.1 in some advanced metrics.During his playing and coaching career, Callaway learned from some of baseballs most experienced managers.In Anaheim, he played for Mike Scioscia.In Texas, he played for Buck Showalter.In Cleveland, he coached under Terry Francona and worked with a front office that leaned heavily on modern analytics.Hes wise beyond his years, Francona said of Callaway late this season.He is confident and when I say confident, I mean confident enough to collaborate with others.Hell take information and sift through it and take what he wants.Hes very good.In an interview with The New York Times in August, Callaway spoke about the Indians approach to all aspects of their pitching staff.Everybodys input is valued, he said, and then we make the best decision we can out of everything thats out there, no matter whos presenting it.Were willing to listen, and if it makes sense, well implement it in our program.To land the managing job with the Mets, Callaway emerged from a group of candidates that included Manny Acta, a former Washington Nationals and Indians manager; Joe McEwing, a former Mets utility player and the current Chicago White Sox coach; Alex Cora, a Houston Astros coach who was hired as Bostons manager on Sunday; and Kevin Long, the Mets well-liked hitting coach, whose future with the team is now unclear.After the season ended, Alderson said he would give Long consideration for the position but had hoped to retain him dependent on the outcome of the managerial search.
Alex Cora Hired as Red Sox Manager:::::Photo BOSTON The Boston Red Sox hired the Houston Astros bench coach, Alex Cora, to be their manager on Sunday, turning to a player from their 2007 World Series championship roster to help the team out of its current playoff slump.The Red Sox announced the hire a day after the Astros eliminated the Yankees in the American League Championship Series.With two days off before Houston opens the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston had a chance to hire Cora without running afoul of Major League Baseballs ban on major moves during the Series.Cora replaced John Farrell, who led the Red Sox to the 2013 title and in the past two years claimed the first back-to-back A.L.East championships in franchise history.But Boston also finished last twice in Farrells tenure, and the club has won just one playoff game since winning it all in his first season.A native of Puerto Rico, Cora is the first Hispanic manager for a franchise that was the last in the major leagues to field a black player.The Red Sox faced renewed racial scrutiny this season after Orioles outfielder Adam Jones reported being subjected to racial slurs at Fenway Park.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A day later, a fan was barred from the ballpark for life for using racial slurs in the stands.The teams president, Sam Kennedy, said at the time that the episode made him feel deep remorse that these things happen in our society.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Cora, who has never managed, played 14 years in the major leagues, including parts of four seasons with the Red Sox, and retired in 2011.He hit .243 with 35 homers and 286 R.B.I.in his career.In 2003, with the Dodgers, he led the National League in putouts and double plays by a second baseman.Alex is a guy that communicates well with the players; hes a guy that studies the game, Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltran said this month.His preparation is above what I have seen in baseball, and he has a great personality.
Behind Astros Victory, McCullerss Killer Instinct and a Fathers Advice:::::A 90 percent blockage in the axillary artery in his shoulder essentially ended his career.McCullers Sr. was 26 years old and had pitched 301 games for San Diego, the Yankees and Detroit.He would pitch just five more, all before his first son was born.He was out of the game by 1996, when the Yankees opened a spring training ballpark near the familys home in Tampa, Fla. McCullers Sr. took a hard-hat tour during construction, and once took Lance Jr. to meet the players in the clubhouse.The family still has tickets, eight rows behind the Yankees on-deck circle.I grew up watching those guys; I love those guys, said McCullers Jr., who went to Jesuit High School on North Himes Avenue, the same street as the Yankees minor league complex.But tonight, I had to do what I had to do.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Astros envisioned a night like this in 2012, at the first draft for their general manager, Jeff Luhnow.They used the No.1 overall pick on shortstop Carlos Correa, who signed for a reduced bonus that allowed them to meet the asking price of two other coveted prospects: McCullers and infielder Rio Ruiz, who was eventually traded to Atlanta for designated hitter Evan Gattis.In Game 7, Gattis lashed a homer for the Astros first run.Correa singled twice and scored.And McCullers authored just the third four-inning save to clinch a postseason series, after Oaklands Vida Blue in the 1972 A.L.C.S.and San Franciscos Madison Bumgarner (five innings) in the 2014 World Series.On the podium behind second base on Saturday, as the Astros received their A.L.championship trophy, Correa draped an arm around Luhnow and reminded him of that first draft.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its crazy, Correa said later.I got drafted with Lance; we grew up together through the minor league system.And now to be here, tasting the World Series, its just surreal.That curveball was working, it was nasty, he was confident.It doesnt get any better than what he did today.A. J. Hinch, the Astros manager, said he had not known McCullers would be so dominant on Saturday, when he was pitching on three days rest.But he knew he would thrive in the setting.McCullers rises to the moment, Hinch said, with a ravenous killer instinct.That assessment got back to McCullers later, in the soggy, smoky home clubhouse.He was proud to explain why.It comes from how I grew up, man, he said.My dad taught me to be a bulldog.This game was, in a way, kind of stolen from him.He got hurt a lot toward the end of his career, and he had a lot left to give.
Astros Move Onto the World Series as the Yankees Run Out of Gas:::::The Yankees ended up losing six of the seven games they played on the road in this postseason.And the final loss came in much the same manner as their last trip to the playoffs, in 2015, when they were blanked by the Astros, 3-0, in the wild-card game.Photo The Yankees meager offense on Saturday was part of a pattern that persisted through all four of their losses at Minute Maid Park in this series.They scored one run in Game 1, another in Game 2 and then one more in Game 6 on Friday night.All three of those defeats came against Houstons two aces Dallas Keuchel, a longtime Yankee tormentor, and Justin Verlander, who boasts a rich playoff rsum.But in Game 7, the Yankees succumbed to Morton, a career journeyman, who held them to two hits through five innings, and to McCullers, who is normally the teams No.3 starter.McCullers gave up a single to Gardner, the first batter he faced, and allowed only one other base runner Todd Frazier on a leadoff walk in the eighth.When center fielder George Springer squeezed a lazy fly ball by Greg Bird for the final out, McCullers leapt into McCanns arms, and the Astros poured out of their dugout to celebrate the franchises second-ever trip to the Series.Photo Everybody talks about Game 7, youre going to need 12 pitchers to get through 27 outs, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.Outside of a couple times I warmed Will Harris up about half a dozen times and Ken Giles at the end we were perfectly content with what Morton and McCullers were doing because they were so dominant.After losing three straight games at a loud and intimidating Yankee Stadium to fall behind in the A.L.C.S, the Astros rebounded once they were back in more comfortable surroundings.Their pitching became dominant again, and it dovetailed with superb defense in the infield and outfield.After Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge jumped at the wall to take a solo homer away from Yuli Gurriel in the second inning on Saturday the second home run Judge pilfered in the postseason Astros third baseman Alex Bregman was quick to return the favor.Photo With one out and runners at the corners in the fifth, and the Astros protecting a 1-0 lead, Bregman fielded Fraziers chopper and fired right to McCanns glove as Bird slid into it.A less precise throw would not have gotten Bird, who was thrown out at the plate twice in this series.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then, in the top of the seventh, as the Yankees were running out of outs, Houston center fielder George Springer whose leaping catch at the wall was the defining moment of Game 6 sprang up again.He vaulted over left fielder Marwin Gonzalez to catch Birds drive to the left-center field wall and keep the Yankees from threatening.And while much was made of the Yankees vaunted bullpen, especially in contrast with the Astros shaky corps, it turned out not to be an advantage in this series.Photo Over the seven games, Yankees relievers allowed more runs than their counterparts (11 to 9), and their most reliable arms were the ones that cost them.Closer Aroldis Chapman was beaten in Game 2 on a walkoff hit; David Robertson deprived the Yankees of a chance to rally when he was raked for four runs late in Game 6; and Tommy Kahnle could not keep his team close on Saturday, getting tagged for three runs.In losing Games 3, 4, and 5 at Yankee Stadium, the Astros seemed unnerved and looked overly anxious at the plate.Thus, it heartened their hitting coach, Dave Hudgens, that when they ended a 15-inning scoreless streak in Game 6, there were three walks that led to a three-run outburst.I think that relaxed everybody a little bit, Hudgens said before Saturdays game.It did.In the fourth inning on Saturday, Gattis fought off three two-strike pitches from C. C. Sabathia and crushed the eighth pitch of the at-bat, a slider he sent over the left-center field wall to break a scoreless tie.Photo In the fifth, Altuve hit a solo homer to right this one beyond the reach of Judge and punctuated the shot with a flip of his bat after he had carried it nearly all the way to first base.Correa and Gurriel followed with line singles to center and right, putting runners at first and second.After Kahnle struck out Gattis, McCann came to the plate.He saw five consecutive changeups from Kahnle.The last one, on a 2-2 pitch, arrived letter high, and McCann ripped it into the right-field corner, chasing home Correa and Gurriel and putting the Yankees in a 4-0 hole.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was the second consecutive game in which McCann, who was traded by the Yankees to the Astros for a pair of low-level prospects last winter, had delivered a critical run-scoring double.In a particularly painful twist, the Yankees are paying $5.5 million of McCanns salary this year and will do the same next season.The Yankees paid at least 15 players on their postseason roster less than they gave McCann this season.It was last years jettisoning of veterans like McCann and another current Astro, Carlos Beltran that ushered in the Yankees youth movement.Judge and Luis Severino quickly emerged as stars this season.Gary Sanchez proved that his scintillating final two months of 2016 had been no illusion.Outfielder Aaron Hicks finally played to his talent level, while reliever Chad Green went from afterthought to indispensable, the rookie pitcher Jordan Montgomery showed a veterans moxie, and shortstop Didi Gregorius continued to blossom.All of these developments should leave the Yankees feeling that there will be a lot more postseason games for them in the years ahead.But there are questions afoot, too beginning with the futures of Manager Joe Girardi and Cashman, whose contracts are expiring.And with the Yankees eliminated, those questions have come into sharper focus.We were hoping to kick that can down the road, but now, obviously, were like 28 other teams, Cashman said.Were now in that pile of whats next?
Things Are Looking Up for the Yankees Thumbs Down Guy:::::But that night, those factors came together in a perfect storm, and now everybody is giving the thumbs down.Im just a regular working guy, and I knew this was going to be the first major league baseball game at Citi Field that did not involve the Mets, said Dunaier, a court office assistant at Manhattan Criminal Court.I just wanted to see history.Little did I know that I would be making history.Dunaier, whose usual seat is in the outfield promenade section, among the least expensive seats in the park, was astounded to obtain a seat in the second row of Section 122, directly behind the visitors dugout.I could never afford that seat for a regular game, he said.I brought my camera along to take some pictures from a vantage point I wouldnt ordinarily have.Before the game was over, however, fans were asking to take pictures of Dunaier, having seen his gesture in social media posts.Thats when I first became aware that something was going on, he said.I had no idea how big this was going to be.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Soon after his image went viral, Thumbs Down T-shirts and hoodies were being worn by Yankees players in their clubhouse, and were quickly available for sale to the general public.This week, Dunaier (pronounced dun-EYE-er) was afforded that 21st century symbol of fame, a bobblehead created in his image.By Thursday night, he had officially arrived, being given a prominent seat in the Brooklyn audience for Jimmy Kimmel Live!After being prompted by the host, he demonstrated his signature move for a national television audience.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kimmel even invited Dunaier to Los Angeles, if the Yankees make it to the World Series to face the National League champion Dodgers.Id have to see if I could get time off from work, he said.Since that game, Dunaier, 54, has found cards and letters of support affixed to the door of his home in Flushing.And he has found himself in a quandary: to root for the Yankees, or not?As a Mets fan, I may not be happy that the Yankees are winning, he said.But the Yankees in the World Series is good for New York City.Thats how Im looking at it.He has retained a manager Chris Gallo, a co-worker at the court who knew him only in passing before seeing his image on television to help him deal with his media demands and the possibility of cashing in on his unlikely fame.I consider myself an entrepreneur, Gallo, who is a court officer, said.When I saw him go viral, I said, This man is going to need some guidance.Our whole idea is to keep him relevant.Dunaier and Gallo struck a deal with the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame for the sale of a Thumbs Down figurine, which will be released in January.They are also exploring legal options either to stop the sale of T-shirts with Dunaiers likeness or to find a way to share in the profits.Gallo said, Were trying to take this for a nice ride.Dunaier, no doubt, would give that the thumbs up.Or should it be a thumbs down?
Astros and Yankees Take Some Shaky Memories Into Game 7:::::In Game 5, at the Astrodome, the Astros led by three runs in the eighth inning with Nolan Ryan on the mound.Yet the Phillies came back and went on to win the World Series.In 1986, also at the Astrodome, the Astros held another three-run lead, this time over the Mets in the ninth inning.A victory would have set up Game 7 and shifted the edge to the Astros, who could use their ace, Mike Scott, whose suspiciously moving splitters had burrowed into the Mets psyche.Yet the Mets, like the Phillies before them, stormed back to win the game and, eventually, the World Series.Fast forward past a few swift exits in the division series, a seven-game loss to St. Louis in the 2004 N.L.C.S.and a sweep by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 World Series.After beating the Yankees in the 2015 A.L.wild-card game, the Astros took a 6-2 lead into the eighth inning of Game 4 of their division series with the Kansas City Royals.By now, you know the pattern.The Royals, who were facing elimination, came back to win the game.They, too, were soon World Series champions.Photo Which brings us to Friday, when the Astros again found themselves with a three-run lead in the eighth inning, trying to extend the series.Verlander had avoided a jam in the seventh, surviving a walk, a hit batter, a 10-pitch at-bat by Aaron Hicks and Todd Fraziers dangerous drive to center, which George Springer snared with a leap.A groundout ended the inning on Verlanders 99th pitch.Not all pitches take the same kind of toll on a pitcher.Ninety-nine pitches in the caldron of October can feel different from the same amount in a blowout in June.Such was the case for Verlander, who had worked all nine innings of Game 2.His 99 on Friday were all he could give.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres no point in saving anything, Verlander said, explaining that he tries to forget the inning in postseason games so he can concentrate solely on the next pitch.Its just kind of: Im out there until Im not out there any longer.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.For Hinch, the point came after seven innings.Verlander would not have lasted much longer anyway, he said, so it was better to pull him between innings.He would not send a tiring stalwart back to the mound to face the Yankees with the season on the line, as a doomed Grady Little did with Bostons Pedro Martinez in Game 7 of the 2003 A.L.C.S.Brad Peacock came in, Hinch said, because he liked the way his slider and riding fastball would play against the top of the Yankees order.But after Brett Gardner flied out, Aaron Judge clobbered a fastball to the train tracks high above deep left-center.I tried to challenge Judge and just lost he put a pretty good swing on it, Peacock said, laughing.A solos not gonna kill us there.Just kept my confidence and made some pitches.With the lead cut to 3-1 and Didi Gregorius and Gary Sanchez coming up, the Yankees had a chance to follow the example of the Phillies, the Mets and the Royals.But Peacock fought back after three balls to Gregorius, inducing a flyout, and he froze Sanchez with a full-count, two-seam fastball that ran back over the plate for strike three.Hinch said he had decided to use closer Ken Giles for only one inning, after the Yankees bruised Giles in the eighth for a comeback win in Game 4.Even after the Astros extended their lead off David Robertson, Hinch stayed with Giles, turning to his best option to get the series to Game 7.Now it is here, with perhaps a full staff of Astros pitchers ready to follow starter Charlie Morton.Expect bullpen seating to be at a premium, with Dallas Keuchel, Lance McCullers Jr. and perhaps even Verlander hes superhuman, Hinch said available on short rest.If things get crazy, Im your man, Keuchel said, smiling.Ill be good; its just my arm.Verlander said he would talk with Hinch on Saturday and be honest about what he could offer.The fact that he will even be considered, of course, underscores how erratic the Astros relievers can be.Fridays example aside, history offers a grim forecast for Houston.Then again, Game 7 is not always kind to the Yankees, either.The last time they played one, in 2004, they let a pennant and a once-insurmountable three-games-to-none lead slip away to the rival Red Sox.Nothing on Saturday could be as crushing as that.
Astros, Their Backs to the Wall, Hold Off the Yankees and Force Game 7:::::But it was Springers catch that kept the Yankees at bay, assuring that there will be one more game to determine who will play the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.The Yankees will start C. C. Sabathia in Saturdays Game 7, and the Astros will counter with Charlie Morton.It will be the fifth time the Yankees have faced elimination in the 2017 postseason.If the Yankees are buoyed by the presence of Sabathia, an unflappable veteran who won the decisive fifth game of their division series at Cleveland, it is also worth remembering that whichever team has been at home in this A.L.C.S.has played with verve and confidence.While the Astros looked frazzled at Yankee Stadium, their defense has stood out in all three games here.In addition to Springers catch and a slick early double play started by shortstop Carlos Correa on Friday night, there was the Game 1 gem turned in by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who threw out Greg Bird at the plate.And there was the Game 2 rat-tat-tat relay from right fielder Josh Reddick to Correa to third baseman Alex Bregman that cut down Brett Gardner at third.The Yankees, whose only run on Friday came on Aaron Judges long homer off reliever Brad Peacock in the eighth inning, have scored just once in each of their three losses here.For the first time in this series, the Astros unleashed the offense that led Major League Baseball in runs in the regular season.Jose Altuve snapped out of an 0-for-12 slump by ripping a two-out, two-run bases-loaded single in the fifth that put the Yankees in a 3-0 hole.Then he hit a curveball off his shoe tops for a solo homer in the eighth against David Robertson, who ended up being pounded for four runs without retiring a batter.I threw it exactly where I wanted to, and he hit it out of the park, Robertson said.Didnt get the job done today.It would have been nice to get a 1-2-3 inning and give us a chance to come back in the ninth, but I went out there and got my butt kicked.Photo The Astros, to that point, had been carried by Verlander, who won a postseason elimination game for the fourth time in his career.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Verlander has been rejuvenated by his Aug. 31 trade from Detroit, which came minutes before the deadline for him to be eligible for the postseason.He has won all eight starts in an Astros uniform as well as gaining a victory in a relief appearance in the division-series clincher against the Red Sox and has compiled a 1.05 earned run average.Few pitchers have his playoff rsum, which includes a pair of Game 5 shutouts of the Oakland Athletics and three wins over the Yankees.I consider him to have a bionic arm, Hinch said before Game 6.Hes never fatigued.Whatever that pitch count, I hope he gets as many outs as he can.The Yankees had few hard-hit balls in Game 6, rarely getting on top of Verlanders four-seam fastballs up in the strike zone, where contact often resulted in towering, but nonthreatening, fly balls.He allowed five hits all singles and one walk, striking out eight.The Astros, who had not scored in 15 innings, broke through in the fifth on a run-scoring double by the former Yankee Brian McCann his first hit of the series and the single by Altuve, who jumped on a first-pitch slider from Luis Severino.Photo The decision to allow Severino to face Altuve, with Chad Green warming up in the bullpen and with Severino having issued three walks in the inning, was a second-guessers delight.When asked before the game about the depth of his well-rested bullpen, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said: Believe me, its been really nice to have.I know that we have weapons down there.We approach games that we went and got those weapons to win games with those weapons, and Im not afraid to go with them.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That bullpen will not be so fresh or fearsome come Saturday night.Green will be unavailable after throwing 38 pitches in two and one-third scoreless innings in Game 6, and Robertson was assailed in his brief time on the mound.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If there was a consolation for the Yankees, it was that they made Astros closer Ken Giles expend himself in the ninth, throwing 23 pitches.The Yankees best chances came late against Verlander.With runners at first and second and two out in the sixth, Gary Sanchez took three borderline pitches for balls to find himself in a favorable 3-0 count.But Sanchez took a checked swing on the next pitch, a slider, and tapped a slow roller to shortstop that Correa handled easily.The Yankees threatened again in the seventh when Verlander walked Bird and nicked Starlin Castro with a pitch that, after a video review, sent him to first and Bird to second.With the tying run at the plate and no one out, Verlander struck out Hicks at the end of a tense 10-pitch at-bat to bring up Frazier.Photo Frazier had struck out in his previous at-bat, feebly swinging at a curveball a pitch Verlander rarely throws.When Verlander threw it again in the seventh, on the first pitch of the at-bat, Frazier was ready, but he just missed, fouling it straight back.Frazier was then ready for the fastball, which he drove to center field.I know our dimensions out there, I know how much space I have and how much time I have before I hit the wall, Springer said.I knew I had a good shot at it.Verlander escaped the inning when he retired Headley, who had seven hits in his last nine at-bats, on a grounder to second.When the out was recorded, Verlander roared and pumped his fists, then waited along with Altuve and Correa to high-five Springer as he came off the field.Hes a free safety playing baseball, McCann said.Fraziers shoulders slumped as he reached first base.I thought I hit it out, he said.It was one of those balls where I thought I had it, where I thought I tied the game.Instead, it is the series that is tied.Frazier acknowledged that he might not sleep well on Friday night, and he had two reasons to toss and turn: the excitement of what lies ahead on Saturday night and the frustration of what he had just endured.
Best Supporting Player? It Has to Be the Dodgers Enrique Hernandez:::::Hernandez, 26, hit a measly .215 in the 2017 regular season, along with a career-high 11 home runs.For his career, he is just a .236 hitter.But his value comes from his athleticism and ability to plug the holes in the lineup that will inevitably arise over the course of a marathon baseball season.This year alone, Hernandez has played all three outfield spots, plus every infield spot, except catcher and adequately, too.He has dressed in a banana suit during games to bring levity to his teammates.And despite his overall batting average this season, he did hit .270 with 10 home runs against left-handers, making him particularly useful when the Dodgers want to load up with right-handed batters.The Dodgers acquired Hernandez in a seven-player deal with the Miami Marlins in December 2014 that was headlined by Dee Gordon, who had been an All-Star second baseman with the Dodgers.Fast forward three years and the deal has netted numerous dividends for the Dodgers.Catcher Austin Barnes, who was part of the trade, started most of the Dodgers games this postseason, and there is Hernandez, who had previously shown an ability to hit in the postseason, but nothing like what he came up with on Thursday, in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series.Photo In hitting three home runs in a postseason game, Hernandez joined a distinguished list of 10 players that includes Jose Altuve, Albert Pujols, Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, who did it twice.Adam Kennedy of the Anaheim Angels achieved the feat in Game 5 of the A.L.C.S.in 2002, the last time a Southern California team reached and won the World Series.Hes a guy with a ton of talent, Zaidi said of Hernandez.Hes a baseball player first and comedian second, so hopefully that will be the order going forward.During a television interview after Thursdays onslaught, Hernandez said he joked before the game that he would forgo trying to simply make contact and try to hit home runs.He saw two pitches combined in his first two at-bats on Thursday and produced a solo home run and a grand slam.He added a two-run homer in the ninth inning.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I hit more homers in the game than I did in B.P., Hernandez said, referring to pregame batting practice.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hernandez said he remembered little in the moments right after the home runs because of the emotions coursing through him.But he said his top priority after the game was to hug his father, who went through a bout with cancer last year and was in attendance on Thursday night.I didnt really care about anything else, he said.If it wasnt for him, I wouldnt be here.He sacrificed a lot throughout my life for me to be here right now.During the game, Hernandez said, he also thought of his paternal grandfather, who passed away last month, and his native island, Puerto Rico, which was recently devastated by Hurricane Maria.He said the hurricane hit the day after he attended his grandfathers funeral on the island.People back home are going through some really bad times, said Hernandez, who played for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic in March.And for me to be able to do this on a stage like this and give the people back home something to smile about for at least a little bit is something that I truly cant put into words and it means the world to me.Hernandez has raised money for relief efforts on the island by selling T-shirts and setting up an online campaign started with his fiance last month.Before the game, the amount pledged was around $70,000.But after the best game of Hernandezs career, it soared above the $100,000 goal.
For the Yankees, the Wild Card Has a Whole New Meaning:::::And if the Yankees should go on to win the whole thing, they would be the seventh wild-card team to do so.The Marlins managed that feat twice, in 1997 and 2003.The Red Sox did it in 2004, an outcome best forgotten by New Yorkers since it was made possible only by a historic comeback against the Yankees in the A.L.C.S.The victory parades in those triumphant wild-card cities, it should be noted, were no less enthusiastic than those after 110-win seasons led to championships.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There is also this to consider: The Yankees won their 2017 season series against Boston, 11-8, and there was a real sense in September that they might have taken the division if time hadnt run out on them.The postseason surge by the Yankees is made all the more delightful by the notion that this group of players is young, exciting and bound to be contending for years to come.Until now, the Yankees performance in the postseason has traditionally correlated with their placement in the regular season.Whenever they qualified as the wild card, they bowed out, and almost always early.They lost in 1995 to Seattle; in 1997 to Cleveland; in 2007 to Cleveland; in 2010 to Texas; and in 2015 to the Astros.They have never come this close to reaching the Series as a wild-card entrant, and their achievement is even more intriguing considering how differently they have played this year at home and on the road.During the regular season, the Yankees owned the best home record in the American League, 51-30, and they were the only team with a sub-.500 road mark to reach the playoffs.Sure enough, they are unbeaten at home this postseason, while they have struggled outside the Bronx.One road victory was required this weekend to get to the Series; at least one would be required in the Series for the Yankees to end up the champions.The only thing that matters now is one win against the Astros and four wins against the Dodgers, Chalpin said.I dont think any wild-card team that made it this far ever said, This is awesome, but I just wish wed won the division.You wont hear that this October from the Yankees, or from their fans.In the Bronx, second-best never felt so good.
Creighton Hale, 93, Inventor of Little League Helmet, Dies:::::In addition to being able to withstand pitches thrown at high speeds, the helmet had a flap on each side designed to protect the temples, ears and cheekbones.Major League Baseball had experimented with helmets before Mr. Hales work.When he formally introduced his Little League helmet in 1958 at the Little League Congress in Chicago, he staged a demonstration of a helmet that was being used in major league games.When his cannon unleashed a 95-mile-an-hour fastball, the helmet split from top to bottom.Photo Mr. Hales dual-earflap helmet became mandatory for Little League batters and runners in 1961.At its World Series that year, he later recalled, a boy was struck in the helmet by a pitch and fell to the ground.After being examined by a doctor, he hopped up and ran to first base, Mr. Hale recounted in More Than a Bat and a Ball: My 60 Years at Little League, an autobiography, written with Mary Ellen Gardner, that was published by Little League Baseball in 2015.No one wants to see a child in peril, but for me that was the ultimate field test and outcome.Mr. Hale also invented a catchers helmet with a mask attached to it and a chest protector that guards the catchers throat.He worked with Alcoa Aluminium and other companies to develop aluminum bats as a cost-effective alternative to wooden bats, which often shattered and had to be replaced.Aluminum bats became controversial for the speed with which balls leave them, compared with that of wooden bats, and for the injuries that have been caused by them.Aluminum bats and others made of composite materials are used at youth, high school and college levels.Little League bats are moving toward meeting a standard in which they would perform like wooden ones.In the 1970s Mr. Hale was chairman of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences that developed a new military helmet made of Kevlar.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Creighton J. Hale was born on Feb. 18, 1924, in Hardy, Neb.(He was given a middle initial but not a middle name.)His father, Russell, was a farmer, teacher and school superintendent.His mother, the former Anita Fay Farthing, was a teacher and homemaker.As a boy, Mr. Hale played baseball but was more interested in boxing, football (he wore a leather helmet), basketball and track.He was so competitive, he wrote, that he entered a state typewriting speed competition as a teenager and won the 15-minute contest.After serving in the Navy, he graduated from Colgate University in upstate New York, then earned a masters in physiology at Springfield College in Massachusetts, where he taught for five years and worked on military research, including testing a more ergonomic infantry pack.He received a doctorate in the physiology of muscular activity from New York University.Photo While at Springfield, he was asked by Branch Rickey, the renowned Brooklyn Dodgers executive who by then had become the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, to develop a way to measure a players skills and predict his performance.(The tests he devised did not provide many answers.)The Little League was a boys-only organization when Mr. Hale became its executive vice president in 1971.A case brought to the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights by the National Organization for Women changed that; a hearing officer ruled in 1973 that the prohibition against female players violated state and federal anti-discrimination laws.Mr. Hale testified at the hearing that studies showed that the bones of females were weaker than those of males.Girls began playing in the Little League in 1975 after the leagues charter was amended.Stephen D. Keener, the Little Leagues president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that while Mr. Hale defended the Little League position in the early 1970s that girls were not permitted to play, he would later say, If I knew then what I know now, we were defending the indefensible.Mr. Hale became president of the Little League in 1973 and its chief executive 10 years later.He retired in 1994.Advertisement Continue reading the main story During his tenure, Little League greatly expanded around the world.When I started here in 1980, we were in 18 or 19 countries, and were in 84 countries now, said Mr.Keener, who succeeded Mr. Hale.Thats largely due to his commitment to grow the game globally.In addition to his son, Mr. Hale is survived by his wife, the former Beverly Gray, who worked at Little League for 50 years; his daughter, Kathy Dumanis; 10 grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; and his brother, Russell.Mr. Hales first marriage, to the former Rita Hugo, ended in divorce.Little League is not a baseball program, its a leadership program, Mr. Hale told The Sioux City Journal in 1992.We use baseball as a vehicle to do other things.Theres no place for 2.6 million kids on major league teams.
Dusty Baker Is Out as Nationals Manager After Two Seasons:::::This was a pure baseball decision, General Manager Mike Rizzo told reporters.Again, our goal is to win a world championship.This has nothing to do with negotiations or dollars.Rizzo told reporters he informed Baker, who flew home to California from Washington the day before, of the news by phone on Friday morning.All season, Rizzo said publicly that he expected to complete a contract extension with Baker.Baker, too, stated publicly that he wanted to return, but had hinted at frustration over a lack of contract-extension negotiations and lower pay, and had heard of issues with past managers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Nationals owners are known to drive a hard bargain with managers.Jim Riggleman quit midway through the 2011 season over the absence of a contract extension.Davey Johnson was pushed out of the position after 2013.The Nationals initial offer and negotiation tactics unsettled Bud Black before the 2016 season.After failed talks with Black, the Nationals hired Baker, who wanted to return to baseball after two years away.Baker replaced Matt Williams, a rookie manager who won a division title in 2014 but was dismissed a year later after managerial blunders in the playoffs and communication issues with players.Baker, who has managed for 22 seasons, is 14th on the career list with 1,863 wins.Although occasionally criticized for his loyalty to veterans and clumsy in-game decisions, Baker is well known and respected for his people skills, and was able to manage the many star personalities in the Nationals clubhouse.While some of Bakers decisions backfired in the playoffs, the Nationals sputtered as a whole.More talented than the Cubs this year, the Nationals had perhaps their best chance of advancing for the first time in the playoffs.But when they had a lead in the fifth inning of Game 5, it was some of their veterans pitcher Max Scherzer, outfielder Jayson Werth and catcher Matt Wieters who helped blow the lead.Our expectations have grown to the fact that winning regular-season games and winning divisions are not enough, Rizzo told reporters.Baker joins John Farrell, who was dispatched by the Boston Red Sox this October after they lost to the Houston Astros in the first round of the playoffs.Farrell inherited the team in 2013, and it won the World Series that season.The Red Sox won American League East division titles in 2016 and 2017, but were bounced in the first round of the playoffs each time.
The Kershaw Collection: 3 Cy Youngs, an M.V.P. and Now, a World Series:::::The Dodgers had not won, so to Kershaw, nothing else mattered.He was 7 months old when they last won a title, in 1988.Drafted in the first round out of high school in 2006, Kershaw achieved so much, so soon, that winning his own ring has stood as the only line unwritten on a future plaque in Cooperstown.That is how others saw it, and that is how Kershaw saw it, too.Would something be missing if he never got this chance?Thats a tough question, Kershaw said late Thursday at an interview podium beside his 2-year-old daughter, Cali Ann.I think, at the end of the day yeah.Winning the World Series is really all that we play this game for.All the individual stuff is great, but I just want to win a World Series.If we win, I might retire.I might just call it a career.He was joking, of course, but a championship would be a fitting way to end a decade of dominance.For a pitcher of his pedigree, it is overdue.Kershaw is 144-64 with a 2.36 earned run average and three Cy Young Awards.Only eight others have won the award at least three times: Clemens, Randy Johnson, Steve Carlton, Greg Maddux, Sandy Koufax, Pedro Martinez, Jim Palmer and Tom Seaver.All have earned a championship ring and pitched at least three games in the World Series.No wonder, then, that Kershaw ranked Thursdays victory with getting married and having children as one of the best days of his life.Its just special; its the only way to say it, Kershaw said.I couldnt imagine being part of something this great.These guys put me in a great spot, to get on that mound for this win tonight.I cant explain it right now.Im getting to go to the World Series.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Andre Ethier, the veteran Dodgers outfielder, said he brags to friends that he may be the only one with the pitching coach, Rick Honeycutt to have witnessed nearly all of Kershaws starts.Ethier, 35, was already on the team when Kershaw was drafted.He tried to ignore the hype, but Kershaw has far exceeded it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I heard about this young guy when he was in the minor leagues coming up, this great phenom O.K., whatever, Ethier said.He comes up and establishes himself as what he is.It really is an honor to be on the same team as him and to take a step back and realize what hes done in his career, how dominant hes been, and at the same time how personable and humble he is toward everyone on this team.If Kershaw had a flaw, it seemed to be October.He is 6-7 with a 4.40 E.R.A.in the postseason, but five starts have come on short rest.At other times, a shaky bullpen has led the Dodgers to leave in Kershaw too long.He has never quite crafted a defining postseason moment that gives a pitcher a halo forever.Yet through it all, Ellis said, there was never a conversation about whether Kershaw was willing to pitch, to grind past the soreness and find a way through.He considered it part of his job as an ace, and admired how Clemens, Pettitte and others had done so.This year has been different, partly by necessity; Kershaw missed nearly six weeks with a back injury in July and August.But with Rich Hill, Yu Darvish and Alex Wood stabilizing the rotation, and Kenta Maeda, Brandon Morrow and others locking down the late innings to set up the closer Kenley Jansen, the Dodgers are better equipped to help Kershaw be his best.All the naysayers want to pull out every negative that they can, said Honeycutt, the pitching coach since 2006.He didnt have the supporting cast in the other years the other starters, the bullpen.This is by far the deepest staff, by far the best group to go deep, to get to the World Series, that the Dodgers have had since Ive been here.Weve always been good, but weve always been short.The Dodgers have now won eight of Kershaws last nine playoff appearances, and teams have learned that there is really just one way to score off him.In 17 innings this postseason, he has given up seven runs on homers, and no other runs.In the regular season, he allowed 23 homers, a career high.The secrets are gone as far as what the league is doing against him, said Ellis, who played for Miami this season.You see the jump in home runs against him because teams understand youre not going to get multiple hits against him in an inning.Hes got too many strikeout weapons.Youve got to try to outslug this guy thats the only way you can beat him but hes now learning how to go away from that slug, although, Ellis added, thats sometimes tough to do on the fly.Kershaws fastball averages about 93 miles an hour, his rainbow curveball brings gasps of awe from fans, and his slider perfected in one bullpen session before a game at Wrigley in 2009 is his best wipeout pitch.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Thursday, though, no teammates mentioned a particular pitch when asked what stands out most about Kershaw.One after another, they cited his work between starts, his relentless preparation and drive.Justin Turner, the series co-most valuable player with Chris Taylor, said he had never seen anyone train as tirelessly as Kershaw.Everybodys like, Whats the secret?Hill said.Its work.Thats what it is.And when he goes out there and pitches, he has such a passion for baseball.When you have a passion for something, its unstoppable.Nothing this season has stopped Kershaw and the Dodgers.Just one stage remains, the one he has wanted all his life.

Girardi out as Yankees manager:::::(Reuters) - Joe Girardis tenure with the New York Yankees, who came within one win of a World Series berth this year, has come to an end after the Major League Baseball team said on Thursday he would not return as manager in 2018.Oct 21, 2017; Houston, TX, USA; New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi (28) speaks to media before game seven of the 2017 ALCS playoff baseball series against the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park.Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports Girardi, who won a World Series title in 2009 and guided the Yankees to the post-season in six of his 10 seasons as manager, had just concluded a four-year, $16 million contract with the storied ball club.I want to thank Joe for his 10 years of hard work and service to this organization, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said in a statement.Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, and weve decided to pursue alternatives for the managerial position.The Yankees did not name a replacement.Girardis exit is the latest high-profile managerial change announced during the MLB postseason and follows similar moves by the Yankees arch-rival Boston Red Sox, who fired John Farrell, and Washington Nationals, who cut Dusty Baker loose.After managing the Florida Marlins for one season in 2006, Girardi took over the Yankees in 2008 and in his second season with the club led them to their 27th World Series title.Girardi compiled a 910-710 record while at the helm of one of baseballs most storied franchises and his win total ranks sixth in Yankees history.He also won three championships with the Yankees as a player and is one of three individuals in franchise history to play for and manage a Yankees World Championship team.While the 53-year-old did lead the Yankees on an unexpectedly deep playoff run, his post-season was marred by a managerial mistake during a Game Two loss to the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series.After that game, Girardi accepted responsibility for not challenging a call that would have ended an inning with his team up five runs rather than load the bases and lead to the Yankees biggest blown lead in a playoff game since 2002.After the Yankees were eliminated from the post-season by Houston, Girardi said he planned to sit down with his family to discuss their future.Girardi, in a separate statement, said that he appreciated the organization having given him the opportunity to lead the team for the last decade.With a heavy heart, I come to you because the Yankees have decided not to bring me back, said Girardi.I would like to thank the players for the relationships that we have fostered over the last 10 years but most important, how hard they played every day.Finally, Id like to thank the fans for their great support as a player, coach and manager, and the lasting memories of their passion and excitement during the playoff games, especially the final six games, which will remain in my heart forever.

Venus stuns Muguruza to advance at WTA Finals:::::SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Venus Williams gained revenge for her Wimbledon final defeat by Garbine Muguruza when the American advanced to the last four of the WTA Finals with a gutsy 7-5 6-4 victory over the Spanish world number two on Thursday.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 26, 2017 USA's Venus Williams celebrates winning her group stage match against Spain's Garbine Muguruza.REUTERS/Jeremy Lee Both players knew a win would secure a passage to the semi-finals as they held identical 1-1 records in White Group play at the season-ending event but the 37-year-old was stronger on the key points and moved brilliantly around the court to progress.Muguruza had brushed aside Williams to claim her second grand slam title in July but any hopes she had of repeating the feat were snuffed out by a resolute opponent, who simply refused to buckle in the tense Singapore Indoor Stadium encounter.I played an amazing opponent who has had an amazing year so I was so happy to win the last point, Williams said in a courtside interview.The victory enabled Williams, who won this event in 2008, to advance along with pool winner Karolina Pliskova, who won her first two matches but ended round-robin play with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko earlier on Thursday.The winner-takes-all showdown started with Williams looking to dictate terms, pushing Muguruza around the court and attacking her second serve as the Spaniard countered by pushing the American back with her deep groundstrokes.The 37-year-old continued to pick away at the Muguruza serve but an ace and a string of big forehand winners helped stave off the early threat as both combatants took the fight to each other in a high-class encounter.The pair traded service breaks before Muguruza failed to hold on and send the opener into a tiebreak when Williams converted her third set point after the back-peddling Spaniard dumped a forehand into the net.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 26, 2017 USA's Venus Williams in action during her group stage match against Spain's Garbine Muguruza.REUTERS/Edgar Su OSTAPENKO VICTORIOUS Muguruzas repeated attempts to pull clear in the second were denied by Williams on every occasion with the American twice battling back from behind to edge 5-4 ahead with her strongest service game of the set.The American made a concerted push for victory in the 10th game and sealed a memorable victory after an hour and 41 minutes when Muguruza sent another feeble forehand into the net.Slideshow (6 Images) Its not easy out here, you have to play every point well or you end up losing the game.I had some great coaching going into my match and I hope I can win some more, Williams added.Earlier, Ostapenko ended her maiden WTA Finals campaign on a winning note with a surprisingly easy victory over a subdued Pliskova, the Latvian saving her best until last after she was eliminated earlier in the week.World number three Pliskova won her opening two matches against Williams and Muguruza to book a semi-final berth but the Czech was out-gunned by an inspired French Open champion in 66 minutes.Ostapenko had battled hard in her opening matches to no avail, especially in a grueling three-set loss to Williams, but she served brilliantly against Pliskova and found the corners with her booming forehand to end her season with a win.Yes, I lost my earlier two matches but its my first time here and I am just happy to finish my season here, in the top eight, especially with a win at the end, Ostapenko said.Caroline Wozniacki has already advanced from the Red Group with one round of matches remaining, while Simona Halep, Caroline Garcia and Elina Svitolina can all still qualify alongside the Dane when play concludes in that pool on Friday.
Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.

Dodgers Advance to World Series for 1st Time Since 1988, After Routing Cubs, 11-1, in Game 5 of NLCS:::::Check out the behind the scenes footage including interviews with Cody Bellinger and Yasiel Puig as the Los Angeles Dodgers Advance to their first World Series since 1988.(Published Friday, Oct. 20, 2017) The iconic words of Vin Scully were first spoken 29 years ago, the last time the Los Angeles Dodgers were in the World Series: "In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened."After nearly three decades, the wait is finally over the Dodgers are going back to the World Series.Enrique Hernandez hit three home runs, including a grand slam, as the Dodgers punched their ticket to the Fall Classic, defeating the Chicago Cubs, 11-1, in Game 5 of the NLCS on Thursday night at Wrigley Field.In 1988, the last time the Dodgers went to the World Series, Clayton Kershaw was just seven months old.Twenty-nine years later, he was on the mound when they won the pennant."We've heard 1988 for so long in L.A., it feels good to say that we're getting to go to the World Series in 2017," Kershaw said after the victory."With four more wins, hopefully we get to bring one home."Top Sports Photos: World Series 2017 Kershaw (2-0), threw six innings, allowing just one run on three hits with one walk and five strikeouts in the third potential-clinching start in his postseason career.In those games, the three-time NL Cy Young Award winner is a perfect 3-0 when he takes the mound with a chance to advance his team to the next round."To get to be on the mound tonight and get to be going to the World Series on the same night, it's a special thing," Kershaw said."Who knows how many times I'm going to get to go to the World Series.I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there.So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted."Since 2013, Kershaw had only gotten one run of support in four total starts in the NLCS over the course of his career.In his only two starts in 2017, he got 16 runs of support."That's a testament to this team and what we stand for," Kershaw said of the support from the offense."As a starting pitcher, when you get seven runs, your job is to get them back in the dugout as fast as possible."In order to end the drought, the Dodgers needed to go through the Cubs, the reigning World Series Champions, a team that slayed their own demons only one year prior.Los Angeles wasted little time dispatching the champs.After a nine-pitch lead-off walk to Chris Taylor to start the game, Cody Bellinger roped a double down the right field line, giving the Dodgers a 1-0 lead."What [Taylor] has done for our lineup all year long, settling into the lead-off spot, getting on base, hitting balls over the fence.He's a dynamic player and table-setter," said teammate Justin Turner, who was named Co-MVP of the NLCS along with Taylor."When he goes, we usually go as a team.I think you guys saw that here in the postseason."One inning later, Hernandez started off the second inning swinging, as he jumped all over a first-pitch fastball from Cubs' starter Jose Quintana, hitting it to straightaway center for a solo home run.Hernandez wasn't finished.After an RBI single from Turner gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead, Quintana loaded the bases before leaving the game for Hector Rondon.Once again, the Puerto Rican was swinging on the first pitch, and this time, Hernandez sent a slider into the basket in right-center for a grand slam home run."I blacked out," Hernandez said of the fourth grand slam ever hit in Dodgers' postseason history."I can't even describe it you know.I was thinking the entire game, 'Man, this is unbelievable.'"Hernandez not only sent the Dodgers to the World Series with his bat, he also became the first Dodger since Adrian Gonzalez in 2013 to hit multiple homers in a postseason game."I don't remember much of the game," Hernandez admitted."The whole game is a blur.I remember the first two, but I definitely don't remember the last one.It's awesome!"As Wrigley Field fell silent as the shrouded dead, one voice could be heard that of Hernandez's father, Enrique Hernandez Sr., one year removed from a life-threatening battle with cancer, fresh off an evacuation from his homeland because of Hurricane Maria.Despite it all, he stood and cheered.He just watched his son have the game of his life, in the biggest moment of his career."Honestly, I couldn't wait for this game to end so I could give my dad a big old hug," Hernandez said as he fought back tears."Everything that he's been through the last year or so, and everything he went through for me to be here on this stage right now means the world to me."Quintana (0-1) lasted only two innings, surrendering six runs on six hits with one walk and one strikeout in his fourth start of the postseason with the Cubs."Quintana was a great addition," said Cubs manager Joe Maddon after the game."[The Dodgers] know what it feels like coming off last year, we were celebrating versus them in this exact same spot."John Lackey entered the game in the fourth inning for the Cubs and served up a two-run double to Logan Forsythe that gave Los Angeles a 9-0 lead.The two innings of relief may have been the last ever seen of Lackey as the 38-year-old's contract is up at the end of the season.He could be leaning toward retirement at the end of the year."John and I go way back," Maddon said."John and I were together with the Angels in the 2002 World Series team.So it's really special for me with John.Hopefully it's not his last year, but if it is, having that chance to be with him in that moment is pretty special for me."Kris Bryant hit his first home run of the postseason in the bottom of the fourth, a laser beam off Kershaw over the scoreboard in left field, for the Cubs' only run of the game.The Cubs became the first team in Major League history to score all of their runs as home runs in a series that went at least five games."Every year is different," Maddon said on why his offense wasn't able to replicate the same success as last year."We have all these incredible numbers from last year, but every year is different."Just for good measure, Hernandez hit his third home run of the game off Mike Montgomery in the top of ninth, to put the exclamation point on his historical night."I may have had a great game, but this is not about me, this is about this team," Hernandez said, as his teammates celebrated around him in the winning locker room."Tonight it was me, but every night its someone different coming up big for us.Luckily enough, tonight it was me."Hernandez is just the ninth player in MLB history to have three homers in a postseason game, joining like the likes of Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert Pujols.Hernandez finished the game three-for-four with three home runs and a league championship record seven RBIs.To put that in perspective, the Cubs scored eight runs in the entire series."I blacked out and four hours later I had three homers and seven RBI," Hernandez said."There's a very big God up there that blessed me tonight, and grandpa, I appreciate it because I know you had something to do with it."Earlier in the season, Hernandez lost his grandfather and left the team to fly to Puerto Rico to be with his family."Kik told me before the game, 'Hey, I've got your back tonight,'" Kershaw said."He said that before I even went out and took the mound.Then he goes and hits three home runs."Kenta Maeda, Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen pitched the final three innings of the game as the Dodgers bullpen set an NLCS record with 17 scoreless innings of relief."We wanted the defending champs," Jansen said after the game."We know how much it sucks to lose here and see the fans enjoy it in front of us.We wanted to make a statement.We wanted to come here and we wanted to win in front of them.It's not over yet.Hopefully, we can bring the championship back home."The Dodgers' pen has a scoreless innings streak of 23, a new MLB postseason record, surpassing the 1977 New York Yankees.However, the rest of the game was a mere formality as both teams went through the motions before the Dodgers popped champagne aged 29 years in the visiting clubhouse.The victory earned the Dodgers their 22nd National League pennant, the second most in league history behind only their rivals, the Giants, who have 23.Nearly one year ago, the Cubs clinched their first World Series berth since 1945 against these same Dodgers.That night, as the mob of adoring fans celebrated in Wrigleyville, the Dodgers team buses were unable to leave, so the players had to wait over two hours in the visiting locker room.During that time, the Dodgers sat and stewed, thinking about this exact moment that could occur one year later, and how great it would be to beat the Cubs on their own field to advance to the World Series.Revenge is, indeed, sweet.Up Next: The Dodgers advance to the World Series, awaiting either the Houston Astros or New York Yankees for Game 1 at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday, Oct. 24.

Full Recovery Expected for Hayward After Injury in Celtics Debut:::::Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said he expects Gordon Hayward to make a full recovery from the gruesome injury he suffered in Tuesday's season opener.(Published Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017) The Boston Celtics said Gordon Hayward is expected to make a "full recovery" after undergoing successful surgery on Wednesday night.The team announced Thursday afternoon that Hayward underwent "successful bony and ligamentous stabilization surgery for the fracture dislocation of his left ankle" sustained in Tuesday night's season opener.Hayward's father tweeted Thursday morning the surgery was 'a big success,' and his wife Robyn posted her own message on social media saying "He did great with surgery!So now we are starting the recovery process."His agent, Mark Bartelstein, added that the surgery "went really well."No timetable has been set for his return, but Bartelstein told ESPN it remains unlikely the 27-year-old forward will return this season.The Celtics player had arrived at New England Baptist Hospital on Wednesday after flying in from Cleveland, where he and former Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving played their first game in Celtics green.Hayward came down awkwardly after an alley-oop pass in the first quarter, dislocating his left ankle and fracturing his leg.In a video message on the Celtics' Twitter page Wednesday, Hayward spoke to his fans from his hospital bed."Wanted to say thank you to everyone whose had me in their thoughts and prayers," he said."I'm gonna be alright."Hurting me that I can't be there for the home opener," Hayward went on to say in his video tweet."I want nothing more than to be with my teammates and to walk out on that floor tonight.But I'll be supporting you guys from here and wishing you the best of luck."While the team initially tweeted that Hayward had been diagnosed with a broken ankle, Stevens said in a press conference Wednesday that hospital tests had confirmed his actual injuries."He put a lot of effort into trying to start his career out well in Boston, but this is a setback," Stevens added.Despite the setback, the coach said he believes Hayward will be back to full health."We are expecting a full recovery," he said."We know there are going to be a lot of tough days ahead on that recovery, but at the same time, I think, hopefully, he'll improve day to day."Stevens coached Hayward at Butler University.After spending the first seven seasons of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz, Hayward signed a four-year, $128 million contract to play for his college coach in Boston.As Hayward lay on the court Tuesday night, the Quicken Loans Arena fell silent, with Celtics and Cavs players alike showing their concern.The crowds erupted in applause when he was carried off the floor on a stretcher.The following day, athletes and fans have taken to social media to support Hayward."Thanks for all the prayers for Gordon and our family," Hayward's wife, Robyn, tweeted Wednesday."It sucks, but this is what happens."Robyn Hayward's tweet included a quote, reading, "When everything seems like it's falling apart that's when God is putting things together just the way he wants it."In their opener, the Celtics came back from a 16-point halftime deficit and jockeyed with Cleveland for the lead in the fourth quarter.The Cavs won their first game 102-99.Wednesday night, the Celtics played their home opener without Hayward against the Milwaukee Bucks, but it was clear Hayward was on the mind of everyone.Love for the forward was evident in every corner of TD Garden, as fans who miss him signed a giant "get well soon" banner for him, gave him a standing ovation, and even chanted his name.The Bucks beat the Celtics 108100.

Olympic Gold Medalist Details Sexual Abuse by Team Doctor:::::McKayla Maroney, a gold medalist and former Olympic gymnast, went public with her account of sexual assault by former US Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar on Twitter.(Published Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017) Two-time Olympic medalist McKayla Maroney says she was molested for years by a former USA Gymnastics team doctor, abuse she said started in her early teens and continued for the rest of her competitive career.Maroney posted a lengthy statement on Twitter early Wednesday that described the allegations of abuse against Dr. Larry Nassar, who spent three decades working with athletes at USA Gymnastics but now is in jail in Michigan awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography.Nassar also is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges and has been sued by more than 125 women alleging abuse.Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and the dozens of civil suits filed in Michigan are currently in mediation.Maroney, now 21, says the abuse began while attending a U.S. National team training camp at the Karolyi Ranch in the Sam Houston Forest north of Houston, Texas.Maroney was 13 at the time and wrote that Nassar told her she was receiving "medically necessary treatment he had been performing on patients for over 30 years."Maroney did not detail Nassar's specific actions.Maroney, who won a team gold and an individual silver on vault as part of the "Fierce Five" U.S. women's team at the 2012 Olympics in London, said Nassar continued to give her "treatment" throughout her career.She described Nassar giving her a sleeping pill while the team traveled to Japan for the 2011 world championships.Maroney says Nassar later visited her in her hotel room after the team arrived in Tokyo, where he molested her yet again."I thought I was going to die that night," Maroney wrote.Maroney did not immediately return an interview request from The Associated Press.Attorneys for Nassar had no comment.Maroney says she decided to come forward as part of the "#MeToo" movement on social media that arose in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein."This is happening everywhere," Maroney wrote."Wherever there is a position of power, there is the potential for abuse.I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things I had to endure to get there, were unnecessary and disgusting."Maroney called for change, urging other victims to speak out and demanding organizations "be held accountable for their inappropriate actions and behavior."Maroney is the highest profile gymnast yet to come forward claiming she was abused by Nassar.Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, was part of the initial wave of lawsuits filed against Nassar in 2016.Aly Raisman, who won six medals while serving as the captain of the U.S. women's team in both 2012 and 2016, called for sweeping change at USA Gymnastics in August.USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar in the summer of 2016 following reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country.In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review.The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so.The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport.Part of Stark's mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.USA Gymnastics praised Maroney's strength in a statement on Wednesday, adding it is "outraged and disgusted" by Nassar's alleged conduct."We are strengthening and enhancing our policies and procedures regarding abuse, as well as expanding our educational efforts to increase awareness of signs to watch for and reporting suspicions of abuse, including the obligation to immediately report," USA Gymnastics wrote."USA Gymnastics, its members and community are committed to working together to keep our athletes as safe as possible."The organization had initially agreed to purchase the training facility at the Karolyi Ranch following longtime national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's retirement shortly after the 2016 Olympics ended.The organization has since opted out of that agreement.Steve Penny, longtime president and CEO, resigned in March.A replacement has not been named.The allegations and fallout have reached Capitol Hill.Two different pieces of legislation are in the works that call for greater responsibility for organizations that oversee Olympic sports to immediately report sex-abuse allegations to law enforcement or child-welfare authorities.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein issued a release Wednesday saying she is putting the finishing touches on a bill she is co-sponsoring that would make failure to report sexual abuse a crime."It has become clear that for too long, amateur athletics organizations have shirked their responsibility of protecting young, vulnerable children," Feinstein wrote."That must stop, and it must stop now."Maroney, who lives in California and officially retired in 2015, encouraged others to speak out."Our silence has given the wrong people power for too long," she wrote, "and it's time to take our power back."

Aaron Hernandez Lawyers File Lawsuit Against NFL, Helmet Manufacturer; Patriots No Longer Named:::::Attorneys representing the family of Aaron Hernandez have re-filed their lawsuit against the NFL, removing the Patriots from the complaint.Lawyers for Aaron Hernandez's family have re-filed their lawsuit against the NFL, but the New England Patriots are no longer named in the complaint.The family's lawyers filed the complaint Monday in Norfolk County Superior Court.They said the Patriots have been removed as a defendant, but a separate action involving the team will be filed at a later date.Named in the suit are the NFL and several of its subsidiaries, as well as Riddell, the company that manufactured the official NFL helmet from 1989 to 2013.Hernandez played in the NFL from 2010 to 2012.The suit claims the defendants knew of CTE dating back to the 1960s but intentionally kept that information from Hernandez and other players.The suit accuses them of a "long-running conspiracy" aimed at insulating themselves from litigation and financial responsibility."(Aaron's) decisions with respect to football would have been different had there been no intentional concealment for football-exposure risk," the complaint reads."Defendants' multi-decade-long efforts to justify ignoring these warnings created a time-bomb in Aaron.Defendants did so to perpetuate the industry of football."Attorneys for the Hernandez family initially filed suit last month in federal court after a brain study showed he suffered from a "severe case" of the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy.Experts said it was the most severe case of CTE they had ever seen in someone his age.The suit claimed the team and the league deprived 4-year-old Avielle Hernandez of the companionship of her father.That suit was dropped on Friday because the lawyers said the issues involved belonged in state and not federal court.The NFL has said it will "vigorously" contest the lawsuit, saying it would face "significant legal issues from the start."Riddell said Monday that it is also prepared to defend its reputation."More than 15 years ago, Riddell introduced its first helmets specifically designed to mitigate concussion risk and warnings written to raise concussion awareness and promote medical treatment of concussions," the company argued in a statement."Riddell intends to vigorously and successfully defend its products, its warnings and its reputation from the claims now being made by a handful of plaintiff lawyers."Hernandez had Stage 3 CTE, the second-most severe out of four stages.That level of degeneration is usually found in players with a median death age of 67.Boston University officials who examined his brain said he also had early brain atrophy and perforations in a central membrane.CTE can be caused by repeated head trauma and leads to symptoms like violent mood swings, depression and other cognitive difficulties.The 27-year-old former star tight end killed himself on April 19 in the prison cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts, where he was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.He hanged himself with a bed sheet attached to his cell windows.Hernandez blocked access to his cell from the inside by jamming cardboard into the door tracks, investigators said.They also said there were no signs of a struggle and Hernandez was alone at the time of the hanging.His Bible was found marked with blood at John 3:16, a verse that describes eternal life for those who believe in God.The verse name was also written in blood on the wall and in pen on his forehead.His death came just hours before the Patriots visited the White House to celebrate their latest Super Bowl victory.Soon after his suicide, Hernandez's family decided they wanted his brain to be studied by the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center.State officials originally refused to release the brain because it was part of the ongoing investigation into Hernandez's death, but later agreed to release it after his lawyer accused them of holding the brain illegally.A star for the University of Florida when it won the 2008 title, Hernandez dropped to the fourth round of the NFL draft because of trouble in college that included a failed drug test and a bar fight.His name had also come up in an investigation into a shooting.In three seasons with the Patriots, Hernandez joined Rob Gronkowski to form one of the most potent tight end duos in NFL history.In 2011, his second season, Hernandez caught 79 passes for 910 yards and seven touchdowns to help the team reach the Super Bowl, and he was rewarded with a $40 million contract.But the Patriots released him in 2013, shortly after he was arrested in the killing of Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.Hernandez was convicted and sentenced to life in prison; the conviction was voided because he died before his appeals were exhausted, though that decision is itself being appealed.SUICIDE PREVENTION HELP: The National Suicide Prevention Hotline (1-800-273-8255) is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Astros manager A.J. Hinch calls hotel altercation report 'nonsense':::::HOUSTON -- Astros manager A.J.Hinch denied a published report that he was involved in a heated altercation at the team hotel after Game 1 of the World Series in Los Angeles earlier this week, calling the story "some nonsense'' and "ridiculous.''According to the website TMZ.com, Hinch was sitting in the bar at the team's Pasadena hotel following Houston's 3-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night when some hotel guests arrived on the premises and began "talking trash'' about the Astros.TMZ, citing unnamed sources, said Hinch "snapped'' and began yelling and cursing in the middle of the bar.TMZ cited a witness who said the confrontation turned physical and that police were summoned to address the situation.Hinch denied the content of the report when meeting with reporters during an off-day at Minute Maid Park on Thursday.The Dodgers and Astros, tied at 1-1, will resume the World Series on Friday with Game 3 in Houston."First off, there was no altercation,'' Hinch said."And it's a shame I get asked about some nonsense, some fabrications and some non-stories and I have to respond to it on a national stage.But to reiterate, there was no altercation.That's as far as I'm going to go.It's ridiculous.''When pressed on the details of the TMZ report, Hinch replied, "Fabrications really suck.And I'm not going to address any of it.''A baseball source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the fans at the bar cursed and were disrespectful to women in the Astros' traveling party.The unruly patrons were asked to leave the bar, the source said, and Astros security people called the police after the fans made threats on their way out the door.TMZ said no arrests were made and that police did not file a report of the incident.
Anquan Boldin considering return, Bills tell agent OK to shop him:::::Retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin has expressed interest in playing again and the Buffalo Bills have given his agent permission to explore trades with other teams.?In a letter obtained by ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Bills granted Tom Condon, agent for the 14-year veteran of the NFL, permission to speak with other teams "for the sole purpose of discussing a trade for Anquan."The letter, dated Thursday, mentions Boldin's desire to be in closer proximity to his home in Florida and his family.?Boldin announced on Aug. 20, less than two weeks after signing a one-year deal with the Bills, that he was leaving football to focus on social activism.He told SiriusXM Radio the next day, "Do I feel like I can still play?Of course.My passion for the advocacy work that I do outweighs football at this point, so I'm not coming back to play for a contender or to do anything else.I'm done with the game of football."Boldin told ESPN at the time, "Football has afforded me a platform throughout my career to have a greater impact on my humanitarian work, and at this time, I feel drawn to make the larger fight for human rights a priority.My life's purpose is bigger than football."In their letter granting permission to seek a trade, the Bills noted that Boldin might not make visits, undergo a physical or try out with other teams at this time.The Bills reserved the right to have ultimate say on trade compensation and the designated club.?The trade deadline is Tuesday, so there is a finite window on any talks.Drafted by the Arizona Cardinals, where he played his first seven seasons, Boldin walked away from the game with 1,076 receptions for 13,779 yards and 82 touchdowns.He won a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in the 2012 season.He also played for the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions.Boldin, 37, has spent parts of the past two years on Capitol Hill fighting for criminal justice reform.He has teamed with current Philadelphia Eagle Malcolm Jenkins in trips to Washington to speak with members of Congress, to push a social media campaign for the Clean Slate Act and to help organize a players coalition of approximately 40 players who perform community work on a grassroots level.ESPN's Jim Trotter and Mike Rodak contributed to this report.
Cubs clean house on coaching staff, bring in 2 ex-Red Sox assistants:::::CHICAGO -- The Cubs turned over their coaching staff on Thursday after failing to advance past the National League Championship Series for the second time in three seasons.The Cubs dismissed pitching coach Chris Bosio, hitting coach John Mallee and third base coach Gary Jones.The team hired former Red Sox hitting coach Chili Davis for the same position in Chicago while also bringing in former Red Sox third base coach Brian Butterfield to replace Jones.?Jim Hickey, who worked with as Joe Maddon's pitching coach in Tampa Bay and remained with the Rays after Maddon moved to Chicago, has agreed to join Maddon as the Cubs' new pitching coach, according to multiple reports.Hickey was let go by the Rays after the season."It's about someone else being able to add something different or new," manager Joe Maddon said on a conference call."The guys that are not going to be here next year are fabulous.These are really horrible conversations."The Cubs ranked second in run scoring in the National League but averaged just 2.5 runs per game in the playoffs, which ended in a five-game defeat to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.Maddon cited situational hitting as a problem all season, and the Cubs think they may have addressed it with their new coach."Chili has a good method regarding situations in general," Maddon said."We're just looking for a slightly different voice with a little bit different approach that we feel can augment our hitters moving forward."The Cubs were near the bottom of baseball this year in getting a runner home from third with less than two outs, though they did improve in situations in the second half.The Red Sox were top 10 in the same category and first in baseball in moving a runner from second to third with no outs."A lot of it is based on availability," Maddon said of hiring Davis.Davis and Butterfield became available when John Farrell wasn't retained in Boston, otherwise Mallee and Jones might still be with the Cubs.That wasn't the case with Bosio, who wasn't going to be brought back."We just thought it was time for a different voice at this particular moment," Maddon said."I don't want to get too deeply into it."The Cubs were last in unintentional walk rate, but Bosio's dismissal had more to do with behind-the-scenes issues than any performance-based statistic.?Only last week Maddon had backed his entire coaching staff, but the Cubs were still playing when he was asked if he wanted them all to return."That was a really awkward question," Maddon said."We're in the playoffs, and I thought that was the only way I could respond."The Cubs also promoted minor league hitting coordinator Andy Haines to assistant hitting coach.That job was left vacant when Eric Hinske left for the hitting coach position with the Los Angeles Angels."The guys that are leaving are near to my heart," Maddon said.
Don't blame Dusty Baker for the Nationals' failures -- look at ownership:::::The Washington Nationals are a bad organization.After consecutive 95-plus-win seasons with consecutive heartbreaking Game 5 losses in the National League Division Series, that they fired manager Dusty Baker is proof of many things, but one thing especially: They are a bad organization with bad owners.The team has been in Washington for 13 seasons.It has had six managers, seven if you count the hiring and rescinding of the offer to Bud Black, who was chosen over Baker to manage in 2016.The?Nationals have made the playoffs four times in the past six years and have lost in the division series each time, including losing three of four in a deciding fifth game, all at home.For being so close and winning the National League East in 2016 by 20 games, the Lerner family, which runs the team, has had three managers since 2012.Baker, with a .593 winning percentage, is the most successful manager in Nationals history, and that includes the Montreal Expos version of the franchise.The Nationals are a bad organization because they hired Matt Williams, who was in over his head as a first-time manager, lost the clubhouse and underachieved.They are a bad organization because, after doing the right thing by firing Williams, they responded to Baker stabilizing the Williams mess by firing him and undermining that stability when general manager Mike Rizzo said, "Winning a lot of games in the regular season and division titles is not enough."It was a stunning thing for anyone who understands just how hard winning is, especially in a league in which the?Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs?-- the two teams that beat Baker's Nats in the playoffs -- are better.Maybe Rizzo would like to go back to Jonathan Papelbon choking Bryce Harper in the dugout.Back in 1995, after Tony La Russa left the?Athletics to manage the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland GM Sandy Alderson was interviewing potential replacements.One, Art Howe, was the man the A's eventually hired, and in Howe's interview, he began to tell Alderson about his managing philosophy, when Alderson interrupted him."We're not interested in your philosophy," Alderson told him."We're trying to decide if you fit with ours."For all the talk of Brad Pitt and Billy Beane and the culture wars of scouts versus spreadsheets, it was in that interview where baseball changed forever.Alderson would ask why baseball teams changed philosophies whenever they hired a new manager, which, to Alderson was a mid-level position.The front office came first.The manager -- after a baseball history of Casey Stengel and John McGraw, Leo Durocher and Tommy Lasorda, in which the manager was the face of the front office -- didn't matter anymore.This is how the Washington Nationals view the managerial position.It isn't important, not worth paying for, and it's certainly not deserving of the credit or respect for the 192 games the team won under Baker.The analytics crowd, among others who are tripping over themselves to sound smart and rational, as if team owners are to be given the benefit of the doubt to make the smart and rational move because they are rich, are arguing the Nationals simply need a more analytics-based manager, to give them a "better chance" to win.As if the next manager can do better than 97 wins, home-field advantage, three remarkable pitching performances from their two best pitchers, Stephen Strasburg and Max Scherzer, and a 4-1 lead with Scherzer on the mound in Game 5 at home.Sometimes, there isn't a formula.Sometimes, the other team wins.The Nationals are a bad organization because they've allowed themselves to engage in the silly pity party that is curses, fan talk and the easiest excuse for an organization that refuses to look in the mirror.They're not cursed.They're cheap.In July, ownership scheduled a Sunday makeup doubleheader at Nationals Park when the team was flying out that night for a road trip.They wound up losing three of their next four games.They've listened to their team be called cursed.They've listened to Dusty Baker be called cursed.The worse part of it is they seem to believe it, which is nonsensical, considering the Washington edition of the franchise has been in existence only 12 seasons, the first seven of which it never even reached .500.Nevertheless, the Nationals lost to the Cubs in the division series, panicked and fired their manager.This move doesn't make them "all-in" for 2018, as if this move somehow makes them a better team.All it did was expose the organization for being responsible for unnecessary upheaval to which now the players, fighting both opponents and their owners, must adjust.As for Baker, the team fired him because it never really wanted him in the first place.He was Rizzo's fallback after the Bud Black deal fell apart.The team did not commit to him, even after two first-place finishes, forcing him to squirm after every inning of the playoffs to determine if he'd be employed next year.He is 14th on the all-time managerial wins list, a three-time manager of the year and a guy who has taken every team he has ever managed over the past 24 years to the playoffs.Unless his successor is La Russa, his successor will not be able to say that.If the Nationals are cursed of anything, it's that they're too smart for their own good.By the arrogance of thinking they can win with such organizational disdain for the managerial position.By the eternal, unforgivable arrogance of 2012, when the franchise won 98 games, was arguably the best team in baseball, had Strasburg healthy, but refused to use him in the playoffs, even in relief, because the organization believed it had discovered the magic formula to prevent injuries.They didn't let Strasburg pitch, allowing the Cardinals to beat them in Game 5.It was arguably the worst personnel decision a team has ever made, trying to look smart while playing to lose.If there is a curse surrounding the Nationals, it is that the players are cursed by the family signing their paychecks.
Marshawn Lynch practices with old high school during suspension:::::ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch?kept busy during his one-game suspension by?spending some time practicing this week with the football team at his alma mater, Oakland Technical High School.Sporting his Raiders helmet as cameras rolled for his reality show, Lynch showed off some fancy footwork and a nasty stiff-arm on an unsuspecting prepster.It took four, five or six Bulldogs players to bring him down on another play.Lynch posted video of the practice on his Instagram account.Lynch was suspended by the NFL for making contact with an official during the Raiders' Week 7 win over the Kansas City Chiefs.?Raiders offensive coordinator Todd Downing said he had not yet seen Lynch's Instagram video.Asked how he felt about Lynch working out with a high school team during his suspension, Downing said, "To be honest with you, I'm so focused on this situational Thursday.We have third down, red zone, all of that going in today.I was dialed in on Buffalo."I don't really know what it was.I know that he loves football and he's a football junkie.I wouldn't expect anything different.We're excited to go put on a good showing with Buffalo and meet up with him after that."The Raiders play at the Buffalo Bills on Sunday and will fly to Florida after the game and spend the week practicing at the IMG Academy in Bradenton before playing the Miami Dolphins on Nov. 5.Head coach Jack Del Rio did not speak Thursday, but he was asked Wednesday about when and how Lynch would rejoin the Raiders."We've got people that will handle that part," Del Rio said."Right now, we're just focusing on Buffalo."Lynch has rushed for 266 yards and two touchdowns on 72 carries for a career-low 3.7 yards per rush.
Whacky World Series: Homers fly, Dodgers-Astros even at 1:::::As a couple of Astros loosened up in the outfield, the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park made its slow crawl Thursday, turning the bright sun into shade.That might be the only way to keep balls from flying completely out of the yard at this power-packed World Series.A day after Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Houston combined with the Los Angeles Dodgers for a Series-record eight home runs in the Astros' 7-6, 11-inning win, the baseball world was still marveling over the moonshots.So were the players who launched them."Actually, when I was getting off the plane with (Carlos) Beltran, I was talking to him, and I was like, what was going through your head when Altuve hit the homer?He was like, 'We were going crazy in the dugout,'" Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said."Then I was like what about when Correa hit his, what about when they hit theirs?And they hit theirs," he said, laughing."We were just going back and forth."After a Major League Baseball season that set a record for the most home runs, the World Series is off to a flying start.Already a whopping 11 homers six by Los Angeles as the sides split the first two games at Dodger Stadium.At this rate, they'd shatter the Series record of 21 in 2002 when Barry Bonds and Giants lost to the Angels in seven games.The curveballing Lance McCullers Jr. starts Game 3 for Houston on Friday night against Yu Darvish, and the roof will be shut exactly how the Astros like it.The highest-scoring team in the majors is 6-0 at its thumping home this postseason.The top hasn't been open since early June in order to block out the Texas summer heat.Rain is in the forecast, and the final call on whether to close the roof rests with MLB.That decision is based in part on what the home team normally does during the year."We want it closed.We've got to have it closed," reliever Chris Devenski said."I feel the electricity when it's closed is so much better.And we love playing here.We have so much excitement being here and the electricity and the vibe.And I feel like we feed off of it."The Astros had plenty of energy Wednesday night, too.Marwin Gonzalez hit a tying homer off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen in the ninth inning, Altuve and Correa connected back-to-back in the 10th and George Springer hit a two-run shot in the 11th.There were five home runs solely in extra innings."Yeah, last night hurt," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.After a few Astros casually limbered up, Los Angeles held a full, relaxed workout.With the roof closed and the park empty, sounds echoed from every corner of the park.Whistles, hoots, singing, the crack of the bat.It was all loud."Hey!"Yasiel Puig shouted, clanking a drive off a distant metal railing in left-center.In the outfield, a couple players bantered with stadium workers high above.Jansen whooped it up, playing third base and trying to make behind-the-back stabs at practice grounders.Jansen was having fun, less than 24 hours after Gonzalez tagged him.The Dodgers had been 98-0 this year when leading after eight innings, the lone club in the majors without a loss in those situations.Roberts said he checked with Jansen after the game."I just wanted to it doesn't happen very often that a game is blown when he takes the baseball.So I just wanted to come back, circle back with him, make sure he was in a good state of mind, which he was," Roberts said."And it's baseball, things like that happen.But he was obviously disappointed but prepared for tomorrow," he said.More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
McCullers is ready to throw the Los Angeles Dodgers a curve:::::Lance McCullers Jr. is ready to throw the Los Angeles Dodgers a curve.He ended Game 7 of the AL Championship Series last weekend by throwing 24 consecutive curveballs to retire the New York Yankees' final five batters in order.The 23-year-old All-Star right-hander will be back on the mound for the Houston Astros on Friday night when the World Series resumes with Game 3 at Minute Maid Park after a split in Los Angeles."The old saying of 'don't fix it if it ain't broke,' or something like that," McCullers said Thursday."I just kind of got in the groove and felt like it was working."Yu Darvish starts for the Dodgers, who worked out under a closed roof at Minute Maid Park on Thursday night.McCullers' curveball use topped the major leagues at 47.2 percent of his pitches this year, according to Fangraphs.The Dodgers' Rich Hill was second at 39.8 percent."He believes in his best stuff matched up against the best stuff of the other guy, that he's going to be better.He's a challenge-first type guy," Astros manager A.J.Hinch said."His belief in himself is second to none."McCullers' father, also named Lance, pitched seven seasons in the major leagues with San Diego (1985-88), the New York Yankees (1989-90), Detroit (1990) and Texas (1992), going 28-31 in nine starts and 297 relief appearances.Lance Jr. mostly played shortstop in his first few seasons at Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida, where he earned a national player of the year award in 2012.He started taking the mound more in his junior year under pitching coach Geoff Goetz, the sixth overall choice by the New York Mets in the 1997 amateur draft."I was messing around with the grip he used, and then I came about with the way I throw it now," McCullers said."The way I grew up kind of learning how to pitch with my father and my pitching coach in Florida was to throw every pitch the same as a fastball, not to manipulate your wrists or to do anything different with your hand positioning, as you would a fastball."Taken by Houston with the 41st selection in 2012, McCullers made it to the major leagues three years later.He was 7-4 with a 4.25 ERA this year in 22 starts, limited to six regular-season outings after the All-Star break because of back discomfort (July 31-Sept. 5) and arm fatigue (Sept. 13-23).A bad back also caused a disabled list stint in June.His curveball use was at 36 percent in 2015 before rising to nearly 50 percent in each of the last two seasons."The curveball, I think it's still the lowest-average-against pitch in the big leagues," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said."There's certainly a place for that when you're working front to back and also up to down."McCullers wasn't thinking exclusively breaking ball when he relieved Charlie Morton with a 4-0 lead over the Yankees after five innings."The crowd was rocking," he said."I could tell they were pressing a little bit.As I was throwing curveballs and I was reading the swings, for me it was just, I'm not really going to make an adjustment until they do.It would have been the same thing if I threw a lot of fastballs or a lot of changeups."Darvish will be starting his third Game 3 this October after beating Arizona in the NL Division Series and the Chicago Cubs in the Championship Series.The 31-year-old right-hander started against the Astros twice this year before Texas traded him to the Dodgers on July 31, allowing three runs over five innings during a home loss on June 2 and one run in seven innings at Houston 10 days later.He is 4-1 in six starts at Minute Maid.Last month Darvish was among the Dodgers players who wore Houston Strong T-shirts to raise money for Hurricane Harvey relief efforts."I made a donation to help, to support Houston, and I want people to get recovered and feel more energized," he said through a translator."And since I made that donation, maybe I can use a ball that doesn't have much pop in it."More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Astros' World Series run lifts Houston amid Harvey recovery:::::Paul Daulong hopes the Houston Astros jersey his daughter gave him after Hurricane Harvey's flooding devastated the family's home will be a good luck charm as his beloved baseball team tries to win its first World Series.So far, it seems to be working.Daulong started wearing the jersey after the Astros trailed the New York Yankees three games to two in the American League Championship Series.They won the next two games in Houston to advance to the fall classic against the Los Angeles Dodgers.He forgot to wear it during Game 1 of the World Series, which the Astros lost, but remembered to put it on for Wednesday's Game 2, which they won in extra innings."Normally I'm not real superstitious," he said this week from his dust-covered home, a gutted structure held up by exposed wooden beams but devoid of furniture and appliances."But I'm wearing it now and I'm not taking it off."The Daulongs and others in the Houston area impacted by Harvey have used the Astros' championship run as a source of inspiration to slog through difficult days filled with tiring repairs, bureaucratic red tape and uncertainty about the future."It gives you a positive note to start thinking about," said Paul Daulong, 70."It's been nothing, other than the last week they fixed the fireplace.So it's frustrating.With the Astros winning, it makes you feel good."Amid the Astros' quest, the city has continued rebuilding from Harvey's devastating flooding, which inundated some areas with more than 50 inches of rain in late August.Officials have estimated that more than 136,000 homes and structures were damaged during Harvey in Harris County, which includes Houston.Officials say it will be months before all of the debris covering many front lawns is removed.Nearly 100 people still remain in an American Red Cross shelter in Houston and nearly 9,000 families in Harris County who were displaced by Harvey are still living in hotels.Mary Daulong, 69, said she and her husband who are temporarily living in an apartment have scheduled their rebuilding activities at their home around Astros' games."We would work here until it was dark.Now we cannot.Whatever time the Astros come on, is when we stop working here," she said.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in the aftermath of Harvey, the Worlds Series isn't just about the Astros."Quite frankly, they are carrying the city on their shoulders and on their backs and in their mitts," said Turner."The storm may have come, but it hasn't dampened our spirit, our enthusiasm."Astros manager A.J.Hinch said the team understands its responsibility to represent Houston and bring awareness "to the things that are needed to rebuild our great city.""It gives the city something to rally around and gives people something to cheer for that otherwise may not have a lot to be hopeful for," said Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.Houston resident Tom Flores, 70, said while cheering on the Astros in the World Series won't make up for people losing their homes, it still gives people some hope."I got friends of mine who lost their home and everything but they are still Astros fans and this does take a little bit of the sadness off," he said.Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish, who wore a "Houston Strong" T-shirt in the days after the storm and made a donation to help those affected by it.He joked that he hopes it gains him some favor when he starts Game 3 on Friday night."I made a donation to help, to support Houston and I want people to get recovered and feel more energized," he said in Japanese through a translator."And since I made that donation, maybe I can use a ball that doesn't have much pop in it."Houston pitcher Lance McCullers said helping boost the city after the storm became a rallying point for the team."We still have pictures hanging in our lockers," he said."It's still something we think about, because people here are hard-working people, and they went through something that a lot of people can't understand.A lot of people lost everything."So for us to be able to just play baseball for a couple of hours and for those people to be able to have a little bit of joy, to get away from what they were having to go through is pretty special."An event like the World Series can be a powerful source of motivation for a community dealing with adversity, said Tim Bono, a lecturer in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department at Washington University in St. Louis."It'll be important for people in Houston to continue to direct attention toward that and say, 'Hey, look how we all came together to cheer on our sports team.Let's continue to do that to support each other and to especially direct resources ... for those areas that still need our help in recovering from the aftermath of the hurricane," Bono said.Paul Daulong said the Astros provided a good example for the community by going through their own rebuilding process after several losing seasons."We have totally put the Astros ahead of the problems that are occurring right now," he said."We just gotta keep our heads up and make sure that just like the Astros are going to come through against the Dodgers, we'll make it back as well as we can."AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.Follow Juan A.

Astros manager Hinch on hotel incident: 'No altercation':::::Astros manager A.J.Hinch firmly said there was "no altercation" at a hotel in California this week at the World Series following a TMZ Sports report that he argued with bar patrons.Hinch on Thursday called the report "some nonsense and fabrications.""To reiterate, there was no altercation, and that's as far as I'm going to go.It's ridiculous," he said.After Houston lost Game 1 to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night, police were called to a hotel to check a report of a verbal altercation "between members of the Astros team management and other hotel patrons," Pasadena Police Lt. Mark Goodman said.The officers "facilitated keeping the peace," Goodman said.No arrests were made, no summonses were issued, and no report was filed, he said.Goodman said there was "no assault."Hinch was not identified by name.Hinch and a few Houston players were at Minute Maid Park on Thursday.The teams were off with the Series tied at one game each.TMZ Sports reported earlier in the day that Hinch argued with patrons at the bar at the team hotel after the Astros' 3-1 loss in the opener.
Girardi fired as Yankees manager, leaving with 'heavy heart':::::Joe Girardi was fired as New York Yankees manager Thursday after a decade that produced just one World Series title for a team that expects to win every year.Yankees general manager Brian Cashman announced the move five days after New York lost to Houston in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series."With a heavy heart, I come to you because the Yankees have decided not to bring me back," Girardi said in a statement released by his agent, Steven Mandell."I'd like to thank the fans for their great support as a player, coach and manager and the lasting memories of their passion and excitement during the playoff games."An intense and driven former All-Star catcher, Girardi was at the end of his four-year contract and said last weekend he had to speak with his family before deciding whether he wanted to return.New York made the decision for him."Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, and we've decided to pursue alternatives for the managerial position," Cashman said in a statement.Girardi's 910-710 regular-season record with the Yankees is sixth in victories managing the team behind Joe McCarthy (1,460), Joe Torre (1,173), Casey Stengel (1,149), Miller Huggins (1,067) and Ralph Houk (944).Cashman said he and owner Hal Steinbrenner had spoken directly with Girardi this week."He has a tireless work ethic, and put his heart into every game he managed over the last decade," Cashman said in his statement."He should take great pride in our accomplishments during his tenure."New York said Cashman and other team officials will not discuss the decision during the World Series.Girardi wore uniform No.25 as a player with the Yankees from 1996-99, when he helped win three titles, but switched to No.27 when he earned the manager's job over Don Mattingly and succeeded Torre after the 2007 season signifying the team's quest for its 27th championship.Girardi took uniform No.28 after leading the team to a World Series victory over Philadelphia in 2009.New York changed managers 20 times from 1973, when George Steinbrenner bought the team, through October 1995, when Torre replaced Buck Showalter.But the Yankees have had just two managers in 22 years since.New York became the third of the 10 postseason teams to remove managers, joining Boston and Washington.There is no clear favorite to replace him, and candidates from within the organization could include bench coach Rob Thomson, Triple-A Scranton manager Al Pedrique and Class A Tampa manager Jay Bell.Possibilities from outside the organization include former Kansas City manager Trey Hillman, a one-time Yankees special assistant who managed in South Korea this year; Mets hitting coach Kevin Long, who held the same role with the Yankees from 2007-14; and former Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin, who was a pro scout for the Yankees in 2008 and 2013.The 53-year-old Girardi led a young squad on a surprising run to an AL wild-card berth this year with a 91-71 record, the team's best since 2012.New York beat Minnesota in the wild-card game, then fell behind Cleveland 2-0 in the Division Series.Girardi admitted he made a mistake not asking for a video review of a hit-by-pitch call in Game 2 that led to an Indians rally."I screwed up.And it's hard.It's a hard day for me," he said then."But I got to move forward and we'll be ready to go tomorrow."New York won the next three games to advance, lost the first two games of the ALCS at Houston, then won three in a row to move within a victory of reaching the World Series for the first time in eight years.But the Astros swept the final two games.Girardi visited Astros manager A.J.Hinch in his office after the finale to give encouragement."He's a real class act," Hinch said."It's a shame to see so much turnover because of the work, the blood, sweat, tears poured into these job.And I don't think anybody goes through more than what Joe does in New York."Girardi's statement thanked people from Steinbrenner and Cashman down to the player development and scouting staff, traveling secretary and even the clubhouse attendants.He had sounded unusually nostalgic when discussing the atmosphere at Yankee Stadium during the playoffs."It's been wonderful to watch," he said last week before what turned out to be his final home game."I peeked at left field and I see the fans jumping up and down.And I peek and watch them hitting the pads.In right field, they're jumping up and down.And it's brought back a lot of good memories for me, but I just love it.And it's fun to be a part of."More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Column: A wild game and a bullpen that finally cracked:::::Smoke came drifting over Dodger Stadium in the extra innings of World Series Game 2, though it wasn't because Houston bats were suddenly on fire.But it did seem an odd coincidence in one of the wildest and most entertaining World Series games you'll ever see.On a night when the Dodgers threatened to take a 2-0 lead in the World Series with just two hits, the Astros rallied in the most improbable of ways .In a stretch of seven batters they hit three home runs in the ninth and 10th innings, then added another one in the 11th to take the lead for good.The Dodger bullpen that had been so spectacular imploded.The team that hadn't lost in 98 games this season with a lead after the eighth inning finally did.And a World Series that struggled to attract viewers in Game 1 suddenly became must-see TV."Oh my gosh, it was crazy," Carlos Correa said."A lot of emotions, a lot of feelings."Blame it on Dave Roberts over managing.Blame it on Kenley Jansen for hanging a cutter in the ninth inning of a game all 54,293 in attendance at Dodger Stadium just knew he was going to close out.Mostly, though, credit a resilient Astros team that just wasn't ready to lose a game to a team that had only a pair of home runs to show for the first nine innings."These guys, they can do a lot of things, and they fight to the last out.They play 27 outs," Roberts said.And that's the same thing we do.And it was one of those games that just ran out of outs."How crazy was this game?Here's a couple of stats in a sport consumed by them: Dodger relievers had gone 28 consecutive innings before allowing a run in the eighth inning.And Astros hitters were 9 for 19 with four home runs from the eighth inning on."That was a great game on so many levels," said Houston manager A.J.Hinch."If you like October baseball, if you like any baseball that's one of the most incredible games."Incredible, yes.Up until the point Yasiel Puig struck out after hitting a home run in his previous at bat fans at Dodger Stadium were on their feet in anticipation of yet another comeback.After all, hadn't little used minor league callup Charlie Culberson just homered in front of Puig to cut the lead to 7-6?In a season of the home run, eight of them went out on this wild and crazy night.The final one for the Astros was the winner, a two-run shot by George Springer who was just trying to get Cameron Maybin moved over to third base.Instead he put himself in the World Series record books, though not before the Dodgers tried yet another comeback of their own in the 11th."When that last out is made, you finally breathe," Springer said."But that's an emotional high, emotional high to low to high again.But that's why we play the game.And that's the craziest game that I've ever played in, and it's only Game 2."That the Dodger bullpen finally cracked wasn't terribly surprising.They had gone 28 scoreless innings in the postseason but were playing the highest-scoring team in the major leagues.But Jansen was brought in for a six out save, and failed.Josh Fields replaced him in the 10th and promptly served up home runs to Jose Altuve and Correa.And starter Brandon McCarthy let up the game winner after the Dodgers had tied it in the 10th.That's on the second-year Dodger manager, who is so super quick with the hook he let Rich Hill go only four innings despite letting up only one run and striking out seven.Roberts replaced another reliever, Josh Fields after he walked the only batter he faced."I just felt that right there at the top of their order coming up, and with the way our bullpen has been throwing, you look back behind that, we had three scoreless innings after that," Roberts said."So just trust the guys behind him, and the bottom line is I'll take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning."Justin Verlander turned from pitcher to cheerleader after being pulled after the sixth inning down 3-1.He was in the video room when Springer's ball went out."I almost fainted I think three times, I'm not joking," Verlander said."Cheering so loudly I had to take a minute to recompose myself so I didn't pass out."He and everyone else.It was that kind of a night.Tim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.Write to him at tdahlberg@ap.org or http://twitter.com/timdahlberg
Verlander brings the heat, hollers Astros toward Game 2 win:::::Justin Verlander brought the heat.With fastballs, then fury.Upset that his Astros had blown a two-run lead in the 10th inning, the Houston ace stormed from the clubhouse to the dugout in gym clothes before the 11th to talk to his teammates.To holler at them, more like it.His message: "Stay positive.Remember how good you are."Good enough to hang tough and win a thrilling Game 2 of the World Series.The Astros outlasted Los Angeles 7-6 Wednesday night and left Dodger Stadium with things tied at one game each.Verlander threw six strong innings, allowing just two hits.The no-decision let him remain 9-0 since being traded from Detroit to Houston on Aug. 31.Maybe more than his pitching, it was his perfect timing that spurred the Astros.It wasn't quite the calm, reassuring talk that Boston star David Ortiz delivered in the dugout during a moment in the 2013 World Series at St. Louis.But, it seemed to have the same effect."I don't even know if anybody heard me," Verlander said.Oh, they did.Asked what Verlander shouted, star shortstop Carlos Correa quoted him."Let's," Correa said, pausing for effect to omit a certain word, "go!"Just what the Astros expect from the big guy, a former MVP and Cy Young Award winner."He was loud.He was firm.He's a leader," Correa said.Verlander, who's 0-3 with a 6.43 ERA in World Series play after this no-decision, exited with Astros trailing 3-1.Moments after a close, full-count pitch was called a ball with two outs in the sixth, Corey Seager hit a two-run homer.Going into the late innings, especially against the deep Dodgers relief corps, it was starting to look dire for the slumping Astros.But not to Verlander.He kept exhorting his club, telling the team it wasn't nearly over."It's so easy in this game to get down, especially when I mean, we have the TV on before the games.You see everyone saying how great this Dodger bullpen is and how our offense hasn't been going," he said."It's so easy to say, man, we're probably not going to win this game, down two against one of the best bullpens in baseball.I just wanted to really remind these guys how great they are."Houston was the highest-scoring team in the majors this year.On this evening, the Astros and Dodgers combined for a Series-record eight home runs.So being down going into the late innings wasn't worth worrying about."This team, since I've been here, and I know it hasn't been that long, but two runs is nothing," Verlander said."And all of a sudden two runs seemed like it was the Grand Canyon."And now, with a boost from Verlander's voice, the Astros aren't in a big hole, either.More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Franklin leads Penn State with grand vision, big personality:::::Every aspiring head coach in college football seemingly has a master plan, copious notes and ideas about how to run a program gathered over years as an assistant.Maybe it is written in a notebook or scratched out on legal pads.Could be printed out and stacked in a file folder or two.James Franklin's master plan is in a three-ring binder, about 8 inches thick, and it sits on a book shelf in his office at Penn State."Training.Camps.Clinics.Fundraising.Spring.Fall.Potential staff members.Offensive staff.Defensive staff.Administrative staff.Strength staff.Special teams.Practice plans.Staff duties.Team prayer.Ticket policy," Franklin rattles off the names of the sections and he is not even half done.The 45-year-old Franklin has it all covered.He said he hardly ever opens the binder anymore, but the plan appears to be working to perfection.In his fourth season as coach of the Nittany Lions (7-0), Franklin has the No.2 team in the country and the Nittany Lions are playing as well as they did during Joe Paterno's prime.Coaching in a division that was supposed to be owned by Ohio State's Urban Meyer and Michigan's Jim Harbaugh, Franklin's Penn State team is the defending champion.Franklin has also done something else: He has restored the pride in Penn State football to pre-Sandusky scandal levels, leading with a grand vision and big, bold personality.He is in many ways the epitome of the 21st century college football coach: An energetic CEO who has his hands in everything while giving his assistants room to work.Cool enough to relate to the players, but demanding enough to get them to embrace his process and give him their respect."Every game is like the Super Bowl for us," Heisman Trophy contender Saquon Barkley said Wednesday, three days before Penn State visits No.6 Ohio State for one of the biggest games of the season.Coaching was not an early calling for Franklin.Football was in some ways a means to an end.Excelling at the game when he was young helped him become the first member of his family to go to college.Franklin grew up in the Philadelphia area with a father who was in and out of his life.Jim Franklin, Franklin said, became violent when he drank.Once the younger Franklin became old enough to stand up for himself and his mother, Josie, his father left for good."What I learned very early on is that if you have a cycle in your family, whether it's alcohol or abuse, the best way to break that cycle, the higher educated you are the better chance you have of not repeating it," Franklin said during a pre-dawn interview in his office this week."I had major fears that I was going to turn into my father."Franklin played quarterback at East Stroudsburg University, a Division II school in northeast Pennsylvania and majored in psychology.He became a graduate assistant coach mostly to pay for grad school.He spent a summer working at two psychiatric treatment centers in eastern Pennsylvania, one for adolescents and one for adults.He desired to help fix people's problems, but in many cases the best that could be done was manage them.He recalled a woman who was seeking treatment for depression.She was sobbing."And I remember saying to myself, 'I can't do this.I cannot do this because I'm getting emotional with her,'" he said."I want to reach over and put my hand on her, which is not appropriate and I'm sitting there saying to myself one of two things is going to happen: I'm either going to become desensitized to this ... where you're just kind of filling out the form and it doesn't affect you anymore.I don't want to be that person.Or I'm just not going to be able to do this because of the emotional investment.It takes a special person and I just can't do that."To this day, Franklin views himself as an extremely empathetic person.He said it is almost comical how easily he gets choked up.His wife, Fumi, will make fun of him for getting misty eyed while watching contestants do well on "America's Got Talent" with his daughters, Shola, 10, and Addy, 9.In coaching, Franklin found a way to be a fixer.He could help kids get into college and change their lives.It didn't take him long to start compiling that binder and get on track to be a head coach."He was really high energy and it kind of slapped you in the face when you first meet him and get to know him," said Penn State strength and conditioning coach Dwight Galt, who was at Maryland when Franklin was hired as an assistant by the school in 2000."It got my attention."At an event for minority assistant coaches, Franklin got the attention of Vanderbilt athletic director David Williams.Franklin was not necessarily Vanderbilt's first choice to be head coach in 2011, but that meeting with Williams had led the athletic director to follow his career and it got Franklin an interview."He had the thickest notebook I'd ever seen," Williams said.Franklin had unprecedented success at Vanderbilt, going 24-15 and taking the Commodores to three bowl games in three seasons.Penn State hired him in 2014 to replace Bill O'Brien, who had held the program together after Paterno's downfall.The winningest coach in major college football history was fired in 2011 after the arrest of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky for sexually abusing boys.The scandal brought crippling NCAA sanctions.It also left the Penn State community hurting and fractured.Franklin had to win over fans, alumni and former players, many of which felt the school was not doing enough to defend Paterno, who died a few months after he was fired.Many Penn Staters wanted one of their own to take over the program.Instead they got Franklin, a gregarious charmer who never misses an opportunity to promote the program."It takes time to understand that none of that for James is show," said Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour, who was hired seven months after Franklin."You have to have a certain level of exposure to him to understand that's him.And it's him all the time."Even some of Franklin's own players say the coach's personality takes some getting used to."It was almost like, whoa, what's up with this dude?"quarterback Trace McSorley said, recalling what it was like to be recruited by Franklin.The Nittany Lions won seven games in each of Franklin's first two seasons and then started 2-2 last year.Skeptical fans were already losing patience.Penn State has won 16 of 17 games since.Maybe the biggest move by Franklin was hiring Joe Moorhead to be offensive coordinator last season.Handing over the offense to Moorhead has fed into an image of Franklin that he doesn't particularly care for: Great recruiter, but not necessarily a great tactician."I guess what I'm saying is there's a lot of head coaches out there across the country who never called a play," Franklin said."Who have never been coordinators.I coached in the NFL.I've been a coordinator at multiple schools in multiple major conferences.Have I been a good recruiter in my career?Yeah, but most of the good head coaches and good programs are.But there's more to that.That bothers me a little bit."There is little doubt that Franklin's ability to connect with people and his boundless enthusiasm are pivotal to his success."He says he always does back flips out of bed in the morning," Penn State senior cornerback Grant Haley said, "and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if that's what he does."Follow Ralph D.

AP source: Patriots Hightower to have season-ending surgery:::::A person familiar with the situation says the New England Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower will miss Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Chargers and is facing season-ending surgery on his right shoulder.The surgery will be for a torn pectoral muscle, the person told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity Thursday because it has not yet been announced by the team.Hightower left Sunday's win over Atlanta in the second half with the shoulder issue and sat out the first practice of the week Wednesday.He's missed two games this season with a knee injury.It comes as a blow for a Patriots defense that has improved in recent weeks, but continues to rank last in the NFL in total defense, giving up 426.7 yards per game.Hightower has 14 tackles and two sacks.In March, he signed a new four-year deal worth $35.5 million.With Hightower out, his snaps are expected to fall to Kyle Van Noy and veteran David Harris.Van Noy has started all seven games this season and has 49 tackles and 3 1/2 sacks.Harris has appeared in four games with one start and has four tackles."For a guy like Hightower to go down with that injury, to be out for the year and what he means to this defense he's one of the captains of this team," Harris said."He knows this defense like the back of his hand.To lose a guy like that is a huge blow for the team.But as a linebacker group we gotta step up and try to take his place, which is gonna be tough to do."Though Harris hasn't had much opportunity to contribute to date, coach Bill Belichick said Wednesday that he has been pleased with how Harris has adapted since he was signed in June."That's the role.That's what it is and when it changes it changes," Belichick said."What a player can do to change it is to work hard and improve and do things better than what he's doing them to get more of an opportunity."Safety and defensive Devin McCourty said adjusting without Hightower is something the defense must do collectively."I think for all of us, it's just being prepared and being ready to go," McCourty said."It's not just one guy, it's not just Kyle Van Noy trying to fill Hightower's (position).It's all the guys stepping up and preparing and playing a little bit better."For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
'They're still beating everybody': Spurs off to 4-0 start:::::Gregg Popovich is in a great mood, seeming to enjoy every aspect of the conversation.There was talk about wine, his favorite beverage and probably his favorite topic.There was talk about players who came through the San Antonio system.There was talk about past NBA Finals matchups and some coaches he admires.Then the chat turned to the Spurs.And the effusive answers from the venerable San Antonio coach were no more."We're doing what we've always done, I guess," Popovich shrugged.True, but that's what makes the Spurs worth talking about.Off to the NBA's best start at 4-0 and matching the best start in franchise history, one they could top at Orlando on Friday the Spurs are generally ignoring this era's preferred method of go-go-go, pace-and-space, shoot-the-3 basketball and relying instead on post-ups and defense.It's working, even as the Spurs wait for Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker their best player and their point guard to make their season debuts."It's remarkable what they do and how they reinvent themselves every year," Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said."The faces change, but their standards and excellence remain the same.So now they're doing it retro, doing it totally old-school, the way everybody said you can't do it."They're doing it by building a top-caliber defense, not playing with incredible pace, not playing with the 3-point line right now ... and they're still beating everybody."San Antonio's latest victim: Spoelstra and the Heat, winning 117-100 in Miami on Wednesday night.The Spurs were plus-12 in rebounds, plus-14 in bench scoring, shot 10 for 17 from 3-point range while holding Miami to a 9-for-26 night from beyond the arc.In a 9-minute span of the second half, the Spurs used a 32-13 run that decided everything.Popovich dismissed the Spurs' effort as mediocre, especially on defense.But all Miami could do afterward was tip its cap."They just know how to play," Heat guard Goran Dragic said."They have that consistency.They have that system that is really good.You can see every cut, every pass, it's crisp.Sooner or later, you're going to get hit by a screen and they'll take advantage of that."Even without Leonard and Parker, it's all working.LaMarcus Aldridge, who often didn't seem to fit with the Spurs during his first two seasons, is averaging 26 points and is off to the best four-game start of his career.Rudy Gay, a Spurs newcomer and a backup for the first time since he was a rookie, is averaging 14.8 points on 58 percent shooting.The Spurs are allowing an average of 93 points per game 12 teams entering Thursday have given up more than that in every game they've played this season.It seems like a very basic style.And it's proven to be very effective."That's what I know," Popovich said."That's what I'm teaching.It suits our team and our personnel, so why not?"Popovich treats the nuances of the Spurs' system as if they are state secrets.The basic principles are easy and obvious, though.He tells a player simply to play to his strength.Case in point: Dejounte Murray, who's filling Parker's role while the veteran recovers from a leg injury, is the only guard in the NBA right now with more than 100 minutes as a starter and less than three 3-point attempts.Murray has taken two, and missed both.He's not a shooter yet."His focus right now is defense and rebounding," Popovich said."Eventually he will learn about pick-and-rolls and when his shot gets better, he will be real dangerous."This is what makes the Spurs dangerous: No one is asked to venture out of their comfort zone, and Popovich figures out the rest."You've got to adapt to your personnel," Spurs veteran Manu Ginobili said."If you have LaMarcus Aldridge, you're going to post up more than other teams.Defensively, we're trying to be who we always be and always were.I'm pretty sure that's what other teams like to try to be.No secret there.We just try to be the same old defensive team and adapt to whoever we have offensively."The Spurs have won 60 percent of their games in each of the last 20 seasons a streak eight years longer than any other team in NBA history, and four years longer than any other team ever in the four major North American sports leagues.Popovich is going to pass Phil Jackson, George Karl and possibly Pat Riley on the NBA's all-time wins list this season.Golden State is the NBA's best team and LeBron James its best player, but San Antonio is still the league's standard."You just have to credit Pop, their program and the players that they like in their program and their adaptability to be able to sustain their excellence," Spoelstra said.More AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball
