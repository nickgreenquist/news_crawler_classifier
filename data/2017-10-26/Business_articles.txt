Millennials are doing better than the baby-boomers did at their age:::::ALL men are created equal, but they do not stay that way for long.That is one message of a report this month by the OECD, a club of 35 mostly rich democracies.Many studies show how income gaps have evolved over time or between countries.The OECDs report looks instead at how inequality evolves with age.As people build their careers, or dont, their incomes tend to diverge.This inequality peaks when a generation reaches its late 50s.But it tends to fall thereafter, as people draw redistributive public pensions and quit the rat race, a contest that tends to give more unto every one that hath.Old age, the OECD notes, is a leveller.Will it remain so?Retirement, after all, flattens incomes not by redistributing from rich seniors to poor, but by transferring money to old people from younger, working taxpayers.There will be fewer of them around in the future for every retired person, reducing the role of redistributive public pensions.One logical response to the diminishing number of workers per pensioner is to raise the retirement age.But that will exacerbate old-age inequality, if mildly.Longer careers will give richer workers more time to compound their advantages.And when retirement eventually arrives, the poor, who die earlier, will have less time to enjoy their pensions.Todays youngsters may resent having to provide for more pensioners, not least because they feel that older generations have it easier than them.The OECD provides qualified support for this complaint.Baby-boomers (mostly born in the 1950s) have accumulated far more wealth (property, shares and other savings) than Generation X (mostly in the 1970s) and millennials (the 1980s and after).But that is partly because they have had more time to do so.Comparing generations at a similar stage of life paints a different picture.Todays young adults have a significantly higher disposable income than previous generations had at the same age.OECD citizens now in their early 30s have 7% more than members of Generation X had at that age and over 40% more than boomers enjoyed when they were similarly short in the tooth (see chart).Youngsters may sigh with impatience when an old codger tells them how life was tougher when I was your age.But it was.This millennial privilege is, however, smaller in America, which tends to set the tone for the generation wars.(Indeed Americans in their early 30s are slightly worse off than the preceding generation was at a similar age.)The gap also appears to close as the later generations get older.Gen-Xers were far more comfortable in their 30s than the people born a decade or two before them.But now they are in their 40s, their incomes have stopped rising, whereas their seniors enjoyed strong gains at the same age.This may reflect the lingering influence of the global financial crisis.But if this trajectory persists, a time may soon come when old folk sigh with impatience as youngsters tell them how much easier life was when you were my age.
India recapitalises its state-owned banks:::::ONE of the perks of owning a bank is the ability to tap it when you need money.The Indian government, which has majority stakes in 21 lenders, is no exception.As it happens, it needs to finance a bail-out of the banks it owns, most of which are in trouble.So under a cunning plan unveiled on October 24th, the ailing banks will lend the government 1.35trn rupees ($21bn), about a third of their combined market value.The government will reinvest this money in bank shares, thus ensuring they no longer need a bail-out.Steadying a tottering financial system is never a graceful exercise, as American and European authorities discovered after the financial crisis.Indias lenders withstood the meltdown of 2007-08 well, but then embarked on an ill-advised lending spree, backing lots of infrastructure projects that got snarled in bureaucracy.Bad loans piled up.State-owned lenders, which account for around two-thirds of the sector, now have stressed loans of 10.5trn rupees, about a fifth of their book.Banks have been reluctant to acknowledge that money they have lent is unlikely to be repaid, in part because that would trigger a loss, which in turn depletes the banks equity (the money shareholders invest).State-owned banks already have equity levels close to regulatory minimums, so they have preferred to pretend that even their ropiest borrowers will pay them back in full.At the very least, they dont have the capacity to extend new loans.Predictably, bank-credit growth has slumped, recently nearing record lows.That is one reason why year-on-year GDP growth slowed to 5.7% in the second quarter, from well over 7% a year ago.Despite the roundabout method of recapitalisation, getting money into the banking system is good policy.Bankers are being encouraged to use a new bankruptcy code to deal with bust borrowers; having fresh equity makes it easier for them to acknowledge past mistakes and move on.Details of the bail-out scheme are pending, but may resemble a rescue plan in the 1990s, whereby banks financed recapitalisation bonds issued by the government.The proceeds were used to subscribe to banks rights issues.(Banks will have to raise 580bn rupees themselves, perhaps by selling non-core assets, and receive a further 180bn rupees from government coffers left over from a previous scheme.)One attraction is that the money the government will have to borrow, roughly 1% of GDP, will not be reflected in its deficit, saving the finance ministrys blushes.The prospect of fresh funds sent most state-owned banks share prices soaring by well over 25%.Unlike recent Indian bank-rescue schemes, the package is large enough to make a difference.It should allow banks to lend again, if they can find willing borrowers.Indian businesses have plenty of spare capacity and many are still over-indebted.Some are still dealing with the effects of a sudden demonetisation of the economy last November, which has dented output.The complex implementation of a new goods-and-services tax in July has also frayed corporate confidence.The government also says its banks will be run more efficiently, to prevent further incontinent lending.There is reason to doubt that.Reform of their corporate governance is long overdue; and letting the private sector take over the reins at public banks remains taboo.Still, repair of the balance-sheets is at last under way.
For American Express, competition will only intensify:::::HE IS leaving with the share price rising and the announcement, on October 18th, of earnings that were largely well received.Better still, Kenneth Chenault, American Expresss chief executive for 16 years, accomplished a feat rare in the upper reaches of American finance: to stand down without an obvious helping shove.No grandstanding senators hounded him out (see Wells Fargo).No boardroom coup hastened the end (Citigroup).The financial crisis left him untouched (take your pick).His successor, Stephen Squeri, promoted from within and apparently groomed for the job, takes over in February.For all that, Mr Chenaults long tenure has not been an unequivocal triumph.Though generating strong returns on assets and equity, American Express has continued its slide within the fast-changing and competitive payments industry.According to Nilson, an industry bible, in 1974 the amount of money for purchases channelled through American Express was equivalent to 50% of what went through MasterCard and 70% of what went through Visa.By 2016, those ratios had shrunk to 30% and 14%.American Express has grown nonetheless, as credit-card usage has surged.But the best days may be over.Its share price, revenues and profits all peaked in 2014.Buried in the details of its latest earnings release are hints that raise questions about how strong its numbers are, and suggestions that its strategywhich increasingly relies on lending to replace diminishing transaction feesmay be heading into more turbulent conditions.Cutting the cards Competitive pressure looms on all sides.MasterCards market capitalisation is twice that of American Express; Visas, three times as big.PayPal, spun off from eBay in 2015 and run by a former American Express executive, has a tiny fraction of Amexs revenues and profits but on the eve of the earnings announcement passed it in market value (see chart).Its sales and profits have grown much faster, and it was born online.Rather than a card, PayPal provides a payments platform for individuals, on smartphones or computers, using accounts at their bank or tied to American Express, Visa or MasterCard.In the process it collects a fee.It also offers systems such as Venmo (intended for payments between individuals but sometimes used by businesses, too), Braintree, a financial link used by Uber and Airbnb, and Xoom, a remittance service.Competition abroad is just as keen.American Express entered Asia early and once had an enviable position there, but its presence has faded.In 2007 it sold (to Standard Chartered) a private bank created almost a century ago that had languished from inattention.Japans JCB has issued almost as many cards (but still accounts for far less in transactions).Chinas UnionPay boasts the worlds biggest transaction volume, eight times that of American Express, and 55% of cards issued globally.These conventional competitors may matter less than electronic networks such as Alibabas Alipay and Tencents Tenpay and a profusion of still little-known startups.The entire mechanics of payments are being rethought, with cards being replaced by QR codes, biometrics and more.In this noisy hothouse, Mr Chenault deserves respect for keeping American Express healthy.It has supported its market share through deals with banks and other financial institutions that can now issue American Express cards (and generate fees by transacting through Amexs systems).In the past decade the number of businesses accepting its cards has doubled.But these victories have come at a cost.Twenty-five years ago American Express collected a 3.2% fee on every transaction, according to Sanford Bernstein, an investment research firm.Now, it makes less than 1.8%.Competitive pressure will squeeze this further.In the past, merchants were willing to pay for American Express transactions because its cardholders were well-off and willing to spend.But now large banks are going after these customers.JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, both with card businesses headed by ex-Amexers, have issued cards that provide benefits broadly regarded as better than those from American Express.Soon Bank of America will follow.Banks have also taken aim at lucrative co-branding deals carrying exclusive rewards for customers.In 2015 American Express lost one such deal with Costco, a large retailer that accounted for 10% of its transaction volume, to Citigroup.Another, with JetBlue, an airline, went to Barclays.To rely less on revenue from transaction fees, American Express has become more banklike, lending more.Net interest income made up 18% of revenues in 2012 and should bring in 28% in 2018, predicts Nomura/Instinet, a brokerage.That has looked good lately, because funds have been cheap and credit quality high, but the environment may be changing.Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, among others, began expanding their consumer-loan portfolios in 2015.Now quality may be worsening.In the two most recent quarters, analysts were surprised by the size of American Expresss provisions for credit losses.Other banks also increased provisions.Credit is cyclical and it would be a surprise if this time were different.A new concern is electronic fraud, notwithstanding companies efforts to thwart it.Still, the business that American Express joined 60 years ago will continue to grow, and American Express may well be a beneficiary.But others may be better placed.Mr Chenaults tenure may thus be remembered merely as a pause before the end of an era.
Apple should shrink its finance arm before it goes bananas:::::IT IS fashionable to say that tech firms will conquer the financial services industry.Yet in the case of Apple, it seems that the opposite is happening and finance is taking over tech by stealth.Since the death of Steve Jobs, its co-founder, in 2011, the worlds biggest firm by market value has sold hundreds of millions of phones with bionic chips and know-it-all digital assistants.But it has also grown a financial operation that is already, on some measures, roughly half the size of Goldman Sachs.Apple does not organise its financial activities into one subsidiary, but Schumpeter has lumped them together.The resultcall it Apple Capitalhas $262bn of assets, $108bn of debt, and has traded $1.6trn of securities since 2011.It appears to be run fairly cautiously and is part of a thriving firm, but it still deserves scrutiny.Companies have a history of being hurt by their financial arms; think General Electric (GE) or General Motors (GM).Apple Capital has lots of responsibilities but three stand out.It invests the firms mountain of surplus profits, mainly in highly rated instruments (this task seems to fall to Braeburn Capital, a subsidiary in Nevada, which uses some external fund managers).Apple Capital also uses derivatives in order to protect the firm against currency and interest-rate gyrations.And it manages Americas fifth-biggest corporate-debt pile by issuing Apple bonds as part of an elaborate strategy to limit tax bills.Apple Capital has become important to its parent.Since Jobs died, its assets have risen by 221%, twice as fast as the companys sales, reflecting Apples huge build-up of profits.Its investments are worth 32% of Apples market value, and its profits (investment income, plus gains on derivatives, less interest costs) have been 7% of Apples pre-tax profits so far this year.It is also sizeable compared with other financial firms.Consider four measures: assets, debt, credit exposure and profits.Depending on the yardstick, Apple Capital is 30-85% as big as Goldman Sachs.It is 22-42% as large as GE Capital was at its peak in 2007, just before things went down the tubes during the subprime crisis.Apple Capital is different from these firms in important ways.It does not take deposits and has much lower leverage.In their prime Goldman and GE Capital were run by hard-charging financiers, and made lots of loans.By contrast, Apple Capital does not make loans, and is not meant to be a profit centre in its own right.Nonetheless, it has become riskier, in three ways.First, Apple Capital is investing in racier assets, which involves taking credit risk.In 2011 a majority of its assets were risk-free: cash or government bonds.Today 68% are invested in other kinds of securities, mainly corporate bonds, which Apple says are generally investment grade.The shift may explain why Apples annual interest rate earned on its portfolio (2%) is now higher than that of the four other Silicon Valley firms with money mountains, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle.In total, they still have 66% of their portfolios squirrelled away in risk-free assets.Second, Apples derivatives book has got much bigger.Since 2011 its notional sizethe face value of its contractshas risen by 425%, to $124bn.This is still much smaller than big banks positions, but is the third-largest book of any non-financial firm in America, after GE and Ford.For every dollar of foreign sales, Apple has 89 cents of derivatives, compared with 57 cents for the other four tech giants.At points these derivatives have yielded big rewards.In 2015 they contributed $4bn, or 6% of Apples profits.But they have dangers, too.Apple says that its value-at-risk (VAR), a statistical measure of the maximum likely loss in an average day, is $434m.That is huge: similar to the combined VAR of the worlds top ten investment banks.In theory losses on derivatives would be offset by gains in the value of Apples underlying business.But the sheer size of these positions gives pause for thought.The last area of higher risk is Apples divided geography.Its foreign operation swims in cash while its domestic one drowns in debt.Profits made abroad are kept in foreign subsidiaries.That way Apple does not pay the 35% levy America charges when earnings are repatriated.Some 94% of Apple Capitals assets are offshore and cannot be tapped for ordinary purposes.The domestic business must do the hard work of paying for dividends and buy-backs.Its profits are not big enough to cover these, so it borrows.Domestic net debts have risen to $92bn, or five times domestic gross operating profits.Each year Apple must issue $30bn of bonds (including refinancing), similar to the average of Wall Streets five largest firms.Apples core business is so profitable that it isalmostinconceivable that a blow-up at Apple Capital could lead to it needing taxpayer or central-bank support, as was the case for GM and GE.Still, it is easy to imagine how Apple Capital could hurt its parent.A market shock could lead to losses on its portfolios.A two-percentage-point rise in interest rates would result in a loss of $10bn.If bond markets dried up, Apple might struggle to issue so much debt and have to bring home funds, incurring a big tax bill.It might also become tricky to run such a big derivatives portfolio.Dont upset the Apple cart Apple Capital has grown in a forgiving period for financial markets.That wont last.Over time, the risk of mission creep will rise, as will the temptation to invest in riskier assets.On the current trajectory, by 2022 its assets will reach $400bn and debts $250bn.By then financial regulators, who do not supervise Apple, will be grinding their teeth at night.According to a former manager who left in 2012, Apples financial gurus were careful because nobody wanted that 3am call from Steve Jobs.But Jobs isnt there any more.In any case, a fear of rebuke is not enough.If the tax laws change Tim Cook, Apples boss should wind down the structure that the firm has created.But even if the rules dont Apple Capital should be shrunk.Tech firms should seek to disrupt finance, not be seduced by it.
Will corporate tax cuts boost workers’ wages?:::::THE presidents tax promise has always been clear: he will reduce the amount middle-earners, but not rich Americans, must pay.Yet every time Donald Trump releases a plan, analysts say it does almost the opposite.The Tax Policy Centre, a think-tank, recently filled in the blanks in the latest Republican tax proposals and concluded that more than half of its giveaways would go to the top 1% of earners.Their incomes would rise by an average of $130,000; middle-earners would get just $660.The White House maintains that tax reform will deliver a much heftier boost to workers pay packets.Who is right?The disagreement boils down to who benefits when taxes on corporations fall.The Tax Policy Centre says it is mainly rich investors.But in a report released on October 16th, Mr Trumps Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) claimed that cutting the corporate-tax rate from 35% to 20%, as Republicans propose, would eventually boost annual wages by a staggering $4,000-9,000 for the average household.The claim has sparked a debate among economists that is as ill-tempered as it is geeky.Left-leaning economists are incredulous.Writing in the Wall Street Journal , Jason Furman, who led the CEA under Barack Obama, pointed out that if the report is right, wage increases would total about three to six times the cost of the tax cut.Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary, wrote that if a student submitted the CEA paper, he would be hard pressed to give it a passing grade.Conservative economists, such as Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University and Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago, have responded with a barrage of algebra and diagrams.They note that taxes, because they distort incentives, can cost the economy more than they raise in revenues.Economists call the extra cost deadweight loss.Once it is reclaimed, tax cuts could benefit workers and firms by more than they cost the Treasury.For instance, investment might rise after corporate taxes fall, sparking competition for workers and pushing wages up.Whats more, standard theory says that, in a small economy integrated with global markets, workers will pay for taxes on capital, because firms can up sticks when levies rise.Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong, two left-wing economists, have fired back their own Greek and graphs, laced with snark.But Messrs Mankiw and Mulligan showed that the CEAs prediction is at least logically possible.That does not mean it is reasonable.There are three reasons to doubt it.First, to calculate its figures, the White House relied on two studies, neither from a peer-reviewed journal, of how wages have varied with corporate-tax rates internationally and across American states.A recent review of such papers, by Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service, found both to be statistically flawed.In any case, Mihir Desai of Harvard Business School, who co-wrote one of them, says that the CEA misinterpreted his work.If you assumed the corporate tax creates a deadweight loss worth ten times the revenue it raises, you might justify the CEAs numbers, he says.But that is implausible.(As The Economist went to press, the CEA was preparing a second report using other methods to justify the figures.)Second, the American economy is plainly not small.This makes capital less flighty.And although it may have become more mobile because of globalisation, many investment opportunities in Americain Silicon Valley, sayare hard to replicate elsewhere.This also makes a high corporate-tax rate less likely to send investment abroad.Third, the White Houses analysis ignores other features of the Republican tax plan, like a proposal to switch to a territorial corporate-tax system.Because this would stop taxing the foreign profits of American firms, it might actually encourage investment abroad.And if, as is likely, the tax cut is financed by borrowing, it is likely to push up interest rates and the dollar.That would create an economic drag.The White House has rushed to include the CEAs paper in its argument for tax cuts.Yet the estimate is more than a little optimistic.There is no clear relationship between recent corporate-tax cuts and wage growth in rich countries (see chart).Even the Tax Foundation, a think-tank that looks favourably on corporate-tax cuts, predicts a much smaller wage boost.Should Republicans get their way, Americans can expect a pay risejust not a bumper one.
Silicon speculators:::::EXCHANGE-TRADED funds (ETFs) were supposed to make investing easy.Instead of spending hours researching individual stocks and bonds or paying an expert fund manager, investors could simply buy a few ETFs.But now there are too many to choose from.BlackRock offers 346 in America alone.Some investors need help allocating their money between different funds.Many companies now offer automated wealth managers (AWMs) that perform this service.AWMs have been around for less than ten years, but they have proliferated, offering different services in different countries.Often, they are called robo-advisers, but this term can be misleading.Some offer clients detailed advice about how to save.For example, Wealthfront, an American AWM, predicts the cost of sending a student to a given college, taking into account increases in tuition fees and likely financial aid.It then suggests how parents can save in a tax-efficient way.Other AWMs are simpler.Wealthify, based in Cardiff, rejects the term robo-adviser because it does not provide advice.It merely allocates clients funds based on how much they wish to invest, when they expect to need the money and the degree of risk they will accept.Nonetheless, AWMs have a few things in common.They typically invest in low-cost ETFs and charge very low fees.Annual charges are usually only a fraction of a percentage point of an investors total savings, plus any fees levied by the ETFs.AWMs target cash-conscious investors who cannot afford or do not wish to pay a human adviser.Millennials are considered good customers because they are used to doing things online and are starting to earn money.But generally they do not have a lot of it.Individual savers tend to have small portfolios.At Betterment, the largest independent American AWM measured by assets under management, the average client had $27,400 in June 2017.At Wealthfront, its rival, the average client had $40,900.Their business model leaves AWMs with a problem.To make a profit despite low fees, they must attract lots of client money.Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar, an investment research firm, estimates that, depending on its model, an AWM would need between $16bn and $40bn to cover its costs.No independent AWMs have reached profitability, though some are close.Betterment says it has $11bn under management.But for most AWMs, profitability remains distant.Only a few manage over $1bn or have more than 100,000 clients.To get more clients, many are tying up with established wealth managers.On October 5th Aviva, a British insurer, said it would buy a majority stake in Wealthify.Michelle Pearce, Wealthifys co-founder and chief investment officer, noted that Aviva has 15m customers in Britain, who can use her firms services through Avivas portal.To stay independent, AWMs need to get big quickly, in part by seeking customers established firms neglect.Similarly, acquired AWMs often pitch their products to people their parent firms would not otherwise serve.These customers tend to have little wealth and to be new investors.There are dangers in this: they may place too much faith in AWMs more optimistic projections of future riches.Wealthfront even allows its customers to borrow against the value of their savings, on the basis that its funds will provide better returns than its interest rates of 3.5-4.75%.Like their human counterparts, robos may have a tendency to oversell their investing prowess.
How leading American newspapers got people to pay for news:::::SOMETIMES it feels like the 1970s in the New York Times and Washington Post newsrooms: reporters battling each other to break news about scandals that threaten to envelop the White House and the presidency of Donald Trump.Only now their scoops come not in the morning edition but in a tweet or iPhone alert near the end of the day.It is like old times in another way: both newspapers are getting readers to pay, offsetting advertising revenue relinquished to the internet.After years of giving away scoops for nothing online, and cutting staff, the Times and Post are focusing on subscriptionsmostly digital oneswhich now rake in more money than ads do.Their experiences offer lessons for the industry in America, although only a handful of newspapers have a chance at matching their success.A subscription-first approach relies on tapping a national and international market of hundreds of millions of educated English-language readers and converting a fraction of those into paying customers.With enough digital subscribersMark Thompson, chief executive of the New York Times , believes his newspaper can get to 10m, from 2m todaythe subscriptions-first model could (in theory) generate more profits than business models dependent on print advertising used to.Such optimism is hard to summon after two decades of accelerating decline.In that period American newspapers lost nearly 40% of their daily circulation, which fell to 35m last year, estimates the Pew Research Centre.Annual ad revenues have shrunk by 63%, or $30bn, just in the past ten years (see chart).Newsrooms have shed 40% of reporters and editors since 2006.High returns on equity turned into single digits, losses or bankruptcy.Like Detroit carmakers before the arrival of the Japanese, in pre-internet days newspapers flush with profits from a captive market grew lazy and complacent.Some big-city papers, like the Philadelphia Inquirer or the Baltimore Sun , splurged on foreign bureaus and fluffy suburban sections whether or not readers wanted them; classified ads alone covered these costs many times over.Now such newspapers are struggling to remain relevant to diminished readerships.A tier below, hundreds of local ones are dying or turning into advertiser sheets; newspaper chains, some managed by investment funds, have snapped up many of them, maintaining high profits by sacking journalists.From the ashes of newsprint The Times and Post have been buffeted by the same forces.But now each is in turnaround.The Times has doubled its digital-only subscribers in less than two years; the Post has managed the feat in ten months, and now has more than 1m.Both have staunched losses.Revenue at the Times had fallen by more than 20% in three years to less than $1.6bn in 2009; this year they are on pace to climb back above $1.6bn, led by digital subscriptions.(Return on equity still fell, to 3% last year from 37% in 2001.)The Post had also been losing millions before Jeff Bezos, boss of Amazon, bought it in 2013.The newspaper is now privately held and does not disclose revenues and profits, but Fred Ryan, the publisher, says both are growing and the newspaper is on track for its most profitable year in a decade.The Wall Street Journal added more than 300,000 digital subscriptions in the year to June, but a sharp fall in advertising crimped revenues by 6% at Dow Jones, the division of News Corp, Rupert Murdochs media empire, that houses the newspaper.How have they done it?Early attempts by newspapers to put up digital paywalls floundered, and met with derision from critics and competitors vaunting the internets ability to generate huge audiences for free content.How could anyone hope to attract paying digital customers when they could go elsewhere online for free?The Times hit upon the answer in 2011, when it introduced a metered paywall, something the Financial Times was also trying.Visitors to the website could read a few free articles a month, after which they would be asked to pay.This approach is now standard across journalism (including at this newspaper), but it was controversial at the time.At News Corp Mr Murdoch erected a hard paywall at all his newspapers in the belief that giving away his product online would cripple the more profitable print editions.Those suffered anyway, and he later dropped the paywall at the Sun , a tabloid, and has allowed some flexibility at the Journal .Softer paywalls have created funnels to suck in customers.On a whiteboard in Mr Thompsons office at the Times is a diagram to illustrate the approach.At the top, where the funnel is widest, are all those who visit its digital site.(In September 104m people in America did so, according to comScore.)At the narrow end are its 2m paying digital-only subscribers (plus 1m print subscribers).Mr Thompsons main preoccupation is to tweak the geometry of the funnel to shift more people from free to paid.At the Post , Mr Ryan is also busy funnelling.The job of funnel mathematician did not exist at newspapers six years ago.Now it is one of the most important functions a digital site has.The Times and Post conduct numerous tests of different ways to trigger the paywall, for instance if a visitor returns to the same columnist.It is A/B testing like at a technology company, Mr Ryan says, except it is more like A to Z testing.The Post has settled on three site visits a month before hitting the paywall, which means 85% of visitors will not encounter it.The other 15% are asked to subscribe at the introductory rate of 99 cents for the first four weeks.Both newspapers sift through data about what visitors do just before stumping up.The Post looks at the month zero of a readers pre-subscription activity on the site.Mr Ryan credits the effort, which began a year ago, with helping to convert more visitors to subscribers this year.Another factor has helped the two papers: Mr Trump.Since his election they have revived an old rivalry, vying for sensational scoops, sometimes several in a day.Mr Trumps attacks on both newspapersthe failing New York Times, more fake news from the Amazon Washington Posthave almost certainly helped their bottom lines.His presidency has created an urgency around news that has made old-fashioned journalism more in vogue than it has been probably since Watergate.Fake news shared on social media has reinforced a feeling that real news costs money.Trump bump The newspapers bosses agree Mr Trump has been good for business, but add they were ready for the moment.As Mr Bezos is fond of saying, you cant shrink your way to profitability.He invested in the Post after buying it, hiring technologists to improve its digital presence.He has also added reporters (the Post now has 750 newsroom employees and counting).Marty Baron, editor of the Post , added a rapid-response investigative team of eight people this year.Dean Baquet, executive editor of the Times , has expanded the Washington bureau twice since the election.(The Times paid for new reporters in part by cutting dozens of other editorial jobs.)The subscription-first approach justifies adding reporters.By increasing the quality of the product, newspapers hope to lure subscribers.But it is not clear others can replicate that virtuous circle so easily.Many regional papers are nurturing digital subscribersthey all have their funnels now, toobut are doing so on a much smaller scale.They will have to come up with other ways to make money to survive.They have to do everything, says Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University.... is present By everything media experts like Mr Rosen mean ending a reliance on two traditional sources of revenue: ads and subscriptions.At regional papers, unlike the national ones, prospects for both are limited by the size of the metropolitan market.Savings from printing fewer copies are smallprinting and distribution costs are mostly fixedso they must either cut staff or find other ways to make money.This may include staging trade fairs, offering memberships with perks, even e-commerce partnerships.Such sidelines help to ward off staff cuts; to be a community hub, newspapers must also cover communities effectively.They may forgo costly (and wasteful) foreign and national bureaus.But to attract local readers, they must provide relevant coverage of city halls, courthouses, police precincts or schools.Take the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, a privately owned newspaper which has managed to keep the newsroom humming along.Almost annually Mike Klingensmith, the publisher, and a few of his senior executives meet with their counterparts at the Dallas Morning News , Boston Globe and one or two other independently owned newspapers.They sign non-disclosure agreements and then share ideas about how to make money.In the past year Mr Klingensmith has adopted three of them, adding several million dollars in revenue: organising an advertiser fair to attract new clients; putting on a consumer travel show; and starting a glossy quarterly print magazine.The Star Tribune now sells digital subscriptions (nearly 50,000) and adverts; delivers a thick Sunday paper full of features (which accounts for 54% of print ad revenue); and is expanding the Saturday print edition.It conducts in-depth investigations that wins awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 2013, and makes podcasts and daily videos.Several reporters cover city hall.In the past year an additional one was dispatched to Washington.Mr Klingensmith and Rene Sanchez, the editor, believe quality is key; nearly 20% of the budget goes to the newsroom, which has kept a headcount of 245 for seven years.That gives the Star Tribune s funnel mathematician a product to sell.Patrick Johnston, a digital executive poached from Target, the retail store, and his boss Jim Bernard, a former executive at Marketwatch, a business-news website, explain how a local newspapers funnel vision is different.They are, like the big papers, interested in the visitors who they call intenders, people whose browsing behaviour suggests they may be ready to subscribe.But whereas many visitors to the Times and Post are potential intenders, the Star Tribune can dismiss about 50% of its online trafficthe grazers from outside Minnesota who clicked a linkand focus on the other half.Reducing friction is vital; they have got 25% more intenders to subscribe since installing PayPal as a payment option.Hold the presses The downside to the ease of online subscriptions is the ease of cancelling them.Newspapers guard their rates of digital churn closely because they are so highdespite an all-out effort the Star Tribune keeps only one in two subscribers after 14 months (the Times and Post numbers are better, executives there say, without giving figures).A subscribers early days are essential.Keeping a visitor engaged with the site is similar to getting a guest on Targets website to put another item in their basket, Mr Johnston says.It also means competing with ever more rivals for peoples attention: bigger fish like the Times and Post , but also Netflix, Spotify or Candy Crush.The virtue of digital subscriptions is that they build a deeper relationship between readers and newspapers than when distribution meant throwing broadsheets onto doorsteps.Newspapers nowadays know a lot more about their customers tastes.That lets them tailor the experience to readers individually, with the aim of keeping them around longer.It can be, as Mr Thompson says, an annuity for the newspaper.But the newspaper has to be worth the cover price.
Reports of the MBA’s demise are exaggerated:::::THE MBA is both revered and reviled.To boosters it has advanced the science of management and helped firms, and countries, to grow.Detractors say it offers little of practical value and instils in students a sense of infallibility that can sink companies, and knock economies sideways.The critics are currently the louder of the two, claiming that particularly the full-time, campus-based MBAs have reached saturation point, with too many mediocre courses chasing too few candidates.The Financial Times recently likened them to the Grand Tour of business education in an age of Airbnb.There is a widespread feeling that full-time MBAs are on their last legs, concedes Sangeet Chowfla, the president of the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), a business-school association.Decline is allegedly hastened by competing qualifications, such as the Masters in Management.MiMs have much the same syllabus as MBAs, but unlike them, take students without management experience straight from undergraduate degrees.They often cost half as much and do not make participants interrupt their careers to study.Such degrees have long been popular at European business schools.Now Americans are following suit.Non-MBAs now attract 35% of people who sit the GMAT, the de facto business-school entrance exam, up from 30% five years ago.MBAs share has dipped proportionately.When Kings College London launches a business school in November, it will offer specialised Masters courses but no MBAs.Stephen Bach, its dean, says that employers like to recruit younger students because they are more flexible and culturally attuned.But look across the world and MBA programmes are thriving.The popular myth of their demise is just that, says Mr Chowfla.Rapid growth in the overall business-education market has offset MBAs declining share.Global applications to MBA programmes in the 2016/17 academic year grew by 6%, according to GMAC.In Asia, they rose by 13%; 132,000 students now apply to Asian schools, nearly as many as to American ones.Applications in Europe increased by 3%.American courses that enroll more than 200 MBA studentswhich dominate The Economist s ranking of MBA programmes (see article )report a 4% rise.Demand has, it is true, fallen at smaller American schools.Those with fewer than 200 students saw applications drop by 6% this year.These schools enroll around half of all students in America.But they face distinct pressures.One is Donald Trump.In a survey by Carrington Crisp, a consultancy, around 40% of potential applicants said that the new president had discouraged them from studying in the country (just 3% said he made them more likely to study there).His anti-immigrant administrations plans to tighten the rules for graduate work visas may have something to do with this.International students are feeling left behind, explains one who opted to study in France over America.Dislike of Trumpism will not deter applicants from the finest American establishments.Few institutions anywhere can match the cachet of Harvard, Wharton or Kellogg, which charge a premium as a result.Second-tier American programmes are nearly as expensive, but nothing like as prestigious.Foreign students may opt for cheaper courses in countries with brighter job prospects.That bodes well for non-American MBAs.One partial exception is Britain.British schools lure students from the European Union, in part because they enjoy an automatic right to work at Londons big banks and professional-services firms.Brexit would change that.But British courses are at least getting cheaper for non-Brits.The collapse in the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016 has cut the cost to Europeans of attending London Business School by 14,000 ($16,000), for instance.That may help explain why three in four British schools report a rise in applications this year, according to GMAC.If Britain crashes out of the EU the pound could weaken again, making courses look cheaper still.By then, however, the discount may not be sufficient to attract anyone.
Italy’s fourth-biggest bank returns to the stockmarket:::::A TELEVISION advertisement for Monte dei Paschi di Siena begins with a toddler tumbling and a gymnast stumbling.Falling is the first thing we learn, declares the voice-over.The second is getting up again.Italys fourth-biggest bank and the worlds oldest, which was bailed out by the Italian government in July, has had several bruising falls over the years.On October 25th it returned to the stockmarket after a ten-month hiatusthe latest stage of its plan to get back on its feet.The shares closed higher on the day, at 4.55 ($5.37), but still far below the 6.49 the government paid.Trading was suspended last December, after a failed private-sector attempt to save the bank through a share issue.The government said it would get involved.In July the European Commission approved a 8.1bn precautionary recapitalisation.European rules say banks receiving such aid must be solvent, the capital injection must not distort competition and the capital shortfall must be identified by a stress test, such as the one Monte dei Paschi failed in July 2016.Shareholders and junior bondholders must share the pain.Therefore, alongside the injection of 3.9bn by the government, 4.3bn-worth of subordinated bonds are being converted to equity.Much of this is held by retail investors, many of whom may have thought they were buying a safe investment.Some of these can choose to swap their new shares for senior bonds.The exchange will run from October 30th to November 17th.If, as expected, they all make the swap, the governments stake will rise from 52% to 68%, at an additional cost of 1.5bn.By 2021 Monte dei Paschi must return to the private sector.The plan also disposes of 28.6bn-worth, at gross value, of non-performing loans, of which most are being offloaded into a separate vehicle and securitised.Atlante 2, a private bank-rescue fund, will buy most of the mezzanine and junior tranches for 1.6bn; the senior debt will be sold on the market, partly backed by a state-guarantee scheme.The scheme is rounded off by the banks restructuring.This includes simplifying and digitising retail banking, strengthening the wealth-management business and improving credit-risk management.The number of branches will be cut from 2,000 to 1,400; 350 have already closed.Monte dei Paschis headcount of 25,500 will be reduced by 5,500; 1,800 staff have already departed.In August Marco Morelli, the banks boss, sent an e-mail to all staff asking for ideas.He received 1,000 replies.He then spent two weeks touring the country, meeting staff in several cities.At each encounter Mr Morelli projected onto a screen three of the most critical e-mailed responses.The message he sought to transmit: no more alibis.Things may be looking up.Pavilion, an investment services firm, suggests that new regulation and accounting rules will make life harder for Italian banks dealing with bad loans, but cyclical factors will offset this.In August net non-performing loans fell to 65.3bn, down from 86.8bn in December, according to Italys banking association.UniCredit, the countrys biggest lender, announced preliminary third-quarter earnings on October 24th: pre-tax profits rose by 45%, year on year, helped by the sale of Pioneer, a fund manager.But the Sienese lender has a lot of work to do.Its gross non-performing exposure ratio is projected to fall from 34.5% in December 2016 to 12.9% within five years.That is a little below last Decembers Italian average, but still much higher than the European average of 5.1%.Meanwhile, new inquiries are under way into two of the banks former managers for allegedly obstructing supervisors.Getting up again may be a struggle.
Firms should make more information about salaries public:::::SWEDES discuss their incomes with a frankness that would horrify Britons or Americans.They have little reason to be coy; in Sweden you can learn a strangers salary simply by ringing the tax authorities and asking.Pay transparency can be a potent weapon against persistent inequities.When hackers published e-mails from executives at Sony Pictures, a film studio, the world learned that some of Hollywoods most bankable female stars earned less than their male co-stars.The revelation has since helped women in the industry drive harder bargains.Yet outside Nordic countries transparency faces fierce resistance.Donald Trump recently cancelled a rule set by Barack Obama requiring large firms to provide more pay data to anti-discrimination regulators.Even those less temperamentally averse to sunlight than Mr Trump balk at what can seem an intrusion into a private matter.That is a shame.Despite the discomfort that transparency can cause, it would be better to publish more information.There is a straightforward economic argument for making pay public.A salary is a pricethat of an individual workers labourand markets work best when prices are known.Public pay data should help people make better decisions about which skills to acquire and where to work.Yet experiments with transparency are motivated only rarely by a love of market efficiency, and more often by worry about inequality.In the early 1990s, it was outrage at soaring executive salaries which led American regulators to demand more disclosure of CEOs pay.Such transparency does not always work as intended.Compensation exploded in the 1990s, as firms worried that markets would interpret skimpy pay-packets as an indicator of the quality of executive hires.Despite this, bosses tend to oppose transparency, for understandable reasons.Firms have an easier time in pay negotiations when they know more about salaries than workers do.What is more, shining a light on pay gaps can poison morale, as some workers learn that they earn substantially less than their peers.A study of employees at the University of California, for instance, found that when workers were given access to a database listing the salary of every public employee, job satisfaction among those on relatively low wages fell.In industries in which competition for talented workers is intense, the pernicious effects on morale of unequal pay create an incentive to split the high-wage parts of the business from the rest.Research published in 2016 concluded that diverging pay between firms (as opposed to within them) could account for most of the increase in American inequality in recent decades.That divergence in turn resulted from increased segregation of workers into high- and low-wage firms.Yet transparency increases dissatisfaction not because it introduces information where there was none before, but because it corrects misperceptions.Surveys routinely find that workers overestimate their performance and pay relative to their peers.This is true across economies as well as within firms.In 2001, tax records in Norway were put online, allowing anyone to see easily what other Norwegians had earned and paid in tax.Reported happiness among the rich rose significantly, while the well-being of poorer people fell as they learned their true position on the economic ladder.Better information changes behaviour.Low-paid workers at the University of California became more likely to seek new jobs after salary data became public.In Norway the poor became more likely to support redistribution.Transparency might threaten the function of capitalist economies if people were implacably opposed to pay gaps, but they are not.A study published in 2015 of factory workers in India, for instance, found that unequal pay worsened morale and led to reduced effort when workers could not see others contributions, but not when productivity differences were easily observable.Yet in the modern economy, individual contributions are often devilishly hard to assess.Simple theory suggests that workers are paid according to their productivity.Were they to earn more, their employers would lose money; were they to earn less, other firms could profit by hiring away underpaid employees.But although it is easy enough to see how many shirts a textile worker stitches in an hour, it is much harder to evaluate the contribution of one member of a team that has spent years developing new software.When it is difficult to observe important parts of a job, economists believe that trying to link pay closely to narrow measures of performance can be misguided.Workers inevitably neglect murky but critical tasks in favour of those the boss can easily quantify.In the knowledge economy, therefore, the relationship between pay and productivity is often loose.Pay gaps are often nonetheless justified.Workers with scarce and valuable skills can easily threaten to leave, and can therefore bargain for higher pay.Those fat pay-packets serve the economy by encouraging young workers to develop skills that are in short supplyprovided, of course, that they know how much they can expect to earn.But the difficulty in observing productivity allows factors to influence pay, such as office politics, discrimination or a simple tendency to silence the squeakiest wheels with grease.Open-plan offices Not every country will opt for radical transparency.Even Nordic governments continue to tweak their policies: in 2014 Norway banned anonymous searching of its tax database, so citizens could see who had nosed around their finances.But increased openness about pay could improve both the fairness and the functioning of the economy.When pay is public, it is not the justifiable inequities that create the most discomfort, but those firms cannot defend.Sources
Sauce for a Brussels goose:::::DIVORCES are rarely easy.In the 16 months since Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum, the negotiations have made little progress.One of the trickiest aspects is the amount that Britain should pay to meet its existing spending commitments for EU programmes.This is not analogous to dividing up the bill in a restaurant, and deciding who had the lobster and who stuck to the mixed green salad.Take the cost of EU officials pensions.The tricky bit in calculating it is that pensions are long-term commitments; a bureaucrat who starts work in Brussels today might still be collecting a pension 70 years from now.Working out the cost is fiendishly complicated, requiring estimates of how much wages will rise (if the pension is linked to salary) and how long employees will live.Then the sum of future benefits has to be discounted at some rate to work out the current cost; the higher the discount rate, the lower the presumed expense.The EU doesnt pre-fund pensions for its officials; it pays them as they fall due.So the calculations dont need to involve any assumptions about investment returns.But the cost estimate needed for Britain to pay its fair share will depend on what discount rate gets used.And that could be the subject of a big dispute.In its annual accounts, the EU calculates a pension liability of 67.2bn ($79.3bn).This is based on a discount rate of 1.7% in nominal terms and 0.3% in real terms (after inflation).This cost has jumped from around 35bn in 2011 because the discount rate has fallen sharply.This rate has not been plucked out of thin air; it is based on the interest rates paid on EU government debt.An agreement to pay a pension is, after all, a debt like any other.So it may seem that there is little to argue about; Britain should simply cough up its share of 67.2bn.However, when it comes to calculating the contributions of employees, the EU uses a completely different approach.As a Eurostat document shows*, the discount rate in these numbers is a 22-year average of real government-bond yields.This includes the period from 1995 to 2000, when real rates were often 4% or higher.The result is a nominal discount rate of 4.8% and a real rate of 3.1%.Up until 2012, the EU used a 12-year average of bond yields.But it is steadily moving to a 30-year average by 2021, which means that those high real yields from the late 1990s will stay in the numbers for longer.The remarkable result is that while the discount rate in the balance-sheet calculations has been falling, the discount rate used for the contribution of officials rose in 2016.The good news for employees is that they were required to contribute 0.5% less of their salaries than would otherwise have been the case.Had the EU used the discount rate it applied to its balance-sheet to calculate the size of contributions, its officials would have had to stump up a lot moreresulting in significant cuts in take-home pay.So it is understandable that it has softened the blow.But Britain is surely at liberty to argue that what is sauce for EU bureaucrats ought to be sauce for British taxpayers as well.Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels, concluded that, if this more generous discount rate were used, the British pensions bill would fall by between a third and more than half.In cash, that could be 2.5bn-4bn.All Britain has to do, then, is argue this case.But EU negotiators might ask how Britain calculates the pension liability for its own public servants.Unfortunately, the accounts of the England and Wales teachers pension scheme show a real discount rate of just 0.24%.That would undermine the logic of the British argument.Another approach might be for Britain simply to pay its share of the pensions bill every year; after all, that is what the EU does at the moment.Then Britain would not be punished by the use of a historically low discount rate.But the snag would be that Britain could still be paying out for some bureaucrats in the 2070s, creating the kind of festering sore that the countrys tabloids will complain about for decades (and demand that some future government repudiates).Perhaps some cunning British civil servant has found a way of escaping this dilemma.When Buttonwood contacted the Department for Exiting the EU (DEXEU), he was told it was a matter for the Treasury; the Treasury said it was a matter for DEXEU.There was no news on whether either department planned to hold its Christmas party in a brewery.
Aldi and Lidl grow despite ignoring the internet:::::THE aisles are wide, the lights bright and shelves low.Most obviously, however, the apples shine and the broccoli beckons.For those used to the cramped, dimly lit Aldi stores of yore, all expense spared, the new supermarket in Herten, Germany, is almost shocking.Opened in April this is the prototype for a vast new renovation and expansion programme across Europe, Britain and America.It is the discount giants big bet on the future of shopping, all the more daring as the money is going almost entirely on bricks and mortar.Defying the conventional wisdom that customers want both in-store and online shopping (omnichannel in the jargon) Aldi wants to conquer the retail world by ignoring the internet.As too, to a lesser extent, does its great German rival Lidl.Plenty of other grocers reckon this may be the miscalculation that eventually brings them down.Founded in 1945 and 1973 respectively, Aldi (split into two legally separate companies, Aldi Nord and Aldi Sd) and Lidl have been eating up the competition, especially since the financial crash of 2008.In the cut-throat British market, Aldi (owned by Sd) increased its groceries share to 6.8%, from 6.2% just a year ago; Lidls jumped from 4.6% to 5.2% (see chart).At home in Germany, Aldi Nords market share has reached 12.9%, and Lidls 8.9%.However, Aldi acknowledges that it must change to keep growing at this pace.Kay Rueschoff, Aldi Nords director of marketing, concedes that low prices, the discounters hallmark, are no longer enough.To lure middle-class shoppers, Aldi has to focus on quality, toohence the shiny store in Herten.In all, Aldi Nord is spending 5.2bn ($6.1bn) on revamping its 4,800 stores in Europe (excluding Britain and Ireland) and opening hundreds of new ones.Besides ambient interiors, there is more fruit, veg and wine.In Britain, Aldi Sd is unveiling about 70 new stores a year, often in impeccably middle-class areas that were once the preserve of posher British rivals such as Sainsburys.Aldi plans to open 900 swanky new stores in America, putting it third in the country by store count, behind Walmart and Kroger.(Lidl has just begun operating in America, and aims to have 100 stores within the year.)Mr Rueschoff bristles at any suggestion that Aldi is changing too much.The new stores still sell only about 1,400 items, as opposed to the 50,000 or so on many rivals shelves, enabling big economies of scale.At Lidl, a new generation of senior managers last year began to upgrade their stores in a similar way.They resigned in February after their effort to expand Lidls small online offering was deemed too radical a departure from the discounters original, tight-fisted formula.But the idea that opening revamped stores as rapidly as possible is the best way to win market share, as well as make money, remains.The discounters reason that whereas their conventional rivals, such as Sainsburys, might be able to win some customers online, they will not make much money out of it.Take Britain, one of the most advanced places in the world for e-commerce.Britons buy 7.3% of their groceries online, up from 6.7% a year ago, second only to South Koreans.Tesco, Sainsburys and others have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on sophisticated internet operations.Yet, as Bryan Roberts, an analyst at TCC Global, a consultancy, argues, these stores are merely cannibalising themselves, driving most of their shoppers from their most profitable channel (the store) to the least profitable (online).Operating margins in the supermarket business are notoriously low, but even lower online, says Mr Robertsabout 3% versus 0.5% or less.Fleets of vans and drivers are expensive, but, argues Walter Blackwood, a consultant, supermarkets dare not charge cost price (or more) for the service as customers expect it to be virtually free.He attributes this in part to the baleful effect of the online behemoth Amazon, which does not seek to profit from the actual delivery of goods, thus creating the conviction that deliveries should be free.Customers expect the same from everybody else.For the moment, Aldis decision to spend its money on physical stores is working.In less developed e-commerce markets, like America, they may have even more of an advantage.But the proportion of people shopping online can only go one way, so the strategy carries risks.Supermarkets are learning to make online sales more profitable, through click and collect schemes, for example, or raising the minimum transaction value for deliveries.A decisive clash of competing retail philosophies looms.To the victor, arugula.To the loser, turnips.
Bloomberg lays off executives as reorganization continues:::::Bloomberg has laid off a number of executives in its global media licensing business, as well as in the digital and newsletters division, amid another reorganization at the financial media company, The Post has learned.The belt-tightening comes as the company, which charges $24,000 a year for its financial data and news terminals, opens a state-of-the art building in London thats been years in the making, even as banks flee the UK capital over Brexit concerns.The latest Bloomberg downsizing is aimed at combining the duties of its licensing and digital businesses, which are increasingly overlapping, one insider told The Post.The news of layoffs was first reported by Digiday.Bloomberg insiders have fretted that the pink slips are just the beginning.On Sept. 22, Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Mickelthwait sent a long letter to staffers that was interpreted as a warning of impending cuts.A more nimble organization should help us produce better stories faster, the letter read.Elsewhere, he called for fewer layers of management and editing to slow us down.He also laid out a plan for smaller news bureaus in order to cut down on turf wars.
Amazon shares skyrocket on strong earnings post-Whole Foods buy:::::Jeff Bezos swallowed 460 Whole Foods stores and never lost his footing.Amazon.com, the moguls e-commerce giant, blew away Wall Street expectations in the third quarter, producing profits and sales that exceeded expectations.The solid quarter where Amazon Web Services, retail sales and services like Amazon Music all produced solid increases sent Amazon shares soaring 8 percent in after-hours trading, to over $1,000 a share.Amazon reported sales rose 34 percent in the quarter, to $43.7 billion, from a year ago while profits, at $256 million, were flat compared to last year.Amazon shelled out $13.4 billion for the upscale grocery chain its largest-ever acquisition and gained positive media coverage for lowering prices.We were pleased by the better-than-expected profitability in what is clearly an investment year for Amazon, Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a note.The companys solid quarter was underpinned by the introduction of three new Echo devices and a 59 percent rise in subscription services, which includes Prime and Amazon Music.Amazon, in a statement, said it expects fourth quarter sales to increase between 28 percent and 38 percent to between $56 billion and $60 billion.On a conference call to discuss third quarter results, General Counsel David Zapolsky said some credit for the solid quarter also has got to go to Prime Day the annual event where goods and services are drastically marked down.see also Whole Foods dominating the competition since Amazon takeover Whole Foods is feasting on its competitors customers with... We had a very strong Prime Day [in July], which carried into the quarter, said Zapolsky, adding that the event was stronger than we had anticipated.The company also got a boost from launching month-to-month Prime, which allows consumers to pay the $99 annual Prime membership fee on a monthly basis for $10.99.Monthly Prime has been a big driver, Zapolsky added.The company continues to integrate Whole Foods into its ecosystem as well, introducing Amazon lockers into some of its stores.The lockers allow Prime customers to return and pick up items that they bought online at Whole Foods stores.We do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods, and the lockers there, said Olsavasky.Industry experts have speculated that Amazon will also get into the pharmaceutical business.While Olsavasky steered clear of speaking specifically about the pharmacy business, the executive did say that, Whole Foods gives us a vast head start to expand into a number of categories.Despite the attention on the Whole Foods acquisition, Amazons profit engine continues to be its cloud computing division known as Amazon Web Services.AWS revenue jumped 42 percent, to $4.6 billion, in the quarter.Olsavasky flagged Amazons video business as growth engine as well.The video business is having great results with our Prime customers, he said.It drives higher membership, and we know Prime members who watch Prime videos spend more on Amazon.
Drinkers don’t care about Anheuser-Busch anymore:::::Americans last year continued to lose their thirst for Bud.The flagship brew of Anheuser-Busch InBev saw US shipments of the famous lager fall to 14.4 million barrels last year down 60 percent from the 35.2 million barrels it shipped in 1988, its peak year, according to Beer Marketers Insights.Consumers first shifted to light beers, and now theyre shifting to imported and craft beers, BMI President Benj Steinman told The Post.Long ago, the light trend made Bud Light the best-selling beer in the country but even that brand has been a bit flat.Its shipments are down 15 percent since 2008, to 35.2 million barrels last year.Overall, Anheuser-Busch InBev said Thursday that third-quarter US revenue for the entire Budweiser brand fell 2.2 percent while it grew 4.4 percent outside of the country.Theyve really been pushing Bud out globally, Steinman said.But in the US, its become an older brand with a less popular style.AB InBev also reported that US sales for all of its brands, including Becks, Corona and Stella Artois, fell 5.6 percent.We cant remember a quarter as bad, Trevor Stirling, the Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, wrote in an update.The dismal performance in the US the Belgian brewers largest market sent AB InBev shares down 1 percent, to $120.41.The poor domestic showing could follow AB InBev overseas.The International Wines and Spirits Record calculated the global market for all alcoholic drinks contracted 1.3 percent in 2016 far greater than the average decline of 0.3 percent in the previous five years.Beer led that decline by falling 1.8 percent.
James Simons says it’s ‘basically terrible’ that Trump is president:::::James Simons who, looking at his winnings in recent years, might be the smartest guy on Wall Street says hes baffled by our current political climate.The billionaire brainiac, who founded the $50 billion quantitative hedge fund Rennaissance Technologies in 1982, said Thursday that he doesnt see anything unusual in the market compared to previous eras, but he wasnt able to say the same about politics.Obviously, politically its a time that I dont think anyone alive in the United States has ever seen and I dont know what to make of it, Simons said at a breakfast hosted by IESE Business School.And he wasnt shy about pointing fingers at President Trump.I think its basically terrible that we have a president remotely like our current president.Weve had some doozies but never of that caliber, Simons said.Simons comments stand in sharp contrast to current RenTec co-CEO Bob Mercer, who was a major donor to the Trump campaign and other right-wing causes.Simons did not address political differences with his colleague in his remarks Thursday.Simons tried to offer some hope, noting the US made it through the Vietnam War and Civil War.I think we can weather anything for at least three to four years except the possibility of somebody dropping an atomic bomb, which I think is remote but its the only thing that really, really worries me.The rest, I suppose, will pass, he said.Simons offered that Trumps victory last year was due to people being left out of recovery following the financial crisis.Simons, a mathematician by training, has founded several organizations dedicated to promoting research and education in math and science.
Tiffany bets NYC pop-up stores will renew sparkle:::::Tiffany & Co., unable to build its same-store sales over the past 2/ years, will reach deep into its bag of tricks this holiday season.The storied jeweler will open two tourist-focused pop-up stores in Manhattan next month one in Grand Central Terminal and the other in Rockefeller Center, The Post has learned.It is believed to be the first time Tiffanys has turned to pop-up stores in the US although the company may have operated a few overseas, sources said.The pop-ups will stock pre-wrapped jewelry, accessories and home gifts among other items.Tiffany & Co. has long been a destination for visitors from around the world, Senior Vice President Philippe Galti said in a statement.With new concept stores at two iconic New York City landmarks, were embracing the spirit of gifting this holiday season and beyond.The pop-up stores will be open for 12 to 18 months, according to a spokesman.Tiffany could use the boost of some high-volume stores.In the six months ended July 31, total same-store sales dipped 1 percent while total sales inched up 2 percent although they fell in the Americas division, the companys largest market.Tiffany may also be taking a page from Cartiers playbook, said one industry insider.Cartier opened a small store next to the Apple store on Fifth Avenue while it was renovating its mansion and to everyones surprise it kept the store even after the mansion reopened, said the source.
Haribo accused of using slave labor to make candy:::::German candymaker Haribo will launch an audit of its associated companies following allegations of using slave labor and sourcing its ingredients from producers with cruel animal conditions.The company, mostly known for its gummy candy products sold worldwide, has come under fire after a documentary aired in Germany accusing the candymaker of using products made in unbearable conditions for animals and humans, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.According to the documentary, the company purchased carnauba wax from a Brazilian company that produced the ingredient under slave labor conditions, including no bathroom aces, no drinking water, and horrible living conditions for its workers.Workers at the company reportedly made $12 a day for harvesting palm leaves.Workers were forced to labor for a month before being allowed to return home, prompting the Brazilian ministry of labor denounce the company and say the employees were treated worse than animal and the conditions could be described as slavery, according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.As well as being accused of using companies that produced ingredients using slave labor, Haribo also reportedly sourced its gelatin from producers with cruel animal conditions, the Chronicle reported.The documentary alleges that the candymaker outsourced gelatin production to a producer that used a farm where pigs had open wounds and pens covered in feces or even dead pigs.Haribo promised to launch an investigation into its practices following the documentary, telling Vices food site Munchies that the conditions on the pig farms and the Brazilian plantations shown are insupportable.Should it transpire that urgent improvements are needed in this area, we will insist on their implementation and will not rest until these improvements have been implemented, a representative of Haribo told the outlet.
This common mistake costs new hires $5,000 a year:::::It pays to ask.Most new hires simply accept their job offers without negotiating for more and thats costing them thousands of dollars in potential salary and benefits, according to a new CareerBuilder survey.More than half (56 percent) of workers confessed they dont negotiate for better pay when they are offered a job, either because: Theyre uncomfortable asking for more money (51 percent;) theyre afraid theyll lose the position (47 percent;) or they dont want to seem greedy (36 percent.)This backs previous research by job site Glassdoor, which found three in five employees accepted their first salary offer particularly women; 68 percent of them didnt negotiate, compared to 52 percent of men a whopping 16-percentage point difference.Get over it.Most employers expect candidates to respond with a counteroffer, which is why 52 percent of bosses told CareerBuilder that they lowball the starting salary so that there is room to negotiate.And more than a quarter of them said the initial offer is $5,000 less than theyre ready and willing to pay.Michael Erwin, senior career advisor at CareerBuilder, told Moneyish that many workers are still suffering job insecurity in the wake of the 2008 recession even though skilled workers are in demand right now.A lot of people became unemployed and when they did find a job, they were quick to just accept anything that was offered to them because they needed money coming in and I think people are still feeling some post-traumatic stress here, he said.We have to change that way of thinking.Its always OK to go back with a counteroffer.Thats something that Jennifer Beeston, a vice president of mortgage lending, learned the hard way while she was rising in her career.I got hired by a manager whom I had worked with previously and I believed him when he said his offer was the best he could offer me, she said.That included paying a $200 fee on every loan she originated and him taking 10 percent of her income.I found out five years later that he had screwed me royally with those caveats, which ended up costing me $50,000 that first year, because I didnt negotiate I just trusted a former colleague, she said.Youve got to know your worth and find out what everyone else is quoting before you accept.Laura Handrick, 56, an HR analyst at FitSmallBusiness.com, never accepts the first pass.She told Moneyish that she was able to get an extra week of vacation and Fridays off to volunteer locally, while working at one business a few years ago.She also landed an extra $21,000 on a contract several years ago.The first offer is not the final offer.Its the offer they hope youll take, she said.Plus, asking for more, proves you can negotiate, which most business leaders and most men, frankly appreciate.Stop leaving money on the table.Erwin and MaryJo Fitzgerald, Corporate Affairs Manager at Glassdoor, told Moneyish their tips to getting what youre worth.Do your homework We all need to do a better job of understanding our market worth and the best way to do that is to do your research, said Fitzgerald, including Glassdoors Know Your Worth salary calculator, which takes your experience, your location and your occupation into consideration.Theres so many tools out there like this now, that youre doing yourself a disservice if you dont do your research, she said.This will also ensure youll make a reasonable offer.Work out what youre going to say Most people are uneasy talking about money.Frame your request like, Thank you so much for the offer.Im really excited to work here.The salary range I was expecting is something more like this.Is this offer negotiable?And take it from there.Olivia Jaras, 33, a salary coach, also scored life-changing perks such as coming in 30 minutes late every morning to take her daughter to daycare and being allowed to work out during lunch.And she simply said, Im thrilled with the offer and I cant wait to get started.That said, I have a couple of items that I need to run by you before I sign off.Practice Similar to what you do with job interviews, you need to rehearse saying what youre going to ask for out loud so that you get comfortable with it, said Fitzgerald.Practice in front of a mirror or with a friend.And while some negotiations do occur over email, Erwin says its better to call with your counteroffer, if you cant get a face-to-face meeting.The sad thing about technology is that a lot of what were trying to say gets lost in translation, he said.Just going back and forth over email with I need this much money may look like youre greedy or unhappy, where on a personal phone call, the employer can hear the excitement in your voice about working at the company and be more likely to say, You know what?Lets see what we can do.Haggle for more than money When there is a salary cap and you cant get exactly what you want, being compensated with flexible hours, extra vacation days or other perks can help bridge that pay gap.Maybe theres a transit benefit to help cover your commute, or childcare credits, or perhaps they serve meals in the office or free coffee, which can save you a lot of money, suggested Erwin.Keep asking Negotiations dont stop once you get the job.Be similarly prepared to advocate for yourself at your next performance review to get the raises and promotions that you deserve.Having these conversations with your manager upfront and frequently is important, said Fitzgerald.If you dont ask, you dont get.
Billionaire pharma founder busted in opioid scheme:::::The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on US charges that he participated in a scheme with other executives to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based cancer pain drug and to defraud insurers.John Kapoor, 74, who stepped down as chief executive of Insys in January, was charged with having engaged in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston.He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a previously filed case against six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, prosecutors said.Brian Kelly, Kapoors lawyer, said in an email: My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously.Insys, which has been in settlement talks with the US Justice Department in connection with the probe, declined to comment.Its stock price fell more than 20 percent to $5.92 in midafternoon trading on Thursday.The charges marked a major escalation of the ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.Those probes have come amid a national opioid abuse epidemic.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015.The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a board member, stepped down in January as the companys chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently the chairman of drugmaker Akorn and president of investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises.According to the indictment, following the launch of Subsys in 2012, Kapoor and Babich grew dissatisfied with the drugs success in its initial three months on the market.It says they, with others, devised a scheme to pay bribes in the form of speaker fees and food and entertainment to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys and to increase the dosage and volume of existing prescriptions.They also sought to mislead and defraud insurers who were reluctant to approve payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.
Twitter admits what everyone already knew:::::Twitter on Thursday said it had overstated the number of users of its online service since late 2014, another black eye for a company thats struggled with controversies over its handling of political messaging and phony accounts.In recent weeks, the company said, it had become aware that it had been including users of a service for third-party apps, which should not have been part of its own user counts.While the company said the mistake stretched back to 2014, it also said it was only able to revise its user count for the past three quarters.In the third quarter, Twitter said it added 4 million monthly users, offsetting the 1 million to 2 million that it said the mistake would cost.That brings its total user count to 330 million.Daily users, a separate metric tracked by media companies and investors, jumped 14 percent.The company had a net loss of $21 million during the quarter, much narrower than the $103 million loss in the same period a year ago.It hinted that if its earnings come in at the high end of its expected range for the fourth quarter, it could be profitable for the first time since going public in 2013.But Twitter faces fresh competition, too, from services like Snapchat, whose parent company, Snap Inc., went public earlier this year.Company shares jumped nearly 9 percent premarket and are up 5.2 percent for the year to date, below the S&P 500, which has gained 14 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Averages 18 percent gain.
UAW files complaint against Tesla over fired workers:::::The United Auto Workers International Union said on Thursday it filed a complaint against electric carmaker Tesla on behalf of the companys terminated workers.The unfair labor practice charges were filed at the National Labor Relations Boards Oakland office, the union said.Tesla in October fired about 400 employees including associates, team leaders and supervisors, Reuters reported, citing a former employee.Performance reviews can result in promotions and occasionally in employee departures and no action was taken based on their feelings on unionization, Tesla said in an email to Reuters on Thursday.Roughly 20,000 ULPs are filed with the NLRB by unions like the UAW as an organizing tactic, the company said.UAW said in February it will greet Teslas Fremont, California, assembly plant workers with open arms in a bid to unionize the factory.NLRB, the US agency in charge of enforcing labor law, in late August filed a complaint against Tesla, saying it found merit to workers complaints about unfair labor practices.
Twitter bans ads from two Russian news agencies:::::Twitter announced Thursday it will ban ads from Kremlin-backed news agencies RT and Sputnik as the war over social-media propaganda heats up.The move by the social network which along with Facebook has taken heat for disseminating fake news stories during the US presidential election drew immediate threats of retaliation from the Russian Foreign Ministry.Twitters move is yet another aggressive step and blamed the influence of American intelligence officials.Naturally, a response will follow, a spokeswoman said.Likewise, the editor-in-chief of RT, formerly known as Russia Today, taunted Twitter on its own platform, tweeting Thursday that the social network had pitched RT on a big ad campaign during last years election.Twitter said it set aside the $1.9 million in advertising it has collected from RT since 2011 to fund external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.In a blog post, Twitter added that the decision was made following an internal investigation, as well as the US intelligence communitys conclusions that Russian actors attempted to interfere in the US election on behalf of the Russian government.We did not come to this decision lightly, the blog post stated.Twitter said RT and Sputnik will still be able to keep their Twitter accounts as long as they comply with the sites rules.
Walmart rolls out robots to make sure shelves stay stocked:::::Walmart will roll out shelf-scanning robots in approximately 40 stores to replenish inventory faster on its shelves and save store employees time when products run out.The company has been piloting such robots in a handful of stores.If you are running up and down the aisle, and you want to decide if we are out of Cheerios or not, a human doesnt do that job very well and they dont like it, Chief Technology Officer Jeremy King told Reuters.The robots are about 2 feet in size and come with a tower on their backs that is fitted with cameras, which scan aisles to check stocks, missing items and if products have been left in the wrong place by customers.They are 50 percent more productive, can scan shelves three times faster than their human counterparts and significantly improve accuracy levels, King said.Store employees are only able to scan shelves about twice a week.Out-of-stocks are a big challenge for retailers, which miss out on sales every time a shopper is unable to find a product on store shelves.
Twitter’s stock surges as it predicts profitable quarter:::::Twitter said Thursday it could turn its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter, after making sweeping cuts in expenses the past few months and finding sources of revenue beyond the advertising that dominates social media.Shares of the company jumped nearly 8 percent to $18.50 in premarket trading.Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles, but it said Thursday we will likely be GAAP profitable in the fourth quarter if it reaches the high end of its own estimates.Twitter reported third-quarter revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from $616 million a year earlier.The company attributed much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed in its quarterly earnings report that it had discovered an error in the way it had calculated the size of its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.The company said it had 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by greater use of email and push notifications to point people toward tweets they want to read.In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million, the company said.Analysts on average had expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.Twitter said the error in past user estimates was caused when it wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the companys Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc.s Google.Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem, said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.Its great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth, Pachter said.Investors and analysts have at times criticized Twitter for how it describes the size of its user base, which is a key metric for social media companies.Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose how many daily active users it has.Chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement that the business was making progress growing its audience and returning to revenue growth.Were proud that the improvements were making to the product continue to bring people back to Twitter on a daily basis, he said.Twitters net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Helping to improve Twitters margin was a 16 percent cut in expenses from a year earlier.One factor was stock-based compensation, which declined 36 percent year-over-year, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.Twitter has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as US President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers away from competitors including Facebook and Snap Inc.s Snapchat.Up to Wednesdays close, Twitters stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with the 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index over the same period.The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through livestreaming deals, including broadcasts of concerts, professional golfing events and news programs.Last month, Twitter began a test of tweets that are as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, to allow people to better express themselves.The company also is diversifying its revenue further beyond advertising.Revenue from data licensing and other sources was $87 million in the third quarter, up 22 percent from a year earlier, Twitter said, adding that it signed a significant number of new enterprise deals in the quarter.The most recent quarter was the third time revenue has declined since Twitters debut as a public company in 2013, as two of Silicon Valleys giants, Facebook and Google, have come to dominate the business of internet ads.Twitters letter to shareholders made no mention of a regulatory challenge facing the company in the United States, where lawmakers are investigating how Russia used social media to interfere in the 2016 US election.Twitter has pledged to make political advertising more transparent on its service.Russia has denied any interference.The company has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment, seeking to limit the number of bullies and abusers on the social network.
Ex-Apollo Global exec charged with defrauding investors out of $290K:::::Federal regulators on Wednesday charged a former senior partner at Leon Blacks Apollo Global Management with defrauding investors out of $290,000.For 3 / years ended in June 2013, Ali Rashid charged more than 1,000 personal items and services to the private equity funds he advised, whose investors included the New York state pension, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.The New Yorkers alleged expenses included trips with his wife and family to Hawaii, Cancun, Rio de Janeiro and the Jersey Shore, it is alleged.Rashid also flew his girlfriend to Paris and charged it to investors, sources told The Post last year.Rashid, 41, reached a separation agreement with Apollo in February 2014 after the firm examined his expenses for a second time.Rashid repaid the firm.Apollo, partially as a result of Rashids actions, reached a $52.7 million settlement in 2016 with the SEC to settle charges it misled investors on fees.The name of the Apollo partner was not identified in the SEC settlement but The Post, citing sources, named Rashid as the wrongdoer.The SEC charges, filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, confirm The Posts story.The SECs lawsuit, filed earlier today, is based on misconduct that Apollo discovered, stopped and promptly reported to the SEC more than four years ago and which was publicly disclosed more than a year ago, Apollo said in a statement.
Bank of Internet was under 16-month SEC investigation:::::Online lender Bank of Internet was the subject of a formal 16-month Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, according to a report.The company, led by Chief Executive Greg Garrabrants, was the subject of scrutiny until June when it ceased without the SEC taking any action.The probe was focused on alleged conflicts of interests, auditing practices, and loans made to two entities, according to subpoenas and government documents obtained by Probes Reporter, a publisher of investment research.The documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, confirmed two earlier reports by The Post that the bank was under investigation.In April, The Post first reported that the Justice Department, the SEC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the US Treasurys Office of the Inspector General were investigating the bank, citing public documents obtained in an unrelated case.At the time, Eshel Bar-Adon, the banks chief legal officer, said, There are no material investigations that would require public disclosure and BofI remains in good regulatory standing.But Probes Reporter countered: After reviewing the documents from BofIs SEC probe, it strains credibility to imagine investors would not consider this investigation material and in need of disclosure.
‘American Made’ sheds light on shady Arkansas airfield deals:::::Theres only one mention of Bill Clinton in Tom Cruises new movie, American Made, which is about a Washington-sponsored operation in the early 1980s to send guns to rebel forces in Nicaragua from an airfield in Mena, Ark.That operation didnt go quite as planned for a number of reasons, including the fact that Cruises character, the real-life and long-dead Barry Seal, was enlisted by the Medelln drug cartel to bring cocaine to the US.Rather than fly his planes empty on the return trip and probably get killed for refusing the cartels request Seal agreed.And the former TWA pilot made a lot of money in the process, leading to a one-man economic boom for Clintons Arkansas.I happen to know a fair bit about the Mena operation because I was investigating Bill and Hillary Clintons financial dealings in the late 1990s, and that mysterious airfield repeatedly came up.And as a result, I acquired copies of a whole lot of Seals documents, including phone records, legal documents and notes scribbled on napkins and bits of hotel stationery.Toward the end of the movie, Seal (Cruise) has been picked up by Arkansas investigators and is about to be charged when then-State Attorney General Joe Svoboda is interrupted by a phone call.Gov.Clinton is on the line.He says its urgent, the AGs receptionist says.Svoboda picks up the phone and says: What you need, Bill?Seal has already taunted the investigators by saying that he was going to walk out a free man.Then, Svoboda says, Hes free to go.The implication, although not stated in the movie, is that Seal was released at the request of someone in Washington probably someone in the Reagan White House, whose CIA was deeply involved in the gun-running operation that later became known as the Iran-Contra Affair.The Hollywood Reporter, which says the film was based on one conspiracy theory, recently wrote that Bill was supposed to get more of a mention in the movie.Those hoping for some Clinton dirt will ultimately be disappointed.The filmmakers decided to cut a scene showing a young Clinton getting a lap dance at an Arkansas strip club, said the paper.But let me tell you that the Mena operation isnt some conspiracy theory.The drug operation was as real as it gets and those notes, interviews and other records I mentioned prove it.And even though it was being run out of Arkansas, from everything Ive seen and heard, it wasnt anything that then-Gov.Clinton controlled or even took an active part in.This was way over his young head.But that doesnt mean Clinton wasnt aware of what was going on.Investigators at the time found people who swore they saw Bill at Menas airport at various times.But nobody said they saw him with either Seal or Fred Hampton, who ran a company called Rich Mountain Aviation at that airport.I heard that [Clinton was at Mena airport] from so many people who had seen him there.At least five or six people, said a professional investigator who looked into the case.One even recorded the wing number of the plane Clinton flew in on.Clinton, of course, was running the state at the time.So his visiting any part of Arkansas would not have been unusual.And while the Mena area of Polk County is a tourist center, the 134-mile drive from the state capital in Little Rock would make it unlikely that anyone would take a lot of trips there unless for a specific reason.And its clear that state investigators had their eye on the airport.So, unless Bill was completely blind as to what was going on, he undoubtedly knew about Mena.One document I have contains a sworn interview with a woman named Mary Kathryn Corrigan who worked as a secretary for Hampton at Mena.Did you ever see anything suspicious while working at Rich Mountain Aviation?she was asked by police in September 1985.I think probably what seemed suspicious to me was to have so many people coming in at night and paying cash and leaving the cash in a drawer and working at all hours of the night to get planes out for people, she said.That interview took place in Mena and was conducted by Arkansas State Police Special Agent William Duncan and was attended by Russell Welch, also of the state police.In another document from 1985, Seal himself testified about some of what he did.Its referred to as a synopsis of Seals transcripts and, citing his real name, is titled, Testimony of Adler Berriman Seal.The case was the US vs. Saunders et al.in Miami federal court.Mr. Seal testifies the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) gave him an undisclosed amount of money for expenses on renting a Learjet Also, Mr. Seal, who also went by the name Bill Elders as well as variations of his real name, testifies he made 6 or 7 hundred thousand dollars in trafficking drugs after he went to work for the DEA [from March 1984 to March 1985].Mr. Seal testifies the DEA knew about the money and let him keep most of it.Now Ill give you a conspiracy theory to chew on.After Seal pleaded guilty in February 1986, he was given an extremely light sentence of 100 hours of community service thanks to the intervention of the CIA and others and ordered to live at the Salvation Army in Baton Rouge, La.Was there a conspiracy to get him killed because someone in Washington was afraid hed spill the beans?The movie doesnt even hint.
Ackman loses big time as Chipotle shares plunge:::::Chipotle Mexican Grill once again has Bill Ackman clutching his stomach and his wallet.The silver-haired hedgie behind Pershing Square suffered a $142 million paper loss on Wednesday after shares of the burrito maker plunged 15 percent on the heels of a disappointing third quarter.The companys shares closed at $277.01 after hitting a 52-week low earlier in the session.For Pershing Square, which announced a 10 percent stake in Chipotle 13 months ago, the selloff was another reminder the company has a long way to go before it wins back the trust of consumers and investors.The hedge fund bought Chipotle shares at an average price of $405, according to regulatory filings.At the time, Ackman was confident Chipotle was primed to recover from its reputation- and bottom line-damaging brushes with norovirus and E. coli.The outbreaks two years ago sickened hundreds of customers.When Pershing Square jumped in, Chipotle shares had fallen roughly 46 percent from its August 2015 high of $757.77.But instead of recovering, new food-safety worries rattled the company last July after a norovirus outbreak hit a Sterling, Va., location.Since initiating its position in Chipotle, Pershing Square has lost an estimated $368.9 million as the stock has fallen 32 percent.Reps from Pershing Square declined to comment.Separately, Ackman got good news relating to his investment in Automated Data Processing late Wednesday when proxy giant Institutional Shareholder Services supported him alone in his bitter battle with the payroll processor.
Burger King wages yet another war with McDonald’s:::::Coulrophobes should steer clear of Burger King this Halloween.The burger chain expecting lots and lots of clowns next week.The chain announced today in a video release that they will be offering free Whoppers to anyone dressed up like a clown for their Scary Clown Night.They also took some time in the video to make a few digs at one clown in particular.According to Burger Kings press release, clowns are the third most sought after Halloween costume of 2017, which prompted the brand to jump on the trend.The video they released for Scary Clown Night starts with a kid biking through the streets at night when he is confronted by a clown bearing a striking likeness to McDonalds iconic mascot Ronald McDonald.The advertisement continues with clowns of all shapes and make-up following the bike to Burger King.The video then ends with the Ronald McDonald-like clown demanding a Whopper.The Home of the Whopper takes another jab with the final tag line: come as a clown, eat like a king.This comes after a Burger King in Germany used the two-hour showing of It as one epic commercial, and after a Russian Burger King tried to ban the viewing of the film on grounds that it gave free promotion to McDonalds.The fast food giant will be offering the deal to the first 500 guests that come into participating stores dressed as clowns between 7pm and 3am on October 31.
Exec is accused of violating every HR policy ever:::::A male executive at a national headhunting firm preyed on his female underling groping her breasts, saying he wanted to suck on her boobies, and humping her office door, according to a new complaint.Veronica McIlraith, 35, was a managing director at Wegman Partners Manhattan office from 2014 through 2017 when she was forced out after reporting the harassment, she says in a New York City Commission on Human Rights complaint filed Wednesday.The married Manhattanite claims her boss, Scott Legg, 37, grew violent when she rebuffed his advances, calling her a bitch and throwing furniture.He often appeared drunk and high on cocaine at work and she once snapped a photo of him passed out on the floor, McIlraith says in the complaint.At times, he has passed out in the office, the complaint says, above a photograph that purportedly shows Legg sprawled out on the carpet.She also took photos of a sign Legg allegedly posted outside his office that read, Suck my balls, and a photo of an ejaculating penis that hed allegedly drawn.In July 2015, Legg aggressively grabbed at Ms. McIlraiths breasts in the office kitchen and tried to open her sweater, sending her running into her cubicle, the complaint says.Later that month, Legg became enraged when Ms. McIlraith refused to go to lunch with him and called her a bitch,' she claims in the filing.That August, Legg allegedly humped Ms. McIlraiths office door, licked it and, showed her his tongue.In November, while waiting for McIlraith at a client meeting, he texted her, Maybe Ill suck on your boobies, according to a copy of the exchange included in the complaint.McIlraith says she refused her bosss advances.He dealt with the rejection by twice hurling chairs at her office wall, according to the complaint.Legg was suspended for five days after Wegmans human resources department investigated her allegations, but he also yanked all her commissions, leaving her without an income, the complaint states.She filed a complaint with the city instead of a lawsuit because arbitration is required in her work contract.Her attorney, Zoe Salzman, said the arbitration clause does not bar her client from filing a complaint with a government agency.No woman should have to experience this sort of harassment at work.Ms. McIlraith is standing up.Other women are standing up.And more will follow, said Salzman, with the firm of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP.Legg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A spokesman for Wegman Parnters said the company has hired a law firm to investigate the allegations and fired Legg.We are an ethical company that is committed to fostering a safe and fair workplace, and to addressing inappropriate employee actions or behaviors, the spokesman said.Wegman Partners provides legal recruiting services to major international law firms and Fortune 500 companies.
Sumner Redstone’s ex won’t be getting his NYC penthouse:::::First ailing media mogul Sumner Redstone kicked his ex-girlfriend out of his Beverly Hills home, now a Manhattan judge has booted her from his New York penthouse in the Hotel Carlyle.Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Erika Edwards also denied the request by the woman, Manuela Herzer, to take a mental exam of the 94-year-old Viacom founder to determine if he was fit enough to sue her for the $3.75 million pad last year.Redstone purchased the East 76th Street apartment in March 2015, promising to give it to his then-partner when he died, according to his Manhattan Supreme Court suit.After they split he decided he no longer wanted to leave the property to Herzer, but she refused to give up her rights to it.Now Judge Edwards has ordered the Hotel Carlyle Owners Corporation to strike Herzers from the proprietary lease.Edwards ruled in a decision released Wednesday that Herzer has no valid ownership claim to the apartment based on an agreement she signed with Redstone in Jan. 2015.The contract said Herzer may inherit the pad, but Redstone was not gifting it to her before she died.The terms of the agreement are clear and unambiguous and the agreement expressly sets for the parties intent, the judge writes.She adds that Redstone paid all the money to purchase and maintain the apartment.He paid the purchase price, closing costs, renovations and redecorations of the apartment and all of the monthly maintenance and assessment fees.Additionally, the closing documents for the purchase of the apartment were solely in his name.The judge said a mental exam of Redstone wasnt necessary because she was basing her ruling on the four corners of the 2015 agreement, which Herzer herself signed.Reps for the two sides did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
Wynn CEO: Las Vegas massacre hasn't measurably hurt business:::::Wynn Resorts chief Steve Wynn insisted Thursday the mass shooting in Las Vegas didn't measurably hurt business for the company's Las Vegas operations.In fact, the CEO said the company's Las Vegas business turned in its "best third quarter in its existence, since 2005.And we're particularly happy because our non-casino revenue was so strong."The casino company beat estimates on total revenue and on the earnings per share in the quarter.During the company's earnings call, the CEO commented on trends following the Oct. 1 massacre that killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others.According to Wynn, one of the groups that canceled after the shooting later re-booked for a different date.He added, "So if you're going to ask us what did the tragedy at Mandalay have on us?None that we can measure."Wynn said the casino giant has been proactive when it comes to security, pointing out the company invested "close to $6 million or $7 million a year, beyond our normal security."The CEO said the company had a series of consultations about two years ago with security firms and experts "to harden this as a target.""I believe that the self-consciousness about security has been continuous with all of the operators in Las Vegas for some time," Wynn said."I know what we did here because as one of my competitors described it, 'Wynn is paranoid.'"Wynn also spoke about Stephen Paddock, the man police say shot people from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay."He just had a screw loose and snapped or something," said Wynn, adding that "this particular fella that did the shooting at Mandalay" was a customer at the Wynn property since 2006."We first pick him up on our records as a typical slot player with a modest credit limit of $50,000," Wynn said."I had the chance to interview the people in the high-limit slot area.He was a loser over the six, seven, eight years here."At the same time, Wynn said the man "never owed any money" at the casino, but also "didn't meet the profile of a problem gambler, anything like that.He was a very controlled person."Meantime, Wynn said the company is preparing to embark on an ambitious expansion in Las Vegas."I'm feeling really great about Las Vegas for the next 20 years," he said."My board of directors is committed to maximizing the non-casino touristic profile of this complex known as Wynn in the next five years.We'll be in construction continually."The expansion in Las Vegas includes a "full-scale destination hotel" off the Strip along with convention space and a lake attraction.Construction of new buildings is slated to begin Jan. 3."We'll be demolishing the north villas where the 1,500-room high-rise is going to go," he said.Wynn is doing much of the development on land that is currently a large golf course the company owns.The project includes an irregular-shaped lake surrounded by a boardwalk that is a mile long.
Intel earnings Q3 2017:::::Intel raised its full-year outlook and reported quarterly earnings that easily topped analysts' expectations on Thursday.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Adjusted EPS: $1.01 vs. 80 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Overall revenue: $16.15 billion vs. $15.73 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters Client computing revenue: $8.86 billion vs. $8.68 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Data center revenue: $4.88 billion vs. $4.79 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Intel said it now expects full-year earnings of $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion.That's up from its previous forecast for earnings of $3.00 per share on $61.3 billion in revenue.The company reported net income of $4.52 billion.That figure represent's 34 percent year-over-year growth.In the year-ago quarter, Intel reported adjusted earnings of 80 cents a share on $15.78 billion in revenue.Shares of Intel gained more than 1 percent in after-hours trade.The stock has been on a tear this year, gaining 14 percent as of its Thursday close.During the normal session, shares of Intel set a fresh 52-week intraday high of $41.58.While the client computing group still brings in the lion's share of overall revenue, Intel has been shifting its focus away from the personal computer market amid declining PC shipments.The segment reported better-than-expected revenue of $8.86 billion, or roughly flat year-over-year.The company has instead highlighted its opportunities in new markets such as artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure.Earlier this month, Intel said it is collaborating with Facebook to develop artificial intelligence chips for data centers.This is breaking news.Please check back for updates.
Aetna shares jump 11% on DJ report that CVS Health is in talks to buy company:::::Shares of the big health insurer Aetna soared by a much as 12 percent Thursday on news that it was in talks to be sold to pharmacy behemoth CVS Health.The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, reported that CVS Health has proposed to pay more than $200 per share for Aetna.Aetna, which as of Thursday had a market value of $53 billion, was trading at about $175 per share after news of the prospective deal broke.CVS Health shares were down nearly 3 percent after the news.In addition to a chain of retail pharmacies, CVS Health also operates the Caremark pharmacy benefit manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.Asked about the potential deal, an Aetna spokesman told CNBC, "We don't comment on rumor or speculation."A spokesman for CVS Health said, "As a matter of policy we don't comment on market rumors such as this."Aetna in February abandoned an effort to merge with another large health insurer, Humana, after that $34 billion deal was blocked on antitrust grounds by a federal judge.
Former Dallas Fed CEO: Why would Yellen want to stay?:::::With President Donald Trump reportedly changing his mind "every day" about who he will appoint to chair the Federal Reserve, many are doubting whether Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is likely to stay on for a second term.One former Dallas Federal Reserve CEO said she should not even want the appointment."If I could wear her flats, I would be saying to myself, 'Do I want to stay?'"Richard Fisher said Thursday.Fisher was president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from 2005 to 2015."There's no upside for Janet to stay," he said."She can go anywhere she wants.She can be chancellor of any university, be a professor anywhere, be on any boards," he said.Fisher said that in his mind, Yellen has done a good job steering the central bank.But as Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor seem to be closing in on the job, Fisher said there's little in it for Yellen.Fisher was speaking on CNBC's Power Lunch.Fisher's remarks come as Trump is struggling with members of his own party over the crucial appointment.Three House Republicans have called on the president not to reappoint Yellen when her term expires in February.It's unclear when Trump will announce his decision, though he has previously indicated it could beas soon as Nov. 3.Trump has reportedly met with Yellen multiple times to interview her for the position."I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot, I really like her a lot," he's said.Fisher also commented on which Fed chair he thought would be best for the stock market.The appointment of Taylor or Powell would be equally likely to juice stock returns, he said.
Amazon HQ2: Not Newark, as per the Uber test:::::On Facebook, a friend who grew up in Memphis suggested that city for Amazon HQ2.This was in response to The New York Times' analysis saying HQ2 would go to Denver.Memphis isn't an obvious choice, and I don't know how it lines up with the official criteria.So how can one quickly weigh if Memphis, or any other location, would be a good choice for Amazon?Amazon is a company where it is always "Day 1".Among other things, that means it tends to pursue disruptive ideas, such as using drones for deliveries.Amazon would want HQ2 to be in a location that is supportive of a Day 1 company, if not outright still in Day 1 itself.What I needed was a simple test for Day 1 type disruptions, and the last decade presented us with a perfect one: Ride sharing, and more specifically Uber.Uber has been disruptive in applying technology to an urban transportation system (taxis) that hasn't changed significantly in almost a century, and has deeply entrenched interests.Moreover, that system had become highly regulated with substantial public bureaucracies and government revenue streams linked to them.So wherever Uber (or Lyft) went, it was going against "the system" and friction was to be expected.What you could measure, very quickly thanks to Google and Bing, was just how much friction (or support) Uber ran into with local government.So I did a search on Memphis and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the city of Memphis had sent its police force to arrest Uber drivers.That seemed like a pretty extreme case of being unfriendly to Day 1 type disruptions, and I pointed that out to my friend.He pointed out this was 2013 -- four years ago -- so I did a search on Denver and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the Colorado Legislature became the first in the country to explicitly legalize ride-sharing.What Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said at the time was, "Colorado is once again in the vanguard in promoting innovation and competition while protecting consumers and public safety."And when there was some friction in the city of Denver after that, the Police Chief acted quickly to resolve it.Which makes more sense to locate the headquarters of a Day 1 company in: A place that sent the police to arrest Uber drivers or one that acted quickly to accept and encourage the disruption?So let's get back to Newark.There are many reasons I could think of for picking Newark as HQ2.In particular the close proximity to New York City and all its benefits, with much better housing costs.Making the reverse commute from Manhattan to nearby New Jersey cities has even become reasonably common in the last 20 years.The incentives being offered are nice, but again they are a short-term benefit in a long-term play.So I applied the Uber test to Newark, and it failed miserably.Newark was still trying to force Uber into their taxi regulatory scheme as recently as 2016, banning them from Newark Airport and train station in February and planning to enact further regulation in April.Uber was planning to abandon the city when a last minute deal was reached.Compare what Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said about Uber "Just because they have a great idea, doesn't mean they have an exemption from rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades," with the earlier quote from Colorado Governor Hickenlooper.I was particularly caught by the "rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades" part.That doesn't read like a Day 1 supportive location to me.It is quite possible that those words will come back to haunt Mayor Baraka when Amazon is evaluating the HQ2 proposals.The Uber test isn't perfect for a couple of reasons.One is that pretty much any locality that regulates taxis and limousines will try to put some regulatory regime around ride sharing.The other is that Uber itself has valued confrontation with local governments and agencies over reaching an accommodation, and that in some cases has raised the heat significantly.For example, I know of airports where Lyft was able to pick up months before Uber, because they negotiated a deal while Uber was still trying to fight the local airport authority.So the Uber test isn't black and white, it is varying shades of grey.But compare the light grey of Denver to the very dark grey of Newark and it, at the very least, gives an indication of which city would be more accommodating to a company where it is always Day 1.This post was originally published on Berenson's blog on Oct. 17.Hal Berenson is President of True Mountain Group, LLC which provides technology and management consulting.He previously worked at Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.
Morningstar fires back at report over ratings; shares surge:::::Morningstar fired back at The Wall Street Journal after the business newspaper published a 4,000-word takedown of the Chicago, Illinois-based company's mutual fund ratings system.In an article titled "Setting the Record Straight on Our Fund Ratings," Jeffrey Ptak wrote that the Journal's findings were "selectively disclosed" and that "highly rated funds were far more likely to outperform low-rated funds."A spokesperson for Morningstar also said Thursday that the company had contacted the Journal to request corrections to "numerous points that mischaracterize our business."Ptak is the head of global manager research for Morningstar, according to his company bio.The Journal's story raised serious questions about the effectiveness of Morningstar's coveted rating system.The paper examined the performance of thousands of funds that the company reviewed over nearly 15 years and found that funds the company rated highly failed to deliver."We strongly disagree with the interpretations that they drew," Ptak said on CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Thursday afternoon.Shares of 'MORN' fell 4.6 percent to a close of $82.75 Wednesday on the news, the biggest loss in two years.The stock came roaring back on Thursday, rising more than 5 percent.
Nike reportedly set to open yoga pant studios in stores, sending Lululemon shares lower:::::Nike could be about to hit Lululemon where it hurts.The Oregon-based sporting goods company is reportedly preparing to open "pant studios" in 5,000 of its stores, Bloomberg reported Thursday, after reviewing supplemental documents handed out at Nike's investor day.The studios would feature women's wear like sports bras and yoga pants items Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike brand, highlighted during his presentation to investors and analysts.The spaces are slated to open on Nov. 1, right ahead of the holidays."This $7 billion business will continue to be fueled by more women engaging in sport, wellness and activity," Edwards said Wednesday about Nike's ambitions."Our growth in our women's business is outpacing our men's business, and it will continue to do so."Shares of Lululemon fell about 2 percent Thursday afternoon on the news, and were last down around 1 percent.Representatives from Nike and Lululemon both didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.This isn't the first time Lululemon has taken a hit from competitors lately.Just earlier this month, it was reported that Amazon is getting into sportswear and plans to create its own private-label lines.The e-commerce giant has reportedly teamed up with companies that manufacture clothes for Nike, Lululemon and Under Armour.Vancouver-based Lululemon has 421 stores open today throughout the U.S. and Canada.In June, the athletic apparel maker known for its yoga pants unveiled plans to close most of its unprofitable Ivivva girls stores, and to focus investments online instead.On its latest quarterly earnings conference call, Lululemon management discussed plans to lure more male shoppers to the brand.Lululemon competes in a "very different playground" than Amazon, Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin told CNBC in September.
American Eagle to open redesigned store where you can 'curate' your jeans and do your laundry:::::Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters is opening a prototype store that it hopes will entice younger shoppers to stay longer by customizing their jeans and doing their laundry there.The company announced this week that its first AE Studio store will open Nov. 10 in New York's Union Square neighborhood."As we celebrate the success of the last four decades, we look ahead to create new brand experiences to inspire today's customer, and broaden our leadership in jeans," Chad Kessler, American Eagle's global brand president, said in a statement."AE Studio is a perfect example of our evolution where we invite customers to enjoy a unique brand experience, feel at home, and curate their distinct individual style."AE Studio will have a heavy focus on jeans, with a gallery for American Eagle's denim products on the first floor.There will also be a "Maker's Shop" on the jeans floor, where shoppers can create their own bespoke pair, personalized to their fit and style.Other additions include iPads in the dressing rooms to serve as "digital concierges."American Eagle said its own social media team will also operate an office in the store to be closer to shoppers and "keep their finger on the pulse of the brand."Looking to get shoppers to stick around longer, American Eagle is putting a wall of washers and dryers in the AE Studio, where customers like students can do their laundry.Shoppers can "hang out with friends or study in the studio bar and seating area," the company said."The integration of services like laundry and study spaces may seem a little wacky, but it's exactly the type of thing that will drive footfall, especially among younger shoppers," GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said."That said, American Eagle will need to work hard to publicize and communicate this as it is an unusual facility to have and most shoppers would not expect it," Saunders added."The bottom line is that AEO is innovating and testing new things which puts it on the right side of the tracks as far as retail is concerned."American Eagle is one of many apparel brands seeking to keep the physical shopping experience exciting to win back shoppers from online merchants.Newer entrants to the U.S. fashion market, like H&M and Zara, have also managed to steal a share of sales.In August, the company reported upbeat second-quarter profit and revenue and a month later announced a new loyalty program, AEO Connected, that promises to draw shoppers in with more rewards.American Eagle has also found a bright spot in its Aerie nameplate, for women's intimate apparel.Comparable sales for Aerie jumped an impressive 26 percent in the second quarter.
The Fed chair contest is Trump's version of 'The Bachelor':::::Like pretty much every big personnel call in this White House, President Donald Trump has turned his selection of a Federal Reserve chair into a version of "The Bachelor" with everyone feverishly guessing who will get the role of leading the world's most important central bank.Trump has gone so far as to solicit advice from Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs in a televised interview."Tell me who your preference is," Trump asked Dobbs."I'd love to hear it.You could even cut it out if you want.You don't have to I would love to hear you.I only want that from people I respect."Dobbs went on to suggest keeping Janet Yellen, something that I'm told is at least somewhat attractive to Trump given that markets love the current chair and would likely react favorably to her status quo renomination.But a source who talks to the president regularly about the Fed and other economic matters tells me that while Trump does like Yellen, he is not going to renominate her because he wants to put his own mark on the central bank something the president also suggested to Dobbs.Just after this conversation, another senior source close to the Fed nomination process cautioned me not to rule Yellen or anyone else out."He changes his mind about it every day," this person said.But a consensus among people close to the process has emerged that the race is likely down to either current Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell or Stanford economist John Taylor.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh sparked increasing speculation after a meeting last week with Vice President Mike Pence.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing against Warsh and in favor of Powell, whom he got to know in recent months working on financial reform issues.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn has been mostly out of the running for weeks now both because of his clash with Trump over the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and because the president wants the former Goldman Sachs president to keep working on the high-stakes tax cut push.An announcement on the Fed chair pick could come any day, but sources close to the matter say it will most likely happen next week before the president departs for a 12-day trip to Asia.Even that is not assured, however.If Trump can't make up his mind, the announcement could wait until he gets back.The Senate needs to have hearings before the Banking Committee and a full vote prior to Yellen's term expiring on Feb. 3.Ideally, the process of sending up the next nominee would start soon.The Senate can move quickly when it wants to it's basically up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell so next week is really not a hard deadline for the president.The arguments favoring a Powell chairmanship include that it would allow Trump to install his own pick while also likely continuing the very modest approach to rate normalization and balance sheet drawdown initiated by the Yellen Fed.Taylor, while much more beloved by conservatives on the Hill and places like The Wall Street Journal editorial board, would present at least something more of a hawkish risk that might spark jitters on Wall Street.Some conservatives on Capitol Hill have led a behind-the-scenes campaign against Powell and in favor of Taylor or Warsh.But it's not clear that those efforts will produce results, especially given that Trump generally does whatever he wants with limited regard for what Republicans in Congress say.And Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is among the few on record arguing against Powell.Taylor won a straw poll when Trump met with Senate Republicans earlier this week and quizzed them on their Fed preference, but there is very little chance many would vote "no" if Trump actually sends up a Powell nomination.And Powell is a former banker rather than a wonky economist like Taylor, a style Trump tends to prefer in his nominees.So the betting line remains on Powell for chair and perhaps Taylor for vice chair, if he is willing.Heavy caveats continue to apply.Trump could change his mind at the last minute and turn the process on its head, possibly even electing to simply stick with Yellen, though that remains unlikely.The rose is still up for grabs.Ben White is Politico's chief economic correspondent and a CNBC contributor.He also authors the daily tip sheet Politico Morning Money [politico.com/morningmoney].Follow him on Twitter @morningmoneyben.
Arianna Huffington: Why the Weinstein scandal is a ‘catalyst for dramatic changes’:::::The recent flood of sexual harassment allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has marked a "catalyst" for dramatic changes, media mogul Arianna Huffington has told CNBC."Now, whatever needs to come out into the light, will come out into the light," the founder and CEO of Thrive Global told CNBC on Thursday, when asked about the recent developments surrounding the Weinstein scandal.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative, a summit held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Huffington said that living in an increasingly digital world has made it more difficult for individuals and companies to hide."Obviously, a lot is coming into the light, as right now, we're living through this period where especially because of social media it's very hard for companies and CEOs to hide behind amazing advertising and a public relations team."More from Global Investing Hot Spots: Hollywood super-agent calls Weinstein's behavior 'disgusting' Uber board member Arianna Huffington still 'optimistic' SoftBank mega-deal will happen 'Fearless Girl' CEO, after discrimination fine, says we're committed to 'equal pay for equal work' In early October, The New York Times published an investigation uncovering sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, a co-founder of both Miramax and The Weinstein Company.In the initial report, two company officials told the Times that Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women over alleged harassment.Subsequent reports from dozens of women accusing Weinstein of sexual harassment and/or assault have since emerged via media outlets worldwide, and the producer was fired by the board of his namesake company.Weinstein has repeatedly denied accusations of non-consensual sex.The scandal has prompted women working both in the movie industry and elsewhere to share their own experiences of sexual harassment and assault.
Rep: Budget bill is a ‘gimmick’ but I voted for it anyway-commentary:::::"I plan to vote in support of the Senate-passed budget.Not because it's the right thing to do fiscally, but because it's the Washington gimmick needed to get tax reform done.Yes, another D.C.gimmick."And while I'm relieved that we can finally move ahead with delivering tax reform for the American people, the fact that we are yet again failing to address our nation's budget and debt crisis is deeply troubling.The simple fact is that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path.Our mandatory spending now represents 70 percent of federal spending and by 2026 will have doubled compared to 2013.Yet once again Washington will shirk its responsibility to pass and actually implement a responsible budget.As a member of the House Budget Committee, we spent months putting together a budget that balanced over the next ten years and that would make real strides in addressing mandatory spending.I fought for 400 plus billion mandatory spending cuts and agreed to 200 billion -- only to see it get reduced to zero in the Senate budget.Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the Senate chose to take an easier path and decided not to include mandatory spending reforms in their budgetagain ignoring the true drivers of our over $20 trillion national debt.God help our children and future generations of Americans as we continue to bury them in unsustainable debt.I just celebrated my first child's wedding this past weekend and wondered: how my future grandchildren will thrive under the reign of Chinese dollars?How will we repair our bridges?How will we provide for our seniors?How will we remain competitive with the world and fund our military?Yet having said that, this week I voted in support of the Senate-passed budget.Not because it's the right thing to do fiscally, but because it's the Washington gimmick needed to get tax reform done.Yes, another D.C. gimmick.We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass tax reform in order to raise wages for hard working Americans, simplify the tax code, and make our businesses more competitive.But make no mistake, when it comes putting our nation on a responsible and sustainable fiscal trajectory, this 'blueprint' is a stunt, not a solution.As wholeheartedly as I welcome the advancement of pro-growth tax reform, I just forcefully implore Congress to end its long and ugly history of budget gimmicks and finally address the true drivers of our country's crippling debtmandatory entitlement spending.Commentary by Congressman Jim Renacci (R-OH).He is serving his fourth term representing the 16th district of Ohio.Currently he serves on the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Budget Committee.Follow him on Twitter @RepJimRenacci.For more insight from CNBC contributors, follow @CNBCopinion on Twitter.
Deutsche Boerse CEO to step down amid insider trading probe:::::Deutsche Boerse's embattled chief executive Carsten Kengeter is stepping down amid continuing allegations of insider trading, the German exchange operator announced on Thursday.The decision came at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board.No successor was named, and Kengeter will stay on until there's a transition plan.Deutsche Boerse said that the resignation was "in order to allow the company to focus its energy back onto clients, business and growth and to avoid further burdens caused by the ongoing investigation".Kengeter and Deutsche Boerse have been dogged by an insider trading investigation since early this year.The probe stems from shares Kengeter bought in December 2015, just months before formal merger talks with London Stock Exchange were announced.The shares soared and investigators have been looking into whether Kengeter was already in merger talks before he bought his shares.The merger eventually failed.Kengeter and Deutsche Boerse have denied wrongdoing.Kengeter's position became more tenuous earlier this week when a Frankfurt court ruled against a settlement that would have helped him and Deutsche Boerse put the case behind them.The resignation means two top exchanges will be seeking new chiefs.Last week, Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, said he would step down at the end of next year.Deutsche Boerse and LSE, which had sought to merge, are now competing for market share in the run-up to Britain's exit from the European Union.
Comcast CEO: NFL ratings are getting better but it's hard to grow audience with so many choices:::::Comcast CEO: NFL ratings are improving but it's hard to grow audience 12 Hours Ago | 01:32 NFL ratings are improving, but it's harder to grow an audience when consumers have so many choices, Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts told CNBC on Thursday."It's early in the season.We're down about 5 percent," said Roberts."That's a lot lower [decline] than people originally thought."Comcast airs NFL games on its NBC network Sunday nights and Thursday nights.NBC also has the Super Bowl this year.Each year gets more difficult for traditional media players to grow audiences as new platforms emerge, Roberts said."There are a lot more choices," he noted."The world has changed, and so does the NFL.And they'll have to look at their own business."According to an ESPN report, citing metrics from Nielsen, total viewership has fallen about 7.5 percent to an average of 15 million people through the first six weeks of the NFL season.President Donald Trump has claimed the NFL ratings decline is due to the controversy of players kneeling during the national anthem.The president has repeatedly criticized the protests, and said owners should fire players who don't stand.The anthem firestorm started last season when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the anthem to protest the treatment of African-Americans in the United States.Despite the ratings declines, Roberts said the NFL has demonstrated it is "the best in sports at what they do" in delivering a quality experience to fans.Roberts appeared on "Squawk Box" after Comcast reported better-than-expected earnings but revenue that slightly missed estimates.Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.
House Republicans tell Trump not to pick Yellen as Fed Chair:::::Some House Republicans are calling on President Donald Trump not to reappoint Janet Yellen as Fed chair when her term expires in February.In a letter sent to the president, the legislators tell Trump that "new leadership" is needed at the central bank to push the economy forward."As general mistrust of government and public institutions continues to rise, we believe that new leadership at the Federal Reserve will help restore its reputation as a forward-thinking monetary institution instead of a slow growth regulator," said the letter, authored by Reps. Warren Davidson, Ted Budd and Alex Mooney.The letter comes as Trump nears the end of a selection process that has become convoluted and volatile in determining the next Fed chair.In recent days, Trump has indicated his decision likely is between Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor.However, he also has indicated that Yellen remains in the mix.Trump has expressed pleasure at how well the stock market has performed while Yellen has led the Fed and has been complimentary of her leadership.The market has jumped since Trump won election last November, with the Dow industrials up more than 30 percent.The index is up about 45 percent since Yellen became Fed chair in February 2014.However, the GOP members insist the Fed has overstepped its bounds elsewhere thanks to the "virtually unlimited regulatory authority" over the nation's banking system.They cite the Fed's "radical monetary experiment" that has included the central bank balance sheet swelling to $4.5 trillion thanks to three rounds of bond buying it engaged in to lower interest rates and stimulate the flow of money to riskier assets like stocks."These actions have blurred the line between fiscal and monetary policy almost beyond recognition, facilitating the Obama Administration's trail of reckless spending and doing so at the borrowed time of an unsustainable national debt on the backs of the American taxpayer," the letter stated.Trump has said he expects to pick a new Fed chair before he leaves for his next foreign trip Nov. 3.
California begins 'historic cleanup' from fires but faces serious hurdles in rebuilding:::::As California begins cleaning up from this month's deadly wildfires, concerns are rising that the rebuilding could take years and will be hampered by shortages of contractors and labor.The governor has ordered the suspension of tough zoning, planning and other requirements to help the fire ravaged communities in Northern California bounce back faster.California, which is known for having some of the nation's strictest environmental and building regulations, also is encouraging local agencies to streamline paperwork to make the rebuilding go smoother.Regardless, some contractors in the affected region say a shortage of skilled labor that existed before the disaster could worsen, and they worry construction material costs will jump and shortages may create additional hurdles.Some firms are swamped with requests by homeowners, including people seeking original plans for their homes and asking for help rebuilding."Our phone is ringing off the hook," said longtime contractor David Leff, owner of Leff Construction Design/Build in Sebastopol, a Sonoma County town about 50 miles north of San Francisco."We're getting calls from people who we built homes for as long as 30 years ago."Leff added, "There are more burned homes than there are contractors in the county.Some builders are going to be gearing up as much as possible.The problem is we were all so busy before the fire, and there was a fairly significant labor shortage before the wildfires, that it's going to be even more difficult now."
The Weinstein ripple effect: Famous men accused of sexual harassment and assault:::::For nearly three decades, Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein faced allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, The New York Times reported on Oct. 5.More than three dozen women have since publicly accused the entertainment mogul of abuse."I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it," Weinstein told the Times.Spike network is also investigating reports of sexual harassment by Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob Weinstein, against the female showrunner of a series produced by The Weinstein Co. that aired on the network.Weinstein's lawyer Bert Fields denied the allegations in a statement to Deadline.These allegations have set off a ripple effect, empowering people who say they also were victims to come forward with stories of abuse by people in power.Here are some of those accused:
ECB chief Draghi delivers speech on monetary policy decision:::::ECB did not discuss composition of quantitative easing, Draghi says 12 Hours Ago | 03:09 European Central Bank President Mario Draghi delivered a speech on the central bank's monetary policy decision Thursday.The ECB decided Thursday to cut the level of bonds it purchases every month, but extend the length of time that its stimulus program runs.Its purchases will fall to 30 billion euros ($35 billion) from 60 billion euros, starting in January.The central bank said it will extend its monetary stimulus program until at last September of next year.
Grocery chain Supervalu pressured by activist investor to sell stores:::::In the aftermath of Amazon buying Whole Foods, Minnesota-based grocery chain Supervalu is facing escalating pressure from an activist investor.Blackwells Capital, which owns a little less than 4 percent of Supervalu's common stock and is one of the company's 10 largest shareholders, issued a letter Thursday morning calling out a "lack of clear steps" at the Jason Aintabi, a managing partner at Blackwells, said he's especially "frustrated" with Supervalu's dismal share performance of late.Ten years ago, the grocer's stock was trading above $320 a share.On Wednesday, shares closed below $16 apiece, and are down more than 50 percent in 2017."We take seriously all input from our shareholders," a spokesman from Supervalu told CNBC in a statement."As we have publicly stated, we continue to evaluate and execute on various initiatives as part of our efforts to transform Supervalu and create value for our shareholders."Blackwells said it's been attracted to Superavlu because of the chain's vast real estate holdings, which include stores and distribution centers.Aintabi has urged the company to "change direction and guide management" to a better strategic plan.The four initiatives Blackwells has suggested Supervalu consider include selling some of the grocer's more than 17 million square feet of owned real estate, which is "worth multiples of the current capitalization of the Company," according to Aintabi.The activist investor is asking Supervalu to sell roughly 30 percent of its stores, and to use the remaining locations for completing tasks like home delivery and meal prep.Further, Blackwells wants a "refresh" of leadership with grocery expertise, a dividend paid to shareholders, and a share buyback plan."Supervalu's leadership has demonstrated a willingness to take in order to unlock value and position the Company for ongoing success," Aintabi wrote."In an industry under pressure, Supervalu has tremendous structural advantages and an opportunity to define, and act upon, a corporate strategy that can create long-term shareholder value," he added."Without active and immediate change, we believe the opportunity will be lost and shareholders will continue to pay the price."Blackwells is seeking to immediately meet with Supervalu's board and discuss its proposal.
China is the largest market for robots in the world right now, ABB CEO says:::::China is dominating the robotics market, according to the chief executive of Swedish-Swiss automation giant ABB.Ulrich Spiesshofer said Thursday that the Asian powerhouse is "the largest robotics market of the world," and that this would likely continue to be the case next year."ABB is clearly the number one in China.Our long-term investment that started more than a decade ago in China is paying off," he said.Beijing has made robot manufacturing a clear policy priority.In 2015, the government announced its Made in China 2025 intitiatve, aimed at boosting development in high-tech.It then introduced a Robotics Industry Development Plan, a five-year program to rapidly grow its industrial robotics sector.
Union Pacific earnings better than expected despite Hurricane Harvey disruption:::::EPS: $1.50 per share vs. $1.49 per share expected by a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts.Revenue: $5.41 billion vs. $5.33 billion expected by Thomson Reuters.Average revenue per car, a key metric for railroads, increased 5 percent from the same period last year.The storm forced the railroad to close over 36 stations in the Houston area.Union Pacific says Harvey negatively impacted earnings by 4 cents.Rail infrastructure required repairs throughout the region and limited operations only resumed near the beginning of September.Union Pacific announced in August it was cutting 500 managers and 250 railroad workers amid a broader effort to cut costs.In July, the company announced it plants to cut expenses by $350 million to $450 million by the end of the year.Shares of Union Pacific climbed nearly 2 percent in midday trading.
ups earnings q3 2017:::::EPS: $1.45 per share vs. $1.45 expected in a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts.Revenue: $15.98 billion vs. $15.6 billion expected in the Thomson Reuters survey.Shares of UPS dropped at market open before bouncing back up more than 1 percent.Quarterly revenue increased 7 percent from the prior year, though operating profits were virtually unchanged at $2 billion.The company also raised its bottom earnings guidance for the full 2017 year to a range of between $5.85 and $6.10 per share."UPS produced another solid quarter of financial performance, despite the impact of several natural disasters that slowed regional economic activity and damaged infrastructure," UPS Chairman and CEO David Abney said in a press release.UPS is making an unprecedented move for the holidays, announcing it will charge extra during peak shipping weeks in November and December.Citi Research said the move suggests UPS "is in the process of accelerating" its business, and raised its forecast for the company's stock.It remains to be seen whether that acceleration will match recent forecasts from the United States Postal Service, which says it expects to ship about 850 million packages during the holiday months.In August, UPS CEO David Abney penned and co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal with rival FedEx CEO Frederick Smith.They said the U.S. must fix its roads and bridges because a simple delay adds up to millions of lost dollars.The two rivals said they are "prepared to pay our share for the use of new roads, bridges, and aviation systems," but "funds should be dedicated specifically to transportation infrastructure."In October, Amazon announced it is testing its own delivery business.The news drove UPS shares 0.7 percent lower and FedEx stock down slightly, though analysts told CNBC that the e-commerce giant's move likely won't hurt UPS as much as expected.At most, Amazon accounts for 10 percent of UPS' revenue, meaning any business lost from Amazon's disruptive "Seller Flex" proposition should be limited in impact.
Buffalo Wild Wings shares surge 20% after earnings beat, boost in guidance:::::Shares of Buffalo Wild Wings jumped more than 20 percent in premarket trading Thursday after the company posted higher-than-expected earnings for the third quarter.The restaurant chain also raised its earnings forecast for the year.It now expects 2017 earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, to come in at $4.85 to $5.15.In July, it cut its adjusted earnings outlook to $4.50 to $5 a share from a previous forecast of $5.45 to $5.90 a share.Buffalo Wild Wings on Wednesday reported earnings of $1.36 a share, excluding items, easily topping analysts' projections of 79 cents a share.Revenue, however, missed, at $497 million, compared with Wall Street expectations of $502 million.Shares of the company closed more than 4.1 percent down Wednesday at $101.15, and have tumbled more than 34 percent so far this year as of the close.CEO Sally Smith attributed the results to a mix of cost-savings initiatives and sales promotions.Investors could well see this as a welcome change after several months looking to see whether Buffalo Wild Wings can turn its fortunes around.In July, the company slashed its 2017 outlook after a sizable miss on second quarter earnings.At the time Smith, attributed weak sales to higher than average wing prices and a change-up in menu promotions.Smith announced in June that she would step down by year's end following a bitter proxy battle with activist investors Marcato.CNBC's Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.
SAP revises sales practices as it faces US probe on South Africa:::::Global business planning software giant SAP is making sweeping changes to its sales practices in countries around the world, the German company said as it revealed it is the subject of a U.S. corruption probe tied to its business dealings in South Africa.Adaire Fox-Martin, SAP executive board member in charge of global customer operations, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that its on-going investigation into corrupt sales practices related to South Africa government contracts had led it to take disciplinary actions against three top managers.SAP also said on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have opened an investigation of the company under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).The probe began after SAP's outside law firm Baker McKenzie had informed U.S. authorities in July, when the South African sales practices and potential government bribery scheme had come to light in reports by a local investigative reporting group.
Nokia sees more tough trading ahead after network earnings miss forecasts:::::The telecom network equipment industry is weathering the toughest part of a decade-long cycle, as demand for 4G and older 2G and 3G network equipment subsides, while volume contracts for next-generation 5G networks remain a few years out.Nokia's network sales fell 9 percent in the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros ($5.7 billion) while operating profit in the business dropped 23 percent to 334 million.Average analyst forecasts in a Reuters poll were 5.0 billion and 432 million respectively.Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said operators' consolidation and technology transitions were slowing demand, while competition in China had toughened."The early positioning for 5G is well underway in that country and the cost of gaining or even maintaining footprint is significant ... We want to ensure the right long-term footprint, but not at any cost," Suri told a conference call."Operator consolidation and M&A activity are also creating some near-term headwinds," Suri said.
Statoil third quarter earnings lag due to lower output in North America:::::"Net operating income was impacted by net impairment charges of $0.8 billion, mainly related to an unconventional onshore asset in North America of $0.9 billion, triggered by lower than expected production," Statoil said in a statement.Statoil did not name the asset.Over the past year the company has been trying to turn around its operations in North America, which mostly consist of offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as shale oil and gas in Texas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York.Statoil said its year-on-year results were up due to higher prices for both oil and gas, high production levels and strong refinery margins.Like other oil companies, Statoil has been slashing costs in order to cope with a 50 percent drop in crude prices since 2014."With an oil price below $52 per barrel, we have generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow so far this year ....This has further strengthened our financial position," CEO Eldar Saetre said in a statement.
Vistra Energy is reportedly close to a deal to buy power producer Dynegy:::::Power producer Vistra Energy is close to a deal to buy fellow Texas merchant generator Dynegy, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Shares of Dynegy jumped to close up about 17 percent at $10.78.Vistra Energy ended trading at $20.32, up 3.8 percent.Talks to combine the two energy companies, reportedly in the works since May, could lead to a deal being officially announced as soon as next week, according to the Journal.It would mark further consolidation among independent power producers, the companies that generate electric power and sell it into wholesale markets.The two companies' combined enterprise value, a more comprehensive measure of total value than market capitalization, would value the merger at more than $20 billion, the Journal reported.Neither company immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment.The purchase would help Vistra expand into the Midwest and Northeast, where Dynegy operates a number of natural gas and coal-fired plants.In addition to generating power, Dynegy and Vistra both play in the retail electricity space, which sells power to residences and businesses.That business typically does well when power prices are low, like they are now.The power generation side usually suffers when prices are soft.Independent power producers have struggled to find a winning business model since a wave of deregulation in the early 2000s.The goal of deregulation was to promote competition in the utility sector and drive down power costs, but sea changes in the space have created challenges for merchant generators.The unexpected boom in U.S. natural gas production over the last decade has pushed down power prices, making it harder for companies that operate plants to turn a profit.At the same time, subsidies and other support for renewable energy projects have boosted competition from wind and solar power and piled pressure on coal-fired and nuclear power plants.The industry has been plagued by bankruptcies.Dynegy entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011, and Vistra itself was spun out of the bankruptcy of Energy Future Holdings, one of the largest in history.The deal potentially takes a chess piece off the table for NRG Energy, the power producer that announced a transformation plan earlier this year under the guidance of billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Singer and fellow activist investor Charles John Wilder.Analysts told CNBC earlier this year that purchasing Dynegy would allow NRG to pick up a large portfolio of combined cycle plants, the most efficient type of natural gas facilities.
GOP shouldn't raid 401(k) plans to pay for tax cuts:::::"Simply stated, many Americans-perhaps most Americans-are on a path to outlive their money in retirement.They need to save more for retirement, and grow those savings.The Republican tax proposal would encourage them to save less."According to a new analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, workers contributing to their 401(k) accounts with earnings at every income level above $10,000, and in every age group from 25 to 64, contribute more than $2,400, on average.Participants of all types with 401(k) plans will be affected by the Republican proposal.If Congress takes away almost all of the tax incentive to save for retirement, Americans will save less.Evidence comes from Americans considering individual retirement accounts (IRAs) who already have the option of selecting the type of arrangement Congress is now considering.Under existing law, individual retirement savers can choose either a traditional IRA, with tax-protected contributions and taxed withdrawals, or a Roth IRA, with taxed contributions and tax-protected withdrawals.They have made a clear choice.Americans owned $7.9 trillion in IRAs at year-end 2016, with Roth IRAs constituting only $660 billion of that total.That's fewer than one in 12 IRA dollars invested in the tax-first-ask-questions-later option Congress is now talking about applying to 401(k)s. Retirement savers do not want their contributions eroded by taxes.Let's say a 50-year-old worker wants to retire at age 65.She realizes she hasn't saved enough for retirement, so she puts $18,000 tax-free in her employer's 401(k) in 2018.Fifteen years later, if she gets an average return of 7 percent in the stock market, her retirement savings will grow to about $49,663 before taxes.After taxes are taken out, if the worker is in the 25 percent tax bracket, $37,247 will be left.But if the Republican proposal becomes law, that same 50-year-old will likely save only $2,400 in her employer's 401(k)-the amount that won't be subject to federal income tax.Fifteen years later, following the same investment strategy, her retirement savings will grow only to about $6,622 with no taxes deducted.This illustrates the consequences for just one year's retirement savings decision: $37,247 vs. $6,622.If the Republican proposal is enacted and survives for 10 years, multiply those very bad results.Most Americans face a difficult choice every time their paychecks show up in their mailboxes or their bank accounts.Where should those dollars go?Should they spend them on the mortgage, bills, clothes, or food, or perhaps save for a kid's college years, or should they put them in a retirement account?Drastically reducing the existing tax incentive makes it harder for ordinary Americans to choose their retirement accounts over other pressing and immediate needs.A smart retirement policy designed to strengthen the middle class would make it easier for Americans to save for retirement at work, incentivize them to save more, help them to grow their savings significantly over time, and provide more access to products and strategies that provide a guaranteed income --- a regular and reliable "retirement paycheck" --- for the rest of their lives.Effective solutions to the retirement crisis are possible, but the Republican 401(k) tax proposal definitely isn't one of them.Commentary by Seth D. Harris, the former Acting Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama Administration.He is an attorney in Washington, D.C. and a Visiting Professor at Cornell University's Institute of Public Affairs.For more insight from CNBC contributors, follow @CNBCopinion on Twitter.
Boeing CEO: Discussions between Airbus, Bombardier 'don't change our plans':::::Boeing's CEO on Wednesday expressed confidence in the planemaker's strategy and said the Airbus-Bombardier partnership won't change the company's game plan.Last week, Europe's Airbus announced a partnership with Canada's Bombardier on the C Series, a narrow-body aircraft that competes with Boeing's 737."Recent changes in the marketplace, the discussions between Airbus and Bombardier, don't change our plans," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said during a conference call after the company announced third-quarter results.According to the CEO, Boeing has "a strong strategy in place.We'll continue to look at our strategic alternatives."Muilenburg said the narrow-body market is "an attractive market with a lot of global competitors.We like competition.It makes us better.We are confident we can win, but it's important that everybody plays by the same rules."Boeing has accused the Canadian manufacturer of benefiting from "unfair" government subsidies.Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed anti-subsidy duties on Bombardier's C Series planes."We're going to continue to invest to win in the narrow-body marketplace," Muilenburg said."We have lots of growth opportunity both top and bottom line in our core narrow-body business.We have a number of customers who operate 737s today who still have not made their next-generation selection [to the MAX].At the same time, the CEO said Boeing will "continue to look at ways to accelerate our core business, grow organically as our primary growth engine."Muilenburg also said Boeing has "clear priorities on usage of cash.Our first use of cash is invested organically, secondly returning values our shareholders roughly 100 percent free cash flow.And then thirdly, mergers, acquisitions, partnerships that complement our organic strategy.We are going to continue down that path."
Morningstar shares tumble the most in 2 years on doubts about its rating system:::::Morningstar is tumbling after The Wall Street Journal slapped the Chicago, Illinois-based mutual fund rating company with a bad rating of its own.'MORN' was trading down 4 percent Wednesday for its biggest drop in two years following a 4,000-word article in the Journal that raised serious questions about the effectiveness of Morningstar's coveted rating system.The Journal tested Morningstar's rating system by examining the performance of thousands of funds that the company reviewed over nearly 15 years.They found that funds the company rated highly failed to deliver.While the Journal found that most five-star funds outperformed, "on the average, five-star funds eventually turn into merely ordinary performers."Only 12 percent of funds given five stars did well enough to earn the same rating over the next five years."Billions of investor dollars hang in the balance," they wrote.Morningstar did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.The company told the Journal that the "star rating works well when it's used as intended: as a first-stage screen that helps identify lower-cost, lower-risk funds with good long-term performance.""It is not meant to be used in isolation or as a predictive measure," Morningstar said."Reversion to the mean is a powerful force that can affect any investment vehicle."Morningstar has been performing well this year.Even accounting for Wednesday's decline, the company's stock is up almost 20 percent over the past 12 months.Click here to read the full story from The Wall Street Journal.
Nike shares jump as retailer lays out new growth targets:::::Nike shares jumped Wednesday as the sporting-goods retailer offered a glimpse at its sales expectations for the future.At its investor day in Portland, Oregon, Nike said it expects earnings-per-share growth in the mid-teens over the next five years.The company added that it anticipates revenue growth in the high-single digits over the same period.Nike shares jumped more than 2 percent on the news, and were last trading up a little more than 1 percent.Prior to Wednesday, the company had already set a revenue goal of $50 billion by 2020.Looking ahead, Chief Executive Mark Parker told analysts and investors that digital revenues should grow from 15 to 30 percent over a five-year period.He also talked the audience through an innovated product pipeline, with a heavy focus on women's footwear.Nike's brand president, Trevor Edwards, then chimed in to say the shoe maker will move away from "undifferentiated" retail channels in the coming years."Mediocre retail won't survive," Edwards said.Nike is calling for about 50 percent of its future sales growth to stem from new categories and innovation.And about 75 percent percent of growth is expected to come from outside the U.S., according to Nike.Earlier this year, Nike posted strong sales growth in its international geographies, particularly China.Meantime, Nike's North America wholesale revenues continued to decline into the fiscal first quarter and ahead of the all-important holiday season.In a competitive retail environment, Nike is seen as favoring discounts and heavy spending to grow its direct-to-consumer business.In June, Nike revealed plans to cut about 2 percent of its global workforce, also trimming its geography segments from six to four signs the company is trying to reduce expenses.Nike is also in the midst of working on a pilot program with Amazon, which allows the Oregon-based retailer to directly sell a limited product assortment on Amazon.com, something Nike had refused to do for decades.
CVS Is Said to Be in Talks to Buy Aetna in Landmark Acquisition:::::The talks between CVS and Aetna appear to be in part an attempt to fend off a move by Amazon into the drug-selling business or at least to insulate the companies in case Amazon does invade.Signs are emerging that Amazon has designs on the pharmacy industry, with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporting on Thursday that Amazon had gained licenses in 12 states to become a wholesale prescription drug distributor.A larger company CVS and Aetna have combined annual revenues of about $240 billion could enjoy greater leverage in negotiations with drug companies, helping it defend itself against newcomers like Amazon.The intensifying battle for negotiating power and market share will lead companies to do acquisitions across traditional industry boundary lines, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan who studies the drug industry.Pharmacies, drug wholesalers and benefit managers are trembling at the prospect of competing with Amazon.Photo Representatives for CVS and Aetna declined to comment.News of the possible transaction, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sent Aetna shares soaring nearly 12 percent Thursday, while CVSs stock dropped 3 percent.CVS, which reported revenue of $177.5 billion for 2016, is based in Rhode Island and opened its first store in 1963.It became a billion-dollar company in 1985.Although it is best known for its chain of storefront pharmacies, it is also one of the nations top three pharmacy benefit managers and operates one of the countrys biggest specialty pharmacies, which sells high-priced drugs that often require special handling.The company also runs walk-in MinuteClinics in its pharmacies and Target stores around the country.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.CVS has managed Aetnas pharmacy benefits since 2010, and it announced a deal last week with Anthem, a large insurer, to help it start the insurers own pharmacy benefit business.It is unclear how the Aetna deal would affect CVSs future relationship with Anthem, and an Anthem spokeswoman declined to comment.Mr. Fein said the acquisition of Aetna, if it went through, would mark an industry shift toward a more seamless approach to managing health care costs.Right now, insurers are typically responsible for managing a patients medical bills and outsource the coverage of prescription drugs to a pharmacy benefit manager like CVS.Mr. Fein said that because the fastest-growing part of the pharmacy industry was high-priced specialty drugs for people who have considerable medical needs, it makes sense to manage those within one coordinated organization.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a strategic play, agreed Paul Keckley, a longtime industry consultant, who said CVSs goal was not necessarily to be in the insurance business but to offer the ability to manage both medical and pharmacy costs for large employers.In addition to its insurance business, Aetna has partnerships with numerous large health systems and a sophisticated technology operation.The resulting company could resemble UnitedHealth Group, which has a large insurance operation but also runs a leading pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, and related health service businesses.The deal would end Aetnas own ambitions to be a much bigger company.Its proposed $37 billion merger with Humana, another large insurer, was blocked by the Department of Justice and was called off this year.Aetnas come out of this Humana scenario with some urgency, Mr. Keckley said.
Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback:::::Perhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media.Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information.Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning.They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election?No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened.Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy.But for Twitter influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful the situation is more vexing.Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.Many of Twitters users have long been frustrated with the sites scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment.Twitters critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitters most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN.Twitters guidelines forbid threats of violence and targeted abuse prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trumps account.In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the companys evolving views on hosting the president.That includes allowing tweets under the newsworthy label it might otherwise ban.But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting We need to do better.Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump.Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the presidents Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring.Its too early to say were all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are already signs that Twitters bottom line is feeling the effects.An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019.Since other parts of social media most notably Facebook are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users, said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities.If you think about why are people alcoholics, its because they dont acknowledge theyre alcoholics.He added about Twitter, It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year.But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected.Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week.When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad.Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it inadequate at every level.He added that Twitter had failed to understand how serious this issue is.On Tuesday, Twitter said it would dramatically increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like.Political ads will be specially marked.Mr. Warner called Twitters plan a good first step.On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc.The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state.It billed itself as the Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird, said Mr. Leatherwood.Thats not how you abbreviate Tennessee.Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed.It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments, Mr. Leatherwood said.It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation.He said others had as well.He never heard back.After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trumps firing of F.B.I.director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, I love my whiteness.And yours.@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.I cant tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account, said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself.But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress.After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background.One of them presented the companys long-held philosophy: We, as a company,

What Worries? Big Tech Companies Post Glowing Quarterly Profits:::::I do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that its Brussels, Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers.For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers.The companys cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing.During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazons growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses.At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Next week, Googles top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabets chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Googles chief executive officer, were not asked about Googles pending appearance before Congress.Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits.Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share surpassing Wall Streets earnings forecasts by more than a dollar.The company is bringing in more revenue up 24 percent while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Unions administrative arm.The fine temporarily hit the companys bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer.When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest.The companys stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No.2 competitor to Amazon.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine.On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year.Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion.Its shares jumped 3 percent.Microsoft executives credited much of the companys success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsofts Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.While Microsofts attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment its foray into making smartphones was a bomb its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.
Mark Halperin, a Top Political Journalist, Faces Multiple Claims of Harassment:::::In a statement, Mr. Halperin denied any nonconsensual contact with the women who spoke to CNN, but he apologized for his behavior with his ABC News colleagues.During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me, Mr. Halperin said through a spokesman.I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain.For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.Under the circumstances, Im going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.Mr. Halperin left ABC News 10 years ago, and a network spokesman said on Thursday that no complaints had been filed about him during his tenure.The speed with which Mr. Halperin lost major television and book projects his account of the 2016 election was among the most anticipated publishing releases of next year reflected a growing national discussion about the misbehavior of powerful men.Mr. Halperins role as a chronicler of the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump also put him at the center of an election that was defined by intense debates over gender, power, and the consequences of sexual harassment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Like the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and the Fox News anchor Bill OReilly who were both forced from powerful perches this year by harassment scandals Mr. Halperin was a gatekeeper in his industry, whose favor could mint careers and bring credibility to politicians, both current and aspiring.His pioneering newsletter The Note, a political tipsheet that he started at ABC News, established him as an influential figure in the power circles of Washington and New York; who he quoted, and what stories he cited, mattered.But it was his 2010 book Game Change, written with John Heilemann, that cemented the Halperin style.A juicy, melodramatic account of the 2008 presidential race, the book was adapted into an Emmy Award-winning HBO movie starring Ed Harris and Julianne Moore.The books success and the authors ability to infuse politics with reality show-like drama led to contracts with Bloomberg News said to be in the $1 million range.The show Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann developed for Bloomberg, With All Due Respect, was a dishy and sometimes whimsical political talk show that failed to attract a wide viewership; it ended after Mr. Trumps victory.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Mr. Heilemann, Mr. Halperin also developed a political documentary series for Showtime called The Circus, which covered the 2016 campaign in real-time.On Thursday, Showtime said it had no record of allegations of untoward behavior by Mr. Halperin during his time on the series.The network said it would evaluate all options before signing on to another season of the show.A spokesman for Mr. Heilemann said on Thursday that he had no comment about the allegations against Mr. Halperin.MSNBC, in a statement, said that the allegations reported by CNN were very troubling and that Mr. Halperin would leave his role at the network until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.
Following the (Bike) Trail to Amazon’s Second Headquarters:::::This means far more than an attractive building or campus.Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle.Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macys department store downtown a move rich in irony, given how Macys has struggled in competing with online retailers and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the citys downtown area.The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon.The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle dont use motorized transport to get to work.Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation.Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work.Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office.The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.)It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers.In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada.The Alliance for Biking and Walking has ranked American cities based on the percentage of people who walk or ride bikes to work.In order, they are Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Ore., New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Chicago and Baltimore.Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the companys DNA.New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington already have vibrant urban centers, not that they couldnt be improved.They are also the kinds of places where local opposition to Amazons potential arrival would be more likely, based on factors like the impact on their already congested streets and criticism of the companys workplace practices.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message.Amazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region, he said.Thats easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco.Its much different than just tapping the talent thats already there.Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that.Next on Amazons wish list are capital and operating costs and incentives, which Amazon identifies as high priority considerations.That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Amazons first obligation is to its investors, Professor Elson said, which means finding the most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters, one that will produce the most value for the company.Photo Most contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial.Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark.Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so.The accounting and consulting firm KPMG ranks major cities by costs in its biennial Competitive Alternatives survey.A score of 100 is equal to the United States baseline, so costs in a city with a score of 105 are 5 percent higher than the baseline; cities with a score of 95 are 5 percent lower.New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots.(Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.)Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut.Washingtons score is 99.4.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austins score is 96.2.But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline.Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreals score is 85.2; Torontos is 85.6.Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canadas talent-friendly immigration policies.Labor Force is third on Amazons list.The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattles talent pool.The commercial real estate firm CRBE produces an annual ranking of cities based on what it calls tech talent, which considers factors like technology positions as a percentage of all jobs, growth in tech jobs and tech-degree completion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York no surprises there.But other cities also fare well: Washington is No.4, Toronto is No.6, Boston is No.9 and Baltimore is No.11.Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders.Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive.Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants.Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there.Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact.Amazon adds that a strong university system is required.Many contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology.Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University.Amazon cites logistics as critically important, specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco.(These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)Virtually every major American airport could use an upgrade, but most big cities have international airports with many direct flights to the cities where Amazon does business.Pittsburgh lacks nonstop flights to Seattle and offers only limited nonstop service to international destinations.But the city was once a major hub for US Air, which made substantial investments in infrastructure there before it was taken over by American Airlines.The number of flights to and from Pittsburgh has dwindled since then, but they could easily be revived.In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtraks northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.Community cultural fit and community quality of life are last on Amazons list of preferences.Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions a diverse population and, again, excellent institutions of higher education.If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives.That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force.Given Amazons vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolinas widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights.There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston.
Weinstein Sues Weinstein Company, Demanding Access to Records:::::Photo LOS ANGELES Weinstein v. Weinstein has commenced.Harvey Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he had helped found after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him, sued the Weinstein Company on Thursday to demand access to records and emails.The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said Mr. Weinstein needed the materials to defend himself.More than 50 women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or rape.Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company will contain information exonerating him, the complaint said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Weinstein also wants access to his former email account and other company documents, including his personnel file, to pursue a claim of wrongful termination against the Weinstein Company, according to the complaint.He also wants to pursue legal action against the studio for mismanagement by leaking confidential company information saying that certain news reports about his behavior could have only come from his personnel file.
Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future:::::Mr. Hacketts predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers.It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.We are committed to transforming our business, Mr. Hackett said of his companys efforts to bring new driverless technology to market.Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.It was just eight years ago that both G.M.and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies.The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.The results drew praise from one analyst because of the companys aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value.Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldnt make money, the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Fords shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years.An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V.lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nations largest automaker.The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe.Moreover, G.M.slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group.But G.M.reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story G.M.s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated the resilience of our core business in the face of declining consumer demand.This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes, he said.But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models.The market is more challenging than expected, Mr. Stevens said.Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars.G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruises work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment.And G.M.is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.Mary T. Barra, G.M.s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States.Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally, she said.And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.Were not laggards here, the companys chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call.Weve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.
As European Central Bank Eases Emergency Measures, Risks May Lurk:::::The European Central Banks move followed similar actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, as they gradually reduce their stimulus efforts.Next week, the Bank of England is expected to raise rates for the first time in 10 years.The Fed has said it plans to keep increasing rates.But their strategies arent without risk, either, reflecting broader vulnerabilities in the global economy.Britains decision to leave the European Union has weighed on growth, while the Fed is dealing with weak inflation.The European Central Bank, which held the benchmark interest rate steady at a historic low of zero percent, provided a timetable on Thursday for rolling back purchases of government and corporate debt, a program known as quantitative easing.It had been buying 60 billion euros, or about $70 billion, of such bonds every month, and will scale that back to 30 billion a month for nine months, starting in January.The bank will also reinvest the proceeds when bonds mature, so that in practice the monthly purchases will be well above 30 billion.Over all, the measures were in line with expectations.Some economists worry that the steady stimulus over the years has created real estate bubbles or pushed the prices of some assets beyond sustainable levels.When the central bank takes those funds away, it could expose weaknesses across the region, and perhaps even provoke a new bout of economic discord.At the moment, I would not be so worried, said Rolf Schneider, an economist at the German insurer Allianz.But, he added, the longer this expansive monetary policy lasts, the greater the chance of overvaluations, and the risk that there could be intense price corrections.That is the difficulty the central bank faces.No one knows for sure what unpleasant surprises may lurk now that it is ready to begin the so-called tapering, stanching the flow of easy money that made it possible for banks to lend and governments to borrow.Photo Mr. Draghi said at a news conference on Thursday that the central bank was aware of the risks, but added, Its not something we are concerned about.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The European Central Bank began departing from its standard playbook in 2007, offering cash-starved commercial banks unlimited short-term loans.It stepped up its stimulus after revelations in 2010 that Greece had systematically understated the true size of its government debt, touching off a crisis that threatened to tear the eurozone apart.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.To keep credit available, it let financial institutions borrow money at rock-bottom rates for longer periods than before.Where once commercial banks earned interest on money they deposited at the central bank, the Governing Council began charging them a penalty, a so-called negative interest rate.The aim was to force skittish banks to lend.The measures culminated in early 2015, when the European Central Bank began using newly created money to buy bonds and other assets, a program that has cumulatively been worth more than 2 trillion, a sum roughly equal to the annual economic output of India.As that tide of cash recedes, the hazards below the surface will come into view.The list is long.For one, Italian banks are still laden with bad loans.Italys public debt is so high that the country spends 4 percent of its gross domestic product just paying interest.Elsewhere, real estate prices in German cities like Frankfurt have risen so much that there is fear of a property bubble.Stock prices are at record-high levels and may be overdue for a correction.And Britains impending exit from the European Union will disrupt the economic order.Consumers, businesses and politicians have also gotten accustomed to or spoiled by low interest rates.Investors are so desperate for safe places to put their money that corporations like Daimler, the German automotive giant, have been able to issue bonds that pay no interest.Low rates have also weakened the euro against other currencies, a boon for exporters whose products are usually cheaper for foreign customers as a result.The euro will most likely rise as monetary policy returns to normal, making it harder for some businesses to compete.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For now, the eurozone economy is humming.But that may be no insurance against another crisis.Such events have occurred regularly since the worlds economic powers abandoned fixed exchange rates in 1973, a recent report by analysts at Deutsche Bank pointed out.They listed the withdrawal of central bank support as one factor that could trigger the next meltdown.To avoid provoking renewed turmoil, the European Central Bank is moving slowly.It stressed on Thursday that it stands ready to increase the asset purchases in response to worsening financial conditions or if inflation failed to rise.Although the eurozone is doing pretty well, Mr. Draghi said, he cautioned that the economy was not ready to stand on its own.Were not there yet.Historically low interest rates will remain in place for the foreseeable future.The central bank has said it will not begin raising rates until it has stopped buying bonds, and only if the eurozone inflation rate is on track to hit the official target of 2 percent.Still, some economists fear that the end of nearly free money will come as a shock for some.The success of a relaxed monetary course is apparent not at the beginning, Jrg Krmer, the chief economist of Commerzbank and a critic of central bank policies, said in a note to clients, but when it ends.
Talk of Weinstein Dominates Women’s Ceremony in a Hollywood ‘Unmoored’:::::These last couple weeks have unmoored the industry, Ms. Silverstein said in a somber tone during her opening remarks.But the revelations about Mr. Weinstein and others, she quickly added, should be seized upon as a real opportunity to push for systemic change.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A global conversation about sexual harassment, toxic masculinity and the institutional sexism that envelops the industry is much needed, she said.Some women in the audience raised a fist in solidarity.One shouted, Topple the patriarchy!A few men shifted uncomfortably in their seats.During a cocktail hour before the ceremony Women and Hollywood held a similar event in New York last week and will host one in London next month honorees like Lenora Lapidus, director of the Womens Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, networked over coconut chicken skewers and cilantro steak empanadas.Photo Theres a teeny silver lining, Ms. Lapidus said about the deluge of allegations.Its reached such a crescendo that theres no going back.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he co-founded, has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.The ArcLight, an upscale movie theater and event space in the heart of Hollywood, was simultaneously hosting a premiere for Jigsaw, which Lionsgate hopes will restart its Saw franchise.As women at Ms. Silversteins gathering cited statistics about gender inequality in moviedom women buy 50 percent of movie tickets in the United States, but only 7 percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2016 were directed by women several dryly noted that it seemed appropriate to have a torture-themed horror movie as a backdrop.One honoree, Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at the University of Southern California and author of damning reports about gender discrimination in the movie and television business, called Hollywood a cesspool of humanity.But Ms. Smith had high praise for Ms. Silverstein, whom she referred to as the entertainment industrys chief agitation officer.Ms. Silverstein, who grew up on Long Island and works from her Brooklyn apartment, has long focused on womens causes.After graduating from Brandeis University in 1989 and earning a masters degree from Columbia University in 1993, she worked for organizations like the Ms. Foundation and the White House Project, a now-defunct nonprofit dedicated to increasing female representation in business and government.Photo In 2007, she started a blog to push for gender diversity in the global film industry.She called it Women and Hollywood.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I didnt trust my voice at first, but I slowly put myself out there and started to get noticed, Ms. Silverstein said.Now Im kind of a rabid dog, she added with a chuckle.On Twitter, where Ms. Silverstein has 33,500 followers, she has been encouraging abused women to come forward.On Thursday, she tweeted #catchthebastards and #BelieveWomen.Although it has evolved into a larger organization, Women and Hollywood is still mostly known as a blog.Ms. Silverstein has a small staff of editors, and the site publishes articles by a range of freelancers.She does not sell advertising and depends on funding from sponsorships and people like Barbara Dobkin, a philanthropist dedicated to womens issues.Ms. Silverstein is also artistic director and co-founder of the Athena Film Festival, which programs films, like Suffragette and Hidden Figures, that highlight women in leadership roles.The eighth annual festival will take place at Barnard College in February.I do this work because movies are our cave paintings, Ms. Silverstein said.And there are still so many stories that are missing.We are desperate for diverse stories from diverse points of view.
Forgetting a Child in a Back Seat Can Kill. Cars May Soon Warn You.:::::This is not the first time that the Auto Alliance has dismissed the need for regulation.In 2011, for example, Robert Strassburger, vice president for vehicle safety at the organization, made a similar argument.We shouldnt overemphasize the effectiveness of technology, he said, adding that a government requirement for warning devices would initially have minimal impact, because the vast majority of cars on the road are years old.The Auto Alliance, like some other industry groups, calls for education rather than technology.For 10 years, it has pushed messages, both online and in print, that describe why cars overheat when parked in the sun and that advise parents never to leave children in a car.But advocates for stronger rules say the years of educational efforts have not slowed the number of deaths.And in almost all cases, they say, the action is a matter of distraction and simple forgetfulness.You cant teach people not to forget, said Janette Fennell, president of KidsandCars.org, an organization dedicated to protecting children in and around motor vehicles.There is a scientific reason why this is happening.Its not that people dont love their kids.David Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who has studied the issue, said a child in the back seat could easily be forgotten.Habit memory can take over during the drive home from work, causing a person to forget to stop on the way for an important prescription.Police officers, he said, have forgotten their guns after laying them down on the toilet paper roll in public bathrooms, so it should not be surprising that parents forget their child in the back seat.The brain process is the same, Dr. Diamond said.All involve an interaction between our habit and conscious memory systems.General Motors and Nissan have introduced technologies that remind the driver that a child is in the back seat by analyzing door sequencing.If the rear door is opened before the car is started but not after it is turned off, a warning sounds.The GM reminder is standard or available on numerous 2017 models and will be offered on others for the 2018 model year.The Nissan system is standard on the 2018 Pathfinder and will be on other models in the future.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This technology does not meet the standard of the legislation, however, because it does not detect the presence of a child.Hyundais technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.Some companies that sell equipment to the auto industry have developed warning devices.One such system, the VitaSense, uses low-power radio to sense movement and breathing.The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat.If a child is detected after the vehicle has been turned off, it alerts the driver by several means, including flashing lights, beeps, and messages sent to cellphones and computers.Ms. Fennell applauded independent efforts to produce a warning device but argued that the only real solution was legislation that required the technology in all new vehicles.When she got an alert from her car that she had left her gas tank open, Ms. Fennell said, I realized that while my car can tell me that, it cant tell me if a child has been left in the back seat.We get buzzers and warnings for everything, she said.How in the world do you not develop a reminder for what is indisputably the most important thing?
More Than Sports: Stadiums Try Video Games and Surfing:::::Jewel box venues like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have survived on the charm they bring to baseball, but large single-purpose sites had mostly fallen out of favor by the mid-1960s.The concrete doughnuts that followed which tried to mash baseball and football fields into the same space struggled to effectively exhibit either sport.And single-purpose designs returned to the norm in the 1990s.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the same concerns that led to the development of those rarely mourned multipurpose stadiums persist today.Single-sports structures can often lie fallow for much the year, in some cases marooned by sprawling parking lots on the outskirts of cities.Although the cost of some new stadiums has pushed beyond the $1 billion mark, a key revenue stream shows signs it might not be the reliable income generator it once was: Weekly attendance at N.F.L.games has been mostly down this year (even before players began protesting comments by President Trump), and attendance at Major League Baseball games, while still high, has also declined slightly in recent years.That has only intensified the need for new buildings to do double (or more) duty.Some large venues are increasingly catering to nontraditional events like monster truck rallies, marathons, black-tie banquets and conferences.MetLife Stadium, the home of the Jets and the Giants, hosted a Bollywood awards show in July.Photo But event planners often find that convention centers are better suited to their needs, with superior lighting and audiovisual options, extensive catering facilities and the ability to partition off floor space into multiple rooms, said Jack W. Plunkett, chief executive of Plunkett Research.Industrywide tracking of supplemental revenue from one-off events is patchy at best.Still, stadium managers want to maximize ancillary income from stadium event rental, but there are a lot of challenges and the competition is fierce for those dollars, he said.Last month, Barclays Center in Brooklyn hosted a video game tournament a championship showdown using the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.In the same space that has hosted Beyonc and the hometown Nets, enormous screens conveyed the action to an audience of thousands, accompanied by pounding music, a light show and smoke effects.Its super awesome theyre putting a lot of time and money into making this a good show, taking it mainstream, said Joseph Nelson, 18, who traveled from Scotch Plains, N.J.I could watch this streamed at home, but I come here to be with people and enjoy the production.Hyperconnectivity of the digital sort is important, especially for younger fans, according to a report from Deloitte last year.That could take the form of virtual assistants guiding customers through team shops or informing event organizers what highlights the crowd wants to see.Photo Companies like VenueNext, which has worked with Super Bowl host stadiums and Churchill Downs, home to the Kentucky Derby, create custom apps to help fans track which bathrooms have the shortest waits, order food to be delivered to their seats and watch replays on their phones.Avaya Stadium, home to the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team, erected a wall of screens nearly seven feet tall to aggregate real-time statistics, social media chatter, YouTube videos and other fan-generated content.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, designers are worried that visitors, accustomed to a spread of entertainment options at home, will get restless at a live event.So theyre considering ways to connect fans to the live experience.Designers envision using biometric data and motion effects to sync an entertainers heartbeat with pulses sent into spectators seats.Augmented reality stations could offer guests a digital backstage tour.One rentable suite at Petco Park, home of baseballs San Diego Padres, allows fans to play the video game MLB: The Show on PlayStation video game consoles while overlooking the field.The traditional arena was fundamentally designed around a static in-seat experience, Mr. Mirakian said.But the behavioral patterns for this next-generation visitor are dramatically different they want to come into the building and have the ability to choose their own adventure.Photo Another bonus: Flexible venues are easier to finance at a time when taxpayers are less inclined to pick up part of the tab.Last year, voters in San Diego rejected a ballot measure that would have raised hotel taxes to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars toward helping erect a new football stadium for the Chargers.(The team opted to move to Los Angeles.)Most economic experts believe that the benefits of stadiums are very likely to be outweighed by the costs to the taxpayers who fund the projects, according to a survey this year from the Initiative on Global Markets at Chicago Booth.After all, even with a full slate of events, many of those taxpayers may never set foot in the building, which the neighborhood may end up seeing as a hulking, self-contained island, siloed from the rest of the community.That is a criticism that new venues are trying to address by better blending into their surroundings and encouraging more visitors.Stadium and arena planners are trying to integrate hotels, lakes, parks, office buildings and other meeting places into their designs.Plans for venues like the Chase Center a privately financed arena being built in San Francisco for the reigning N.B.A.champion Golden State Warriors that will include a waterfront park, restaurants and retail refer to the complexes as districts.Half of the concourse area used for the Little Caesars Arena, which opened last month in Detroit as the new home of the Red Wings and the Pistons, is accessible year-round, regardless of whether an event is scheduled in the main bowl.Retailers and restaurants open on to the street and the clear-roofed concourse.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This way, we dont have these massively long runs of inactive street frontage when theres no game or concert, said Ryan Gedney, a senior project designer at HOK, the architecture firm behind the arena.It becomes a much harder-working venue day to day.
Deutsche Börse C.E.O. to Resign Amid Insider Trading Scandal:::::He will lead the exchange on an interim basis until the end of this year and still has the supervisory boards full confidence, Deutsche Brse said.The exchange operator said that it accepted his resignation with deep regret.Mr. Kengeter has consistently denied wrongdoing, and said he would cooperate with the authorities.This decision was not easy for me since I feel very closely connected to Deutsche Brse and I still have many plans for the company, Mr. Kengeter said in a statement.In the light of the public accusations and allegations, I am taking this step to protect Deutsche Brse.In March 2016, Deutsche Brse and the London Stock Exchange Group agreed to merge in an all-stock deal that they hoped would forge a European heavyweight in a rapidly consolidating industry.The deal would have created by far the largest operator of stock markets in Europe, combining bourses in Britain, Germany and Italy, as well as several of the regions largest clearinghouses.But this year European regulators blocked the deal, citing concerns that it would create a de facto monopoly in the clearing of bonds and fixed-income products.The two exchanges said formal merger talks began in January 2016, after Mr. Kengeters share purchases.Prosecutors have said, however, they believe the discussions began as early as the previous summer.Mr. Kengeter told shareholders in May, Insider trading goes against everything I stand for.Deutsche Brse has stood behind Mr. Kengeter throughout the investigation.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The exchange operator said last month, when it agreed to pay fines to resolve the German investigation, that it did not share the public prosecutors view concerning the accusations raised, but the decision to nevertheless accept the fines was made for the purpose of protecting the overriding interests of the company.It is rare to see a top exchange executive forced out by concerns about their conduct.Richard A. Grasso, the former New York Stock Exchange chief executive, resigned in 2003 during a public outcry over his pay package.He was ultimately allowed to keep the $139.5 million he was paid after a long and contentious legal battle with the New York Attorney Generals office.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite the unusual nature of Mr. Kengeters departure, it does not mark his first brush with controversy.Before joining Deutsche Brse, he previously led investment banking at UBS for several years before leaving the bank in 2013.During Mr. Kengeters time running UBSs investment bank, Kweku M. Adoboli, a trader in its London office, was accused of unauthorized trading that led to a $2.3 billion loss for the bank.Mr. Adoboli was found guilty of fraud in 2012 and sentenced to seven years in prison.The ensuing scandal led to the resignation of Oswald J. Grbel as UBSs chief executive, though Mr. Kengeter was not implicated.UBS also became embroiled in an industrywide investigation into the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, during Mr. Kengeters time as head of the investment bank.UBS ultimately paid $1.5 billion in fines as part of a settlement with British and American authorities over its role in the rigging of global benchmark interest rates.Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, was convicted of criminal charges related to the manipulation of Libor in 2015.Mr. Hayes told British authorities in interviews after his arrest that Mr. Kengeter had been present at a meeting where manipulation of the rate was discussed, according to a report that summarized those interviews and was entered into evidence during his trial.Mr. Kengeter, however, was never accused of wrongdoing in relation to Libor.The departure of Mr. Kengeter will mark the latest leadership shake up among the worlds largest exchanges.Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, has said he would retire next year.(He originally planned to retire following the completion of the merger with Deutsche Brse.)Adena T. Friedman took the top job at Nasdaq in January, replacing Robert Greifeld as chief executive, and Phupinder Gill retired as chief executive of the CME Group last year after nearly two decades at the company.
Atlantic Hurricanes Wipe Out Reinsurers’ Profits in Europe:::::Photo FRANKFURT The financial damage from the hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida and the Caribbean in recent months crossed the Atlantic on Thursday when Munich Re, a German insurer, warned that virtually all of its profit this year would be wiped out by the horrendous cost of the disasters.The hurricanes have already caused hundreds of deaths and left residents of Puerto Rico and other islands living in primitive conditions.Now, Munich Re and several other large reinsurers companies that effectively insure other insurers have reported big losses resulting from the natural disasters.That has consequences for regular consumers: The financial battering that insurers have suffered portends higher premiums for homeowners in disaster-prone areas.Virtually all insurance companies that sell to consumers and businesses unload some of their risk to reinsurers like Munich Re, Swiss Re or SCOR SE, a French company that also reported losses from the hurricanes on Thursday.The cost of buying reinsurance is almost certain to rise, and will eventually be passed on to customers.Insurance has already become expensive and hard to get in states like Florida, which are frequently at risk of being hit by hurricanes.Munich Re, which has warned about the effects of climate change since the 1970s, has predicted the severity of storms is likely to increase in years to come.That would further raise the financial damage, and consequently the cost of insurance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Munich Re, by some measures the worlds largest reinsurer, said that its losses from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria would be 2.7 billion euros, or $3.2 billion, though it warned that the estimate was fraught with considerable uncertainty.The losses will come to 3.2 billion including damage from other natural catastrophes such as earthquakes in Mexico, Munich Re said.
Head of Mexican Media Giant Televisa to Step Aside:::::Photo MEXICO CITY Emilio Azcrraga Jean, the chairman of Televisa, whose melodramatic telenovelas once hooked viewers around the world, will step down as the companys chief executive at the end of the year, the Mexican media conglomerate announced Thursday.Mr. Azcrragas decision to step back from Televisa the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the world comes as it has begun to experiment with new styles of programming after a sharp decline in ratings at home and in the United States.It also may lay the groundwork for additional changes as Mexican audiences, like audiences everywhere, are fragmenting.The decision is an acknowledgment that radical change is needed, especially in the context of an industry that is changing very fast, said Carlos de Legarreta, a media analyst at GBM, a brokerage house in Mexico City.To refuse to reinvent the company is not an option.As its largest shareholder, Mr. Azcrraga, 49, will remain chairman of the company that his grandfather founded.Alfonso de Angoitia, who has long been responsible for much of the companys operation, and Bernardo Gmez, will become the co-chief executive officers of Televisa.The two men who have been by Mr. Azcrragas side since he took control of Televisa when his father died two decades ago.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Televisa has been at the center of Mexican entertainment for years.Under the leadership of Mr. Azcrragas father, Emilio Azcarrga Milmo, Televisa operated in lock step with the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, broadcasting news coverage that fawned over presidents and programming that glossed over the countrys problems.
Comcast’s Careful Steps to Grow Past Cable Yield Results:::::Photo Comcast is earning its peacock feathers.The $170 billion media firm was early and careful in expanding beyond cable.Two examples are its purchase of NBC Universal originally with its peacock logo and a recently launched wireless phone service.Comcast stock has trounced the shares of Verizon Communications and AT&T.The company, led by Brian Roberts, has even pulled away from Walt Disney in terms of market value this year.Its earnings report released Thursday confirmed that Comcast lost 125,000 TV subscribers in the third quarter because of competition and hurricanes, something it warned about earlier.That doesnt detract much, though, from the longer-term picture.In 2004 Mr. Roberts, the chief executive, made a hostile lurch for Disney only to drop the bid.Comcast finally scored when it bought NBC Universal from General Electric in a two-part, $39 billion deal.The TV outfits former chief executive officer, Bob Wright, groused in his book that G.E., hobbled by the financial crisis, had given away the broadcaster for a song.He reckoned it was worth $45 billion.AT&T has tried belatedly to follow.The telecom firm offered some $85 billion for Time Warner, owner of HBO, in October last year and is still waiting for regulatory approval.It may have overpaid: When the deal was announced, Breakingviews calculated that the expected $1 billion in cost savings wouldnt cover the hefty $20 billion premium.Comcast is prudently moving into other areas as well.It introduced a mobile service using Verizons infrastructure, avoiding acquiring a carrier like T-Mobile US.That may yet be an option, but for the moment its mostly upside for Comcast as it dips into the cellphone business.Mr. Roberts has made mistakes.For one, he misjudged the political climate and had to drop a bid for Time Warner Cable, which Charter Communications scooped up.But investors have little to complain about.Since March 2013, when the NBC Universal deal was finally completed, Comcasts total return, including dividends reinvested, of 96 percent beats the S.&P.500-share index and Disney, at around 80 percent each.AT&T and Verizon have managed only 15 percent and 26 percent, respectively.Comcasts steady strategy is paying off.
Democrats Pressure Trump to Fulfill Promise to Impose Steel Tariffs:::::When the administration announced the investigation, we felt, O.K., theyve got the message.But theyve just dragged their feet and delayed and delayed, Mr. Schumer said.The bottom line is the president has been a total paper tiger on this issue, and as a result, we feel the need to hold up nominees for the Commerce Department.The delays in imposing the tariffs appear to have further worsened conditions for the American steel industry, which was already struggling financially with a global glut of cheap metal.To get ahead of the tariffs, foreign manufacturers appear to have shipped more steel and aluminum into the country.Steel imports rose 20 percent in the five months since the investigation was announced in April, compared with the previous five months, the American Iron and Steel Institute said on Thursday.The import surges have helped fuel more layoffs and plant closures, according to Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers.According to Mr. Paul, that includes layoffs of 180 workers at the Dura-Bond Industries plant in Steelton, Pa., and 150 workers at ArcelorMittals rolling mill in Conshohocken, Pa.The president signed executive orders in April calling for the Department of Commerce to launch two separate investigations into whether imports of steel and aluminum were harming American national security.Initiated under the rarely used Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, the investigations gave the president broad authority to impose tariffs or other restrictions on imports.Proponents of such measures said a glut of Chinese metal was depressing worldwide prices to such low levels that American manufacturers could not remain in business.The administration said it would announce a decision by the end of June.Throughout the spring and summer, those in the steel and aluminum industry in the United States and abroad waited for tariffs or other measures, which they thought would be sweeping and imminent.Photo Wait till you see what Im going to do for steel and your steel companies, Mr. Trump told a crowd in Cincinnati on June 7.Were going to stop the dumping and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers.Well be seeing that very soon.The steel folks are going to be very happy.But the measures never materialized.In July, the president told The Wall Street Journal that he had decided to wait until the administration had finished health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sept. 19, steelworkers came to Capitol Hill to meet with senators and urge them to move the investigation forward.Billy McCall, the president of the local United Steelworkers union in Gary, Ind., said he saw measures to protect steel plants as a necessity.Weve been fighting a trade war for some time, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But support for the steel and aluminum measures has been far from unanimous.American industries that buy metals to forge into other products, including food packagers and automakers, complained that tariffs could raise their costs and shrink their profits.The European Union and foreign countries that supply metals to the United States, including Canada and South Korea, also protested, arguing that the United States should work with other countries to act against China, not retaliate against its allies.The Department of Defense argued that import restrictions could raise the price of its equipment, while the Department of Agriculture said it feared foreign partners would retaliate against American food exports.In a letter sent Wednesday, Mr. Schumer and other Democrats urged the Commerce Department to take action before Mr. Trump arrived in Beijing on Nov. 8.But the White House may be hesitant to introduce such an aggressive policy before an important diplomatic visit.The move is part of a broader fight over Mr. Trumps promises to radically alter trade policy, which has largely been subsumed by other priorities, like the tax overhaul and the nuclear threat from North Korea.It is also a sign of the continued challenge the administration faces in creating policies to confront China economically while still preserving a strategic partnership.Mr. Trump came into office saying that Chinas economic competition was one of the biggest challenges facing the United States, but the administration has struggled to put together a comprehensive strategy to deal with it.The administration did press China for significant cuts to its steel capacity during a visit to Washington in July, but the Chinese refused to accede to such big reductions.Since then, it has begun an investigation into intellectual property violations by the Chinese and is reportedly working on a more comprehensive trade approach.Both have yet to be unveiled, and it is unclear to what extent these plans or their components will be discussed during Mr. Trumps Beijing visit.In the next few months, the administration could roll out several influential trade measures, including the results of these investigations.Mr. Trump also confronts major decisions on whether to impose tariffs to protect domestic makers of solar cells and washing machines, as well as whether to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.By statute, the Commerce Department is required to deliver final reports on steel and aluminum to the administration by January 2018.
Insys Founder Charged in Bribe Scheme Linked to Fentanyl-Based Painkiller:::::Photo The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on federal charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based painkiller intended for cancer patients.John Kapoor, the Insys founder, was charged with engaging in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in Federal District Court in Boston.He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a case that was previously filed against six former Insys executives and managers, including Michael Babich, the former chief executive, prosecutors said.In a statement, Brian Kelly, a lawyer for Mr. Kapoor, said, My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously.Insys, which has been in talks with the Justice Department about a settlement in connection with the inquiry, declined to comment.Its stock price closed down 22.64 percent to a four-year low of $5.74 on Thursday.The charges escalate the continuing inquiries into Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.They came as President Trump declared the countrys opioid problem a public health crisis.William D. Weinreb, the acting United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said the charges reflected a commitment on the part of authorities to combat the opioid-abuse epidemic.Opioids drugs were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable, just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer, Mr. Weinreb said in a statement.Mr. Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a member of its board, stepped down in January as the companys chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently chairman of the drugmaker Akorn Inc. and president of the investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises.Prosecutors said that after bringing Subsys to market in 2012, Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Babich and others devised a scheme to pay speaking fees and other bribes to medical practitioners who prescribed the drug.They also sought to defraud insurers into approving payments for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.The other defendants include Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry, former company vice presidents; Richard Simon, a former national sales director; and Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan, former regional sales directors.They have pleaded not guilty.

Is Bridge a Sport? E.U. Court Says No:::::Bad news, bridge fans.The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that the card game is not a sport, even when played by multiple competing teams.Like many disappointments, this one traces its roots to a dispute on taxes.The courts decision came in response to a case filed by the English Bridge Union, based in Aylesbury, which organizes team-based bridge matches.The organization had argued that it should not have to charge tax on entry fees to its tournaments because bridge is a card-based mind sport.Entry fees for many sports competitions are exempt from value-added tax, or VAT, in Britain.But the British tax authority said bridge did not qualify because it did not involve much physical exertion.The European Court heard the bridge unions arguments against the tax authority, Her Majestys Revenue and Customs, in Luxembourg in March, the group said.On Thursday, the court sided with the tax authorities and said in a statement that bridge was not a sport because it was characterized by a physical element that appears to be negligible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The bridge union promotes a form known as duplicate bridge, which minimizes the role of chance by having teams score points based on how well each plays the same hands.The court agreed that this involves logic, memory and planning and may constitute an activity beneficial to the mental and physical health of regular participants.

Australia Battles Amazon, With Populist Defiance:::::I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath.In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry.I wish I was more optimistic, said Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend Books in Brisbane.What concerns me the most about the growing influence of corporations like Amazon is their worldview, said Tim Winton, the author of Cloudstreet and many other well-known novels.People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce.That pessimism and the demand for a society built to a more human scale and tied more closely to identity and agency crosses ideological and international borders.Its Catalonia trying to split from Spain.Its Silicon Valley insiders calling for us all to turn off our smartphones.Its Steve Bannon and Brexit, yes, but it may also be Emmanuel Macron and Jacinda Ardern.Whether populism is the right word for this is an open question, but whatever it is, it may be the ism of our time a messy mishmash of human urges seeking a middle ground after the Cold War battle between capitalism and communism.Maybe its just a function of change, and a lot of it.A McKinsey Institute report from 2015 keeps coming back to me.It compared the current moment of globalization and technological change with the Industrial Revolution, and concluded that in this era, change is happening 10 times faster and at 300 times the scale, or roughly 3,000 times the impact.If that assessment is accurate, the urge to pull inward and protect your own regardless of your professed politics starts to make more sense.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Add to that the continued rise in influence of digital giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon (part of what our tech columnist has identified as the Frightful Five) and its hard to see a world in which the tensions between the local and the global diminish anytime soon.Some

Weinstein Company Will Not Get Planned Cash Infusion:::::On Monday, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the studio, examining whether allegations against Mr. Weinstein reflect broad gender discrimination and other civil rights violations.On Tuesday, an aspiring actress, Dominique Huett, sued the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles Superior Court, accusing it of negligence.She became the first woman to take legal action against the studio since The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment and rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein.In her complaint, Ms. Huett said Mr. Weinstein had lured her to a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 with a promise to discuss acting roles and instead forced her to engage in sex acts.A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment on the suit on Wednesday.The suit contends that the Weinstein Company had a duty to control Weinstein in his interactions with women during meetings taking place within the course and scope of his employment.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio on Oct. 8, has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Part of Colonys calculus appears to involve the likelihood that other women will sue the studio.More than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Mr. Weinstein.In remarks to Bloomberg Television on Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Barrack was attending a business conference, he said that sorting through which potential liabilities are attributable to the company on an ongoing basis, and which arent, is a Rubiks Cube.Adding to the complexity, no one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey, Mr. Barrack said.In other words: Would it be possible to structure a sale so that Mr. Weinstein did not benefit financially?Mr. Weinstein owns roughly 20 percent of the studio.His brother, Bob, owns an identical share.The rest is owned by about 25 investors, who hold portions of varying sizes.Several major entertainment companies have looked at buying pieces of the Weinstein Company and come away with mixed to negative reactions, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Lionsgate had interest in only one of the studios coming films, Paddington 2, which is set for release in January.But even that family sequel has limited potential; the Weinstein Company mainly holds domestic rights.Endeavor, which owns the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the IMG sports and fashion business, took a look at the Weinstein Company to see if there was a way to protect clients who have projects in the works there.But it concluded that clients should instead use legal tactics to pry projects loose.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Endeavor-related projects include a film adaptation of the musical In the Heights, created by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegra Hudes; a documentary about President Trump by Michael Moore; and a planned adaptation of The Boys in the Boat, Daniel James Browns book about the American rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.Even before the sexual harassment crisis, the Weinsteins boutique studio was struggling.Film releases had become sporadic, and its library of old films had become less valuable because of the collapse of the DVD market and a 2010 deal to sell a substantial portion to prevent bankruptcy.The studio has made inroads in television, selling series to the likes of Amazon and Viacom and lining up potential shows with Showtime and Apple.But Amazon pulled the plug on its deal after the harassment scandal.Apple also walked away.Showtime said it would move forward with its project only if the Weinstein Company dropped out.Viacoms Paramount Network, formerly known as Spike, is moving forward with three series.In terms of existing shows, the Weinstein Companys primary asset is Project Runway, which airs on Lifetime.A scripted series, Scream, will return for a six-episode third season on MTV in the spring.
Amazon’s Latest Way Into Your Life Is Through the Front Door:::::Photo SEATTLE For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain.Now, if customers give it permission, Amazons couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home.What could possibly go wrong?The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home.There are risks for couriers too whether its an attacking dog or an escaping cat.To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera.Amazon isnt the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping.This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier.The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them.E-commerce companies have experimented with ways of making deliveries more secure for years.Amazon installs self-service lockers in office buildings and outside supermarkets where customers can fetch their orders, and Daimler and other carmakers have tested the delivery of goods from Amazon and other retailers to customers car trunks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The costs of package theft arent known Amazon, for example, will not say but are probably substantial.Most people who have spent any time on a neighborhood blog, social network or email list have a sense of how prevalent such crime is.And packages sitting on front porches can also signal to anyone who walks by that the homeowners are away.
M.T.A. Will Ban Alcohol Advertising on Buses and Subways:::::In 2015, the board voted to ban political advertising on subways and buses to avoid legal challenges it had faced in rejecting some ads with political messages.Tobacco advertising has been banned in the transit system since 1992.The estimated $2 million in revenue derived each year from alcohol advertising is a minuscule figure compared with the authoritys budget, said Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the authority.The authority expects to receive about $15.5 billion in revenue in 2017.The authority, he said, was not concerned about making up for lost revenue, especially as the system begins to modernize.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.When advertisers understand that we have approximately 1.6 million people every single day through the system its a fabulous place to advertise, Mr. Lhota said.Effective immediately, the agency will no longer accept new alcohol-related ads; existing contracts for such ads will be honored until the contracts expire at the end of the year.The decision disappointed alcohol trade associations, which have confronted a growing number of alcohol advertising bans in cities across the country.Science and research show that there is no benefit to banning this type of advertising, said Jay Hibbard, vice president of government relations for the Distilled Spirits Council.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Hibbard said the majority of the American population, about 71.6 percent, was above the legal drinking age.Parents, not advertisements, are the greatest influence on preventing underage drinking, he said.This is not advertising on school buses, Mr. Hibbard said.This is advertising on a public transportation system.The board is still discussing how the measure will affect the partnerships it has with Connecticut on Metro-North Railroad trains, and with New Jersey on New Jersey Transit.Underage drinking leads to over 7,000 emergency-room visits in New York City hospitals a year, said Councilman Daniel Dromm, a Democrat representing Jackson Heights, Queens.Im 26 years clean and sober, and its a personal issue for me, said Mr. Dromm, who introduced a resolution in the Council urging the authority to ban alcohol ads.I know the detrimental effect this type of advertising has on young people.
Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool:::::As a generation turned, house D.J.s turned remixes of Sade ballads into club classics, and a raft of hip-hop artists repeatedly sampled her.So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week, obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the stores side.All that says is your understanding of the world and whats happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol, one wrote.Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet.But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.This impact includes tattoos.More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adus visage over the last year or so.A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than theyd gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.A post shared by Art8C Tattoo8CLaser8C (@niki23gtr) on Mar 22, 2017 at 9:26am PDT The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake.He premiered it on Instagram this March.In it, Ms. Adus hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adus image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt.In March, Reese Witherspoons Type A character on Big Little Lies established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade on the car stereo and mistakes it for Adele.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Demand for T-shirts from Sades 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chicos Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.Photo Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sades 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West.Id sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still dont understand, Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.I used to say to people about Sade, This isnt going to impress everyone in the room, Mr. Matamoros said.Get an Iron Maiden shirt if thats what you want.Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.Photo Not anymore.Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name.(Many Americans believe its pronounced Shar-day; its Sha-day.)In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sades disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the worlds most prestigious fashion school.To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the bands Love Deluxe and Lovers Rock albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly.The lead singer left, she later said.Photo It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride.They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now, said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.She was very young, but she was very sophisticated, Ms.Blond said.She didnt follow anyone elses style.No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her.She didnt mind designer clothes, but youd never ever look at her and say, Oh thats a Chanel outfit.She never looked like a brand.And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.In a way, Ms. Adus sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, Smooth Operator, she was lamenting what happens when sentiment is left to chance.The saxophone signaled sorrow.Ms. Adu wasnt asking as Ms. Jones did for a guy to drive it in between.Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on Saturday Night Live with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: It was the first time I did SNL, which is a major event an anyones life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history.Id never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H.I thought the big talisman for being on SNL was the job of saying Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote.She was not that.She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence.Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade.She remains a Smooth Operator, no?Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sades first four albums, said, There was grace to everything she did.Photo Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasnt because she was temperamental or diva-ish.She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion.She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.She never enjoyed promotion of any type, Mr. Beck said.It was painful for her.Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal.I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period.I said, Youll hate it but well get it all done and when youre done youre done.And she laughed, and thats what we did for the next two albums after that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story (She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turners career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer.She wanted to have normal relationships.She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.Photo Sades 1992 album, Love Deluxe, arrived four years after Stronger Than Pride.Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said.I thought that was so sweet.(In a 1992 interview she said, Its good that we stopped and didnt try to make another one off the back of the previous album.You get some perspective on why youre making a record.)Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sades videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.She said, I dont mind.Ill do that for you, but I dont want it to be anywhere near the album cover, Mr. Watson said.I said, The shoot is for you.You control all the images.Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of Pearls, perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war.Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the eras defining club tracks.In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended.Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship.For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.An eight-year stretch between albums yielded Lovers Rock, which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people.The video for King of Sorrow was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a childs shoe clean.Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it?Who could say.It was lovely.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts.With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew.The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade.The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious.Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form.(And the time away only helped build interest.The first tour for her 2001 album, Lovers Rock, grossed $26 million.The second, for Soldier of Love, grossed $50 million.)In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance.She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving childs Instagram.On Mothers Day this year, this undated portrait was published.Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared.She looks impeccably happy.A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere.Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazines entertainment director, didnt hesitate when asked whom they were channeling.Sade, she said.You never know how someones going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres.Nicki saw the images and was like, Sade, Oh my God.I love it.It felt expensive, cool and timeless.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isnt sure.Its always like that with Sade, he said.Time will go by and shell start working on it.For her, its like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning.You know you dont want to do it, but at some point you just do it.When we were having our first success with her, I said, This lady could have a hit album when shes 90 years old.Most artists try too hard, Mr. Beck said.And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isnt out there waving their rsum at you every five minutes.Shes completely unique.
Spain Looks to Seize Catalonia Radio and TV as Crisis Mounts:::::Among those measures, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy wants to guarantee truthful, objective and balanced coverage in Catalonia.Such a media takeover would be a direct strike at Catalan institutions that have been instrumental in promoting a separate culture and language.It would also put the Spanish government on a path toward reducing media freedom in ways that worry many Spaniards, even beyond Catalonia.But the prospect has left Catalan citizens and journalists especially anxious.Not least among them is Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, who said it would return Spain to a dark period, when the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco censored information.When a government says that it will take charge of a television station, I know that this is something very serious, said Mr. Sanchis, who wrote his doctoral thesis about Francos censorship.Since last weekend, the Catalan broadcaster has received messages of solidarity from the staff committees of rival television stations, including Spanish national television, where some employees have been openly criticizing their own coverage of the conflict.Ignacio Escolar, the editor of eldiario.es, a Madrid-based online publication, wrote that TV3 isnt my model of public television, but that he was shocked by what he described as the cynicism of Mr. Rajoys government in demanding truthful coverage.Spains national television station, which is led by a central government appointee, runs news bulletins that have become obscenely manipulated, Mr. Escolar claimed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The divergent story lines have sown bitterness all around, and extraordinarily harsh characterizations and criticism from each side.Last month, a group of far-right protesters stood outside the studio of Catalunya Radio during the morning show of Mnica Terribas, the stations most famous presenter.They shouted insults and displayed a banner that accused her of leading Catalans toward independence just as a Rwandan radio station persuaded Hutus to kill Tutsis before the 1994 genocide.Somebody who compares us to the radio in Rwanda clearly hasnt thought properly about what that means, said Ms. Terribas in an interview on Tuesday.It breaks my heart to hear people talk about us like monsters who manipulate brains.But perhaps the outlet with the most at stake for Catalans is TV3, which was begun in 1983 as an ambitious regional television project that Catalonias leader at the time, Jordi Pujol, used to reinstall the Catalan language, which was banned under Francos dictatorship.Since then, TV3 has spawned a generation of Catalan producers who built their own media companies, in both Catalonia and the rest of Spain.Photo TV3 was a decisive element in the construction of the new Catalan identity and society that Pujol wanted, but it also became part of a powerful system of clientelism, said Josep Maria Mart Font, a Catalan journalist and former foreign correspondent for the newspaper El Pas.Antonio Garca Ferreras, who runs a politics show on La Sexta, a Madrid-based television channel, argued that Catalonias independence movement had been light years ahead of its opponents, in terms of promoting its separatist project on every possible platform.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The same ideology has been sold in every clever way possible, including on TV3s children and food shows, Mr. Garca Ferreras claimed.I think the independence movement is perhaps now a victim of its communications success, having made people really believe that independence could soon become a reality.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In Madrid, on the other hand, he added, were now seeing a large part of the media respond in a way that is forceful but also disrespectful, building up an audience that seems happy to hear denigrating views about Catalonia.As the standoff has reached a boiling point, some columnists and pundits have resigned or been pushed aside, while warning against mounting extremism in the news media.This month, Joan Lpez Alegre, a Catalan university professor of communications, left alongside another regular pundit on TV3, signing off with an opinion article in El Pas headlined Farewell to the circus of hatred.Mr. Lpez Alegre argued in an interview that it would not be illogical for Mr. Rajoys government to take control of a Catalan broadcaster that had been pushing not only a political project against Madrid, but also working to create a conflict within Catalan society, using public money.The conflict has put journalists on both sides under huge pressure, also because it often feels extremely personal.Susanna Griso is a journalist who comes from Barcelona but has worked for the past 20 years in Madrid for the Antena 3 channel.She recently choked back tears on live television while arguing with a Catalan mayor about whether Spanish police officers should be stationed in her town.Photo These are extreme circumstances when youre giving opinions about an issue that affects your family and those you love, Ms. Griso said.From the media coverage, it often now looks as if were already living in different states, but real life is a lot more complicated than that.Mr.Mart Font, the former El Pas journalist, noted that the gap in the narrative was

members.Money talks and its easier to turn off the tap to change an editorial line rather than enforce censorship, as weve seen with the problems of some newspapers dealing with their debt holders, he said.Mr. Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, acknowledged that his company could not survive without public money.The Catalan government pays 230 million euros, or about $272 million, of TV3s annual 300 million budget.Madrid has already used the stick to force Catalan media into line.Last month, it warned that it would prosecute media companies that advertised the independence referendum.Ara, a Catalan newspaper that is committed to holding an independence referendum, heeded the warning.Some readers were unhappy, but we took this decision not only to protect our newspaper but also to stay sound and alive now, said Salvador Garcia Ruiz, Aras chief executive.On Tuesday afternoon, Ldia Heredia drove home late, after spending 12 hours at her TV3 television station, presenting her morning show and then attending an afternoon newsroom meeting where executives discussed Article 155 with their anguished staff.Ive always known that Im in a job with high responsibility as well as pressure,

Illinois Wields New Power to Challenge Noncompete Agreements:::::When workers violate one of these agreements, courts can prevent them from taking a new position or remove them from a job theyve settled into.Even when that does not happen, the threat creates a chilling effect that makes people skittish about leaving or seeking a raise.Volumes of economic research have identified the proliferation of these agreements as one reason American wages have been stagnant.This has led to a push from state and national politicians to limit where and how they can be used.Last year, the Treasury Department and President Barack Obamas Council of Economic Advisers released papers on the economic harm wrought by noncompetes and other restrictive employment contracts.In 2015, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced federal legislation to ban noncompetes for workers making less than $15 an hour.The bill never passed, but last year the Illinois legislature passed a law prohibiting noncompetes for employees who make less than $13 an hour.Since then the attorney general has reached settlements with several companies to have the clauses removed, but until Wednesday had not filed a lawsuit.In addition to alleging that Check Into Cash broke Illinoiss new noncompete law, the suit takes a page from the economic literature by arguing that noncompetes hurt the states economy by suppressing wages and preventing workers from leaving for better pay.It also argues that noncompetes make it harder for state employers to find the best people, reducing innovation and limiting the pool of workers that thriving businesses need to grow.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its clearly a winning issue for attorneys general, said Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton economics professor who was chairman of Mr. Obamas Council of Economic Advisers.In Illinois and elsewhere, much of the recent interest among legislators and attorneys general began a little over three years ago, when the Huffington Post reported that the Jimmy Johns sandwich chain required hourly sandwich makers and delivery drivers to sign noncompetes.Illinois sued Jimmy Johns last year, arguing that its noncompete agreement violated the states consumer fraud act the new noncompete law hadnt been passed yet and reached a settlement in which the company agreed to remove the clause.New Yorks attorney general announced a similar settlement with Jimmy Johns.Each time the Jimmy Johns case was in the news, the Illinois attorney generals office received a round of calls from workers who felt they had signed an unfair noncompete agreement, including nurses, sales representatives, day care workers and cooks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story One complaint came from an undisclosed employee of Check Into Cash.Ms. Madigan said her office was investigating about a dozen companies over the use of noncompete agreements.According to the lawsuit, clerks at Illinois branches of Check Into Cash agree not to work at any employer offering services like check cashing, loans or money transmission for a year after they leave.It applies to employers within 15 miles of any of the companys more than 1,000 locations in the United States.The Illinois attorney generals lawsuit said that because Check Into Cash had 33 locations in the state, its workers were effectively agreeing not to seek employment at competitors across Chicago and its suburbs.And the language is broad enough to extend far beyond other check-cashing and payday-loan companies for instance, to include department stores, which offer their own credit cards, and the post office, which allows people to send money, said Jane Flanagan, an assistant attorney general in Illinois who is the lead lawyer on the case.Studies have shown that many employees who sign noncompete provisions have no idea what theyve agreed to.People arent necessarily aware they sign one of these and then they try to leave, and at that point their manager tells them, Oh, but you have this noncompete, Ms. Flanagan said.
Count on a Political Backlash to the Banks’ Victory in the Senate:::::Banks just scored a victory against disgruntled customers and, in the longer term, against themselves.The Senate has killed a rule allowing groups of consumers to sue financial firms and card issuers even when the small print of their contracts prohibits them from doing so.Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again.Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night.The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the agency, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.Mr. Cordray argued that consumers needed protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged.Banks said the rule would increase costs for consumers.Their celebration could be short-lived.Equifax, the credit-scoring agency, had to drop its arbitration clause for the 145.5 million consumers who may have been affected by a data breach it disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general.And after Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration.Before the vote, the industry had been enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington.Wall Street wasnt even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections.Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they needed further antitrust regulations.The Senate vote reignited their ire, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, calling it a giant wet kiss to Wall Street.Bashing banks is also still in style among the populist base that elevated Donald J. Trump to the presidency.The shrinking political target on the backs of banks is set to grow again.
Women Accuse Knight Landesman, Art World Mainstay, of Sexual Harassment:::::For decades, Mr. Landesman, 67, had been a pillar of the international art scene, a man-about-town known from the galleries of Manhattan to the Art Basel fair in Switzerland for his primary-colored suits and deep connections in the industry.The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, who once served as the head of the National Endowment for the Arts, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and until Wednesday had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell.Photo The lawsuit that preceded his departure was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and included accusations that he had harassed nine women, groping them, attempting to kiss them, sending them vulgar messages and, on occasion, retaliating against them when they spurned his advances.The accounts were from both former employees at the magazine and women Mr. Landesman met at art events, all of whom said he took advantage of them at the start of their careers when they were economically and professionally vulnerable.The suit also accused the owners of Artforum, one of the art worlds premier publications, of being aware of his behavior but doing little to stop it.The only named plaintiff in the suit is Amanda Schmitt, a New York curator who started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21.Shortly after Ms. Schmitt took the job, the suit contended, Mr. Landesman singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention, subjecting her to questions about her sex life while touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email, reviewed by The Times, in which he praised brown nosing as a sales technique before veering off into a different and sexually explicit description of the practice.Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea, ostensibly to discuss her career, and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, the suit said.It also cited another incident in which Mr. Landesman is said to have told Ms. Schmitt that she needed to be more open to physical contact to succeed and demonstrated by running his finger down her body.In December 2012, while both were attending Art Basel Miami, Mr. Landesman barraged Ms. Schmitt with text messages asking that she meet him alone and kiss him for three seconds, the suit claimed.When Ms. Schmitt refused, Mr. Landesman sent an email saying: Give yourself to me!ALL of you = to all of me.Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending notes, asking if she was making herself climax and was ready to make it a bit physical.Over the next two years, when he saw Ms. Schmitt at art events, the suit said, he would often whisper to her about masturbation and spanking, and touch her without consent.In May 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with Mr. Landesman, pleading with him to stop.But according to the suit, he responded by reaching his shoeless foot out to caress her.The following month, Ms. Schmitt sent him a text message saying: You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so.I want it to stop.Mr. Landesman wrote back promising professionalism in the future, but then asked if they could get on the same page, adding, Id like to be an ally.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On June 15, 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with two of Artforums other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent.That same day, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising he was taking action to insure that whatever may have transpired never happens again.But according to the suit, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events.Then in May, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic.Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had unfairly accused him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended.Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment.Three months ago, Ms. Schmitts lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, sent Artforum a letter detailing those acts as well as the accounts of other women who claim Mr. Landesman harassed them.The letter demanded that the harassment stop and that Artforum pay Ms. Schmitts legal and therapy bills.Negotiations broke down last week, Ms. Reisbaum said, partly because Artforum demanded that Ms. Schmitt not speak to the media.Her lawsuit includes the other womens accounts, although none of them joined it as plaintiffs.While their stories suggest a pattern of harassment, it remains unclear if they can be considered as corroborating evidence since some of the accusers never worked for Mr. Landesman.One of them, Elisabeth McAvoy, did work at Artforum on and off from 2010 to 2013 and described how Mr. Landesman often subjected her to unwanted touching.Ms. McAvoy, who was in her 20s then and shared a bedroom with her sister, said that Mr. Landesman once encouraged her to get her own apartment so that her sister could masturbate herself to sleep.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jordana Zeldin, a former Manhattan gallery owner, met Mr. Landesman at an art opening in 2012 and said that when he saw her boyfriend giving her a back rub, he began to pressure her for back rubs in a series of emails over the next several weeks.When Ms. Zeldin finally put her foot down, Mr. Landesman sent her an email saying she should ask for forgiveness.How about a small apology, the email said.Knight I feel a little guilty that somehow I may have lead you on into thinking Id give you a great backrub.Valerie Werder, who worked in a gallery, said that Mr. Landesman groped her after introducing her to one of her favorite art writers at an industry gala last year.Another gallery worker, Alissa McKendrick, said he did the same to her at the Whitney Biennial in 2012.In an interview this week, Ms. Schmitt said that she never wanted to sue, but that she did so not just to protect herself, but also the countless young men and women starting out in the art world.I had no power and no voice then, she said.I dont feel that way anymore.
‘TRL’ Is Back on MTV, but Undone by the Internet:::::Even though its been on the air for less than a month, the reboot of TRL on MTV already has a few signature moves.There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members.There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented.And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch.The seams are visible, and frayed, on TRL, which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first.In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, TRL originally Total Request Live was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era.It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers.But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTVs mission.Photo The TRL of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions.Each episode is an hour but feels like two.It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF.(One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.)The fact that the internet has leached attention and relevance away from television is only part of whats befuddling this show plenty of television is premised on digesting and commenting on things that happen online.But those shows say, Desus & Mero, or even late-night talk-show monologues specialize in personalities and commentary.TRL is a mishmash and has the additional problem of trying to build a tentpole television series out of the component parts of internet personalities, who are generally poorly suited to the task.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats true of the musical guests, many of whom found fame online and arent kiln-fired in the glare of camera lights.An interview with the young rap star Lil Uzi Vert elicited about a couple dozen words from him.Playboi Carti looked somnolent during his performance.When actual famous people, like Fifth Harmony, Ed Sheeran or Pitbull, showed up, their professionalism was almost disruptive.On the episode when Jhen Aiko spoke of keeping a journal after the death of her brother, it was as if the channel had flipped.
CBS Names Jeff Glor Its Evening News Anchor:::::For the current season, CBS Evening News is averaging 6.2 million viewers, with 1.3 million viewers in the all-important 25-to-54-year-old bracket, according to Nielsen.The total is more than two million fewer than ABCs newscast with David Muir.Both ABC and NBC attract roughly 500,000 more viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic.David Rhodes, CBS Newss president, praised Mr. Glors enormously strong work in the field, and the fact that hes kind of done every job here.Mr. Glor has been with the network since 2007 and has hosted the weekend edition of CBS Evening News.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Rhodes also emphasized that what had secured the job for Mr. Glor was what hes done here, at CBS, as opposed to going out and getting some kind of attention-getting external hire.Mr. Glor is by no means a household name, though many news executives argue that thats not as important as it was in the days of Brokaw, Jennings and Rather.Mr. Muir was an 11-year-veteran of ABC News before being tapped to replace Diane Sawyer; Lester Holt had been at NBC News for 15 years before becoming the emergency and then the permanent replacement for Brian Williams.Indeed, the biggest star power and highest salaries have shifted to the morning hours, where the revenue and profits are significantly higher than in the evening.Megyn Kelly, whom NBC is paying more than $15 million a year, was given a show at 9 a.m. on weekdays.Though she has a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus, that is not nearly as important to the network as her morning gig, which is off to a rough start in the ratings.Anthony Mason, who was the interim host since Mr. Pelleys departure, will continue his hosting duties of the Saturday edition of CBS This Morning.
Eminem’s Publisher Triumphs in New Zealand Copyright Battle:::::Photo A political party in New Zealand must pay Eminems music publisher $413,000 (600,000 New Zealand dollars) for infringing on the copyright of his hit song Lose Yourself, a court in Wellington ruled.The National Party of New Zealand had been sued in 2014 by the publisher, Eight Mile Style, over a song featured in one of its campaign ads that echoed the rappers Grammy and Oscar-winning 2002 smash.The name of the song?Eminem Esque.A representative for Eminem said that the artist was not himself a party to the lawsuit and has no comment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.The case had received international attention this year, spawning a viral video of stone-faced lawyers silently listening to Lose Yourself in court, and serving as fodder for John Olivers satirical news show Last Week Tonight.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In court, a lawyer for the National Party argued that "Eminem Esque didnt substantially copy Lose Yourself, and that the latter was itself derivative of other earlier works.Under New Zealand law, copyright infringement claims are valid only if the infringing song bears sufficient objective similarity to original components of the work alleged to have been copied.
C.D.C. Panel Recommends a New Shingles Vaccine:::::Once a person has had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue.Years later, it may reactivate as shingles.The C.D.C.estimates that about one million cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.This is what weve been waiting for, said Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an expert in the disease.Shingles is an unappreciated and common cause of severe problems throughout the nervous system.Dr. Oaklander said that while rash symptoms lead some people to consider shingles as minor as a bad sunburn, the illness can cause strokes, encephalitis, spinal cord damage and loss of vision.Photo Given in one dose, Zostavax had shown a 51 percent reduction in shingles and a 67 percent reduction in nerve pain.Shingrix is given in two doses, and the company said clinical trials showed it to be about 98 percent effective for one year and about 85 percent over three years.By preventing shingles, the vaccine also drastically reduces the overall incidence of severe nerve pain, a lasting complication for about one in three people who get shingles.GlaxoSmithKline said it tested the vaccine in more than 38,000 people.We believe Shingrix will provide confidence in the protection one can expect from a shingles vaccine, said Luc Debruyne, the companys president of global vaccines.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The recommendation of the advisory committee will be considered an endorsement of Shingrix over Zostavax, although the closeness of the committee vote, 8 to 7, may mitigate the market loss for Merck.Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer in the C.D.C.s division of viral disease, said she expected the agencys final recommendation to be issued early next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Shingrix vaccine has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles and its complications, Dr. Dooling said.She cautioned, however, that more people had adverse reactions to Shingrix than to Zostavax, including fever and muscle aches.Patients and health care providers should be aware that this vaccine is very effective, but it also causes more reactions than they may be used to with other adult vaccines, she said.All indications are these are not dangerous to ones health, but they may interfere with your daily activities for a few days.GlaxoSmithKline said its new vaccine would cost about $280 and would be available next month.Zostavax costs about $223.
James Murdoch Says Size of O’Reilly Settlement Was ‘News to Me’:::::Photo James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, on Wednesday defended how the company responded to sexual harassment allegations against the former Fox News host Bill OReilly, stating that he did not know the size of Mr. OReillys $32 million settlement until recently.It was the first time that Mr. Murdoch had publicly addressed the controversy since The New York Times reported over the weekend that the company had granted Mr. OReilly a contract extension the month after he agreed to the settlement with a longtime Fox News legal analyst.At the time, the company was aware of at least six settlements involving harassment allegations against Mr. OReilly.The settlement wasnt a company settlement, and that was news to me when we saw the number the other day, Mr. Murdoch said, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit, a media conference, in New York.At the time, what you do is you deal with what you know, he added.You investigate things thoroughly.You do the best job you can with that, and you try to make the right decision.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In response to questions from The Times, 21st Century Fox has previously acknowledged that it was aware of the womans allegations against Mr. OReilly which included harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of pornography and that a settlement had been reached.The company has said that it considered the dispute a personal issue between Mr. OReilly and the woman, Lis Wiehl.
Rita Henley Jensen, Founder of Women’s eNews, Dies at 70:::::About two years later, when the fund withdrew its sponsorship, Ms. Jensen took the site over, turning into fund-raiser in chief in addition to editor in chief to keep it afloat and further its mission of writing about womens issues, which she defined expansively.Its not just about abortion, she said in a 2007 interview with CUNY-TV in New York.Its about economic opportunity.Its about the nutrition programs.Its about whos going on the Supreme Court next.Its about everything that impacts women, which is everything.Rita Jane Henley was born on Jan. 1, 1947, in Columbus.Her father, Justin, was a journalist, and her mother, the former Mary Elizabeth Downey, was a homemaker.Her first journalism job was with The Paterson News in New Jersey, where she was a reporter from 1977 to 1979.Then came the position at the Stamford paper and the Brinks robbery, a botched job attempted by members of the Black Liberation Army and other radicals, for which Ms. Boudin went to prison.(She was released in 2003 and is now an assistant professor at Columbia.)Ms. Jensen brought legal action against the company.Central to the dispute was whether she had known the real identity of Ms. Boudin, who was using the name Lynn Adams.Ms. Jensen said at the time that she had known who Ms. Boudin was and had so informed her editor, but that later news accounts had misconstrued the careful wording they had devised to skirt the issue.The media picked up the story, added and subtracted a word here and there, and suddenly I was quoted denying that I knew Lynn Adams was actually Kathy Boudin, she said.Photo As Ms. Jensen eased back into journalism, she was writing about womens issues even before she started Womens eNews.Her personal experience with spousal abuse made her a lifelong advocate for providing women in difficult circumstances with support.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The resources available to battered women in need of assistance have drifted steadily downward during the past 20 years, she wrote in 1996, when President Bill Clinton was pushing changes to the welfare system.In 1973, my children and I lived in Ohio and received $204 a month or about 75 percent of the average need, she said, adding, Twenty-three years later, the maximum family of three in Ohio receives $341 or less than half of the average need.The issue was not just dollars and cents, she continued.I am willing to go so far as to say the ongoing Republican and conservative Democratic campaigns against welfare inflame the hatred of the attackers and further diminish low-income womens self-respect and are therefore contributing factors to domestic violence, she wrote.Violence against women was only one of the issues Ms. Jensen and the journalists she edited and mentored dug into at Womens eNews.Single motherhood, health, womens legal status and more received scrutiny, and the site looked far beyond the borders of the United States.In 2003 it started an Arabic version after noticing that its articles were drawing a lot of readers in countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.Most recently, Ms. Jensen had been concerned with high mortality rates among women giving birth in parts of the United States, a subject she wrote about for cnn.com in May.She had recently left Womens eNews and started the Jane Crow Project to combat that problem, especially among African-American women.She also occasionally wrote about her breast cancer.In a straightforward, often droll article for sheknows.com in 2016, she recounted her decision not to have reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy.I do not regret that I decided to drop a boob, she wrote.I do regret that the post-mastectomy bathing suit I bought is ugly, by my lights.I would really like my black Speedo back.Ms. Jensens marriage to James Jensen in 1965 ended in divorce.In addition to Ms. Jensen-Vargas, she is survived by another daughter, Shasta Jensen; three brothers, Dick, Paul and Mark Henley; and four grandchildren.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Jensen was always quick to acknowledge the help she received in hard times, whether from an aid program or the good Samaritan who got her to orientation on her first day at Ohio State.Having no money for transportation, she hoped to hitchhike to the university, dropping her two girls off at two different day care centers on the way.That improbable plan succeeded when a man in a red sports car pulled over in the rain; the stranger dropped the two children off, then dropped her off, even letting her bum one of his cigarettes.When he let me out, I thanked him, she recalled, recounting the moment in the anthology Nothing but the Truth So Help Me God: 73 Women on Lifes Transitions (2014).He nodded, revved his engine and sped off.
A Chef Will Wind Down His Crusade to Feed Puerto Rico:::::The operation will shift to a more strategic approach aimed at feeding the elderly, the sick and people in remote communities, including Ponce, Humacao, Naguabo and Vieques, an island eight miles east of the main island that was hit particularly hard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In those places, local chefs and church members will cook rice dishes and other hot food with ingredients and supplies delivered by the network that World Central Kitchen has developed in the month it has been in Puerto Rico.We are going to concentrate on hot meals because there is plenty of cold food and sandwiches on the island now, Mr. Andrs said in an interview on Tuesday night.Photo At this point in Puerto Ricos recovery, cooking and distributing too much free food could swamp the emerging economy, he said.Even though 75 percent of the island is still without power and relies largely on bottled water, officials report that about 89 percent of grocery stores have reopened, and small restaurants and roadside stands are starting to sell food.An NGO has no right taking money away from business, said Mr. Andrs, 48, who immigrated to the United States from Spain.At its peak, Mr. Andrss operation cost about $400,000 a day, including transportation and hotel costs for chefs and staff members he flew in from some of the 27 restaurants in his company, Think Food Group.He also paid to use some venues, and paid people like food-truck owners who took meals into isolated neighborhoods that had received little or no other support.The money came from donations to World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit association of chefs that Mr. Andrs established in 2011 after he traveled to Haiti to help that country recover from an earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people.Photo Popular chefs like Mario Batali, Eric Ripert and Guy Fieri and celebrities including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Bourdain began sending money early.Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobss widow, gave $1 million after she visited.Several business provided support, including Goya Foods, whose helicopter ferried supplies to remote areas.Last Saturday, World Central Kitchen signed a $10 million contract with FEMA to produce 120,000 meals a day for two weeks.Other pieces of Mr. Andrss operation will likely feed people through Thanksgiving.And other organizations will continue to distribute millions of shelf-stable meals ready to eat and boxes of canned food, dried meat, beans and rice.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Red Cross said Tuesday that since the storm struck, it had distributed 1.4 million pounds of pantry items and 540,000 meals and snacks to 40 communities.Every day up until Wednesday, it was handing out 400 of Mr. Andrss sandwiches and as much fruit.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Red Cross is working very closely with the entire response community, including government agencies, other nonprofit groups, faith-based organizations, area businesses and others, said Elizabeth Penniman, vice president for communications.We are pleased that Chef Andrs is playing such an important role there as well.FEMA said that at least eight other organizations are providing emergency food aid in Puerto Rico, including World Vision International, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Puerto Rico State Guard and the Church of Scientology.FEMA has told me many times they feel they have this under control, Mr. Andrs said.I am going to help keep them to that promise.We are all here covering each others backs.
Tarot Is Trending, and Dior Predicted This Months Ago:::::Photo Vicki Noble, who with Karen Vogel created the Motherpeace Tarot Deck in the late 1970s, hasnt really kept up with the latest happenings in the community of divinatory playing cards.But when Maria Grazia Chiuri, the artistic director of Christian Dior, called and said she wanted to incorporate the Motherpeace into a fashion line, she and Ms. Vogel agreed.Both felt that it could breathe new life into their 40-year-old deck.Almost six months after Diors fashion show in Santa Monica, Calif., Motherpeace sales have skyrocketed, up 263 percent from last year, according to Stuart Kaplan, the chairman and owner of U.S. Games Systems, a global distributor.Photo I feel like this is a wave, and we should catch it, Ms. Noble said.Tarot-deck sales in general are up 30 percent this year, after rising 30 percent in 2016 the highest in 50 years, according to Lynn Araujo, the editorial and communications director for U.S. Games Systems.The company sells hundreds of thousands of decks a year, including Motherpeace, the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck and 123 other varieties.The tarot boom comes as no surprise to Libby Edelson, a senior editor at HarperCollins.In 2015 an unusual new deck called the Wild Unknown caught her eye.With images of plants and animals instead of people, the deck had attracted a dedicated following and was selling out with each new edition.Ms. Edelson acquired the rights to sell the deck with the accompanying guidebook and watched this package climb best-seller lists.Photo Now theres this whole new wave of tarot, said Kim Krans, the creator of the Wild Unknown Tarot deck.People are saying things like, Im going to quit my job and become a tarot reader.Ms. Krans attributes her success both to Instagram, on which she has posted images of her cards, and tarots incursion, like crystals and yoga mats before it, into modern boutiques rather than dusty occult stores.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There used to be this idea of tarot being connected to that chick in a shop behind a neon sign whos going to take you for a ride and tell your future, said Sasha Graham, a tarot reader and author.Thats different now.Witchcraft and feminist spirituality, especially in our political climate, are having a moment.Tarot is part of that.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.And what could be more of the moment than crowdfunding?Tarot projects have been on the rise for the last five years at least, according to David Gallagher, senior director of communications at Kickstarter.In 2013 there were 37 such projects.In 2017 there have been 88, including decks created with more diverse audiences in mind.
Trump to Open Skies to More Drone Testing:::::Photo WASHINGTON President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet.Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages activities limited by federal restrictions.The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said.For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year.The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming.Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes.Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Many questions remain about the program announced on Wednesday, including how many drones could be part of pilot programs.The Federal Aviation Administration is still deliberating potential rules for commercial drones, which are expected to have far more impact on the industry than Wednesdays executive memorandum.
How Australia’s Technology Stands Out:::::What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?Were still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter Ive always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis.The song was So What, and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.We also went analog with our brainstorming equipment.Instead of white boards, we bought two studio rollers with craft paper.What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.Are Australians excited?Reaction is pretty mixed.Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.I was stunned.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity.Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter.And I love them.I cant believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesnt work well with a bit of wind.I dont know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.And as long as were talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?Gumtree is my favorite.Ive used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things.The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.Its great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.
Gens Y and Z Are Buying Lots of Luxury Stuff After All:::::Key to success with younger consumers have been efforts by brand to develop engaging content for digital platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, so they and their creative directors can connect with fans multiple times a day.Heavy investment also has gone into luxury streetwear, like sneakers, sliders (bedroom slipper-like shoes) and down jackets, with some brands showing double-digit sales growth across those product categories.And pairing with pop stars and social media influencers, rather than just Hollywood glitterati and models, has become an essential part of product marketing for most brands.We were expecting a rebound as the industry shifted its strategy: We just didnt expect there to be such a strong and immediate reaction from shoppers, Ms. DArpizio said.The fact that customers are getting younger and younger is good for the future of the industry.Growth in the personal goods market flatlined in 2016.For 2017, Bain has forecast a 6 percent increase in the sectors revenue, at constant exchange rates, to 262 billion, beating predictions earlier this year for growth of 2 percent to 4 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The positive prospects painted by the report corresponded with the robust earnings reports from some of the luxury industrys power players.Shares in Kering reached record highs on Wednesday after the French luxury group reported revenue of 3.9 billion in the three months to the end of September, up 23 percent, driven by the performance of star brands like Gucci, where revenue soared 42 percent to 1.5 billion in the quarter.Earlier this month, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the worlds largest luxury group by revenue, continued its upward momentum with a 12 percent increase in the first nine months of the year that beat analyst expectations.Of course, the latest change in fortunes is not all down to the selfie generation.Tourism flows have recovered strongly in Europe, buoyed by a weaker pound in Britain and by the economic recovery in China, counterbalancing a slower American market.Chinese buyers now lead the luxury goods market, at 32 percent of all buyers, thanks to increased purchasing abroad and at home.That rise in domestic purchases is a result, at least in part, of a reduction in the price differentials that once existed in geographic markets and had driven buyers to shop outside their home markets.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investment in streamlining sales channels and improving shopping experiences online and off also is paying off, the Bain report indicated.Online luxury sales jumped by 24 percent, with Bain estimating that online sales of personal luxury goods will make up 25 percent of the market by 2025.But not everyone will benefit: While 65 percent of all luxury companies will see sales growth this year, only 35 percent will manage to increase their operating profits, Bain projected.Still, the consensus was that the future for now looks bright.The last few years have been very painful for the luxury industry, Ms. DArpizio said.But we are entering a new normal, where winners and losers are being decided by those who take a smart new approach to their business that factors in the changing macro state of the world.It will be exciting for everyone to see what happens next.
Toyota Demands ‘Clarity’ Over Brexit:::::He also voiced worry that import tariffs or other new costs arising from Brexit would make manufacturing in Britain less attractive, implying that investment in operations in the country might be reduced in future.If we move to something like an import tax, trade tax or any kind of additional penalty, it will create a big negative impact in terms of competitiveness, Mr. Leroy said.His remarks echo the concerns of Japanese and other automakers in Britain, like Germanys BMW, which makes the Mini in the country.They worry that Brexit could add to their costs and complicate the flow of vehicles, components and employees between Britain and the Continent.Indeed, if the British government does not manage to negotiate barrier-free access to the European market after Brexit, vehicles made in the country may face an import tariff of perhaps 10 percent, according to Peter Wells, a professor at the Cardiff Business School.That could hurt the competitiveness of mass-market manufacturers Britain-based operations.Toyota, he said, may be particularly vulnerable because it manufactures both cars and engines in Britain.A high proportion of British content might put the companys vehicles into a foreign-made category elsewhere in Europe.So far, carmakers in Britain have been patient, and moved ahead with investments necessary to keep their plants on track.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Toyota, for instance, said in March that it would invest 240 million pounds, or $315 million, to upgrade its plant in Burnaston, England, with the British government kicking in a further 21 million for items like training and research.Overall investment, though, appears to be sliding downward.According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a trade group, publicly announced investments in the British car industry fell to 1.7 billion last year, from 2.5 billion in 2015.That trend appears to be accelerating, with the figure totaling 647 million in the first half of this year.The trade group attributes the falling numbers to the carmakers holding back from commitments until they see how Brexit is likely to play out.I think the issue is clarity more than anything else, Mr. Wells said.Without knowing what sort of arrangements will emerge from Brexit, he added, the industry would find it difficult to plan ahead and make long-term investment decisions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Car manufacturing in Britain employs about 170,000 people, according to the trade group.Largely because of the stakes involved, the government has provided aid to Toyota and other companies, and is backing research into electric, hydrogen-powered and self-driving vehicles.Still, negotiations between Britain and the European Union have been agonizingly slow so far, with both sides seemingly unable to move into the meat-and-potatoes talks that will address the terms that businesses based in Britain will face after Brexit.Companies like Toyota, however, are quite clear in describing their needs.In an email, Chris OKeefe, a Toyota spokesman, listed trade and barrier-free market access and uncomplicated and predictable customs arrangements as vital for future competitiveness.
David Rubenstein, Private Equity Titan, Passes the Torch:::::The firm is in better financial shape than its ever been, Mr. Rubenstein said in an interview from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he had joined other financiers for a gathering being called Davos in the Desert, a reference to the annual World Economic Forum in Switzerland.This was our initiative.Nobody was pushing us to do it.Carlyle will be led by three familiar faces.Kewsong Lee, who joined Carlyle in 2013, and Glenn A. Youngkin, currently the firms president and chief operating officer, will become co-chief executives.Peter J. Clare was named the firms co-chief investment officer.All three men will join the board and begin their new roles on Jan. 1.Mr. Rubenstein will not be hard to find.An affable White House aide under President Jimmy Carter who became a self-made billionaire, he is a major philanthropist with a passion for American history, and is on the boards of organizations including the Brookings Institution, Lincoln Center, the University of Chicago and the Council on Foreign Relations.Mr. Rubenstein even has his own talk show on Bloomberg Television, where his guests have included Oprah Winfrey and Yo-Yo Ma.The Carlyle Group, which has headquarters in Washington, manages about $170 billion in assets around the world, spread across private equity, real estate and other investment funds.Though it was once best known for deals with defense businesses, it has since become a major investor in a wide range of sectors.Among private equity firms, it was one of the first to go beyond traditional corporate buyouts and develop extensive practices in real estate, infrastructure and credit.Investments include holdings in Getty Images and the health supplements maker Natures Bounty.Mr. Rubenstein, however, said he regretted passing on opportunities to invest in Amazon and Netscape, deals that would have made the firm billions.I always remember the ones that got away, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Privately held until 2012, Carlyle joined other private equity firms in offering shares to the public in the years after the financial crisis.But since the initial public offering, Carlyles stock price has barely budged.On Wednesday, the stock was down 3 percent on news of the succession planning.Publicly traded private equity firms are undervalued by the market, Mr. Rubenstein said.Carlyle may not have been a great investment for public markets investors, but it has been lucrative for the co-founders.Thanks to the traditional private equity business model in which firms charge investors a lucrative management fee, regardless of performance, and also take a large share of profits companies like Carlyle are practically guaranteed to make money.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.And thanks to the so-called carried interest loophole, which Mr. Rubenstein has lobbied to protect, much of those profits are lightly taxed.Mr. Rubenstein, Mr. Conway and Mr. DAniello are each worth $2.8 billion, according to Forbes.Since 2011 alone, the three co-founders have collected compensation worth some $3.2 billion combined, according to Equilar.Mr. Rubenstein said that he was troubled by the widening gap between rich and poor.Theres no doubt that income inequality in all developed markets is increasing, and the U.S. is no exception, Mr. Rubenstein said.Its attributable to many factors; education is probably the most important one.You cant sustain a very good economic system when people arent graduating.But Mr. Rubenstein said there was little he could do about it.I wish I had the power as one person to change that, but I dont, he said.It took us generations to get into the income inequality morass.I dont think anybody has enough money or energy to fix it.But I am certainly sensitive to it.Mr. Rubenstein and Mr. Conway, who serve as co-chief executives, will become co-executive chairmen of the company.Mr. DAniello, Carlyles chairman, will become chairman emeritus.The changes will give Mr. Rubenstein more time to focus on his extracurricular activities, which he says have allowed him to engage in networking that has benefited Carlyle.A fan of American history, he has donated millions of dollars to help restore the Washington Monument and renovate museum galleries around Washington.I have taken on a fair number of high-profile nonprofit positions, he said.I dont think thats hurt the firm; thats helped the firm.David Skorton, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, said that Mr. Rubenstein, who serves on the Smithsonians board of regents, was uncommonly involved in his nonprofit work.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He is really engaged in the work of the organization, Mr. Skorton said.He doesnt just show up to pound a gavel.He wants to understand the what and the why.In 2007, Mr. Rubenstein paid $21.3 million for a copy of Magna Carta, which is on display at the National Archives.More recently, he donated $10 million to the National Museum of African American History & Culture.He actually thinks about the public interest, Mr. Skorton said.Hes a real student of history.Carlyle and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are only the latest private equity firms to undergo a generational transfer of power.At the Blackstone Group, Jonathan D. Gray has long been the heir apparent to take over for Stephen A. Schwarzman.TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus have also either picked their next chiefs, or transitioned to a new set of leaders.Still, Mr. Rubenstein said he and his co-founders would try to stay involved in the firm without micromanaging their successors.We dont want to be helicopter parents, Mr. Rubenstein said.But its not as if were disappearing into the dust.
How Wall Street Won a Fight on Class-Action Suits: DealBook Briefing:::::From Jessica Silver-Greenberg, NYT: In recent months, financial firms and their Republican allies in Congress mobilized to

had been waging an activist campaign against Arconic.Some at the conference were floored that Mr. Kleinfeld had clearly landed on his feet with such large responsibility and oversight.Others dismissed the role as being a sort of exile in the desert.The smart take: During his time at Arconic (and its predecessor, Alcoa), Mr. Kleinfeld had invested a lot of time and his then-employers money in the region to become a trusted adviser to the Saudi royal family.The only other major Western C.E.O.with that kind of clout is Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical.(Bloomberg cheekily wrote that Mr. Kleinfeld,

Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together:::::To me, the only way to stop this is to defeat the budget tomorrow, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said on Wednesday.Once the budget passes, they hold all the cards.Theyre asking us to vote on the budget for a tax bill they havent shown us on a promise that somehow its going to be fair, even though theyre talking about knocking out SALT, Mr. King said.I dont see how anyone from those districts can vote for the budget under that, even if they promise us something.The challenge facing Republicans is trying to mitigate the revenue-losing effects of cutting tax rates, particularly Mr. Trumps push to reduce the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, which the White House says is nonnegotiable.The budget resolution that is supposed to win final approval on Thursday would allow for $1.5 trillion in additional deficits from tax cuts over the next decade, but the proposed tax cuts already revealed would cost well over $2 trillion.Photo Cutting rates unifies Republicans.Finding offsets, either by eliminating tax deductions or employing accounting tricks, divides them.On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged a long list of still-unresolved issues in the Houses draft bill, which is to be released Nov. 1.They included where to place the income limits for various tax brackets, whether to maintain or cut tax rates on top earners, and the fate of several critical components of the revamped corporate code.Two issues in dispute flared up publicly: changes to retirement savings and to individuals ability to deduct their state and local taxes.Mr. Brady seemed to defend a proposal to drastically lower the cap on tax-free retirement account contributions.He indicated that there were better ways to encourage the bulk of workers to save, even after Mr. Trump declared on Monday that there will be NO change to your 401(k).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Right now, we are not a nation of savers, Mr. Brady said at a breakfast convened by The Christian Science Monitor, adding: We think in tax reform we can create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.Privately, though, a member of House leadership assured lobbyists on Wednesday that retirement account limits would not be touched in the draft bill.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.House Republicans have been considering sharply reducing the amount that Americans are allowed to save, before taxes, in 401(k) retirement plans to $2,400 a year, from the current $18,000, or $24,000 for workers who are over 50.Lowering the cap would be unlikely to encourage more savings, research suggests, but it would amount to an accounting maneuver that would help Republicans make up some of the lost revenue from large cuts to business tax rates.Money in such retirement accounts is taxed when it is withdrawn.By taxing most deposits immediately, Republicans would push future tax revenue into the 10-year budget window they are now working in.Mr. Trump was not giving up.He told reporters that he wanted to quickly end speculation because 401(k)s, to me, are very important.Asked whether he might negotiate over the changes, he replied, maybe well use it as negotiating, then added that Mr. Brady knew how critical the retirement accounts were.Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said the issue of tax rules for retirement savings was far more complicated than Mr. Trumps declaration.Photo Were the ones writing the bill, Mr. Schweikert said.At some point, he gets to agree or veto.And ultimately, we have to make the math work.Mr. Brady also said Republican leaders were seeking a deal on the state and local tax deduction, which they had targeted for elimination.Mr. Brady seemed to suggest the deal could focus on maintaining deductions for property taxes, but not for income or sales taxes.That would reduce the savings from eliminating the deduction to about $1.3 trillion over 10 years, from an estimated $1.9 trillion over 10 years for eliminating the deduction entirely, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.But it may be the key to passing the budget resolution, which appears in jeopardy if Republicans from high-tax states are not pacified.A protracted fight over taxes would be particularly rough on a Republican Party already fraying on the edges.Mr. Trump is feuding with two Republican senators who plan to retire, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, as part of a growing rift between old-guard conservatives and Mr. Trumps new-wave populists in Washington.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the face of those divides, Republican leaders aim to deliver a completed tax bill to Mr. Trumps desk by Christmas.The stakes are rising by the day, as Republican donors and voters worry about the party advancing the legislative priorities it has long espoused.A failure on taxes, after the Republicans did not succeed in repealing the Affordable Care Act, could jeopardize its congressional majorities in the 2018 midterms.The Republicans are finally figuring out if they dont pass this, the political consequences are going to be catastrophic, said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who is advising Mr. Trump on tax policy.The attitude of the conservative base is, If they dont do this, theyre worthless.Finding common ground will only get more difficult as the effects of specific tax changes on constituents become clearer.Polling suggests Republican voters subscribe less to the tax cut philosophy than their elected representatives.A report this week from the Pew Research Center, based on polling in August, found that Republicans were not especially unified in support of tax cuts, said Carroll Doherty, the centers director of political research.A September poll from the online survey company SurveyMonkey found that three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of cutting corporate taxes, which is the centerpiece of the tax plan.But that poll, and a related one in October, found a divide: Republican voters who approve of Mr. Trump were far more likely to approve of corporate tax cuts and to say that they believe their individual taxes will fall next year than those who have turned against the president.The divisions in the party do not, at this point, appear to imperil the tax-cutting effort.Mr. Corker, an outspoken deficit hawk, gave his blessing to parliamentary language that would allow the tax bill to add $1.5 trillion to federal deficits, though he made clear he could still vote against the final legislation.And Mr. Flake diatribe on Tuesday aside is still viewed as a likely yes on whatever tax bill makes it to the Senate floor, provided it survives several weeks of political kicking and screaming.

two companies can be understood simply as a matter of timing and control.When he began his second stint as Twitters chief executive in 2015, the company was already struggling and had a series of internal problems that were hard to change, including executive turnover and competing strategic visions.At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.Square wasnt Jacks first rodeo, said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009.It was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.Mr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorseys education from Twitters fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this article.Mr. Dorseys success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the publics eye.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Dorsey trained Squares sights on a mostly invisible business electronic payments that has momentum as more and more commerce moves online.Photo Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020.It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia.At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo.As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Squares app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmos busy blue dashboard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around.That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who dont have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.We are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank, Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.Photo The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Squares bottom line.While Square and PayPal generally dont make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorseys ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that it may be the most important thing Square is working on.During Mr. Raboiss tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright.The companys first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses.The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.During a talk at Silicon Valleys Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didnt need to make a choice between the two.They both have different needs and are in different phases, he said.Focusing on one thing doesnt mean you completely lose sight of something else.
Laura Ingraham Is Ready to Rev Up Fox News:::::Since we are in the south, I can say bless his heart, but its time to melt the snowflake, she said as the room vibrated with boos.A chant of Build that wall!broke out.(On Tuesday, a week after Ms. Ingrahams trip to Arizona, Mr. Flake announced he was out of the race.#MeltSnowFlake accomplished, Ms. Ingraham wrote victoriously on Twitter.)Fox News hosts are not usually allowed to stump for candidates, but Ms. Ingraham was granted an exception because her show had not yet begun.An ardent nationalist, a Trump confidante, and a foe of open borders, Ms. Ingraham said in an interview with The New York Times that she wants to represent the working-class, populist sensibility that is the beating heart of the Republican Party right now.Photo She added, I hope that a lot of the men and women who feel forgotten in this country really see that they have in me a champion.An acolyte of Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork and Pat Buchanan, Ms. Ingraham was among the first commentators to endorse Mr. Trump in the presidential campaign.Many pundits on Fox News took longer to follow her lead, especially as Mr. Trump feuded with the networks star anchor, Megyn Kelly.Before Election Day, Fox News executives were talking up a new focus on straight news coverage.Post-Trump, the channels prime-time lineup has moved to the right, installing the combative Tucker Carlson in the 8 p.m. slot and Sean Hannity at 9.Laura Ingraham is as about as hard-core a Trump defender as they could have put on the air at this point, said Charlie Sykes, the longtime conservative radio host and MSNBC analyst.Right now, thats what the Fox News viewership wants.They want the Trump red meat.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Ingraham is well-suited to deliver it.In Scottsdale, she was greeted as a hero by the Trump-supporting crowd.Everyone at Fox News was afraid to say they wanted Trump, said Mary Waldren, 53, of Ahwatukee, Ariz., one of several hundred attendees who had paid up to $2,700 a ticket to attend the rally for Ms. Ward.Shes going to be good for Fox News.Theyre lucky to have her.When Ms. Ward took the microphone, she held up a copy of Ms. Ingrahams new book, which praises the rise of Mr. Trump and economic nationalism.Steve Bannon tells me this is my campaign plan, Ms. Ward told the crowd, so Im going to read it closely.As an early supporter of Mr. Trump, Ms. Ingraham landed a prime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention.She said she now speaks with the president a few times a month.Sometimes, I call him, and occasionally, Ill get a call, she said nonchalantly.Photo But unlike Mr. Hannity, another confidant of the president, Ms. Ingraham has shown a willingness to publicly bite the hand.In the interview, she criticized the snails pace of staff appointments and knocked the president for stepping on his own message at times.This is about the movement, she said.Trump is invaluable hes the titular head of the movement.But its like with George W. Bush.I campaigned for him in 2004, and by the end of it, I wasnt invited to any of the White House events.Shawna Noyes, who waited in line for a half-hour for Ms. Ingraham to sign a book, said that Mr. Hannity was sometimes too soft on the president.I think shes going to be tough, said Ms. Noyes, who runs a steel company in Phoenix.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The president, an avid Fox viewer, has not been not shy about registering his displeasure with critical coverage.What will he think of Ms. Ingraham?Advertisement Continue reading the main story You know, hell probably, uh, be irked, Ms. Ingraham said, staring straight ahead.We are friends, but friends tell friends when they go off course.And Im sure hell tell me when he thinks Im deviating from whats proper and thoughtful.And Ill do the same with him.Ms. Ingraham lives in Virginia with her three adopted children.She grew up in Glastonbury, Conn., the daughter of a waitress and the owner of a carwash.Media criticism began at home: She wrote in her book that she could remember her father deriding the anchor Walter Cronkite and his famed signoff, Thats the way it is.No, Walt, thats the way you say it is!her father would reply.Ms. Ingraham honed her craft in college at The Dartmouth Review, the undergraduate right-wing journal that earned national recognition (and some revulsion) for stunts that, in hindsight, presaged the antics of Breitbart reporters.All the way back to Dartmouth, I was part of the insurgency, she said.In an era before mainstream acceptance of homosexuality, Ms. Ingraham assigned a reporter to attend a meeting of the campus gay students alliance and published a transcript of the proceedings, naming names.Years later, she apologized, citing in part the experience of her gay brother and his partner, who had AIDS.In law school at the University of Virginia, she drove a Honda hatchback with the license plate FARRGHT.In Washington, as a young conservative on the rise, Ms. Ingraham worked in the Reagan White House, clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, and founded a right-wing retreat cheekily dubbed The Dark Ages.(Arianna Huffington was on the steering committee.)A New York Times Magazine article described her joy-riding in Washington in her green Land Rover, blasting zydeco music at midnight.Photo She was among the first crop of commentators at the dawn of the cable-news era, hosting a show on MSNBC and, along with Kellyanne Conway and Ann Coulter, earning the nickname the pundettes.By the early 2000s, her radio talk show was carried by more than 200 stations and her books The Hillary Trap, Of Thee I Zing, Power to the People sold by the millions.Some of her remarks brought outrage.No one wants to see fat people on the cover of magazines in swimsuits, she said during a television appearance.She has also been the recipient of name-calling: Ed Schultz, the former MSNBC host, was suspended for calling her a right-wing slut.Still, her move into Mr. Bannons Breitbart circle considered a fringe of the right-wing until Mr. Trumps victory was not inevitable.Her embrace of Mr. Trump strained her relationship with some of her fellow conservatives.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Laura represents her own unique brand, said Christopher Ruddy, who runs Newsmax, a Fox News competitor.She comes out of the milieu of talk radio, where the economics of that business have driven a lot of hosts who were moderately conservative to be a little edgier.Ms. Ingraham joined Mr. Bannon in 2014 to endorse David Brat, an outsider Republican who would go on to win a surprise victory over Eric Cantor, then the Republican majority leader in the House.She had been encouraged to back Mr. Brat by a producer, Julia Hahn, who went on to write for Breitbart and now works in the White House.Asked if she is bringing a Breitbart viewership to Fox News, Ms. Ingraham responded: I wouldnt call it a Breitbart audience.I would call it America.I like Tom Wolfes description of the country, she continued.Theres America.The coasts are like the parentheses.In between is the country.Her show, she said, would go beyond politics: Parenting, how technology is changing our lives, the pornified culture that our children are marinating in.So is a makeover la Ms. Kelly who has softened her on-air persona for her new morning show on NBC in the cards?What do you think?Ms. Ingraham said, sarcastically.Were going to have a stove in the back, and were going to have popovers.She laughed.No.I wont be doing that.
Consumer Bureau Loses Fight to Allow More Class-Action Suits:::::The arbitration rule has sparked a political battle that has taken on broader significance in the new administration.Republicans latched on to the rule as a way to cast the agency as a player in the regulatory regime that was impeding business and the economy.Shortly after the rule was adopted in July, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce pointed to it as a prime example of an agency gone rogue.In recent months, financial firms and their Republican allies in Congress mobilized to defeat the rule.Some credit unions and community banks also weighed in, lodging calls to lawmakers in their home states.Under the Congressional Review Act, Republicans had roughly 60 legislative days to overturn the rule.The House passed its own resolution in July.Wrangling the votes in the Senate was trickier.In the weeks leading up to the vote, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who sponsored legislation to protect military members from being forced into arbitration, said he would not support a repeal of the rule.Looking to head off a repeal, Democrats and consumer advocates branded the effort as a gift to financial institutions like Wells Fargo and Equifax.Both companies, in the face of corporate scandals, used arbitration clauses to try to quash legal challenges from customers.The rule, Democrats argued, was precisely what was needed to protect the rights of vulnerable borrowers.Regulators and judges, including some appointed by Republican presidents, have also backed the position.Class actions, they argue, are not just about the size of the payouts, which are typically spread out among a large group of people.They are also about pushing companies to change their practices.Large banks, for example, had to pay more than $1 billion to settle class actions beginning in 2009 that accused them of tweaking checking account policies to increase the amount of overdraft fees that they could charge customers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tonights vote is a giant setback for every consumer in this country, Richard Cordray, the director of the consumer bureau, said in a statement.As a result, companies like Wells Fargo and Equifax remain free to break the law without fear of legal blowback from their customers.Photo The vote was a win for a party that has struggled to deliver on its legislative priorities.Last month, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, failed to drum up the support needed to overturn President Barack Obamas signature health care law.Mr. Graham and Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana broke with the Republicans to vote against the measure.But Senator John McCain of Arizona, whom some Democrats had hoped to sway, voted to overturn the rule.The measure now heads to President Trump, who is expected to sign it.The consumer bureau has unusually broad authority and autonomy from both the White House and Congress to enforce existing federal laws and write new regulations, like the arbitration rule.That independence has rankled Republicans and other federal agencies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In June, the Treasury Department issued a report accusing the agency of regulatory overreach and calling for Mr. Trump to have the right to remove its director.This week, the department weighed in directly on the arbitration rule, warning that the regulation could unleash frivolous lawsuits, costing financial firms an estimated $500 million in legal fees alone.Republicans echoed those arguments on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, rallied his peers, calling it harmful regulation that imposes obvious costs and offers invisible benefits.Like the Treasury report, he argued that class actions enrich lawyers at the expense of consumers.The debate over the arbitration rule put Mr. Cordray, into an odd position of publicly bickering with other federal agencies.After the Treasury report, Mr. Cordray sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin faulting the department for misrepresenting the bureaus work.He also expressed surprise at the report, noting that during his agencys work on arbitration, the Treasury raised no issues or concerns with the bureau.The friction is intensifying as Mr. Cordrays tenure at the bureau is ending.Appointed by Mr. Obama in 2012 to a five-year term, Mr. Cordray is widely expected to step down sooner to run for governor in Ohio.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump will then be free to install his own appointee, a move that is expected to defang what has been one of the financial industrys most aggressive regulators.The arbitration rule, in many ways, encapsulated the bureaus work: It was independent and designed to fill a regulatory gap.The rule was the first major check on arbitration since a pair of Supreme Court decisions, in 2011 and 2013, enshrined its widespread use.Emboldened by those decisions, more and more companies adopted the clauses.Today, it is hard to open up a checking account, rent a car, get cable service or check a loved one into a nursing home without agreeing to mandatory arbitration.As arbitration clauses appeared in tens of millions of contracts, the consumer agency was specifically mandated to study arbitration under the Dodd-Frank financial law in 2010.That effort culminated in a 728-page report, released in March 2015, that challenged longstanding assumptions about arbitration.The agency found that once blocked from suing, few people went to arbitration at all.And the results for those who did were dismal.During the two-year period studied, only 78 arbitration claims resulted in judgments in favor of consumers, who got $400,000 in total relief.The vote late Tuesday left many Democrats dismayed.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said the Republicans had betrayed ordinary Americans.By voting to take rights away from customers, he said, the Senate voted tonight to side with Wells Fargo lobbyists over the people we serve.
U.S. soldiers ambushed in Niger were chasing a target, officials say:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The attack in Niger on U.S. and Nigerien troops at the beginning of the month followed an aborted effort to track a target, according to U.S. intelligence officials.Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. told reporters at a press briefing Thursday that the attacked 12-man Special Forces team was not the only one on the ground in Niger during the October 4 attack.U.S. intelligence officials told UPI a special mission unit was preparing to go after a high-value target in Niger, but the mission was canceled after the target crossed the border into Mali.McKenzie told reporters that contact with the enemy was unlikely before the attack, and that it is unknown if that assessment changed at some point during the operation.Before the attack, 26 previous operations had been completed during the previous six to seven months, he said.McKenzie confirmed that there were other American teams operating in the area, but gave no details as to their activities because of their possible connection to the Oct. 4 attack.U.S. intelligence officials told UPI they believe that Abu Walid al Sahrawi, also known as Adnan al-Sahrawi, was behind the Oct. 4 attack near the village of Tongo Tongo in the southwestern region of Niger near the Mali border.Sahrawi, a pseudonym that means, "Adnan of the Desert," is a jihadist and a former senior spokesman and self-proclaimed emir for al-Mourabitoun, an al-Qaeda linked terrorist organization that operates out of West Africa.Sahrawi took an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State in May 2015, according to the Counter Extremism Project, a not-for-profit, non-partisan, international policy organization that combats the growing threat from extremist ideologies.The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, or ISIS-GS, would form after Sahrawi split from al-Mourabitoun.The group is believed to operate near Mali, according to a October 2016 post in Arabic on the encrypted app service, Telegram.The post was distributed by ISIS's Amaq news agency."ISIS-GS is a small offshoot," Malcolm Nance, a retired Navy senior chief petty officer and career counterterrorism specialist in the U.S. intelligence community, told UPI."That was an ISIS-style ambush, but they have a lot more than 45-50 fighters.I suspect they are peeling off AQIM [al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb] branches and rolling them into ISIS-GS."The Special Forces team from 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group were attacked in Niger, while returning to their forward operating base, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford told reporters on Monday.The complex attack involved an array of small arms weapons and rocket-propelled grenades and a force of about 50 militants.The Green Berets ambushed in Niger were delayed as they left a meeting with local leaders -- which may have been part of the plan to attack them, Army officials previously told UPI.Officials suspect that some people in the Oct. 4 Tongo Tongo meeting may have been working with the Islamic State, and some residents from the town have already been arrested.Once the firefight started, an unmanned aerial vehicle overhead provided real-time full motion video images of the attack, Dunford said.Staff Sgts.Dustin M. Wright and Bryan C. Black were killed in the ambush, along with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist Staff Sgt.Jeremiah W. Johnson.Sgt.La David Johnson's body was recovered 48 hours later by Nigerien forces in a remote, northwestern region of Niger.Two other soldiers were also wounded.French Mirage jets arrived on the scene approximately one hour later in a "show of force" in an attempt to drive out the militants.By the time, French air support arrived, troops had been in contact with enemy forces for two hours."It's important to note when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support," Dunford said."We'll find out in the investigation exactly why it took an hour for them to call."Pentagon chief spokeswoman Dana White told reporters Thursday that the media is wrong regarding the notion that Army Sgt.LaDavid Johnson was abandoned, echoing a statement last week by Defense Secretary James Mattis that the "U.S. military doesn't not leave troops behind."It remains unclear when Johnson was separated from the other members of his unit, but a search was mounted after a DUSTWUN was declared, a military abbreviation for duty status, whereabouts unknown -- meaning, a service member cannot be located, but they have not been confirmed dead or captured by enemy forces.McKenzie told reporters that a joint effort made up of U.S., French and Nigerien forces were involved in what's called a tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel mission and the joint task force did not leave the area until Johnson was located.A team of investigators led by a one-star general has been sent to West Africa on a fact-finding mission, with Congressional committees launching their own inquiries into the circumstances of the attack in the last week as well.
C-5 Galaxy component ordered from Triumph Group:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The Triumph Group is to produce aftermarket spare rotary actuators for the main landing gear on U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy aircraft.The actuators were ordered in a two-year $22.9 million contract issued by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, located in Robins Air Force Base in Georgia."We are honored to be selected as a sole source supplier for these operation-critical parts on the C-5 Galaxy aircraft, the U.S. Air Force's largest and only strategic airlifter, and to support the service men and women who depend on the aircraft to transport them anywhere in the world on short notice," Tom Holzthum, executive vice president for Triumph Integrated Systems, said in a press release.The spare actuators -- the number ordered was not disclosed -- will be manufactured at Triumph Group's facility in Park City, Utah.
Despite strong Q3 earnings, Boeing hit with $349M loss over Pegasus:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Despite Boeing publishing strong third quarter earnings on Wednesday, the defense contractor will take a loss of $349 million due to cost overruns on the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus program as a result of its fixed-price contract with the U.S. Air Force.The KC-46 Pegasus is a wide-bodied aerial refueling tanker jet being developed for the U.S. Air Force.It is capable of refueling all U.S. and allied military aircraft capable of mid-air refueling.The aircraft has met performance and cost requirements since work on the KC-46 program first began in 2011, and more recent problems with development and the necessary fixes have led to delays in the KC-46's delivery to the Air Force.Under the terms of the deal between Boeing and the Air Force, the risk of cost overruns during production falls on Boeing.Historically, the burden of the fixed-price contract weighs heavy, especially for innovative projects involving military transports that are untested or have undeveloped technologies.The $329 million of overrun costs are split between Boeing's defense business unit and its commercial sector, the company said in its third quarter earnings report.The business unit will pay out $73 million, with commercial taking on the remainder.To date, Boeing has had to pay out roughly $2.9 billion in pre-tax fees, equating to about $1.9 billion after taxes.Wednesday's cost overrun disclosure is attributed to "incorporating changes into initial production aircraft as we progress through late-stage testing and the certification process," the company said in its third quarter 2017 conference call with reporters.While Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg gave little insight during a conference call into the cost overruns and penalties acquired by the company, he remained optimistic about Boeing's approach to developing the KC-46 and the company's ability to meet its delivery deadline."We remain very confident," Muilenburg said."The opportunity is measured in hundreds of aircraft.We expect this to be a long-term production and support franchise, one that will add tremendous value for our customers, and the need for the new tankers is very clear.So the fundamentals for the program are strong, the long-term value proposition is very strong."Boeing said that they have completed more than 2,000 hours of flight testing with six tankers, and about 80 percent of flight test requirements have been completed."While we've had some issues that have occurred during flight tests that are normal to tanker testing," he said."I can tell you the feedback we've heard from the customers flying the airplanes is that the airplanes are flying well and the controllability of the boom is excellent.""The challenges we're having right now are related to just implementing just final detailed changes on the aircraft to get them to a final certification standard."The first 18 planes are expected to be delivered by next February and their wingtip aerial refueling pods by October 2018, 14 months later than originally planned.
Lockheed, Navantia renew collaborative agreement:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin and Spanish shipbuilder Navantia on Thursday renewed their 20-year agreement on surface ships and naval combat systems.The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding to recognize their history working alongside each other and to seal the renewed agreement, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin announced in a company news release."The fundamental openness, trust, and transparency between Lockheed Martin and Navantia laid a tremendous foundation 20 years ago to build a world-class capability for the Spanish Navy, the Royal Norwegian Navy, and the Royal Australian Navy," said Michele Evans, Lockheed Martin Vice President, Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors."Today, the future remains bright as we look across the world and continue to expand Aegis alongside the tremendous shipbuilding capability that Navantia brings."Lockheed Martin and Navantia equipped Lockheed's Aegis Combat System for the Spanish Navy's F-100 frigates, the first ship weighing less than 9,000 tons to use the equipment.The Spanish Navy now operates state-of-the-art naval escorts that can provide full air defense coverage to expeditionary forces.Between 2000 and 2010, Lockheed Martin and Navantia delivered four F-100 frigates to the Spanish Navy and sent a fifth in 2015.The two companies are now developing the Spanish Navy's F-110 frigate and said they are collaborating with other countries."With the success of the F-100, Fridtjof Nansen, and Hobart programs in our sails and F-110 just in front of us, we are excited to see what the next 20 years of this great partnership between two world-class companies can offer," Navantia Vice President Sofia Honrubia said.
Lithuania buying air defense system, equipment from Kongsberg:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Lithuania's Ministry of National Defense has contracted Norway-based Kongsberg to produce and provide a medium-to-long-range air defense system to the country.The contract from Lithuania is worth about $128.4 million, Kongsberg said in a release.Lithuania announced last October that it had signed an agreement with the Norwegian Ministry of Defense to purchase components for the defense system, also known as NASAMS.The contract announced Thursday includes additional equipment, a training and integrated logistics support package and assured refurbishment and integration of government-supplied parts."We are pleased that the Lithuanian Armed Forces has chosen NASAMS," Eirik Lie, president of Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace AS, said in a statement."NASAMS, produced by Kongsberg and Raytheon, is the most sold air defense system in NATO in recent years, and will be the backbone air defense system for many nations in decades to come."The release did not disclose additional contract details.
Embraer, Sierra Nevada supplying more A-29 aircraft for Afghan air force:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The U.S. Air Force's Afghanistan program has tapped Sierra Nevada Corporation and partner Embraer Defense & Security to supply six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft to Afghanistan.The Afghan air force uses the A-29 trainer and light attack aircraft for flight training, aerial reconnaissance and other missions, Embraer said in a company news release Wednesday.Afghanistan will have 26 A-29s after the delivery of the new planes through the U.S. Air Force program "We believe this decision demonstrates that the A-29 Super Tucano is the best aircraft for close air support operations, as well as the most proven, reliable and cost-effective solution for counterinsurgency and irregular warfare scenarios," Jackson Schneider, president and CEO of Embraer Defense & Security, said in a statement."We are honored to continue to support the U.S. Government in this critical mission."Sierra Nevada and Embraer will start manufacturing the six aircraft in Jacksonville, Fla. "We are proud to continue our support of the Air Force's A-29 Afghanistan Program as it is not only a testament to the capability of the A-29 aircraft, but also to its ease of operation and cost effectiveness," Taco Gilbert, senior vice president for SNC's ISR business area, said in a statement."There is no other aircraft like the A-29 in its ability to provide flight training, light attack, and combat pilot seasoning"
Oil prices stand still in market push-pull:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Mixed support from supply and demand metrics left crude oil prices in relatively static territory in the early rounds of Thursday trading.Preliminary data and early reads on supply and demand indicated a slight drain in U.S. crude oil inventories.The U.S. Energy Information Administration, however, posted a surprise 856,000 build, snapping a four-week streak of declines.Traders are watching supply and demand metrics closely in anticipation of a balancing market.Supply-side strains last year pushed the price of oil below $30 per barrel and movement above $50 per barrel this year is supported by an effort by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain the five-year surplus on global crude oil inventories with managed production declines.EIA reported U.S. crude oil production at 9.5 million barrels per day last week, 1.1 million barrels per day more than the previous week.Early October production levels were impacted by Gulf of Mexico operations shut down ahead of Hurricane Nate.U.S. oil exports, according to an emailed market report from S&P Global Platts, have "exploded" since late September and put more oil on the global market, offsetting some of the inventory build.Crude oil prices were stable to mixed early Thursday.The price for Brent crude oil was down 0.26 percent to trade at $58.29 per barrel at 9:15 a.m. EDT.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was more or less unchanged at $52.21 per barrel.The spread, or difference, between Brent and WTI means U.S. oil is more competitive against other benchmarks in some markets.A forecast from the EIA, meanwhile, said expectations for WTI are what drive its forecast for crude oil production.Echoing sentiments about a so-called Goldilocks number, Tamas Varga with London oil broker PVM said in an emailed market report that U.S. crude oil production numbers may be the governor on market direction."If one accepts that U.S. shale oil production is primarily the function of the price of WTI then it is unreasonable to expect a prolonged price fall," the report read."Using the same logic, the upside is limited, too as strong-ish U.S. domestic crude oil price will serve as an incentive to ramp up production."
Insitu awarded $9.2M for parts, sustainment of RQ-21A:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The Pentagon announced Insitu Inc., a subsidiary of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, has been awarded a new $9.2 million firm-fixed price contract for spare and sustainment parts for the RQ-21A Blackjack.The RQ-21 Blackjack is a small tactical unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platform used by the Department of the Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps.The RQ-21A is used to supplement another unmanned aerial vehicle, the Boeing Scan Eagle, and can use the same launcher and recovery system as the Scan Eagle.The contract, announced Wednesday by the Department of Defense, calls for the procurement of spare and sustainment parts for the RQ-21A in support of U.S. Marine Corps operations.Work on the project will be performed in Bingen, Wash., where Insitu is headquartered, and is expected to be completed in April 2018.Navy officials said procurement funds will be allocated from the Marine Corps fiscal 2017 budget in the amount of $9,200,000.To date, Insitu, Inc., has worked on three hundred and sixty-five contracts worth $2.12 billion in obligations from the federal government since fiscal year 2007, according to InsideGov, a government visualization database.In addition to supplying the Defense Department, Insitu, Inc., also fulfills contracts for the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Department.In fiscal year 2016, the company received a total of $483 million in obligations from the U.S. government.
Iran says it's signed its first agreement tied to LNG:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- An Iranian energy company said it signed its first-ever deal for the sale of gas slated for foreign delivery as super-cooled liquefied natural gas.SHANA, the Iranian oil ministry's news website, said the National Iranian Oil Co. and a consortium controlled by Iranian and Norwegian companies signed the agreement for LNG."The gas will be delivered by the floating liquefaction unit Caribbean FLNG, owned by Belgium's Exmar, with 500,000 tons of LNG production capacity annually," the report read.LNG has more options for delivery than conventional natural gas, which is bound by transnational pipelines that are sometimes exposed to geopolitical risk.The announcement comes one week after Pars Oil and Gas Co., the National Iranian South Oil Co., and a handful of others said they signed a memorandum of understanding with Italian power company Ansaldo Energia to collect flared gas from Phase 12 of the operations at the South Pars gas field.The Iranian oil company said the LNG deal lasts for 20 years and kicks in within the next three months.The floating LNG will dock daily at a Pars gas refinery, SHANA's report read.The Pars Oil and Gas Co., which helps drive operations at Iran's offshore South Pars natural gas field, was one of a handful of Iranian companies with a pavilion set up at the annual Offshore Energy Exhibition & Conference in Amsterdam this month.Speaking to the Financial Times, Amir Hossein Zamaninia, the deputy oil minister for international affairs, said the country is in talks with everyone "except the Americans."By his estimate, there are talks under way for more than two dozen agreements with foreign companies, which could lead to more than $20 billion in contracts over the next year.President Hassan Rouhani set a goal of signing 10 new development deals by the end of the Iranian calendar year, March 20.
Hearings canceled over Minnesota oil pipeline:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- More than $20 million in state property taxes are on the line amid shows of civil disobedience over an Enbridge oil pipeline, a Minnesota trade group said.Public hearings of plans by Enbridge Energy to overhaul its Line 3 pipeline through Minnesota were canceled by authorities in St.Cloud because of "logistical and safety issues" at a convention center.The Minnesota Petroleum Council said it was unfortunate that those working to "actively obstruct civil discourse, stifle free speech, and disrespect those in attendance" were interfering with public vetting."It's estimated that the Line 3 replacement project would support thousands of Minnesota jobs and generate an estimated $20 million per year in state property taxes," Executive Director Erin Roth said in a statement."We hope that this cancellation is an isolated incident and look forward to our continued participation in these hearings throughout Minnesota."Enbridge said replacements and upgrades to the 50-year-old system are the most efficient way to ensure the infrastructure is reliable.In testimony submitted to the state Public Utilities Commission, the company stressed that operating a 50-year-old pipeline that has a regular maintenance program carries more potential risk of a release than a "newly constructed, modern pipeline."The proposal for Line 3 includes a $4.2 billion Canadian component and a $2.9 billion U.S. component.Enbridge said replacements and upgrades to the system are the most efficient way to ensure the infrastructure is reliable.The State Department last week said Enbridge could build a three-mile section of its Alberta Clipper oil pipeline across the national border.The company three years ago connected Alberta Clipper to its existing Line 3 pipeline through Minnesota while it waited for approval for the new cross-border section.The PUC said it was reviewing a time to reschedule the canceled hearings.Pipeline opponents said the cancellation was "a blatant sign of racism" because many of those protesting were from the indigenous community.The PUC is expected to make a decision on the project by early 2018
Energy-rich Norway leaves policy rate unchanged:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The general outlook for the oil- and gas-rich economy of Norway hasn't changed so lending rates will stay the same, the head of the central bank said.Norge Bank, the country's central bank, said Thursday the economy was struggling to pick up the pace, with inflation expected to stay below 2.5 percent over the next few years.Though the labor market is gaining strength, the value of the currency, the krone, is weaker than expected and the bank said it was keeping its key policy rate at 0.5 percent."The outlook and the balance of risks for the Norwegian economy do not appear to have changed substantially since the September report," Governor ystein Olsen said in a statement."The executive board therefore decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged at this meeting."Olsen early this year said oil and gas production for Norway peaked more than a decade ago, though he added that the sector as a whole may have been underestimated.Nevertheless, he said Norway's economy should start adding in more non-oil capacity because it needs "more legs to stand on."Statistics Norway, the government's record-keeping agency, reported taxes on the extraction of petroleum for September were down 7.1 percent from last year.Christopher O. Hansen, a staff member at the agency, told UPI that the trend lower was a reflection of market conditions.Oil and gas prices were high, relatively speaking, through a three-year period ending in 2014, but then dropped considerably.Conditions have improved since early last year, though the market is still more or less suppressed.Norwegian energy company Statoil, which is partially owned by the government, reported adjusted earnings after tax for the third quarter at $2.3 billion, more than double the amount from the same period last year.President and CEO Eldar Stre said that, even as the price of oil during the quarter stayed near $50 per barrel, his company was still generating positive cash flow."This has further strengthened our financial position," he said in a statement.The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate reported lower sales and lower production, based on preliminary data for September.Preliminary data show oil production was 1.44 million barrels of oil per day, which was about 11 percent lower than expected.
French contractor TechnipFMC bruised, but confident:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The energy market is set up for oilfield service contracts to outperform levels from the depths of the downturn, French company TechnipFMC said.French energy services company TechnipFMC reported third quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a metric that serves as a measure of profitability, of $536.2 million, down 23.3 percent from last year.In December, the collective shareholders approved a merger between FMC, which specialized in subsea oil and gas operations, and Technip, a leader in submarine pipeline installation and broad-based oil and gas infrastructure development The company in July said an error in calculations meant it overstated its first quarter figures by $209.5 million.TechnipFMC reported an initial first quarter net income attributable to the company was $190.8 million.In a milestone for the first quarter, the company secured a contract from a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil working offshore Guyana awarded for the engineering, manufacturing and delivery of equipment slated for the Liza project in deep waters, one of the more promising prospects in the world.In September, the company said it would help Norwegian energy company Statoil with new pipeline and production infrastructure at the Peregrino project in the oil-rich Campos Basin off the coast of Brazil, where production passed 100 million barrels in 2015.CEO Doug Pferdehirt said the rest of 2017 and into 2018 shows potential for additional contracts across the sector."We believe that most major subsea projects can move forward at today's oil prices, with delays in project sanctioning more a function of near-term price uncertainty than project returns," he said in a statement.Historic lows for crude oil prices last year forced most major companies to tighten the purse string for exploration and production spending.The price for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, is up about 6 percent since the start of the year to trade near $58 per barrel, but coming off lows in the mid-$40 range.The head of oilfield services company Schlumberger, Paal Kibsgaard, said last week that trends to the third quarter were pointing to market recovery."We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals," TechnipFMC's chief executive said.
New York sets high bar for wind energy:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The state of New York aims to become a new hub for the wind energy industry with its unique geographical position and ambitions goals, a state leader said.New York ranks 11th in the nation in terms of installed wind energy capacity and is the 15th windiest.As of 2014, the state had 20 wind energy projects in service, with a total capacity of 1.8 gigawatts of capacity.The state set of goal of 2.4 GW by 2030."New York intends to be the preeminent global hub for the next generation of the wind industry," Lt. Gov.Kathy Hochul said during the opening remarks of a wind energy conference."We're making unprecedented investments in infrastructure and laying the groundwork for the offshore wind industry, which is primed to benefit from New York's talented, ambitious workforce."A clean energy mandate in New York states that renewable energy should account for half of the installed capacity on the state grid by 2030.This week, managers at Norwegian energy company Statoil named their early-development project off the Long Island coast Empire Wind.Statoil secured the 79,000 acre plot during a federal auction in December and said the facility has a design capacity of 1 GW of offshore wind.The Board of Trustees of the Long Island Power Authority voted in favor of the 90-megawatt South Fork Wind Farm in January.Gov.Andrew Cuomo's broader state energy vision calls for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and includes a $5 billion investment in clean-energy technology.There are more than a dozen offshore wind energy projects in various stages of development in the United States, representing more than 9.1 GW of installed capacity.One GW is enough to power 100 million LED light bulbs."Unlocking America's vast offshore wind potential will reliably deliver large amounts of clean power, grow jobs, and cement American energy dominance," Tom Kiernan, the CEO of the American Wind Energy Association, said.The AWEA hosted the New York wind energy conference.
Oil-rich Alberta adding more solar components:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Canada's oil-rich province of Alberta took further steps toward a balanced economy through small-scale solar installations, provincial and local leaders said.More than a dozen public buildings in central and northern Alberta have installed solar photovoltaic systems since last year, removing more than 13,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.More than 100 residents, businesses and non-profit organizations have been approved for more installations under a provincial rebate plan.Volunteer community leagues in the provincial capital, Edmonton, have now added enough solar polar to their facilities to save the emissions equivalent of pulling 300 cars off the road each year."Edmonton's community leagues are proud to join a growing movement towards sustainability, thanks in part to the provincial government," Debra Jakubec, the executive director of the Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues, said in a statement.Up to $7,500 in rebates for homeowners and up to $375,000 for businesses and non-profit organizations were made available in June to help cover some of the costs tied to solar panel installation.Without the program, the government estimated solar uptake would grow from 2 megawatts to 30 MW by 2022.That quadruples with the program in place, with solar uptake reaching a potential 140 MW during the next five years.Along with much of the Canadian economy, Alberta is adding layers of diversity with low-carbon ambitions.Solar power in the province doubled in 2015 thanks in part to municipal and farm-area incentive programs.Alberta's economy was hammered last year by the dual strains from lower crude oil prices and wildfires that swept through the heart of the provincial oil sector.The provincial government forecast growth in terms of gross domestic product for 2017 at 3.1 percent, up from the budget forecast of 2.65 percent.
Airbus expected to lead light military helicopter market, report says:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- More than 1,600 light military helicopters will be built over the next 15-years by manufacturers worldwide for a value of about $22.2 billion, according to a market report.Market intelligence and analysis firm Forecast International said Tuesday it came to the conclusion using data from its Platinum Forecast System 3.1.Production of light military rotorcraft -- those weighing less than 15,000 pounds -- has been on the upswing since 2014, rising from the 160 units produced that year to 208 in 2016, the firm said.The upswing has continued in 2017, with 217 such aircraft expected to be built.A decline in annual build rates is expected to set in soon, and will last until 2023, when production of 73 rotorcraft is forecast, the company said.But some minor growth and longer-term stability is expected, with production rising to 87 units in 2024.Production rates will then remain at between 75 and 87 units per year through at least 2030.Forecast International senior aerospace analyst Raymond Jaworowski expects near-term defense spending in the United States "will go mainly to readiness and RDT&E accounts, rather than to procurement.""The effects of increased defense spending on rotorcraft acquisition will be more apparent outside the U.S., where some countries could accelerate certain fleet modernization plans," Jaworowski said."While North America and Europe are currently the two largest regional markets for light military rotorcraft, Asia will grow in importance as a regional market over the next 15 years.Manufacturers will also be able to find sales opportunities in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East."Airbus Helicopters is projected in the report to lead the light military rotorcraft market in unit production, producing 420 units for a 26.1 percent market share from 2017-2031.China's Avicopter is expected to take the second place with production of 301 units for an 18.7 percent share.Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd of India will produce 257 units, a 16 percent share, while Bell Helicopter is projected to be fourth, with production of 225 units for a 14 percent share.
Britain extends helicopter pilot training contract:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Britain's Ministry of Defense is investing in its helicopter simulation training center for military helicopter pilots at a Royal Air Force base in the country.The purpose-built center, at RAF Benson, trains future pilots of Chinook, Puma and Merlin aircraft.The contract for the center amends a current CAE training award, adding eight more years of service to it.The ministry said the new contract for the center represents an investment of more than $118.5 million.CAE simulators at the RAF base in South Oxfordshire, together with four computer-based classrooms and a tactical control room, provide operational mission training to the pilots and crew of the aircraft."The importance of effective synthetic training cannot be underestimated and continues to play an increasingly important role in our overall training curriculum," Adrian Baguley, director for Air Support at the MoD's Defence Equipment and Support organization, said in a press release."The Medium Support Helicopter Aircrew Training Facility has consistently delivered a high standard of quality training to the operators of our front line helicopter capabilities."This agreement continues to maintain the world-leading ground school and simulator training facility for our helicopter aircrews."The simulators put pilots through their paces in replicated real-life scenarios, including flying in blizzards, while under enemy fire, dealing with power failures and electronic warfare.
Leonardo to deliver two AW139 rescue helicopters to Australia:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- The defense contracting company Leonardo announced today that the government of Queensland in Australia placed an order for two Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters.The rotorcraft are expected to aid in the country's ability to respond with additional medical services and to conduct search and rescue missions on land or sea.The AW139 is a 15-seat medium-sized twin engine helicopter that cost approximately $12 million each.The AW139s will replace two older helicopter models as part of Queensland's fleet modernization program, which aims to reduce maintenance costs, Leonardo said in a press release.The two AW139s are expected to be delivered by December 2018, bringing Queensland's total AW139 fleet up to five.
Orbital ATK marks milestone for Hellfire missile motors ahead of upgrades:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Orbital ATK has celebrated the delivery of the 100,000th tactical motor for the Hellfire missile to military customers.The Hellfire is in service with 18 nations and carried by a variety of platforms -- from helicopters to fixed-wing aircraft to armored land vehicles."This is a great program that has continued to deliver a quality tool, at the quantity we need, to do our job and keep American soldiers safe," U.S. Army Col. David Warnick, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, Joint Attack Munitions Systems, said at a company ceremony earlier this month."The Hellfire is going straight from the factory to the front lines where they are being utilized by our soldiers."The minimum-smoke Hellfire missile rocket motor is produced at the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory in Rocket Center, West Virginia, which makes the motors for all missile variants.Orbital ATK said it is is upgrading the current version of the rocket motor to include insensitive munitions.The company has incorporated into the new version reduced sensitivity propellants, low-cost bonded end-closure composite cases, and passive thermal mitigation systems.The motor meets propulsion interface requirements for the existing Hellfire and provides enhanced safety for soldiers, the company said.The company is building a new manufacturing facility for tactical motors in Rocket Center, West Virginia, that will produce only IM-compliant motors.
Lockheed gets Air Force production order for Paveway II kits:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Follow-on production of Paveway II plus Laser-Guided Bomb Kits is to be conducted by Lockheed Martin under a $131 million Air Force contact.The award is the ninth consecutive year the company has been chosen for most of the kits for the service and U.S. allies."The U.S. Air Force and its foreign military sales partners realize significant savings in their defense budgets with our affordable and combat-proven LGBs," Joe Serra, Precision Guided Systems director at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, said in a press release."This innovative and cost-effective guidance package supports greater precision for warfighters."Paveway II Plus includes an enhanced guidance package turns free-fall, or dumb bombs, into laser guided weapons through the addition of a nose-mounted laser seeker and fins for guidance.Paveway II Plus also includes an enhanced guidance package.Lockheed Martin said new production of the kits and air foil groups for GBU-10 2,000-pound bomb and GBU-12 500-pound bombs will begin in first quarter of 2018 at a company plant in Pennsylvania.
Oil price rally tested by shale expectations:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- After strong gains in previous sessions, crude oil prices retreated Wednesday on analyst expectations they had brushed up against a market ceiling."Synchronized global growth, robust demand for oil, high compliance [with an OPEC deal] and geopolitical risks provide support [for crude oil prices]," Ole Hanson, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in an emailed market report."Capping the upside for now are... concerns that current prices could accelerate non-OPEC production further."Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has continued to roll out a "whatever it takes" platform for balancing a market tilted slightly toward the supply side.OPEC and a handful of producers outside the group, like Russia, are coordinating to drain the surplus on the five-year average in global crude oil through managed declines in production.OPEC during the weekend said compliance with the agreement was above 100 percent.OPEC economists in their monthly market report for October said the price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, could be in a range between $50 per barrel and $55 per barrel for 2018.Another above that would trigger an uptick in U.S. drilling, and possibly contribute to later supply-side strains.The price for Brent crude oil was down 0.17 percent at 9:15 a.m. EDT to $58.23 per barrel.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was down 0.59 percent to $52.16 per barrel."The threat of an even bigger response from U.S. shale oil producers following WTI's return above $50 per barrel is likely to cap the upside for now," Hanson said.His comments came after the U.S.Interior Department announced plans to hold what it said was the largest offshore lease sale in its history as an oil and gas producer.The government estimates the lease area holds as much as 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that crude oil inventories in the United States, the world's largest economy, declined by 519,000 barrels.A survey of analysts from commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts forecast a draw on crude oil inventories of 425,000 barrels The trajectory for crude oil prices will be determined later in the morning when the U.S. Energy Information Administration publishes official government data.Figures less than the API's estimate would likely send crude oil prices into negative territory.
Oklahoma frustrated by ruling against alternative vehicle fees:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Lawmakers in Oklahoma are working to make up for any losses from vehicle taxes after courts ruled against electric and hybrid fees, the governor said.The state chapter of the Sierra Club filed a claim against a House measure that would put a yearly fee of $100 per on electric cars and a $30 fee on hybrids.Slated to enter into force next year, the high court found the measure to be unconstitutional.The court said in a draft opinion that the House bill in question passed without three-quarters of the member of the state legislature and was therefore unconstitutional.Oklahoma Gov.Mary Fallin said she was disappointed with the decision from the Oklahoma Supreme Court."Fortunately, lawmakers are in special session now working on how to adjust a shortfall of $215 million of state appropriations caused when the state Supreme Court earlier this year struck down a proposed smoking cessation fee," she said in a statement.The government called lawmakers to a special session in late September to address budget strains she said were critical.By her estimate, the state could face a $500 million shortfall next year because one-time funds were used to balance the books for the current fiscal year.On some of the proposals, like a higher tax on cigarettes, the governor said they fell short because they would be implemented too late in the fiscal year.House Minority Leader Scott Inman, who is running to fill Fallin's seat after she leaves office on term limits, said earlier this month there was a bipartisan agreement to raise sin taxes, cut a tax on wind energy producers and raise the rate for gross production taxes.Fallin responded by saying that maybe there were agreements on common goals, but if there were a budget deal, should would've announced it herself.Oklahoma is home to about 4 percent of the total petroleum reserves in the country and accounts for as much as 5 percent of the total crude oil production.The state government reported that new tax legislation was supporting economic growth.Changing a tax rate for shale drillers from 1 percent to 4 percent supported overall receipts in September with $6.9 million.
After big bet on Guyana, Hess posts big loss:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- After dumping billions of dollars in assets to focus on one particular oil field in Guyana, Hess Corp. said Wednesday its net loss almost doubled year-over-year.Hess reported a net loss in the third quarter of $624 million, a loss that was nearly 90 percent higher than reported during the same period last year.The company attributed most of the loss to a change in tax structure, though production was lower across most of its portfolio."We are successfully executing our strategic plan to focus our portfolio by investing in our highest return assets and divesting mature higher cost assets," CEO John Hess said in a statement."These actions in turn will lower our cash unit costs, bolster our balance sheet and prefund our world class investment opportunity in Guyana, which will position us to deliver a decade plus of returns-driven growth and increasing cash generation for our shareholders."The company this week shed assets across a wide portfolio range to help fund operations at the Liza field in Guyana.Working alongside Exxon Mobil, the company said it would cost about $3.2 billion to develop the broader offshore Liza field, which may contain as much as 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent.Hess this week secured more than $2 billion in the sales.The CEO said Guyana would yield "a decade plus of returns-driven growth."Drilling operations are scheduled through next year and Hess said the first phase of operations at the Liza discovery should enter into production by 2020.Across the rest of its portfolio, Hess reported a decline in output for the third quarter.Not counting Libya, the company said net production averaged 299,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 4.7 percent decline from the same period last year.In the United States, one of the largest oil and gas producers in the world, Hess said production at the Bakken shale formation was reduced because of "adverse weather and delays in completing new wells."Output from the Gulf of Mexico was 3.2 percent lower than the same period in 2016.Crude oil prices bottomed out last year and crimped spending on exploration and production, but have since recovered, with Brent flirting with $60 per barrel.Hess said its spending on exploration and production during the third quarter was $558 million, up from the $433 million during third quarter 2016.
Kurdish government proposes end to independence push:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- With oil the source of regional disputes, the semiautonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq said it was backing off its ambitions for independence.The Kurdistan Regional Government said in statements published Wednesday that greater Iraq and the self-governed Kurdish provinces were faced with "grave and dangerous" circumstances that followed a contentious referendum for Kurdish independence.The referendum coincided more or less with the liberation of Mosul and other key areas of northern Iraq from the terrorist group calling itself the Islamic State, known variably as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.Liberation prompted a reconstruction effort by the Iraqi government.After tensions escalated in the wake of the referendum, Iraqi forces in early October wrestled control over oil fields in the disputed region of Kirkuk, taking over an economic lifeline for Kurdish independence.Kurdish military forces backed out of the northern city of Sinjar after a confrontation with paramilitary forces loyal to the federal government in Baghdad.The city is included in territories of dispute between the semiautonomous Kurdish government and the federal government in Baghdad.Disputed territories run north from a line stretching from Khanaqin along the eastern border with Iran to Sinjar, near the border with Syria.The Kurdish government said Wednesday that, in order to prevent the conflict from spiraling out of control, it was proposing a bilateral cease-fire agreement, open dialogue with the federal government in Baghdad and a freeze to "the results of referendum conducted in the Iraqi Kurdistan."While most of the Iraqi reserves are in the south of the country, hundreds of thousands of barrels move each day north to a Turkish port facility on the Mediterranean Sea.A conflict management proposal published by Raad Alkadiri, a senior energy and national security associate with the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies, outlined a bilateral "special status" agreement for the oil and gas reserves in Kirkuk province and sector management from an international third-party company.British energy company BP confirmed to UPI earlier this week that it resumed technical assistance to an Iraqi oil company working in the northern provinces, work that was stopped in 2015.BP officials met in Baghdad earlier this week with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to discuss a number of issues."One of them was Kirkuk, our potential support and discussion of the current situation," a spokesperson said.Crude oil from northern Iraq flows primarily by truck and through a pipeline from Kurdish territory to a Turkish sea port.A second pipeline from Iraqi territory in the north could be used once it's rehabilitated.Skirmishes in northern Iraq had supported a risk premium for crude oil prices in the last few weeks.The price for Brent crude oil was more or less unchanged from the previous session in early Wednesday trading.
Amid energy spats, Ukraine's economy showing resilience:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Amid spats with Russia over natural gas, Ukraine's prime minister said Wednesday the economy for the former Soviet republic is on pace to grow at a decent clip."The economy is showing resilience," Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman was quoted in state media as saying."We are planning 3 percent growth for the next year."While stronger that advanced industrialized economies, the prime minister said that growth rate should be closer to at least 5 percent.To advance, he said, the country needed to improve the business climate and take a "worthy place in Europe."Ukraine serves as an energy bridge for Europe, hosting the pipelines that carry about 20 percent of the Russian natural gas headed west.Geopolitical risks to energy security escalated as Kiev moved closer to the European Union in recent years.In an annual review, the International Monetary Fund said Ukraine needs to enact structural reforms in order attract investors to its oil and gas sector and reduce its import dependency.Private gas traders, meanwhile, need to be able to compete with state-controlled gas company Naftogaz.European markets may draw on natural gas from Azerbaijan as a way to break the Russian grip on the regional energy sector though a network dubbed the Southern Corridor.Russia, meanwhile, could get around Ukraine by twinning its Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea to Germany.Russian news agency Tass reported that Ukraine is pushing for an alternative to Nord Stream through alternative delivery points in the country.According to the report, that comes amid possible delays in the Nord Stream extension.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Kiev's position on the project was irrelevant.Despite the push for diversity in the European market, Russian natural gas company Gazprom, which controls both the supplies and the transit arteries, said markets in the European Union still needed Russian gas because of the lack of EU production.
Chinese offshore production lower than last year:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Incremental gains in overseas production weren't enough to offset the declines in Chinese oil and gas production, state-owned CNOOC Ltd. reported Wednesday.The China National Offshore Oil Corp. said Wednesday that third quarter production of 116.2 million barrels of oil equivalent marked a 1.3 percent decline from last year.Offshore production from China yielded 73.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, a 2.3 percent decline from last year, while overseas production of 42.4 million boe marked a 0.7 percent gain from third quarter 2016.CNOOC said the drop in offshore China was because its fields were in decline, rather than regular maintenance."During the third quarter of the year, the company made every effort to fully tap potential, constantly push forward quality and efficiency enhancement," CEO Yuan Guangyu said in a statement.China Offshore Oil Engineering Co., a CNOOC division, said earlier this year the offshore market was improving and Chinese companies were looking to capitalize on the momentum.When oil prices hit historic lows last year, CNOOC, the country's largest producer, lowered its production forecast for 2016 by 3.5 percent and pledged to put cost control and efficiency at the forefront of its agenda."We are confident that we will achieve our production and operation targets for the year and continuously create greater value for the shareholders," the CEO said.The company earlier this year turned in one of its worst performances ever, with oil and gas revenues down 17 percent from 2015.On Wednesday, the company said revenue was up 16.9 percent from last year, a gain attributed to improved market conditions.CNOOC realized an average price for oil during the third quarter of $50.87 per barrel, up 20.4 percent year-on-year.The price for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, was near $58 per barrel early Wednesday, up nearly $10 per barrel from this time last year.CNOOC this year made five new discoveries and put four new projects into production.China has an energy-hungry economy and the second largest economy in the world after the United States.In a September report, the Asian Development Bank said Chinese growth in the first half of the year was stronger than expected.Expansion of 6.7 percent is expected this year, an increase of 0.2 percent from the previous forecast.
$300 million Puerto Rico power deal now under government review:::::A $300 million contract awarded to Whitefish Energy, a small Montana utility company hired to restore power in parts of Puerto Rico, is now under several government reviews after being mired in controversy in recent days.The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general has launched an inquiry into the deal with Whitefish following calls by the press and lawmakers on Capitol Hill.The agency considers it one of their highest priority cases, a spokeswoman told CNN on Thursday.The inspector general plans to look into whether the appropriate process was followed by state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, when it awarded the contract.Thus far, the Whitefish deal is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.There will be 'hell to pay' The contract has raised a few eyebrows given that the firm is based in the same hometown as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and it employed just two people at the time Hurricane Maria made landfall.Such concerns prompted a separate House committee on Thursday to also open a review of the multimillion dollar contract.Rep.Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to Richard Ramos, the head of the PREPA, requesting further information on the contract.In addition, Sen. Maria Cantwell, a ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has asked the Government Accountability Office to review the matter.A GAO spokesman said the agency has received the letter and is reviewing the request."Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico power contract A White House spokesman told CNN the decision to give the contract to Whitefish was made exclusively by PREPA."The White House is not aware of any federal involvement in the selection," White House spokesman Raj Shah said.In a letter to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello requested that the government oversight agency complete its review of the Whitefish contract by October 30.Rossello also noted that he recently asked Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget to audit the Whitefish contract in order to ensure it's in compliance with all of the appropriate laws.The results of that audit are due Friday, Rossello told CNN."If there is no wrongdoing, if it has been done correctly then we will push forward," Rossello told CNN."If there is wrongdoing in this process or any process there will be hell to pay."A Twitter battle ensues Since the company announced the deal last week it has been swept up in controversy.On Wednesday, a public feud erupted between Whitefish and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on Twitter.Whitefish later issued an apology to Yulin Cruz after criticizing her and threatening to pull workers from the city she represents.In an earlier interview with Yahoo News, the mayor had called the multimillion dollar contract awarded to Whitefish "alarming" and pressed for the contract to be canceled immediately."The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said of the two-year old electrical utility in the interview Tuesday.Related: San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract In response, Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames posted a statement on Twitter calling Yulin Cruz's comments "misplaced.""We find her comments to be very disappointing and demoralizing to the hundreds of people on our team that have left their homes and families and have come here to help the people of Puerto Rico," Whitefish tweeted Wednesday.By the afternoon, the situation grew heated.Yulin Cruz tweeted back: "If @WhitefishEnergy feels that asking for transparency is "misplaced", what are they afraid we will find.""We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?," the utility company replied.Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico contract "Threats received by @WhitefishEnergy.The implication is if I do not "play nice" they will not do their job.Nasty!," the mayor tweeted back.She said Whitefish's response implied it would not treat San Juan with the "diligence it deserves."Whitefish later said it is committed to restoring power in Puerto Rico and then apologized to the mayor."Mayor Cruz and everyone in Puerto Rico... we would like to apologize for our comments earlier today, which did not represent who we are and how important this work is to help Puerto Rico's recovery," the company posted on Twitter late Wednesday night.Yulin Cruz does not have authority over PREPA and the contracts it issues.She has long been a critic of Rossello, who backed the Whitefish contract, and has criticized President Trump's handling of relief efforts on the island.Hometown connections in question PREPA's Ramos told reporters during a press conference last week the cash-strapped island chose Whitefish because it didn't require a big deposit upfront.The other contender, Power Security, wanted a $25 million down payment for the work, Ramos said."In that moment, we were not in a position to offer that collateral," said Ramos."The other company did not ask for a guarantee of payment."In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Ramos said he had no regrets about picking Whitefish out of the seven companies he spoke with about working on the recovery efforts."If we went back in time, I would do it all over again," Ramos said, adding the company is "doing a great job."But some on Capitol Hill are concerned that Whitefish may have stood out for another reason.The tiny utility company is based in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be Zinke's hometown.Both Zinke and Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski acknowledge knowing one another.Zinke's office described Whitefish as a "small town" with a population of roughly 6,000 people.One of the secretary's sons "joined a friend who worked a summer job at one their [Whitefish's] construction sites."Related: FEMA just got another $6.7 billion to help with hurricane relief Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce confirmed an Oct. 1 report by NBC Montana, which quoted Techmanski as saying he reached out to Zinke after winning the contract to help get resources to the island more quickly, But Luce told CNN that the company did not make any requests to the administration before the contract was signed on Sept. 26."The secretary had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish getting the contract," he said.Techmanski, who has described the firm as specializing in "difficult and mountainous terrain projects," has downplayed any ties to the administration."All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN Friday, referring to a call from director Ramos."We called each other."PREPA, which is $9 billion in debt, could have requested aid after Maria through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.That's what Texas and Florida did after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Ramos told CNN on Thursday that the closest states to Puerto Rico were already dealing with their own aftermath of earlier hurricanes and he believed they would not be able to respond quickly to the island's needs.The bankrupt utility also couldn't afford to cover the costs of utilizing the network either, he added.Related: Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous lines' Whitefish does have another tie to the administration.HBC Investments, which was founded by a big Republican donor named Joe Colonnetta, backs the firm.Colonnetta and his wife donated more than $20,000 to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and more than $30,000 to the Republican National Committee last year alone, according to a filing from the Federal Election Commission.A representative for Colonnetta was not immediately available to comment on the donations.Luce said the investment firm learned of Whitefish last summer through an unnamed mutual acquaintance in the energy industry."Techmanski is the type of entrepreneur HBC likes -- a family guy with a good business plan," Luce said, noting that the Whitefish CEO had previously managed contracts of up to $250 million.Additional reporting by Julia Jones, Martin Savidge and Paul Murphy.
Here's what you'll pay in Obamacare premiums in 2018:::::Consumers can now check out how much Obamacare will cost them in 2018.The window shopping tool for the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, went live on Wednesday, allowing folks to start comparing plans a week before open enrollment begins.What they find may shock them, especially if they aren't eligible for federal premium subsidies.Premiums for silver plans -- the most popular on the exchanges -- will rise an average of 34% in the more than three dozen states that use the federal exchange, according to a new analysis from Avalere, a consulting firm.The hikes vary by state, with Iowa seeing the largest average silver plan rate increase at 69%.Many insurers hiked the price of their silver policies for 2018 to offset President Trump's elimination of the funding for Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies.These payments, made directly to insurers, reduce deductibles and co-pays for lower-income enrollees.Trump had threatened to eliminate the funding all year, finally doing so earlier this month.Those who earn too much to qualify for premium subsidies will be hit the hardest.Related: Trump's quest to kill Obamacare hurts the middle class But in a strange twist, those eligible for premium assistance could actually find themselves able to buy gold plans -- which have lower deductibles -- for less than or the same price as the silver policies.That's because they'll likely receive more generous subsidies, which will make the gold plans more affordable.Here's why: Most state regulators directed insurers to compensate for the loss of the cost-sharing subsidy funding by hiking only the prices of their silver plans, knowing the premium subsidy would shield eligible enrollees from the increase."People will see much better deals in those states," said David Anderson, research associate at Duke's Margolis Center for Health Policy.Gold plan premiums are rising by 16% on average, while the prices for bronze plans, which have lower rates but higher deductibles, are increasing by an average of 18%, according to Avalere.Related: Actually, Trump is raising health insurance premiums This makes it even more crucial for consumers to shop for 2018 coverage during open enrollment, which runs through Dec. 15.Those who don't may find themselves missing out on more affordable coverage or, even worse, stuck with much costlier plans or no coverage at all.Premium subsidies are based on the second lowest cost silver plan, but this benchmark policy can change year to year.The window shopping tool is one of several features the Trump administration is keeping for the open enrollment season.However, it is making many other changes that critics say will sabotage Obamacare.First, what's staying the same: Call centers will be staffed: Roughly the same number of call center representatives will be available to answer enrollment questions.Last year, staffing peaked at 11,000 people, according to the administration.New this year will be a call-back feature so consumers can opt to get a return call, rather than wait on hold.Waiting rooms could be deployed if needed: As in prior years, consumers may be put in virtual "waiting rooms" when healthcare.gov traffic is high.Users will see a message asking them to stay on the page, which will refresh when they can continue with enrollment.And here's what's new: A big change for auto re-enrollment: The Trump administration will once again automatically re-enroll consumers who don't actively select a plan by Dec. 15.However, unlike in prior years, participants won't be able to switch to another policy after that date.That's because open enrollment ends on Dec. 15, whereas it continued at least through the end of January in previous years.This is a big deal because some policies will be far costlier next year.Consumers may get stuck if they don't shop around.Enrolling outside of healthcare.gov: Consumers will now be able to enroll directly through certain third-party websites, rather than having to go to healthcare.gov to complete their applications.Also, the federal exchange will make it easier for consumers to connect with agents and brokers for assistance with applications through a new "Help on Demand" service.The Trump administration says this will provide Americans with more ways to enroll.Critics, however, worry that applicants may be steered to certain insurers' products and may not be told of less-expensive options.The open enrollment features released Wednesday follow many other changes Trump officials are instituting that experts say will likely dampen sign-ups.These include cutting the enrollment period in half, cutting funding to non-profit groups that help consumers pick plans and slashing the advertising budget by 90% -- not to mention, Trump's repeated declarations that Obamacare is dead.Related: Trump administration is making it even harder to sign up for Obamacare The administration said Wednesday that it will target the uninsured, as well as young and healthy enrollees who plan to sign up again, in its marketing campaigns.It will use YouTube videos, social media, mobile and search advertising, emails, texts and autodial messages to reach out to consumers.What the administration is not doing is television, radio and direct mail advertising.TV, in particular, is the most effective way to drive people to enroll, said Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration official who co-founded the Get America Covered campaign to try to boost enrollment.Trump officials seem to be interested in making sure consumers get help while enrolling, Lodes said.However, the Trump administration isn't looking to boost the number of Americans signing up for Obamacare."They are only focused on the consumer experience, which is great, but they also need to be focused on making sure people get enrolled," she said.The cuts to the advertising budget could reduce Obamacare enrollment by at least 1.1 million, estimates Joshua Peck, co-founder of the Get America Covered campaign and former chief marketing officer for healthcare.gov.
ECB: Europe's stimulus program is slimming down:::::Europe's massive stimulus program is slimming down.The European Central Bank announced Thursday that it will reduce the scale of its bond buying program in January 2018.As part of the program, which began in March 2015, the ECB has been purchasing 60 billion ($71 billion) worth of government bonds and other assets each month.At times, the purchases reached 80 billion ($94 billion) per month.Starting next year, the buys will be slashed to 30 billion ($35 billion) per month.However, the central bank also said the purchases would continue at that pace deep into 2018.The bank indicated the program would run at its reduced level until at least September -- but longer if needed.The program -- a form of quantitative easing -- has helped support the economy by keeping borrowing costs low for households and businesses.That, in turn, has increased spending and helped spur economic growth.Investors reacted to the bank's announcement by pushing the euro lower.Stock markets remained in positive territory."The announcement has been well signaled by the central bank ... with the aim of causing as little disturbance as possible for the markets," said Mihir Kapadia, CEO of financial services firm Sun Global Investments.A range of quantitative easing programs were put into action after the global financial crisis.The Federal Reserve purchased $4.5 trillion in investments over the years to support the U.S. economy.Central banks in the U.K. and Japan deployed similar measures of their own.European economies have stabilized since the stimulus program was launched.The average annual growth rate in the eurozone hit 2.3% in the latest quarter, and formerly troubled Spain and Portugal are now growing at around 3%.Related: Europeans really want to work at Google Draghi said in a news conference that he was pleased by "unabated growth momentum" in Europe, but noted that it was the result of the central bank's "ample" support.He said that continuing the bond-buying program -- without a definitive end date -- would help keep the economy on track.The ECB boss has other issues to worry about: inflation remains below the central bank's 2% target at 1.5%.Unemployment is also stubbornly high.The jobless rate in Greece is above 20% and Spanish unemployment sits just above 17%.
Trump's quest to kill Obamacare is going to hurt the middle class:::::Dave McDonald is no fan of Obamacare.The health reform law has prevented the 59-year-old from saving as much for his golden years as he would like.A retired mining engineer, McDonald and his wife, Lorraine, now run a bed-and-breakfast in Dutch John, Utah, and he also works as a fishing guide on the Green River.Both jobs help cover the extra $11,000 a year the couple has to pay in health insurance premiums."When the cost of health care more than doubles, you have to do something," said McDonald, whose premiums went from $350 a month in 2013 to $1,320 a month this year.He calculates he has to work 45 days on the river just to pay for their additional health care expenses.McDonald, who earns too much to qualify for the federal subsidies that would lower his premiums, could very well have to shell out even more for policies next year.Rates in Utah will soar an average of 39% for 2018, in part because carriers are looking to shield themselves from the uncertainty emanating from Washington D.C. Like their peers in many states around the nation, Utah's insurers are steeply hiking rates for next year in part because they anticipated President Trump would stop funding a key set of Obamacare subsidies that help lower-income enrollees afford health care.Trump lived up to his vow earlier this month when he announced that he would end the cost-sharing payments.Related: Actually, Trump is raising health insurance premiums Whom will this move hurt the most?The middle class, who aren't protected from the rate hikes like those of more modest means.Nearly seven million people who buy individual policies don't qualify for premium subsidies.These include the roughly 1.6 million Obamacare enrollees who earn more than $47,500 as an individual or $97,200 as a family of four this year, and the 5.1 million who buy individual coverage outside of the Obamacare exchange.These middle class folks will bear the full brunt of the premium increases, unlike the 8.7 million enrollees who receive federal assistance to keep their premiums to less than 10% of their annual income.They were the Americans that Trump and congressional Republicans promised to help by repealing and replacing Obamacare.Instead, they will be hit the hardest.Related: Trump kills key Obamacare subsidy payments: What it means After seeing her premiums rise 33% this year, Chicago resident Heather Tamburo is frustrated that her premiums will likely soar again.The stay-at-home mom and her husband, a self-employed photographer, are already paying $1,200 a month to cover themselves and their daughter.The couple makes too much to qualify for subsidies and expect their rates to rise again for 2018.The average premium for the lowest-cost silver plan in Illinois will rise 35%, while the cheapest bronze plan will go up 20% on average.The Tamburos have already been told that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois won't offer their same bronze plan next year."Next year, we'll have to switch to doctors we've never seen and to a plan we've never heard of and will have to pay more," said Tamburo, 53, who preferred the policy she had on the individual market prior to Obamacare because it had smaller annual rate increases.For Laurie Ryan, the answer may be to leave the country.Ryan and her husband, Randall, have bought insurance on the individual market since they started their music and voice over production studio in Austin, Texas, more than two decades ago.When the Obamacare exchanges first opened in 2014, their rates went down.But now they pay $816 a month, about $150 to $200 more than they did before Obamacare, for a plan with a $13,000 deductible.Her insurer, Sendero Health Plans, requested a premium hike of 26%, on average, for next year.The ever-climbing cost of health insurance has pushed the Ryans to consider moving to Panama or Mexico.They've already done the research on the former -- they could get coverage for $5,000 a year in premiums, with a $5,000 deductible.They are visiting Mexico in December to talk to other Americans who have moved there."Spending $10,000 a year for health insurance that isn't that great ... we just can't sustain that until we qualify for Medicare," said Ryan, 52, noting they are in very good health.
South Korea's economy and markets are flying high despite tensions:::::Tensions over North Korea may be causing alarm around the world, but they're not weighing heavily on its southern neighbor's economy and stock market.The South Korean economy grew at its fastest rate in seven years in the third quarter, according to government data released Thursday.Experts say momentum will hold despite saber-rattling between Kim Jong Un and President Trump."Provided conflict is avoided, South Korea should continue to grow strongly over the coming year," analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a research note.They predict South Korea will benefit from healthy global trade, rising government spending and a big hike in the country's minimum wage.Related: South Korea does a sudden U-turn on nuclear power Investors are showing optimism about South Korean companies, too.The benchmark Kospi index has soared to record highs recently and is up more than 22% since the start of the year.That beats the Nasdaq and the Dow over the same period.The South Korean index has been helped by heavyweight stock Samsung Electronics, which has shrugged off last year's Galaxy Note 7 debacle and the corruption conviction of its de facto leader to post a gain of more than 45% in 2017.Trump and Kim's bellicose threats have weighed on markets from time to time this year, only for them to bounce back.Analysts say that brinkmanship over North Korea is nothing new for investors, who have seen repeated flare-ups on the Korean peninsula.But the situation has had real consequences.The deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea angered China, the country's biggest trading partner, resulting in a sharp drop in Chinese tourists and difficulties for South Korean firms operating inside China.Related: China can squeeze its neighbors when it wants.Ask South Korea The boycott by Chinese tourists is hurting South Korea, but other industries like electronics are more than making up for it.The country's economy expanded 1.4% in the third quarter, compared with the previous three months of the year.That comfortably beat economists' forecasts and was propelled by a 6.1% jump in exports.The main problem looming over the economy is the high level of household debt, according to the Capital Economics analysts.But they expect a planned 16% increase in the minimum wage next year to prop up spending by consumers.
Trump likes Yellen but wants to make his mark on the Fed:::::President Trump really likes Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen."I think she's terrific.We had a great talk," Trump told Fox Business in an interview aired on Wednesday.Trump met with Yellen last week, and he's still considering whom to nominate as the next leader of the Fed.He said Monday that he was "very, very close" to a decision but no definitive date has been set for the announcement."It won't be a big shock," he told Fox Business on Wednesday.Trump neither fully endorsed Yellen nor dismissed her chances of getting renominated.He hinted that the stock market's rise to record highs -- one of his favorite talking points -- was partially due to the Fed's monetary policy under Yellen's watch.The Dow recently crossed 23,000 points for the first time in history.Trump also credited himself for the stock market's success.Related: Trump keeps teasing imminent Fed Chair decision "We're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets," Trump told Fox Business, speaking of himself and Yellen.But Trump admitted he wants to put his own stamp on the Fed and its leadership.After all, Yellen was nominated by President Obama in 2013."In one way I have to say, you like to make your own mark ... which is maybe one of things that she's got a little bit against her," Trump added.Trump's comments on the nomination have changed day to day.In a separate interview with Fox, he hinted that Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor are frontrunners.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh is also a candidate.At a meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump did a "show of hands" poll for the next Fed chair in a closed-door meeting with Republicans.Some lawmakers told CNN that Taylor was apparently the most liked in the casual vote, but no official tally was made.Trump also asked Fox anchor Lou Dobbs in the interview on Wednesday who he would choose to be Fed Chair."I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping," Dobbs replied.
The jobs market is strong. Here's the asterisk.:::::The jobless rate at a 16-year low.A record 6 million open jobs.Weekly jobless claims below 300,000 for the longest stretch since the 1970s.By nearly every headline measure, the American jobs market is roaring.But something is missing -- meaningful wage growth.Companies are hiring and layoffs are down, but paychecks aren't growing as they should.Before the Great Recession, wages grew around 3% each year.A healthy labor market should generate fatter paychecks to the tune of 3% to 3.5%.Those higher wages help workers keep up with inflation and keep the consumer-driven economy strong.Since the recession, wage growth has been stubbornly weak, an asterisk in the job market recovery.There was a glimmer of hope in September, when wages rose 2.9% from the year before, the strongest in eight years.It's too early to know whether that was temporary, a statistical blip because of the hurricanes, or the beginning of long-repressed wage inflation.Related: Romans' Numeral: Is it too late to buy stocks?Another asterisk: Geography.Unemployment is still high in some places, like Alaska, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C. And then there's this: A record 6 million jobs are open in the United States, and at the same time 6 million people are looking for work.So why can't those unemployed people fill those jobs?Employers say they can't find workers who have the right training.It's been a problem for years.Other factors that could be holding down wage growth are automation, which is eliminating some jobs, and competition from overseas.But until wage growth improves, it's holding the economy back from an even stronger recovery.

Saudi Arabia: 4 big takeaways from 'Davos in the Desert':::::More than 3,500 business leaders and government officials have flocked to Saudi Arabia for a conference dubbed "Davos in the Desert."Attendees were hungry for insights on where the major oil producer is headed.They were not disappointed.Here are four of the biggest takeaways from the summit in Riyadh: The crown prince Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the driving force behind sweeping economic changes in Saudi Arabia, made a rare appearance at the conference, addressing a huge audience of investors on Tuesday.The young crown prince had a message: We are open for business.He also delivered a warning to ultraconservatives, vowing to to destroy "extremist ideologies" and return to "a more moderate Islam.""We want to lead normal lives, lives where our religion and our traditions translate into tolerance, so that we coexist with the world and become part of the development of the world," he said.Related: Saudi Arabia is investing billions in fun It's a development that was welcomed by investors.Colony Capital chief executive Tom Barrack, who lived in the kingdom in the 1970s, said that these reforms may succeed where others failed."His approach is definitively the right one," Barrack said of the crown prince."What you've seen here in the last few days is a real commitment of tolerance," he added."We are going to create an environment for the West that will be transparent, secure, stable and understandable."A new mega-city The crown prince also unveiled NEOM, a $500 billion mega-city that will span three countries.The city will be powered entirely by regenerative energy, while also making use of automated driving technology and passenger drones.Wireless hi-speed internet will be free.Should it become reality, the development could become a major driver of tourism, an industry that is key to the crown prince's ambitious Vision 2030 program.The goal is to diversify the country's revenue and reduce what he once called an "addiction" to oil.It would also build stronger ties with neighbors Jordan and Egypt, whose territory would be included in the project.One major caveat: Saudi has previously announced several economic cities that have failed to attract the right investment, with many office spaces reduced to empty caverns in the desert.Massive investment Much of the change in Saudi Arabia is being funded by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF).The sovereign fund has contributed $45 billion to Softbank's Vision Fund, which is the world's largest technology investor.PIF has also poured $20 billion into a Blackstone infrastructure fund.Some fund managers and business titans attending the conference have privately expressed worries over the kingdom's ability to deliver on all of the projects built into Vision 2030.But the pace of new initiatives has only accelerated.On Wednesday, PIF said it plans to increase its assets under management to $400 billion by 2020.It wants to create 20,000 direct jobs and 256,000 jobs in construction."I'm sure they need and should be looking at domestic investments as well," said Joshua Friedman, co-CEO of Canyon Partners, "As they interact with the most sophisticated investors globally ...I'm sure they'll bring that sophistication to bear on their own markets."Related: The man leading Saudi Arabia's overhaul just got more powerful The world's biggest IPO One of the biggest remaining questions surrounds a partial sell-off of the kingdom's crown jewel, Saudi Aramco.Officials have said they expect the IPO to value the giant sate oil company at around $2 trillion.If the market agrees, selling just 5% would raise $100 billion.The debut has been scheduled for 2018, but there are doubts over its realization.Aramco has disputed recent media reports suggesting uncertainty.CEO Amin Nasser told CNNMoney in an interview that an IPO is on track for 2018, but he refused to define whether it will have an international listing."We looked at the different venues, which are New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo," he said."We are taking time for the shareholders [the ruling family] to look at all the data ... and then the decision where to list ... will come in due course."Economic regulation, foreign ownership laws, and strict Islamic laws have often deterred investors in the past.This time, investors are listening.

San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract:::::San Juan's mayor, Carmen Yulin Cruz, has called a multimillion dollar contract awarded to a small Montana firm to help restore power in Puerto Rico "alarming" and said it should be canceled immediately."The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said in an interview with Yahoo News Tuesday.Whitefish Energy, a two-year old electrical utility firm with ties to the Trump administration, announced last week it had secured a $300 million contract from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority -- more commonly known as PREPA -- to repair and reconstruct parts of the island's electrical infrastructure.This is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico contract Whitefish only had two employees the day the hurricane hit.Already, the company has scaled up to 300 employees in Puerto Rico -- and it says 700 more are on the way.Such quick growth is typical among utility firms when they are awarded large contracts, the firm told CNN."It seems like what the Puerto Rican people are going to be paying for, or the American people are going to be paying for, is an intermediary that doesn't know what is at stake here and that really has to subcontract everything," Yulin Cruz said of Whitefish in the interview."What we need is somebody that can get the job done and that has the expertise to get the job done."In a statement Wednesday, Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames said Yulin Cruz's comments were "misplaced.""We are making progress and doing work when others are not even here," Whitefish's statement said."We find her comments to be very disappointing and demoralizing to the hundreds of people on our team that have left their homes and families and have come here to help the people of Puerto Rico."By Wednesday afternoon, the situation got heated on social media.After Whitefish posted its statement on Twitter, Yulin Cruz tweeted: "If @WhitefishEnergy feels that asking for transparency is "misplaced", what are they afraid we will find.""We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?," the utility company replied to the mayor on Twitter.We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?Whitefish Energy (@WhitefishEnergy) October 25, 2017 "Threats received by @WhitefishEnergy.The implication is if I do not "play nice" they will not do their job.Nasty!," the mayor tweeted back.She said Whitefish's response implied it would not treat San Juan with the "diligence it deserves."Whitefish then tweeted that it did not want to leave the island without helping and it was committed to restoring power in Puerto Rico.Related: Puerto Rico's cash crisis: 35% of banks still closed Yulin Cruz has long been a critic of Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, who backed the Whitefish contract.She has also criticized President Trump's handling of relief efforts on the island, repeatedly noting that U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are facing a "life and death situation" since the hurricane made landfall.She does not have authority over PREPA and the contracts it issues.The Whitefish contract has also been raising a few eyebrows among Democrats.On Tuesday, both a House and a Senate committee called for reviews of the Whitefish contract.PREPA's executive director, Ricardo Ramos, told reporters last week during a press conference the cash-strapped island chose Whitefish because it didn't require a big deposit upfront.The other unnamed contender wanted a $25 million down payment for the work, Ramos said."In that moment, we were not in a position to offer that collateral," said Ramos."The other company did not ask for a guarantee of payment."But some on Capitol Hill are concerned that Whitefish may have stood out for another reason.The tiny utility company is based in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.Both Zinke and Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski acknowledge knowing one another.Zinke's office described Whitefish as a "small town" with a population of roughly 6,000 people.One of the secretary's sons "joined a friend who worked a summer job at one their [Whitefish's] construction sites."Related: Who owns Puerto Rico's mountain of debt?You do Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce confirmed an Oct. 1 report by NBC Montana, which quoted Techmanski as saying he reached out to Zinke after winning the contract to help get resources to the island more quickly, But Luce told CNN that the company did not make any requests to the administration except for one after the contract was signed on Sept. 26."The secretary had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish getting the contract," he said.Techmanski, who has described the firm as specializing in "difficult and mountainous terrain projects," has downplayed any ties to the administration.Related: Can Elon Musk fix Puerto Rico's broken power grid?"All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN Friday, referring to a call from director Ramos."We called each other."Still, PREPA, a state-owned utility, chose to hire Whitefish rather than initiate agreements with other utilities to help recover from the natural disaster more quickly.The bankrupt utility, which is $9 billion in debt, could have requested aid after Maria through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.That's what Texas and Florida did after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.--CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this report.
Reality check: Will Trump's tax plan really give you a $4,000 pay raise?:::::The White House is actively marketing the promise that President Trump's tax plan will mean at least $4,000 more in income every year for the average household.That figure is based on a report by Trump's chief economist Kevin Hassett, who looked at various studies to gauge how cutting the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today might affect workers' pay.But before anyone reworks their budget to make way for all that new cash, here are a few things to keep in mind: Some economists have serious doubts Most economists can agree that "well-designed tax changes can improve living standards over time," said Donald Marron, a former acting director of the Congressional Budget Office who now is director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute.But they part company on just how big the benefit to wages could be.In fact, it's among the most unresolved issues in economics today.Jason Furman, who ran the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and is Hassett's immediate predecessor, characterized the claim that average working households might see $4,000 to $9,000 more in income every year as "wild" in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece.Even an economist whose research Hassett cited in his study pushed back against the $4,000 claim as being far too high."Cutting corporate taxes will help wages but exaggeration only serves to undercut the reasonableness of the core argument," Harvard finance professor Mihir Desai tweeted.A lot of mainstream economists would agree."If you just go by weight of opinion by people who think about this for a living, [the boost to income] will probably be much lower than $4,000," Marron said.Some, however, aren't shocked by Hassett's estimate.Using a comprehensive model he developed with colleagues over several years, Boston University economics professor Laurence Kotlikoff estimated the entire tax reform framework negotiated by the White House and Republican leaders could potentially generate enough growth to boost average working household incomes by $3,500 a year.Related: White House explains why it believes corporate tax cuts mean bigger paychecks That said, Kotlikoff noted that there's always some uncertainty with any model."I don't think what [Hassett] suggested is out of the range of possibility.Nor do I think zero is out of the range of possibility."More income per household doesn't mean per paycheck Hassett's report measures the potential wage gains by household.And his $4,000 estimate applies to both households that bring in the mean (or average) income in the country ($83,143 in 2016 per Census data) as well as the median income ($59,039).Related: Cutting U.S. corporate taxes could mean a windfall for foreign investors But that's not the same as saying every worker would see a $4,000 raise, since the Census Bureau reports that there is more than one earner on average in households at those income levels.Other tax changes may undercut the potential benefits The $4,000 estimate is based strictly on the prospect of lowering the corporate rate to 20%.If lawmakers can't get the rate that low (e.g., because of deficit concerns), or if they make the rate cut temporary or in some other way inhibit the incentive to invest, that could curtail potential wage gains."If there were lots of other changes that we haven't modeled that worked in the other direction, then these numbers could change," Hassett noted in a press briefing.A boost to income won't happen right away In a briefing with reporters, Hassett allowed that "it's hard to come up with a model that jumps to $4,000 in the first year."In fact, no one knows quite how long it might take for a corporate rate cut to start affecting wages.Kotlikoff, for instance, estimates that average household income under the GOP tax reform framework might rise by $3,500 within six to eight years.
U.S. slaps sanctions on terrorism group leaders in Yemen:::::The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed a new round of sanctions, this time on eight key ISIS and al Qaeda leaders and a supermarket that supports terrorism in Yemen.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the measures during a speech in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as part of a six-day trip to the Middle East aimed at bolstering cooperation in curbing terrorism financing.The latest round of economic warfare was coordinated with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, the Kingdom of Bahrain and Qatar, making it the largest multinational sanction in the Middle East, Mnuchin said."This bold and innovative multilateral approach is needed because terrorism poses a threat to all of our nations," said Mnuchin."It is critical that we come together to combat this."The deal builds on a prior agreement reached during President Trump's visit to Riyadh in May.That pact created a center to coordinate the efforts of all seven countries to undermine the financing of terrorist groups.The White House has prioritized using such economic tools to combat rogue regimes like North Korea and terrorist organizations, like ISIS.The administration has been working to tamp down on terror attacks by cutting off their access to an expansive network of fundraisers, recruiters and operators.Mnuchin said ISIS has raised hundreds of millions of dollars through the theft of oil, kidnapping and extortion, and targeted sanctions by the U.S. have helped to reduce the flow of capital to the terrorist organization."We are focused on maximizing the use of our expansive economic authorities, intelligence, and other sources of financial information to target and interrupt the financing of those who execute and facilitate these deadly attacks and other destabilizing activities," said Mnuchin.Related: Did China just break its promise not to buy North Korea coal?The group of countries designated eight key ISIS and al Qaeda leaders operating in Yemen, including Abu Sulayman al-Adani, a top ISIS leader in Yemen and Khalid al-Marfadi, who has been in charge of the movements of ISIS fighters.Some of the men designated have acted as arms dealers helping to smuggle weapons to secret locations and storage depots in the country, while another has acted as a military and chief financial officer for ISIS.They also designated a supermarket and four of its stores, which are run by one of the ISIS weapons dealers on the U.S. list.Speaking with reporters on a conference call, a senior administration official said the U.S. had proposed a lengthier list of individuals and entities supporting the terrorist groups in the country, but other countries asked for certain names to be removed for various reasons."It is absolutely the case we had additional targets we wanted to go after but some of the countries didn't want [to]," said the senior administration official.Related: U.S. slaps sanctions on 8 North Korean banks The senior administration official acknowledged that the enforcement of such sanctions by each country is voluntary, but noted there is "political will" by each of the countries to shut off the terror financing spigot."It is not a trivial matter," said the senior administration official."We have shut down their ability to travel, to actually do that [kind of] fundraising."
Europeans really want to work at Google:::::Everyone wants a job at Google.That's according to a new survey of European students published Wednesday by research and consulting firm Universum.The tech giant, which was hit with a record 2.4 billion ($2.8 billion) fine in June for abusing its dominant search position in Europe, remains the most attractive employer among the continent's business students, as well as their engineering and IT peers.It's the sixth consecutive year that Google (GOOGL, Tech30) has topped the ranking for business students.This year, L'Oreal Group and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) round out the top three companies.Claudia Tattanelli, global director at Universum, said that Google performed well because the firm remain focused on recruiting, and making sure prospective hires hear its message."They do a lot of communication on how it is to work at Google.Graduates don't read newspapers -- they're looking at their social media channels," said Tattanelli.Here's the full top 10 ranking of most attractive employer among European business students: Google L'Oreal Group Microsoft PricewaterhouseCoopers Ernst & Young KPMG Deloitte Goldman Sachs McKinsey & Company Boston Consulting Group There was more upheaval in the list of most desirable employers for engineering and IT students, which saw Daimler and IBM (IBM, Tech30) make major gains.Siemens and BMW, meanwhile, dropped in this year's rankings.American tech giants Google and Microsoft were the only two firms to appear in the top 10 among both business and engineering and IT categories.The top 10 employers among European engineering and IT students: Google Microsoft IBM Siemens General Electric Daimler/Mercedes-Benz Bosch Airbus BMW Intel Business as well as engineering students said their top career goal is striking the proper balance between work and life outside the office.But business students emphasized leadership opportunities, while engineers said they valued job security more.The groups also look for different qualities in an employer.Universum said the most important attributes for business students are "high future earnings, professional training and a good reference."But engineering students tend to look for professional training and development."These firms are dealing with the biggest technological challenges," said Tattanelli."If you join them, what they're saying is: 'Come and challenge yourself, come and innovate.'" The 2017 Universum rankings were based on a survey of almost 200,000 business, engineering and IT students across 12 European nations, including Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. -- Alanna Petroff contributed reporting.
Brits should prepare for their first interest rate hike in a decade:::::The British economy has accelerated just enough to lock in the country's first interest rate hike in a decade.That's the assessment of economists after official data published Wednesday pegged U.K. economic growth at 0.4% compared to the previous quarter.The GDP growth, which translates to an annual expansion of 1.5%, was stronger than expected.With inflation near 3%, the result means the Bank of England is now very likely to increase interest rates next week."Today's growth figures show that, despite the Brexit headwinds, U.K. growth is good enough to give the [central bank] the green light for a rate rise," said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.The central bank's key interest rate is currently set at a record low of 0.25%.It had been as high as 5.75% in mid-2007.Britain's economy has been under pressure in the aftermath of last summer's Brexit referendum.Unemployment has continued to fall, but a sharp drop in the value of the pound has hurt consumers by making imported goods more expensive.Wages have also been squeezed and the housing market has slowed.Uncertainty about the terms of a divorce deal with the European Union has forced businesses to put investments on hold."The U.K. growth rate would probably be nearer 2.5% this year if it weren't for Brexit," said Kallum Pickering, a senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.Related: Time is now the key factor in Brexit talks The new GDP data showed strength in the services sector, including computer programming and retail.However, there were signs of further decline in construction. "These numbers do not change the big picture for the U.K.," said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC.Related: The CNNMoney Brexit jobs tracker The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points next Thursday, part of a bid to control inflation.The move would benefit savers, who have for years seen paltry returns on their deposits.But it would also make borrowing more expensive for consumers who are facing tighter household budgets."While any interest rate hikes would be limited and gradual, even small increases could cause problems for many consumers given high borrowing levels," said Howard Archer, an economic adviser to EY .
Harvard study: Employers are making it harder to hire:::::Imagine applying for a job that requires a college degree, even though the employee currently doing the same work doesn't have one.But that's exactly the situation many job seekers find themselves in -- and companies may be shooting themselves in the foot in the process.Employers are increasingly demanding that applicants have better qualifications than the person already doing the same job, according to a new study published Tuesday by Harvard Business School professor Joseph Fuller.This trend means that otherwise qualified workers are missing out on good jobs.It also costs companies more in salaries and comes as America has 6.1 million job openings -- a number that's near a record high."By raising the bar academically, employers are often hurting their own economics and slamming the door on the opportunity to give a good-paying job to an increasing number of Americans," says Fuller.Related: This is the biggest mystery in the U.S. economy Businesses routinely say they are having trouble finding skilled or available workers, according to surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve.The manufacturing sector in particular has reported severe labor shortages.But factory bosses have raised the bar for job applicants.For example, 67% of the job postings in 2015 for supervisors of production workers required a college degree.But only 16% of the existing supervisors actually had a college education.Fuller argues that this trend is a key undercurrent in the broader debate about wage inequality.Workers without college degrees increasingly have fewer job options even though they may have the skills for a better-paying gig.Related: Job training saved her life In total, the bar has been raised on 6.2 million jobs that didn't previously require a college degree, according to the study, which was done in partnership with consulting giant Accenture, Grads of Life -- a nonprofit that connects employers to Opportunity Youth -- and Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based data firm.Researchers focused on "middle skill" jobs -- those that require more than a high diploma but less than a 4-year college degree.They found that employers increasingly demanded a college degree because the job skills for a particular position rapidly changed and companies preferred to not pay for job training.But hiring college grads for jobs that non-college grads can do carries a litany of hidden costs, according to the study.For one, the majority of employers paid as much as 30% more to hire an applicant with a college education instead of an applicant without a 4-year degree.Companies also suffered from high turnover rates and long periods of time with unfilled jobs.Related: Holiday hiring is getting more difficult for retailers And people searching for work -- particularly supervisors, clerks, inspectors and secretaries -- have suffered too.The majority of the 600 businesses surveyed admitted that demanding a 4-year degree excludes some applicants.Some firms create online job application sites that automatically weed out applications without a college degree."Even workers who have relevant experience are excluded," said Fuller, who examined 26 million job postings, in the study.Fuller recommends companies partner with local community colleges or job training centers to better prepare young workers or give middle-aged workers new, relevant skills.He also suggested in the report that employers remove automatic filters in their online job applications and use a more customized vetting process that includes people who have not graduated from college.
Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico power contract:::::A small Montana utility firm with ties to the Trump administration has won a major multimillion-dollar contract to help restore large portions of Puerto Rico's crippled electrical grid.Whitefish Energy, a two-year old electrical utility firm, announced last week it secured a $300 million contract from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to repair and reconstruct parts of the island's electrical infrastructure.This is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts on the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.The deal surpassed a six-month contract worth $240 million to Fluor Corp. from the Army Corps of Engineers to help bring power back to the island and a $35.1 million contract to Weston Solutions to provide two generators for temporary power to the city of San Juan.The arrangement has raised a few eyebrows among Democrats given that Whitefish only had two employees the day Hurricane Maria hit.Already, Whitefish has scaled up to 300 employees in Puerto Rico -- and it says 700 more are on the way.Such quick growth is typical among utility firms when they are awarded large contracts.On Tuesday, both a House and a Senate committee called for a review into the Whitefish contract.Related: San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over power contract "Today I am calling on the Government Accountability Office to investigate the circumstances surrounding the multi-million dollar contract awarded to Whitefish Energy -- a brand new company with two employees," said Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on Tuesday."The size and unknown details of this contract raises numerous questions," said Parish Braden, a spokesman for the House Committee on Natural Resources, which is also reviewing Whitefish's role in Puerto Rico.Others have questioned why PREPA did not choose a larger, more established utility."Congress needs to understand why the Whitefish contract was awarded and whether other, more cost-effective options were available," said Democratic Rep. Ral Grijalva from Arizona, in a statement Tuesday.PREPA's executive director, Ricardo Ramos, told reporters last week during a press conference the cash-strapped island chose Whitefish because it didn't require a big deposit upfront.The other unnamed contender wanted a $25 million down payment for the work, Ramos said."In that moment, we were not in a position to offer that collateral," said Ramos."The other company did not ask for a guarantee of payment."But some on Capitol Hill are concerned that Whitefish may have stood out for another reason.The tiny utility company is based in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.Both Zinke and Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski acknowledge knowing one another.Zinke's office described Whitefish as a "small town" with a population of roughly 6,000 people.One of the secretary's sons "joined a friend who worked a summer job at one their [Whitefish's] construction sites."Related: Relief group hits major hurdles getting aid to Puerto Rico Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce confirmed an Oct. 1 report by NBC Montana, which quoted Techmanski as saying he reached out to Zinke after winning the contract to help get resources to the island more quickly, But Luce told CNN that the company did not make any requests to the administration except for one after the contract was signed on Sept. 26."The secretary had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish getting the contract," he said.Zinke's office acknowledged they received an email from Techmanski, but said no one at the agency took any further action.On Tuesday, the spokeswoman for the Department of Interior told CNN Zinke played no role in securing the work for Whitefish in Puerto Rico.Techmanski, who has described the firm as specializing in "difficult and mountainous terrain projects," has downplayed any ties to the administration."All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN Friday, referring to a call from director Ramos."We called each other."Still, PREPA, a state-owned utility, chose to hire Whitefish rather than initiate agreements with other utilities to help recover from the natural disaster more quickly.The bankrupt utility, which is $9 billion in debt, could have requested aid after Maria through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.That's what Texas and Florida did after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Related: Workers are dangling from helicopters to fix Puerto Rico's power lines A PREPA representative did not respond to an email from CNN asking why the utility didn't activate the mutual-aid network.On Monday, Rep. Nydia Velzquez -- a New York Democrat -- sent a letter to the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency raising questions on the handling of such contracts to restore power and water to the crippled island."Due to the island's current state of affairs, there is a legitimate and unquestionable need to expedite the process of restoring power and water for the residents in Puerto Rico," Velzquez wrote in the letter."However, such an accelerated procurement process should not be without sufficient safeguards and proper oversight mechanisms."
Canada and Mexico prepare for life without NAFTA:::::Canada and Mexico are exploring new trade ties as talks with the United States have turned gloomy.Officials from the two nations are meeting with counterparts from Peru and Chile for the first time in Colombia this week to discuss a potential trade deal.Canadian officials hinted that the talks may be a message to President Trump and the U.S.The meeting in Colombia "sends a strong signal to the world on the importance of free trade to increase growth and prosperity," Canada's Ministry of International Trade said in a statement.That comment comes days after the renegotiation of NAFTA -- the pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico -- took a sharp turn south last week.Talks are expected to continue into 2018.Trump administration officials introduced two major proposals -- one about auto manufacturing and a sunset clause for NAFTA -- that were swiftly rebuked by Mexican and Canadian negotiators.There has been no progress on those divisive issues and President Trump routinely threatens to pull out of NAFTA.Related: Canada's Freeland on NAFTA: 'It's easy to take us for granted.'Canada is now talking tough."Canada is kind of like the girl next door.It's easy to take us for granted," Chrystia Freeland, Canada's minister of foreign affairs, told CNN on Sunday."These [NAFTA] negotiations are really important not just for Canadians, but for Americans."Still, it's important to note that Canada sent Francois-Philippe Champagne, its minister of international trade, to Colombia this week -- not Freeland.Champagne's office denied that the talks in Colombia were a warning shot directly at Trump.But the meeting in Colombia is a little odd.Canada already has free trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia.Those four nations make up the Pacific Alliance, a group that promotes free trade in Latin America.Related: If Trump kills NAFTA, farmers, bars and factories lose jobs Nonetheless, experts say now is as good a time as ever for Canada to talk up the benefits of free trade with other nations considering what's going on with NAFTA."Having seen the talks sour in the latest stage of negotiations, we've now seen a reaction from Canada about talking up the importance of free trade, integration, globalism," says Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.But Shearing added "there's a growing sense that this may not happen" and that "the U.S. might end up walking away" from NAFTA.For its part, Mexico is looking elsewhere too.It's renegotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union, shoring up trade ties with Argentina and Brazil, and warming up to the idea of a deal with China.Related: Mexico and Canada slam U.S. proposals for NAFTA Talk aside, it will be difficult for either Mexico or Canada to shift its trade away from the United States.About 80% of Mexico's exports go north of the border, and the United States is Canada's top trading partner.Supply chains run across North America.Business between Canada and Latin America is quite small too.For example, Canada and Colombia traded about $1 billion in goods in the year ending in June, according to Panjiva, a global trade research firm.Trade between the U.S. and Canada last year totaled $627 billion.Some doubt Trump would even care if Canada were trying to fire back at his threat to pull out of NAFTA."I can't see President Trump giving two hoots what Canada is up to in South America," says Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva.
Relief groups hit major hurdles getting aid to Puerto Rico:::::Chicago is a long way away from Utuado and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.But Julian Seda is trying to get 68,000 pounds of donated supplies to these and other remote towns, as fast as he can -- and with as little official involvement as possible."The government has their hands full," said Seda, who leads the Chicago chapter of a group called Puerto Rico Rising that formed after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.Instead of raising money for the Red Cross or requesting help from the National Guard, the group found a private shipping company with operations in Chicago and Puerto Rico willing to ferry donations by boat for free to warehouses it owns on the island.The organization, which is currently in the process of obtaining non-profit status, then distributes the supplies.That way, it avoids the government inspections at the port and "all the bureaucracy that has become a bottleneck," Seda said.Nevertheless, the ad hoc group's capacity to bring relief is limited; it has stopped collecting donations until it finds a way to transport the next load.Seda's group is one of dozens of organizations that are running into enormous logistical hurdles while trying to help Puerto Rico.Disaster management experts say that the citizen response has been extraordinary, as Puerto Rico's diaspora of nearly 5.4 million watch in frustration while relief workers struggle to move supplies like food, water and medicine to those in need throughout the island.Related: Doctors in Puerto Rico: 'Reality here is post-apocalyptic' Transporting goods from church basements and high school auditoriums to an island more than 1,000 miles off the U.S. coastline, with already crumbling infrastructure and little to no cell service, has proven to be a major challenge.Puerto Rican leaders say they haven't gotten enough help from the federal and state governments, which have assets like planes and personnel that could be used to deliver aid.Transportation companies have made in-kind donations and big names like Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda have funded charter flights.But the need is far from satisfied.Meanwhile, volunteers say, the slow speed of road clearing and power restoration have made it more difficult to reach remote communities.There are currently 13,600 active duty and National Guard troops on the island, but many say that's not enough."It shouldn't be up to the handful of Puerto Rican millionaires in this country to be the U.S. Air Force and FEMA," said Ohio state Rep. Dan Ramos, who represents the heavily Puerto Rican town of Lorain.Organizers of the New York Puerto Rican Day Parade received semi trucks full of food, water and clothing from other parade organizations in places like Hartford and Cleveland.But they sat in warehouses, until leaders could arrange transportation."It has been a yeoman's task to figure this out," said Lorraine Cortes Vasquez, who chairs the New York parade's board of directors.Finally, she said, the National Guard took their first shipment, and JetBlue took some of their supplies as well.Experts typically recommend that people who want to help during disasters send money, which can then be used to buy and transport supplies from points closer to people who need them.But once goods have been collected, nobody wants to waste them.Miami nightlife impresario Michael Capponi runs the Global Empowerment Mission, which started after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.After Maria, the group coordinated some 50 flights chartered by celebrities like Will Smith and reality TV personality Bethenny Frankel.They've procured a 100,000 square foot warehouse to store and sort 15 million pounds of donations, some of which had to be retrieved from small-scale drives all over the country.Related: Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous' lines Capponi acknowledged that it would be "100 percent more efficient" to raise money than collect physical goods.Later on, money can also be used to buy goods in the disaster zone, which puts money back into the local economy."The problem is," Capponi said, "we can't let all that stuff sit in the U.S." So, he continues to send trucks to pick it up.Still, some groups are bypassing the messy process of taking physical donations entirely.PRxPR, a group formed by Puerto Rican business leaders, has raised $530,000 to date.It has been parceling out small grants to individuals and organizations on the island for urgent priorities like generators and water filters, if they can be found in stores.But distributing those goods to the people who need them remains difficult."You get a private cargo plane landing in the Aguadilla airport, and when that plane lands, is that there's not enough personnel to help unload the plane," said PRxPR co-founder Carmen Baez of the groups flying aid in."There's not enough personnel to guard the merchandise, to load the trucks, to drive the trucks to where they're needed."This was a particular problem at the Port of San Juan, where pallets of aid sat uncollected for days, in large part because drivers couldn't make the journey to pick up supplies.Puerto Rican groups with local ties had an easier time.Puerto Rican Agenda, a 22-year-old community organization in Chicago, flew aid into Puerto Rico using two planes donated by United.Omar Torres-Kortright, a member of the group, says local politicians like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz helped make sure transportation was available at the airport and paperwork didn't hold anything up.Related: Caribbean tourism faces long road to recovery "As long as our shipments are directed to municipal leaders like her, we do cut through the red tape," said Torres-Kortright."The mayor of San Juan goes directly to the airport with her trucks, says 'That's my plane, it's my stuff,' and distributes it."The groups that have mobilized in the wake of Maria know their efforts won't be enough so they're pushing for policy measures, like forgiveness of the island's enormous debt, and an exemption from the Jones Act, which only permits shipping to the island from other U.S. ports to be carried out by U.S. vessels.Javier Ferrer, who runs Houston's Puerto Rican and Cuban Festival, says that a Norwegian company offered to send a ship from New Orleans to San Juan with 53 containers of aid a few days after the storm.But by the time the White House announced a 10-day break in enforcement of the Jones Act, it would have been too late to get the ship loaded and out to the island."That law needs to be lifted -- not temporarily, but permanently," Ferrer said.The Hispanic Federation, which has raised more than $14 million for Puerto Rico and is still chartering planes to send aid, is ramping up calls for a more robust effort from Washington."It's been tremendously frustrating, to say the least, to see the lack of adequate response from our federal government," said Hispanic Federation president Jose Calderon."There's only so much that the diaspora can do."
Saudi Arabia wants foreign help in its massive economic overhaul:::::The kingdom is open for business.That's the message in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where some of the world's top business leaders are gathering this week.The Arab nation is holding a big investment conference as it pursues an aggressive economic overhaul to reduce its dependence on oil.HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver, IMF chief Christine Lagarde and SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son will attend, according to the conference website.The country's reform plan, spearheaded by its ambitious young crown prince, includes increasing foreign investment and selling a stake in its giant state oil company.A year and a half into the efforts, officials have made progress on some parts of the plan -- known as Vision 2030 -- but also flip-flopped on others.The government has cut some subsidies, announced new taxes and lifted a controversial ban on women driving.It also tapped global bond markets three times in less than a year, borrowing billions to balance its books.The crash in world oil prices in 2014 and 2015 had left a huge hole in the kingdom's budget.It reported deficits of $100 billion in 2015 and $71 billion last year.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy The man behind the push to modernize the conservative kingdom, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is expected to give a rare public speech on Tuesday."There's no doubt that [he] understands the challenge," said Robin Niblett, director of think tank Chatham House."You need the energy of a new generation" to confront "a social structure that is reliant upon government handouts, low tax, non-work," he added.Some targets already slipping But Saudi Arabia has backpedaled on a number of targets.In April, it rolled back wage and benefit cuts imposed on top ministers and other public workers.It's also revising part of the broader strategy that sets specific targets for government bodies to meet by 2020.The Saudi government gave few details about the changes and didn't state whether new targets would be introduced."I don't care particularly if some of the targets and the time lines slip.They were always ambitious," Niblett said.Questions over $100 billion IPO One of the most high-profile parts of the plan -- the planned IPO of the biggest oil company in the world, Saudi Aramco -- is drawing a lot of the attention.Saudi officials have said they expect the IPO to value Aramco at around $2 trillion.If the market agrees, selling just 5% would raise $100 billion -- four times as much as Alibaba (BABA, Tech30)'s IPO in 2014, which is the largest to date.Aramco has disputed recent media reports suggesting uncertainty over its mammoth stock market listing and where it might happen.It insisted earlier this month that its IPO plan is still "on track" for next year.FT report on Saudi Aramco IPO is entirely speculative.All listing venues under review for optimal decision,IPO process is on track for 2018 aramco | (@Saudi_Aramco) October 14, 2017 The money the government aims to raise from the listing are seen as crucial for funding its broader plans to revamp the national economy, which include measures like increasing the role of women and the development of an entertainment industry.Saudi Arabia wants to increase the participation rate of women in its workforce from 22% to 30% by 2030.Related: Saudi Arabia is investing billions in fun There have been some high-profile examples of progress: three top jobs in finance, including the head of the stock exchange, were recently filled by women.But at 33%, the unemployment rate for women is far higher than the national average of about 13%.Painful transition Pushing through major changes is tough in an economy that's already struggling.The International Monetary Fund estimates that Saudi economic growth will be "close to zero" this year.But it also warned the government shouldn't wait too long to tackle key reforms."Without growth support coming in, it's difficult to progress," said Monica Malek, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.Saudi officials insist their country is prepared for the challenges."No pain, no gain is very much at play here," Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih told CNNMoney in May."The Saudi population is ready for the long haul."-- John Defterios contributed to this report.
CVS reportedly in talks to buy Aetna:::::CVS and Aetna are said to be weighing a massive tie-up.The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that CVS Health (CVS) is in talks to acquire the health insurer for $66 billion.The story, which posted just before the market close, caused Aetna (AET) shares to skyrocket as much as 12%.Shares of CVS fell almost 3% after hours.Both companies declined to comment on market "rumors."If the merger is approved and goes through, it would reshape the health care industry.CVS Health controls a massive drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits management system, while Aetna is one of the nation's largest insurers.Related: Here's what you'll pay for Obamacare in 2018 But mergers involving health insurance companies have run into roadblocks in the recent past.In 2015, Aetna and Humana announced a $34 billion merger, while Anthem agreed to acquire Cigna for $54 billion.Both deals were called off in February after they were targeted by the Justice Department over antitrust concerns and blocked by federal judges.
A bond market freakout could derail the rally in stocks:::::Historically low interest rates are a critical ingredient in the remarkable stock market rally.All that easy money has fanned the flames by keeping borrowing costs low and forcing investors to take a gamble on risky stocks because bonds hardly make any money.But what if the recipe of steady economic growth and extremely low rates suddenly changed?A rapid spike in interest rates could disrupt or even derail the relentless run on Wall Street.Investors were dealt a fresh reminder of the market's addiction to ultra-low rates this week as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.44%, the highest since March.The closely watched Treasury rate, which moves opposite the price, is up dramatically from 2.27% on October 16.The selloff in bonds has been driven in part by expectations for faster growth and concerns that President Trump's choice to lead the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively than Janet Yellen would.Some also worry that Trump's proposed tax overhaul could overheat the economy.The sudden move in rates led star bond investor Jeff Gundlach to warn on Twitter that "obituaries need to be written" for the 30-year bull market in bonds if the momentum doesn't reverse soon."The moment of truth has arrived," the billionaire said.Mike LaBella, portfolio manager at QS Investors, believes rates are still low enough to keep the party going in the stock market."But if rates climb at this accelerated pace, that could potentially hinder this recovery.Well above 3% or closer to 4% would definitely be alarming," LaBella said.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Of course, it's way too early to say the great bull market in bonds is done.And steadily rising interest rates aren't a bad thing.If anything, investors alarmed by how long rates have remained extremely low would welcome a return to normalcy.As would those who own shares of banks, which have struggled to make money in the low-rate environment.That's why Wall Street has largely applauded the Federal Reserve's efforts to gradually raise interest rates."The economy can absorb slowly rising interest rates," said Art Hogan, chief equity strategist at Wunderlich Securities.But he conceded that the recent spike is "not gradual" and has forced investors to "sit up and take notice."It's no secret that ultra-low rates helped fuel the bull market in stocks.Bond returns are so low that investors are willing to accept more risk in stocks, even stocks that are very, very expensive by historical standards.After getting accustomed to low rates for nearly a decade, investors may be caught off guard by a sudden spike in rates.The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research published a heat map this week identifying weaknesses in the U.S. financial system.Just one of the map's six categories flashed red, signaling high vulnerability: market risk.Within that category, the report indicated that the biggest risk is that the market is unprepared for higher rates.Related: Caution: U.S. stocks have rarely been this expensive Trump's effort to overhaul the tax system could push rates higher.If it gets through Congress, tax reform could spook the bond market by adding to the federal deficit or overstimulating a healthy economy.And the bond market could sell off if the European Central Bank and the Fed unwind their emergency bond-buying programs more aggressively than investors have been anticipating.Yet Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital, thinks it's "silly" to predict the end of the bond bull market because Treasury rates remain very low, hovering just above their five-year average.And bond bulls believe demand will stay high because the population of the world's major economies is getting older, and those people want safe, steady income."That's a trend that isn't ending anytime soon," LeBas said.If that's true, rising rates may pose a risk to the stock market, but perhaps not an imminent one.
Not America's beer? Budweiser sales down in U.S.:::::This Bud's not for you?Anheuser-Busch InBev, the owner of Budweiser, Bud Light and Stella Artois, said that beer sales in the U.S. fell 5.6% in the third quarter.Those are shockingly bad numbers when you consider that they came during the start of the football season and as the baseball pennant races were heating up with teams getting ready for the playoffs.Shares of BUD fell 2% on the news.It's also a sign that A-B InBev's push to brand Budweiser beer as "America" on bottles and cans during what the company called its "American Summer" may have failed to catch on with suds-loving consumers.A-B InBev said that market share for Budweiser and the lower calorie Bud Light fell in the U.S. during the quarter.Beer snobs in the U.S. are increasingly choosing fancier and pricier craft brews over established brands like Bud.AB-In Bev has recognized this and has been on a microbrew shopping spree over the past few years, scooping up popular brands like Goose Island, 10 Barrel Brewing and Blue Point.The company also has a significant minority stake in Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), the publicly traded firm that owns the Kona, Redhook and Widmer Brothers brands of beer.Related: Corona time!Beer owner's sales soar But AB-In Bev's growth in the craft segment isn't enough to offset the declines in its top brands just yet.Still, it wasn't all bad news for the company.A-B InBev said that other established brands, namely Michelob Ultra, Busch and Stella Artois, were growing in the U.S. and helping to pick up the slack for the weaker Bud and Bud Light sales.Overall revenues were up globally in the quarter thanks to growth in China, South Korea, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.AB-In Bev is also cutting costs thanks to its more than $100 billion merger with SABMiller last year.And even though BUD stock was down Thursday on the weak U.S. sales, the brewer's shares are still up 13% this year -- better than nearly all its rivals.Boston Beer (SAM), the owner of Sam Adams.is up just 5% while Molson Coors (TAP) is down 17%.But the American-listed shares of Heineken (HEINY) are up nearly 30% in 2017 while Constellation Brands (STZ), which sells Corona in the U.S., is up almost 40%.
Buffalo Wild Wings' stock takes off after going boneless:::::Whether you like it or not, Buffalo Wild Wings is winning with boneless chicken wings.The chain's popular Tuesday "buy one, get one free" deal on traditional bone-in wings has been a big draw for Buffalo Wild Wings' customers, but it was eating into the company's bottom line.Costs for traditional wings have spiked, rising more than 25% in the past year.So Wild Wings decided to switch the Tuesday deal to lower-cost boneless wings as a savings measure.Customers weren't necessarily digging the move: sales at restaurants that were open at the same time last year fell more than 2% after the change.But it made good business sense, since Buffalo Wild Wings was able to find some important savings.That's why the company says the boneless wings are here to stay, at least for now."The recent Tuesday promotion shift from traditional to boneless wings at company-owned restaurants will continue to improve cost of sales while traditional wing prices remain elevated," CEO Sally Smith said in a prepared statement on Tuesday.Overall, the company's profit continued its downward slide.Earnings fell 20% from the same quarter in 2016, mostly because customers still have a strong taste for chicken wings with bones in them.Investors were expecting that.Actually, Wall Street analysts' forecasts were far too pessimistic.The restaurant chain's profit smashed expectations.Investors also cheered Buffalo Wild Wings raising its financial outlook for the rest of the year.Shares of Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) surged 18% on Wednesday.Related: Chipotle's profit ravaged by hurricanes, hack and high avocado prices Still, it has been a rocky year for the company.Its stock is down 23% this year due to slumping sales and profit and an activist investor campaign from a group that wanted to reshape the chain.Smith announced over the summer that she would step down after 21 years as CEO.Like many other retailers and restaurants, Wild Wings weathered the impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma during the quarter.It was forced to close 71 restaurants because of the storms, costing the company nearly $3 million in sales.One particularly good sign: Declining NFL ratings aren't hitting Wild Wings so far.The company said on an conference call with investors that it doesn't expect the viewership drop to hurt sales.
8 stocks that could cash in on Trump's tax overhaul:::::Wall Street is fired up about President Trump's push to overhaul the corporate tax system.The relentless rally in the stock market has been powered by strong economic growth, low interest rates and hopes that tax cuts will turbocharge Corporate America's already healthy bottom line.But some stocks may benefit more than others from changes to the tax code.For instance, companies that already pay low corporate tax rates, like Pepsi (PEP), may not cash in as much as those that pay Uncle Sam a much higher rate, like Under Armour (UA).Companies pay different rates because of loopholes, tax reduction strategies and how much money they make overseas.Much will depend on the details, most of which are still being hammered out in Congress and the White House.And there's no guarantee tax reform will happen at all.But there's such intense interest in the negotiations that you can buy and sell a basket of stocks, the EventShares U.S. Tax Reform Fund (TAXR), that could win big if the GOP tax framework becomes reality."If a vote passes, we think it has a multi-year, even decade-long, impact," said Ben Phillips, a former Goldman Sachs exec who is now chief investment officer of EventShares.Rather than simply holding low-tax stocks, this actively managed ETF includes nearly three dozen companies that Phillips believes could reap bigger rewards from tax reform than Wall Street realizes.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Here are a handful of the stocks this ETF is betting will win if tax reform happens: Ford: Trump's plan calls for slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.That means Ford (F) could afford to sell its cars overseas at lower prices, undercutting competitors.Phillips pointed out that Ford makes more cars inside the United States than any other automaker.Chipotle: The Mexican food chain is grappling with slower sales and rising expenses in the wake of its food safety problems.Chipotle (CMG) is also among the highest tax payers in the S&P 500, with an effective rate north of 40% in 2016, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Denny's: It's another struggling fast food giant with a hefty tax bill.Phillips argues that Denny's (DENN) stock, which is flat this year, doesn't yet reflect the potential benefits of an overhaul.CarMax: The GOP tax plan would allow companies to immediately write off, or expense, the cost of new investments.That would be critical for companies like CarMax (KMX), a used-car retailers, that spend a lot of money each year on things like opening new stores.Southwest Airlines: Like other airlines, Southwest (LUV) spends billions each year to upgrade its fleet and buy new jets.Southwest pays a lot in taxes each year, too.Its effective tax rate was nearly 37% last year.AK Steel: Phillips believes this company stands to benefit in two ways.Not only does AK Steel (AKS) have heavy capital spending that could be written off under the GOP plan, but its exports to Europe and Canada could grow faster thanks to a tax break.Phillips 66: The fund has very few energy companies.One is Phillips 66 (PSX), which is known as Warren Buffett's favorite oil company because Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is its biggest shareholder.Tax cuts could make Phillips 66 and other oil refiners more competitive.W.W. Grainger: It's been a terrible year for W.W. Grainger.(GWW) The distributor of repair and maintenance tools has lost 17% of its value.But W.W. Grainger could win big from corporate tax cuts.The company paid an effective tax rate of nearly 38% last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Deutsche Boerse CEO resigns amid insider trading probe:::::The chief executive of German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse has resigned amid an investigation into potential insider trading.The company's board announced Carsten Kengeter's departure on Thursday, just days after a German court turned down a settlement offer that would have closed the investigation.Prosecutors in Frankfurt have been probing Kengeter's purchase of Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF) shares worth 4.5 million ($5.3 million) in December 2015, just weeks before his firm began merger talks with the London Stock Exchange (LNSTY).Plans to combine the companies were announced in February 2016, and shares in both firms soared as a result.The deal was blocked by the European Union's competition watchdog in March.Deutsche Boerse said earlier this year that Kengeter was allowed to buy the shares as part his official remuneration program, which was approved by its supervisory board.The board, which had been publicly supportive of Kengeter, said Thursday that it had accepted his resignation with "deep regret."He will leave his post at the end of 2017.Deutsche Boerse said in September that it had agreed a 10.5 million ($12.3 million) settlement with prosecutors that would have closed the investigation.The deal required Kengeter to personally pay an additional 500,000 ($585,000).But the company said the judge overseeing the case rejected the settlement.A representative for the prosecutor's office declined to comment on Thursday.
Coming soon to a theater near you: Surge pricing for movies:::::Would you go see "Geostorm "or "The Snowman" -- two box office duds that were savaged by critics and have abysmal scores on Rotten Tomatoes -- if you didn't have to pay full price to watch them in an empty theater?Regal Cinemas (RGC), one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States, is hoping you might.The company will experiment with charging more for tickets during peak movie times and less at times when attendance tends to be lighter.Think of it as Uber-style surge pricing, but for movies.Regal, partnering with the online ticket service and app Atom Tickets, will try it in several markets next year.Regal CEO Amy Miles didn't say how many theaters would try it, what the prices would be or whether Regal might use such a model to charge different prices for hits and duds.But the new pricing plan, if successful, could be just what theater chains need.Shares of Regal, competitors AMC (AMC), Cinemark (CNK), and big screen operator IMAX (IMAX) have all fallen this year because of poor box office sales.There's a big debate about whether the high cost of tickets -- not to mention popcorn, soda and other concession stand goodies -- are the industry's biggest problem.Related: Box office slump hurting AMC theaters and its rivals That might be part of it, and it's the reason another company has recently launched a service called MoviePass that lets people see as many movies as they want for a monthly subscription.In other words, Netflix for movie theaters.The big chains are cautiously embracing it.Miles said in an earnings conference call with analysts Tuesday that Regal is happy to sell tickets to MoviePass at full price, and MoviePass can then offer those tickets to its customers at whatever price it wants.But Miles ruled out any partnership that would give MoviePass access to lower-priced tickets."We will take a wait-and-see approach and we're going to continue to enjoy the benefits of the full priced movie tickets that we're receiving for all MoviePass customers," Miles said."What we will not entertain is the discounted ticket arrangement or any participation in our concession sales as part of the arrangement."Related: Can MoviePass save the multiplex?Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) itself is a problem for the movie theaters: Why go out and see a mediocre movie when you can sit on the couch and binge the second season of "Stranger Things" instead?Netflix, along with Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Hulu and top cable networks have splurged on big budget shows with top actors and directors.It's why many call this the golden age of television, or peak TV.Still, there's hope for movie theaters.It's a simple formula: People will put down their phones and go the multiplex when there's something good to see.That was clearly the case with the recent horror movie smash hit "It."The superhero movies "Justice League" and "Thor: Ragnarok" are coming out in November, and the eagerly awaited next installment in the Star Wars saga, "The Last Jedi," is due out just before Christmas.So there's a good chance people will stop watching Netflix long enough to go spend two hours escaping reality in a movie theater.
ECB: Europe's stimulus program is slimming down:::::Europe's massive stimulus program is slimming down.The European Central Bank announced Thursday that it will reduce the scale of its bond buying program in January 2018.As part of the program, which began in March 2015, the ECB has been purchasing 60 billion ($71 billion) worth of government bonds and other assets each month.At times, the purchases reached 80 billion ($94 billion) per month.Starting next year, the buys will be slashed to 30 billion ($35 billion) per month.However, the central bank also said the purchases would continue at that pace deep into 2018.The bank indicated the program would run at its reduced level until at least September -- but longer if needed.The program -- a form of quantitative easing -- has helped support the economy by keeping borrowing costs low for households and businesses.That, in turn, has increased spending and helped spur economic growth.Investors reacted to the bank's announcement by pushing the euro lower.Stock markets remained in positive territory."The announcement has been well signaled by the central bank ... with the aim of causing as little disturbance as possible for the markets," said Mihir Kapadia, CEO of financial services firm Sun Global Investments.A range of quantitative easing programs were put into action after the global financial crisis.The Federal Reserve purchased $4.5 trillion in investments over the years to support the U.S. economy.Central banks in the U.K. and Japan deployed similar measures of their own.European economies have stabilized since the stimulus program was launched.The average annual growth rate in the eurozone hit 2.3% in the latest quarter, and formerly troubled Spain and Portugal are now growing at around 3%.Related: Europeans really want to work at Google Draghi said in a news conference that he was pleased by "unabated growth momentum" in Europe, but noted that it was the result of the central bank's "ample" support.He said that continuing the bond-buying program -- without a definitive end date -- would help keep the economy on track.The ECB boss has other issues to worry about: inflation remains below the central bank's 2% target at 1.5%.Unemployment is also stubbornly high.The jobless rate in Greece is above 20% and Spanish unemployment sits just above 17%.
South Korea's economy and markets are flying high despite tensions:::::Tensions over North Korea may be causing alarm around the world, but they're not weighing heavily on its southern neighbor's economy and stock market.The South Korean economy grew at its fastest rate in seven years in the third quarter, according to government data released Thursday.Experts say momentum will hold despite saber-rattling between Kim Jong Un and President Trump."Provided conflict is avoided, South Korea should continue to grow strongly over the coming year," analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a research note.They predict South Korea will benefit from healthy global trade, rising government spending and a big hike in the country's minimum wage.Related: South Korea does a sudden U-turn on nuclear power Investors are showing optimism about South Korean companies, too.The benchmark Kospi index has soared to record highs recently and is up more than 22% since the start of the year.That beats the Nasdaq and the Dow over the same period.The South Korean index has been helped by heavyweight stock Samsung Electronics, which has shrugged off last year's Galaxy Note 7 debacle and the corruption conviction of its de facto leader to post a gain of more than 45% in 2017.Trump and Kim's bellicose threats have weighed on markets from time to time this year, only for them to bounce back.Analysts say that brinkmanship over North Korea is nothing new for investors, who have seen repeated flare-ups on the Korean peninsula.But the situation has had real consequences.The deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea angered China, the country's biggest trading partner, resulting in a sharp drop in Chinese tourists and difficulties for South Korean firms operating inside China.Related: China can squeeze its neighbors when it wants.Ask South Korea The boycott by Chinese tourists is hurting South Korea, but other industries like electronics are more than making up for it.The country's economy expanded 1.4% in the third quarter, compared with the previous three months of the year.That comfortably beat economists' forecasts and was propelled by a 6.1% jump in exports.The main problem looming over the economy is the high level of household debt, according to the Capital Economics analysts.But they expect a planned 16% increase in the minimum wage next year to prop up spending by consumers.
Could GE get booted from the Dow after 110 years?:::::Could the Dow show GE the door?Shares of General Electric (GE) keep falling after the company reported lousy earnings last week.GE is down more than 30% this year, easily the worst performer of the 30 companies in the venerable stock average.It's already sold NBC and GE Capital, and has even put its light bulb business on the block.There's talk that new CEO John Flannery could unload even more assets.Now GE faces a question that would have been inconceivable not long ago -- whether it should lose its blue-chip status after 110 uninterrupted years as a Dow component.CNBC, Reuters and MarketWatch have all asked whether GE's days in the Dow could, or should, be numbered.(Marketwatch is owned by News Corp.'s (NWSA) Dow Jones, but the committee that selects Dow stocks is run by S&P Global (SPGI), the same company that picks the stocks for the S&P 500.)GE was one of the first components when the Dow debuted in 1897.Back then, the average included just a dozen companies.GE was removed and added back several times.It returned to the Dow in 1907 and has been there ever since.Related: GE's nightmare just got worse Here's why GE could be in real danger of getting booted again.Unlike the S&P 500 and most other major market barometers, the Dow is weighted by stock price, not market value.And even though GE isn't the smallest company in the average -- not even close -- it has the lowest stock price, about $21.40 a share.The folks running the Dow like to have no more than a 10-to-1 ratio between the stock with the highest price and the stock with the lowest.Boeing (BA) trades at about $258 a share -- nearly 12 times the price of GE.Goldman Sachs (GS) and 3M (MMM) also trade at more than 10 times higher.Still, the people who manage the Dow are reluctant to make big changes willy-nilly.Technically, a new company was added to the Dow just this summer.And it's even named Dow.DowDuPont (DWDP) joined after Dow Chemical merged with DuPont, an existing Dow component.But the last time the Dow made a real major move was more than two years ago, when Apple (AAPL, Tech30) was added and AT&T (T, Tech30) was removed.(AT&T is buying CNN parent company Time Warner (TWX).)Related: What's wrong with GE?An American icon is in 'crisis' The most recent change before that was in September 2013, when Alcoa (AA), Bank of America (BAC) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) were removed and replaced by Goldman Sachs, Nike (NKE) and Visa (V).By way of comparison, stocks are added to and dropped from the S&P 500 much more often -- usually because a company has been bought or has become too small.David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee for S&P Dow Jones Indices, had no comment about the speculation surrounding GE being removed from the Dow.GE was not immediately available for comment.But it's worth noting that while GE's ever-shrinking stock price may not be bringing good things to life for investors, GE is not the smallest company in the Dow by market value.GE has a market value of about $185 billion, higher than Merck (MRK), Disney (DIS), IBM (IBM, Tech30), Nike and 10 other Dow components.The smallest Dow company -- insurance firm Travelers (TRV) -- is worth just $36 billion.Related: GE vice chair Beth Comstock is stepping down But GE's problems may remind people of other erstwhile titans of American commerce who were once in the Dow -- companies like Sears (SHLD), Eastman Kodak (KODK), the defunct Bethlehem Steel and Woolworth, which now is known as Foot Locker (FL).So could GE really be kicked out of the Dow?It's possible.But don't bank on it just yet.It's true that the Dow is not meant to be a representation of just the largest companies.If that were the case, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) would be in.And yes, GE is a shell of its former self.But what's left is a large industrial company with $125 billion in annual sales.So to paraphrase Mark Twain -- who was still alive when GE joined the Dow -- the rumors of its demise may be greatly exaggerated.
Trump likes Yellen but wants to make his mark on the Fed:::::President Trump really likes Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen."I think she's terrific.We had a great talk," Trump told Fox Business in an interview aired on Wednesday.Trump met with Yellen last week, and he's still considering whom to nominate as the next leader of the Fed.He said Monday that he was "very, very close" to a decision but no definitive date has been set for the announcement."It won't be a big shock," he told Fox Business on Wednesday.Trump neither fully endorsed Yellen nor dismissed her chances of getting renominated.He hinted that the stock market's rise to record highs -- one of his favorite talking points -- was partially due to the Fed's monetary policy under Yellen's watch.The Dow recently crossed 23,000 points for the first time in history.Trump also credited himself for the stock market's success.Related: Trump keeps teasing imminent Fed Chair decision "We're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets," Trump told Fox Business, speaking of himself and Yellen.But Trump admitted he wants to put his own stamp on the Fed and its leadership.After all, Yellen was nominated by President Obama in 2013."In one way I have to say, you like to make your own mark ... which is maybe one of things that she's got a little bit against her," Trump added.Trump's comments on the nomination have changed day to day.In a separate interview with Fox, he hinted that Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor are frontrunners.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh is also a candidate.At a meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump did a "show of hands" poll for the next Fed chair in a closed-door meeting with Republicans.Some lawmakers told CNN that Taylor was apparently the most liked in the casual vote, but no official tally was made.Trump also asked Fox anchor Lou Dobbs in the interview on Wednesday who he would choose to be Fed Chair."I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping," Dobbs replied.
Saudi Arabia: 4 big takeaways from 'Davos in the Desert':::::More than 3,500 business leaders and government officials have flocked to Saudi Arabia for a conference dubbed "Davos in the Desert."Attendees were hungry for insights on where the major oil producer is headed.They were not disappointed.Here are four of the biggest takeaways from the summit in Riyadh: The crown prince Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the driving force behind sweeping economic changes in Saudi Arabia, made a rare appearance at the conference, addressing a huge audience of investors on Tuesday.The young crown prince had a message: We are open for business.He also delivered a warning to ultraconservatives, vowing to to destroy "extremist ideologies" and return to "a more moderate Islam.""We want to lead normal lives, lives where our religion and our traditions translate into tolerance, so that we coexist with the world and become part of the development of the world," he said.Related: Saudi Arabia is investing billions in fun It's a development that was welcomed by investors.Colony Capital chief executive Tom Barrack, who lived in the kingdom in the 1970s, said that these reforms may succeed where others failed."His approach is definitively the right one," Barrack said of the crown prince."What you've seen here in the last few days is a real commitment of tolerance," he added."We are going to create an environment for the West that will be transparent, secure, stable and understandable."A new mega-city The crown prince also unveiled NEOM, a $500 billion mega-city that will span three countries.The city will be powered entirely by regenerative energy, while also making use of automated driving technology and passenger drones.Wireless hi-speed internet will be free.Should it become reality, the development could become a major driver of tourism, an industry that is key to the crown prince's ambitious Vision 2030 program.The goal is to diversify the country's revenue and reduce what he once called an "addiction" to oil.It would also build stronger ties with neighbors Jordan and Egypt, whose territory would be included in the project.One major caveat: Saudi has previously announced several economic cities that have failed to attract the right investment, with many office spaces reduced to empty caverns in the desert.Massive investment Much of the change in Saudi Arabia is being funded by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF).The sovereign fund has contributed $45 billion to Softbank's Vision Fund, which is the world's largest technology investor.PIF has also poured $20 billion into a Blackstone infrastructure fund.Some fund managers and business titans attending the conference have privately expressed worries over the kingdom's ability to deliver on all of the projects built into Vision 2030.But the pace of new initiatives has only accelerated.On Wednesday, PIF said it plans to increase its assets under management to $400 billion by 2020.It wants to create 20,000 direct jobs and 256,000 jobs in construction."I'm sure they need and should be looking at domestic investments as well," said Joshua Friedman, co-CEO of Canyon Partners, "As they interact with the most sophisticated investors globally ...I'm sure they'll bring that sophistication to bear on their own markets."Related: The man leading Saudi Arabia's overhaul just got more powerful The world's biggest IPO One of the biggest remaining questions surrounds a partial sell-off of the kingdom's crown jewel, Saudi Aramco.Officials have said they expect the IPO to value the giant sate oil company at around $2 trillion.If the market agrees, selling just 5% would raise $100 billion.The debut has been scheduled for 2018, but there are doubts over its realization.Aramco has disputed recent media reports suggesting uncertainty.CEO Amin Nasser told CNNMoney in an interview that an IPO is on track for 2018, but he refused to define whether it will have an international listing."We looked at the different venues, which are New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo," he said."We are taking time for the shareholders [the ruling family] to look at all the data ... and then the decision where to list ... will come in due course."Economic regulation, foreign ownership laws, and strict Islamic laws have often deterred investors in the past.This time, investors are listening.
What's the best way to invest $100,000 in today's market?:::::I have $100,000 sitting in cash that I'd like to invest.What's the best way to do that in today's market?--R.B.Given today's gaseous stock valuations and concerns that this eight-and-a-half-year bull market might be getting a little long in the tooth, it's understandable why many investors are skittish about investing money in stocks.On the other hand, despite such worries the market continues (so far at least) to climb into record territory, which makes people reluctant to avoid stocks altogether for fear of missing out on gains.So what should you do if you have new money to invest -- whether it's a hundred grand, ten grand or for that matter any amount -- and you don't want to give up stocks' potential upside but you also don't want to get hit with losses you can't handle?Basically, you have three choices.The first is to try to time your entry into the market.So, for example, if you think this bull market still has room to run, you put your money into stocks, but stand ready to exit quickly when you're convinced the market is about to tumble.Conversely, if you think the chance of a big setback or full-fledged bear market is just too high at the moment, you hold your cash on the sidelines with the aim of buying in after a selloff when prices are lower.This strategy sounds great, but the problem is pulling it off.Since the market began its phenomenal surge back in early 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, there have been many times when soothsayers suggested the stock market, like Humpty-Dumpty, was headed for a great fall.In 2011, the downgrading of the rating of U.S. debt by Standard & Poor's was expected to be the catalyst for a significant setback.In the summer of 2016, pundits said Brexit would do the job.And then the election of Donald Trump was supposed to send the market into a tailspin.Apparently, the stock market didn't get the message because it continued to rise.That's not to say that at some point, some prediction of its demise won't be correct.It will.We pretty much know the market will eventually hit a wall.We just can't predict when that meltdown will come, any more than investors back in March of 2009 were able to discern that, after a 17-month slump during which stock prices fell nearly 60%, the market would rebound and prices would nearly quadruple over the following eight-plus years.Which means, to my mind at least, that timing your investments based on whether you believe the market is headed up or down is little more than a guessing game.Related: Should you shoot for higher returns by investing outside your 401(k)?The second option is dollar-cost-averaging, or investing your money gradually, say, over the course of a year or so rather than all at once.But while this strategy will provide some downside protection if your call about the market's direction is correct, it doesn't make much financial sense.One reason is that the stock market historically has had more up years than down, which means you're more likely to come out ahead investing your dough all at once rather than moving it from cash to stocks a bit at a time.But more importantly, if you already have a long-term investing strategy that includes investing in a mix of both stocks and bonds, then you're actually undermining that strategy by dollar-cost averaging and likely relegating yourself to inferior gains.Which brings us to the third, and I think most sensible, option, which is to set a mix of stocks and bonds that you'll be comfortable sticking with in good markets and bad and immediately investing any new money to reflect those proportions.Let's say, for example, that you have an investment portfolio of $500,000 and based on your tolerance for risk and the length of time you intend to keep your money invested, you decide that it makes sense to keep 60%, or $300,000, of your stash in stocks and 40%, or $200,000, in bonds.(If you want guidance on arriving at an appropriate mix, you can check out Vanguard's risk tolerance-asset allocation questionnaire.)And let's assume that you receive a windfall of $100,000.Rather than wait for the "right" time to invest your hundred grand or move it into your portfolio gradually, you would simply invest 60%, or $60,000, of your hundred grand in stocks and 40%, or $40,000 in bonds all at once, giving you a total portfolio of $600,000, of which $360,000 (60%) would be in stocks and $240,000 (40%) in bonds.In short, you would maintain the blend of stocks and bonds, or the mix of risk and reward, that you determined was right for you when you decided on an asset allocation of 60% stocks-40% bonds.If the amount of new money was very large relative to your current holdings -- say, it would double or nearly double the size of your portfolio -- you could conceivably decide to take more, or less, investing risk, in which case you would revise your overall stocks-bonds mix and invest the new funds based on your new mix.But aside from such an extreme situation, you would essentially invest any new money in a way that reflects your current allocation.Related: How to invest for lifetime income and long-term growth But, you may ask, what if stock market drops right after I do this?Won't I have taken a bigger hit than if I'd stayed in cash longer or invested my money gradually?The answer is yes, but all that would mean is that you guessed right this time about what the market would do.You lucked out.Had you guessed wrong (think back to all the times in recent years when experts warned of setbacks that never materialized), then the opposite would be true, and you would have unnecessarily missed out on gains.Besides, if you're really, really worried that you won't be able to handle a major downturn in the market or that a big setback might cause you to deplete your nest egg too soon, then that may be a sign that your current stocks-bonds allocation may be more aggressive than it should be, in which case you may need to revise it.The point, though, is that as long as we can't predict whether the market will take a major tumble or continue its ascent, the best we can do is settle on a mix of stocks and bonds that we'll be comfortable staying with whichever direction the market goes.In other words, the way you manage risk in your portfolio is by choosing an appropriate mix of stocks and bonds, not trying to figure out whether the market will melt down or heat up.So my advice is to come up with an asset allocation that you're confident you'll be able to stick with through good markets and bad, and then invest any new money in a way that reflects that mix.Remember too that to maintain your allocation over time as different parts of your portfolio earn different returns, you may also need to periodically rebalance your holdings to get back to your target allocation.But whatever you do, don't get into a guessing game about the market's direction.Over the long term, that's not a game you can consistently win.
Buy the world a Coke? Sales pop in U.S. and Asia:::::Coca-Cola's push to focus less on high-calorie drinks seems to be paying off.The beverage giant reported earnings and sales that topped forecasts on Wednesday and it was led by growth from its new Coca Cola Zero Sugar product as well as coffee and tea drinks, particularly in the United States.The company's overall revenues were dinged by Coke's decision to refranchise some of its bottling operations.But excluding that, sales rose 4% worldwide.Coke (KO) said that sales in North America were up 3% from a year ago.That may not sound like a great accomplishment but it's actually solid growth for a company of Coke's size.Plus, the U.S. beverage market is pretty saturated.Coke also said that its market share was up and that's a testament to both Coke's sales gains and a drop reported by its key rival.Pepsi (PEP) said earlier this month that its soft drink sales in North America actually fell slightly.Pepsi CFO Hugh Johnston told CNNMoney after its latest earnings report that the main reason for the slide was because the company focused more marketing efforts on newer, low-calorie products and less on core brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew.Interestingly, Coke said that sales volume for its Mountain Dew rival, Sprite, were up in the third quarter.Related: Coca-Cola replaces Coke Zero with new sugarless drink And another Coke competitor -- Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) -- posted weak sales on Wednesday, blaming the impact of recent hurricanes and earthquakes in Mexico for the sluggish performance.But Coke CEO James Quincey, who succeeded long-time chief executive Muhtar Kent earlier this year, said he was pleased with his company's results, particularly since they come while the company is "making substantial structural and cultural changes."Along those lines, Coke is making a bigger push beyond its core cola drinks.Coke is now partnering on coffee drinks from Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and McDonald's (MCD) that are sold in supermarkets -- a clear challenge to Starbucks (SBUX).Coke also announced earlier this month that it was buying the popular Mexican-based maker of sparkling water, Topo Chico.That move led to a big drop in the stock of LaCroix owner National Beverage (FIZZ).And National Beverage's CEO Nick Caporella put out a bizarre press release last week to defend the company's recent performance.The release concluded with this strange proclamation."If you have the opinion that I, Nick A. Caporella, am angrily exercised while extremely fortunate to be guiding FIZZ, your opinion is quite accurate!"National Beverage's iconic brands are the genuine essence ...of America."Patriotism" -- If Only We Could Bottle It!WE SPARKLE ...AMERICA SMILES!"Related: America loves fast food, soda and booze Coke, of course, doesn't self-promote in such a fashion.It doesn't have to, given how iconic the company is in the U.S.But Coke is also a global giant -- and its sales in emerging markets are gaining steam too.The company said Wednesday that another reason for its solid overall sales was due to a jump in revenue in China, India and South Korea.Coke shares fell slightly Wednesday despite the better than expected results.But the stock is still up 11% this year and is outperforming Pepsi and Dr Pepper Snapple.
What's wrong with Japan Inc?:::::Top Japanese companies are doing damage control once again.Industrial giant Kobe Steel is dealing with a global crisis this month after it owned up to falsifying data about products it sold to major brands like Boeing (BA) and Toyota (TM).And last week, Nissan halted production of cars for the Japanese market because of problems with its vehicle inspections.Long admired for their precision manufacturing, big Japanese firms are making headlines for embarrassing missteps.Even senior government officials are getting worried."They shake the credibility of Japan's manufacturing, which is valued for its high quality and safety," Transportation Minister Keiichi Ishii told reporters Friday after the latest revelations from Kobe Steel (KBSTY) and Nissan (NSANF).Other recent scandals include Takata's deadly airbags, Mitsubishi Motors' fudged fuel-efficiency tests and Toshiba (TOSBF)'s damaging debacles over its accounting and its nuclear power business.'A sad reflection' The problems suggest poor oversight by senior managers at Japanese businesses, experts say.That contrasts starkly with Japan Inc's reputation for quality that's widely credited with driving its success since the 1970s."Clearly, it is a sad reflection on aspects of the quality culture of Japan," said Professor Thomas Clarke, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at University of Technology Sydney's Business School.Clarke attributes the failings in large part to the loyalty required from managers wishing to make their way up Japan's corporate ladder.Related: Europe to planemakers: Stop buying Kobe Steel products Long-term service at a company is rewarded with higher pay and tax benefits.That makes workers "reluctant to blow the whistle for fear of losing their job or being demoted," said Marcel Thielient, a Japan expert at research firm Capital Economics.That appears to be what happened at Kobe Steel, where employees fabricated data on the strength and durability on copper and aluminum products going back at least a decade.Cutting corners Some experts say Japanese firms are too willing to sacrifice standards in order to grow market share and profits.That's a particular challenge in their domestic economy, which has struggled for decades with sputtering growth and falling prices."Corners can get cut and negative news is buried in the vain hope it might go away," said Professor Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan.Related: How things got ugly for some of Japan's biggest brands Japanese manufacturers are facing more competitive pressure than ever before.Aggressive rivals have emerged from China, South Korea and Taiwan -- neighboring economies that once lagged Japan but are now export powerhouses for high-end products like electronics and autos."Globalization of supply chains has put pressure on suppliers to do more for less," Kingston said.That's left some Japanese companies struggling to compete.Last year, electronics giant Sharp was bought by Taiwan's Foxconn, a humbling comedown for one of Japan's most well-known brands.Foxconn also bid for Toshiba's microchip unit this year.Anything for a quiet life Japan knows it has a problem.In the past couple of years, the stock exchange has been prodding companies to improve oversight by bringing in external board members.But the cascade of scandals hasn't stopped.A recent study by academics at the Tokyo Institute for Technology tried to get to the root of the problem.The researchers looked into the so-called "quiet life hypothesis."They argue that Japanese managers often avoid making tough decisions like investing in new areas or cutting costs -- in other words, anything that's goes to make their life more difficult.Related: Japan's economy faces huge challenges The study also pointed to another issue.Japanese companies in similar industries often have unspoken agreements not to compete, which they seal by buying stock in one another.This naturally makes managers at these firms more complacent, the researchers found.If Japanese companies are unable to shake off these problems soon, the country is set to suffer further."Japan will lose out as other Asian economies, including China, progressively raise their standards of quality and reliability," Clarke warned.-- Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.
Brits should prepare for their first interest rate hike in a decade:::::The British economy has accelerated just enough to lock in the country's first interest rate hike in a decade.That's the assessment of economists after official data published Wednesday pegged U.K. economic growth at 0.4% compared to the previous quarter.The GDP growth, which translates to an annual expansion of 1.5%, was stronger than expected.With inflation near 3%, the result means the Bank of England is now very likely to increase interest rates next week."Today's growth figures show that, despite the Brexit headwinds, U.K. growth is good enough to give the [central bank] the green light for a rate rise," said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.The central bank's key interest rate is currently set at a record low of 0.25%.It had been as high as 5.75% in mid-2007.Britain's economy has been under pressure in the aftermath of last summer's Brexit referendum.Unemployment has continued to fall, but a sharp drop in the value of the pound has hurt consumers by making imported goods more expensive.Wages have also been squeezed and the housing market has slowed.Uncertainty about the terms of a divorce deal with the European Union has forced businesses to put investments on hold."The U.K. growth rate would probably be nearer 2.5% this year if it weren't for Brexit," said Kallum Pickering, a senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.Related: Time is now the key factor in Brexit talks The new GDP data showed strength in the services sector, including computer programming and retail.However, there were signs of further decline in construction. "These numbers do not change the big picture for the U.K.," said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC.Related: The CNNMoney Brexit jobs tracker The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points next Thursday, part of a bid to control inflation.The move would benefit savers, who have for years seen paltry returns on their deposits.But it would also make borrowing more expensive for consumers who are facing tighter household budgets."While any interest rate hikes would be limited and gradual, even small increases could cause problems for many consumers given high borrowing levels," said Howard Archer, an economic adviser to EY .
Chipotle earnings ravaged by hurricanes, hack and high avocado prices:::::Chipotle just can't catch a break.The burrito maker said sales rose by 17% and profit more than doubled in the third quarter.That's the good news.The bad news is that Hurricanes Irma and Harvey took a giant bite out of Chipotle's revenue, and costs associated with an April malware attack ate into the company's profit.Though Chipotle found some cost savings in preparing lettuce and peppers in its restaurants, some of those cost reductions were offset by higher avocado and beef prices.Its new queso dip, which Chipotle hoped would bring disgruntled customers back, has received largely negative reviews -- on social media, customers found Chipotle's version of queso to be a "crime against cheese."Chipotle said it's early days (it launched nationwide in September), but early queso signs are only somewhat positive for sales.Adding to the disappointment, Chipotle (CMG) said it would open 15 fewer stores than the company planned this quarter.To lure in new customers, Chipotle said it is considering changing the design of its restaurants.Investors weren't having it.Shares dipped by more than 15% on Wednesday.Related: Chipotle's recovery hopes melt with 'gritty' queso It's been a rocky few months for the fast food retailer.The hack, acknowledged by the company on April 25, allowed cyber thieves to steal credit card information from customers at several locations across major U.S. cities.Related: Chipotle stock drops 6% on new illness report Plus, two recent incidents -- the closure of a location where rodents were sighted and a norovirus outbreak in a different restaurant -- spooked investors who remember Chipotle's 2015 troubles with E. Coli.And it's not like other fast food sellers are struggling.Shares of McDonald's, already one of the hottest stocks in the Dow this year, rose on Tuesday after the fast food giant impressed Wall Street with total revenue that topped forecasts.
Caution: U.S. stocks have rarely been this expensive:::::Just a week after blowing past 23,000, the sizzling Dow is halfway to its next milestone.The Dow zoomed nearly 200 points to a fresh record high on Tuesday thanks to impressive earnings from the likes of Caterpillar (CAT), General Motors (GM) and 3M (MMM).Investors are celebrating the latest evidence that Corporate America is very healthy.That put the Dow close to 23,500.But is Wall Street celebrating a bit too hard?Some market pros are growing concerned that stocks are too expensive.Goldman Sachs crunched the numbers on virtually every way to value stocks and found that S&P 500 stocks have rarely been as expensive as now.The most popular way to value the stock market is based on projected earnings over the next year.By that measure, known as forward price-to-earnings, the S&P 500 is trading at a lofty multiple of 18.5.That's miles ahead of the long-term average of 12.8.More telling, over the last four decades, stocks have been more expensive only 11% of the time, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent report.Related: Meet the market bears predicting stock market doom Digging deeper, the report found that the median stock in the S&P 500 has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7.That's higher than 98% of the time.A variety of other measures confirm that the stock market is trading in truly rarefied territory, Goldman found.For example, the median S&P 500 stock has never been more expensive based on enterprise value to sales.Enterprise value is roughly what a company would be worth if it were acquired.Ditto for another another measure based on how fast profits are growing.And other metrics cited by Goldman are either at all-time highs or very close.In other words, there have been few times in history where the stock market looked this expensive.By some measures, it never has."Objectively, the stock market is overvalued.That's a fact," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.There's only one measure Goldman Sachs listed that makes the market look a bit inexpensive: a gauge of a company's financial strength called free cash flow yield.The S&P 500 is trading at about average levels by that measure.But Goldman notes that metric has been kept low because companies aren't spending a lot on factories and equipment.Related: Stocks soar.Why?Corporate America is still great Of course, there are plenty of reasons why the market is on fire.The U.S. economy looks solid, with unemployment at just 4.2%.Virtually all major economies around the world are finally growing at the same time.Inflation is unusually low, allowing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates very low, for now at least.And Wall Street is getting excited about the tax overhaul proposed by President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress."The speed the market is moving with is surprising.But the fundamentals support higher stock prices," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.Given that bond prices are also very expensive, Sandven said investors have few good alternatives to stocks.Consider that one-third of the S&P 500 pays a higher dividend rate than the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.4%.Market bulls argue that expensive valuations might not matter right now.Sandven said that while valuation metrics would "suggest caution," history shows that "stocks can be over or undervalued for long periods."Even market bears acknowledge that valuations don't matter, until they do."Valuations are never a timing mechanism.Markets were expensive in 1996," said Boockvar, referring to the period before the dot-com bubble popped.Related: Trump is too obsessed with Wall Street Even though valuations are poor timing tools, they can help give investors a sense of how much money they can expect to make in the long run.(Think: Buy low, sell high.)"Elevated valuations suggest low long-term returns," Goldman Sachs wrote.Sandven agrees, saying investors should expect annual stock returns in the mid-single-digit range.That would be disappointing compared with the double-digit gains of recent years.The S&P 500 is already up 15% this year.In other words, if you're jumping into the stock market, don't bank on these incredible returns to continue.
Amazon Key will let delivery people inside your house:::::Alexa, is it a good idea to let strangers into my house?Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) thinks so.The company says it has a safe way for you to allow delivery drivers inside your home, even when you're not there.The service is called Amazon Key and launches November 8 for Prime members.You buy a kit that includes an Amazon security camera, the Cloud Cam, and a compatible smart lock.The kit starts at $249.99.You order something for delivery and click the "in-home" shipping option.When the delivery driver arrives, Amazon verifies the address and delivery time and allows him or her into your home.You can watch from your phone as the camera records the whole thing.Related: Cool or creepy?Walmart to deliver food and put it in fridge Amazon says the delivery driver will not be given an access code or key.The service isn't just for deliveries.Amazon says you can also use it to let family and friends into your house when you're not home.And it will work for certain services like home cleaners, pet sitters and dog walkers.Amazon Key will be available in 37 U.S. cities to start, and Amazon says it will add more.It's not the first major retailer to experiment with remote delivery access.Last month, Walmart (WMT) announced that it was testing a service that allows a delivery driver from the startup Deliv into your home, mostly for groceries.It will even give the delivery person access to your refrigerator.In the Walmart service, the driver gets a one-time passcode for a smart lock, and you can watch the delivery on security cameras.
Harvard study: Employers are making it harder to hire:::::Imagine applying for a job that requires a college degree, even though the employee currently doing the same work doesn't have one.But that's exactly the situation many job seekers find themselves in -- and companies may be shooting themselves in the foot in the process.Employers are increasingly demanding that applicants have better qualifications than the person already doing the same job, according to a new study published Tuesday by Harvard Business School professor Joseph Fuller.This trend means that otherwise qualified workers are missing out on good jobs.It also costs companies more in salaries and comes as America has 6.1 million job openings -- a number that's near a record high."By raising the bar academically, employers are often hurting their own economics and slamming the door on the opportunity to give a good-paying job to an increasing number of Americans," says Fuller.Related: This is the biggest mystery in the U.S. economy Businesses routinely say they are having trouble finding skilled or available workers, according to surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve.The manufacturing sector in particular has reported severe labor shortages.But factory bosses have raised the bar for job applicants.For example, 67% of the job postings in 2015 for supervisors of production workers required a college degree.But only 16% of the existing supervisors actually had a college education.Fuller argues that this trend is a key undercurrent in the broader debate about wage inequality.Workers without college degrees increasingly have fewer job options even though they may have the skills for a better-paying gig.Related: Job training saved her life In total, the bar has been raised on 6.2 million jobs that didn't previously require a college degree, according to the study, which was done in partnership with consulting giant Accenture, Grads of Life -- a nonprofit that connects employers to Opportunity Youth -- and Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based data firm.Researchers focused on "middle skill" jobs -- those that require more than a high diploma but less than a 4-year college degree.They found that employers increasingly demanded a college degree because the job skills for a particular position rapidly changed and companies preferred to not pay for job training.But hiring college grads for jobs that non-college grads can do carries a litany of hidden costs, according to the study.For one, the majority of employers paid as much as 30% more to hire an applicant with a college education instead of an applicant without a 4-year degree.Companies also suffered from high turnover rates and long periods of time with unfilled jobs.Related: Holiday hiring is getting more difficult for retailers And people searching for work -- particularly supervisors, clerks, inspectors and secretaries -- have suffered too.The majority of the 600 businesses surveyed admitted that demanding a 4-year degree excludes some applicants.Some firms create online job application sites that automatically weed out applications without a college degree."Even workers who have relevant experience are excluded," said Fuller, who examined 26 million job postings, in the study.Fuller recommends companies partner with local community colleges or job training centers to better prepare young workers or give middle-aged workers new, relevant skills.He also suggested in the report that employers remove automatic filters in their online job applications and use a more customized vetting process that includes people who have not graduated from college.
CVS makes more than $66 billion bid for Aetna: sources:::::(Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp has made an offer to acquire No.3 U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo A deal would merge one of the nations largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.Aetna shares rose more than 11 percent, or $18.48, to $178.60, while CVS shares fell 3 percent, or $2.22, to $73.31, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks earlier on Thursday.Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.But it would also subject it to more antitrust scrutiny.The deal could also help counter pressure on CVSs stock following speculation that Amazon.com Inc is preparing to enter the drug prescription market, using its vast e-commerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.CVS made the offer earlier this month, although the two companies have been in discussions about a potential deal for several months, the sources said.These talks were carried out primarily between CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, and were aimed at making executives comfortable with the idea of a merger, the sources said.CVS and Aetna started discussing terms only recently, and a deal is not expected for a few weeks, one of the sources added, cautioning that the pace of the talks could accelerate given the publication of the negotiations.The sources did not specify how much of CVS bid is cash versus stock, but given CVSs and Aetnas market capitalizations of $77 billion and $54 billion, respectively, a substantial stock component is likely in any deal.Aetna and CVS declined to comment.Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.UNCERTAIN TIMES AHEAD The deal comes after years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Acts facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement.The lack of progress - as well as Trumps executive order to bring down healthcare costs - has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.After the deal with Humana fell apart, Bertolini has said that he did not believe large deals were possible in the insurance industry.But analysts have speculated about a tighter partnership between Aetna and CVS since early in the year.CVS and Aetna have a long-term contract in which CVS has provided pharmacy benefits for Aetna customers.Aetna really makes the best sense said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Its their largest client on the PBM side.They really have similar views as to where healthcare should go, which is to the retail setting.Jonas, who owns both Aetna and CVS shares, noted the two companies were already talking about working together on Minute Clinic, on home infusion and other services.To go from that to a full merger is a big step but its not huge, he said.Last week No.2 insurer Anthem Inc. announced plans to manage its own pharmacy benefits with the help of CVS, a move that would give it a set-up similar to UnitedHealth Group Inc. and its Optum unit.Insurers want more control over the pharmaceutical component of care as they implement pricing schemes with doctors and hospitals that are based on health outcomes, not just procedures.They also want to work on driving down costs, and as a pharmacy benefit manager, would negotiate directly with drugmakers.
Alphabet's mobile ad revenue surges; shares jump:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected advertising sales and higher operating margins, boosting its shares as investors brushed off concerns about higher costs for acquiring mobile users.The stock was up nearly 3 percent at $1,001.50 after the bell.They have gained 25 percent this year.Third-quarter revenue for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped 24 percent to $27.8 billion, above the average analysts estimate of $27.2 billion.Profit of $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share, was well ahead of Wall Street estimates.Alphabet, along with much of the tech sector, has enjoyed torrid growth in recent years as advertising moves from traditional media to the internet and consumers flock to an ever-expanding array of digital devices.While Google faces political pressure, especially in Europe, over its growing dominance and its role in spreading propaganda online, those problems have yet to hit the bottom line.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that efforts to attract both large and small advertisers around the world were paying off, especially in Asia, where sales rose 29 percent to $4.2 billion.The third quarter was the 15th in a row in which Alphabet has shown double-digit, year-over-year consolidated sales increases.The pace is not slowing down, with the growth rate reaching its highest level in nearly five years.Ad sales at Google, Alphabets main operating unit, account for the vast majority of the companys revenue.The ad business faces competition from Facebook Inc but has continued to grow as more users turn to Googles YouTube and mobile search services.Alphabet shares trade for almost 25.8 times expected earnings and Facebook at about 26.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.Investors have been increasingly concerned about a sharp rise in costs for getting ads in front of users as Google pays Apple Inc and other companies to integrate Google search into mobile products and services.The payments are included in traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and they rose 54 percent in the quarter, accounting for 12 percent of ad sales.Pichai defended the partnerships in response to several analysts questions on Thursday, calling the deals a win-win construct because Google performs better when our partners do well.FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Were pretty comfortable with how were approaching it, he said.Other analysts said revenue growth and cost controls made TAC increases less of an issue.There is way too much focus on TAC as a cost - its a great investment for Google to control the publishing ecosystem, said Richard Kramer of Arete Research.James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said: TAC is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one.The third-quarter profit margin of 24 percent marked Alphabets highest since 27 percent in first quarter of 2013.Googles other revenue, which includes hardware such as the Pixel smartphones and Home speakers as well as the cloud computing business, also enjoyed solid growth.Sales from non-ad businesses rose 40 percent from a year ago to $3.4 billion in the quarter.Among Googles top priorities is expanding its salesforce to catch up with Amazon Web Services in providing corporate computing via large data centers, Pichai said.Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue, but Jefferies analysts estimate it at about 15 percent of Googles other revenue.Google also is trying to take on Apple in the high-end smartphone business with the Pixel.The company deepened its investment in September, agreeing to acquire 2,000 engineers from smartphone maker HTC Corp for $1.1 billion.Googles Android operating system already powers most non-Apple smartphones.But Googles second-generation Pixel had a rough debut last week, with users complaining of a faulty screen and clicking noises during calls.The company responded on Thursday by doubling the warranty period for the smartphones to two years and promising to issue software fixes.Losses from Alphabets Other Bets segment, which includes the Google Fiber broadband service and smart thermostat maker Nest, narrowed to $812 billion from $861 billion.The change reflected both an increase in sales across the companies and scaled back expansion plans for Fiber.Google faces political uncertainty as European regulators crack down on its business practices and U.S. critics call for greater regulation of the tech industry.The company recorded in the second quarter a $2.7 billion European Commission fine for unfair treatment of shopping websites in search results.Antitrust experts have said another fine could come by the end of year, as the EC investigates its distribution deals with smartphone vendors and wireless carriers.Apparently alluding to political concerns about extremist propaganda and misinformation appearing on Google services, Pichai told analysts on Thursday that the company cared deeply about the quality of information it provides and would constantly work to get this right.
Amazon sales surge after Whole Foods acquisition, busy Prime Day:::::(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday said its sales surged over the summer and profit trounced expectations, as shoppers jumped at Prime Day promotions on its website and bought groceries at its newly acquired chain of Whole Foods Market stores.Shares rose more than 7 percent in after-hours trade.Amazon is winning business from older, big box rivals by delivering virtually any product to customers at a low cost, and at times faster than it takes to buy goods from a physical store.It acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August to help it deliver groceries to shoppers doorsteps.Amazons results defied expectations that it would invest nearly all of its earnings into new areas as it has in the past.The worlds largest online retailer said net income rose to $256 million, or 52 cents per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30.Analysts on average were expecting 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders, said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.Prime Day, a summer marketing event Amazon has created to replicate the shopping frenzy that is more typical of the winter holiday season, helped boost sales.Revenue rose 34 percent to $43.7 billion in the third quarter, including $1.3 billion in sales from Whole Foods.Analysts had expected $42.1 billion.Therell be a lot of integration, Amazons Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts, citing how Amazons two-hour delivery service Prime Now could work with Whole Foods, for instance.We think well also be developing new store formats, he said.In a first, Amazon broke out sales for its online retail business and for its physical bookstores and Whole Foods locations.Revenue from its online stores jumped 22 percent to $26.4 billion, the fastest growth Amazon has seen in the segment in more than a year.Key to its success has been signing more people up for Amazon Prime, its fast-shipping and video-streaming club, whose members tend to buy more from the company.Revenue from subscription fees such as Prime grew 59 percent to $2.4 billion.FILE PHOTO - The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo And Amazon Web Services (AWS), which handles data and computing for large enterprises, saw its profit margin expand from the previous quarter.It posted a 41.9 percent rise in sales to $4.58 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.52 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.They are firing on all cylinders.The machine is churning, Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.STILL BETTING ON HOLLYWOOD Amazon shares have a high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio more than eight times that of cloud-computing rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance.Unlike peers, Amazon runs on razor-thin profit margins because it sinks most of its profit back into its business.This quarter, which includes the shopping holiday Black Friday, Amazon said it expects operating profit between $300 million and $1.65 billion.Analysts were expecting $930.78 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Amazons profit is going toward a dizzying number of investments: warehouses for faster shipping, data centers for AWS, and a 77 percent uptick in employees last quarter, including Whole Foods workers.The company plans to spend more on video content next year as well, Olsavsky said.Analysts estimate Amazon will have spent $4.5 billion this year.The commitment to content comes after Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned last week, and other top studio hands left the company.It is unclear what impact the shakeup may have on Amazons ability to secure video that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) for viewers attention.The companys shares, which closed down 0.05 percent on Thursday, rose about 7.5 percent to $1,046 in after-hours trading following the earnings statement.They had gained about 30 percent this year.
Asian shares gain after upbeat earnings from U.S. tech titans:::::TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares gained on Friday as technology shares were boosted by upbeat earnings from U.S. hi-tech giants while the euro hovered near three-month low against the dollar after the European Central Bank extended its stimulus.Passersby are reflected in an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, October 23, 2017.REUTERS/Issei Kato Japan's Nikkei .N225 gained 0.6 percent while South Korea's Kospi .KS11 rose 0.2 percent and Australian shares rose 0.2 percent.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat in dollar terms..MIAPJ0000PUS Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), the worlds second, third and fifth largest companies by market capitalization, were all upbeat, boosting their shares in after-hour trade.Shares in those companies rose 2.8 percent, 4.5 percent and 7.6 percent respectively.Prior to that, the U.S. S&P 500 Index .SPX gained 0.1 percent to edge near the record high touched last week, thanks to the robust global economy and solid corporate earnings.As third-quarter earnings season nears the half-way mark, 74 percent of U.S. companies have topped expectations, above the 72 percent beat rate for the past four quarters.The U.S. House of Representatives helped pave the way on Thursday for deep tax cuts sought by President Donald Trump, passing a budget blueprint for fiscal 2018 that will enable the tax legislation to win congressional approval without any Democratic votes.On the whole, growth shares were strong yesterday both in the U.S. and in Europe.And now that the Republicans can pass the tax reform, the tax cut debate now looks set to kick off next week, said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities.German shares .GDAXI hit record high while the pan-European Eurofirst 300 Index .FTSE gained 1.1 percent, its biggest gains in 3 1/2 months, after the ECB extended its bond buying program to September.Although the ECB halved the size of its bond purchase to 30 billion euro per month from January, it also promised years of stimulus and even left the door open to backtracking.Euro zone bond yields plunged, with the benchmark 10-year German Bund yield falling about 6 basis points to 0.42 percent, the biggest daily fall in nine months DE10YT=TWEB.Yields on debt issued by Southern European countries seen as less creditworthy also fell, with the premium that investors demand from Italian bonds IT10YT=TWEB falling to 1.53 percentage points, near 7 1/2-month low touched in early August.In the currency market, the ECB's dovish stance sent the euro EUR= to a three-month low of $1.1631.The dollar was little moved against the yen at 114.09 JPY=, near Wednesday's three-month high of 114.245.The Australian dollar AUD=D4 slipped to 3 1/2-month low of $0.7654, smarting from a softer-than-expected local inflation data earlier in the week.On the other hand, Brent crude futures held firm after closing at a 27-month high on Thursday as the market focused in on Saudi Arabias comments about ending a global supply glut, brushing off an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories and high U.S. production and exports.Brent LCOc1 stood little changed at $59.32 a barrel, just below Thursdays high of $59.55 U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fetched $52.64 a barrel, flat from Thursdays six-month closing high.
Cloud computing drives massive growth for big U.S. tech firms:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Corps (GOOGL.O) Google and Intel Corp (INTC.O) are all putting their chips on the cloud computing business, and it is booming.FILE PHOTO - A sign marks the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 25, 2017.REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo All four companies posted stellar quarterly earnings on Thursday, showing the strength of the shift in corporate computing away from company-owned data centers and to the cloud.Microsofts Azure business nearly doubled, with year-over-year growth of 90 percent.The company does not break out revenue figures for Azure, but research firm Canalys estimates it generated $2 billion for Microsoft.The move to the cloud was one we felt Microsoft could always benefit from, and theyre showing us that they can, said Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a portfolio management firm.Highlighting the quarter for Microsoft was a deal securing retailer Costco (COST.O) as an Azure customer.That came just two months after the close of Amazons acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, which has heightened unease among retail and e-commerce companies about working with Amazon, said Ed Anderson, an analyst with Gartner.Tim Green, analyst with the Motley Fool, said Amazon could find it needs to make changes at some point at Amazon Web services.Spinning off AWS at some point down the road might become necessary to prevent an exodus of customers, he said.Amazon Web Services is still delivering far more revenue than any of its peers.For the quarter, AWS raked in nearly $4.6 billion -- a year-over-year increase of 42 percent.AWS may have missed out on Costco, but the company secured deals with Hulu, Toyota Racing Development, and most notably, General Electric.Google Cloud Platform landed deals with the likes of department store retailer Kohls and payments processor PayPal.Like Microsoft, Alphabet does not break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but Canalys estimates the business generated $870 million in the quarter, up 76 percent year-over-year.FILE PHOTO - The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Google Cloud Platform is a top-three priority for the company.He said Google plans to continue expanding its cloud sales force.Canalys estimates the cloud computing market at $14.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 43 percent from a year prior.Amazon holds 31.8 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft at 13.9 percent and Google with 6 percent, according to Canalys estimates.The cloud market will keep growing faster than most of the traditional information technology segment, as the market is still in the developing stage, said Daniel Liu, research analyst with Canalys.FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Reflecting the overall growth of the market was the strong performance by Intel, which sells processors and chips to cloud vendors.In July, Intel launched its new Xeon Scalable Processors, which drove 7 percent year-to-year growth for the companys data center group.The big three cloud vendors also benefit from the decision by many enterprises to build their applications using more than one cloud vendor.Retailers Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), for example, told Reuters they use a combination of cloud providers.Our philosophy here is to be cloud agnostic, as much as we can, said Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot, which uses both Azure and Google Cloud Platform.Some analysts expect cloud services growth to slow over time as competition increases.Amazon, for instance, has said that price cuts and new products with lower costs on average are a core part of its cloud business.Additionally, Amazon Web Services saw usage growth outpacing that of revenue growth, said Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky.Going forward, cloud services will become more of a commodity, and the prices will quickly compress, said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, an investment advisory service.For now though, its a great business with plenty of room for all to grow.
Microsoft beats profit estimates on gains from cloud services:::::(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as demand for its cloud computing services for companies rose and its personal computer software business stabilized.FILE PHOTO: An promotional video plays behind a window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. on May 15, 2017.REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Shares of the worlds largest software company rose 3.1 percent to $81.20 in trading after the bell.Microsofts focus on fast-growing cloud applications and platforms is helping it beat slowing demand for personal computers that has hurt sales of Windows - the software that powered the company to the top in the 1990s.Under Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Microsofts cloud business - which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and the flagship Azure computing platform - has emerged as a major source of growth.Revenue from Microsofts intelligent cloud business rose nearly 14 percent to $6.92 billion in Microsofts fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30.Analysts on average had expected $6.70 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.Revenue from Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Incs (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and offerings from Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google, IBM (IBM.N) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), grew 90 percent compared to a 97 percent growth rate in the preceding quarter.Azures strong performance helped lift the gross margin at Microsofts cloud business to 57 percent, said Stephanie Rodriguez, director of investor relations for Microsoft.Microsoft said its commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate reached $20.4 billion in the quarter.In 2015, Nadella set a target of $20 billion in cloud revenue by 2018.In a call with analysts after earnings, Nadella said retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) recently chose Azure its hybrid cloud platform.Revenue from Microsofts personal computing division, its largest by revenue, fell 0.2 percent to $9.38 billion but handily beat analysts estimate of $8.81 billion.The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.After two straight quarters of declining Surface revenue, Microsoft notched a 12 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its tablets and laptops in the latest quarter, helped by the release of a new Surface in May.Microsoft also benefited from a 13 percent year-over-year increase in revenue from Dynamics, its enterprise and sales software business which competes with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).Even though best in class is Salesforce, Microsoft has a good enough product to get a large amount of business, said Kim Forrest, an equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.Microsoft is set for an acceleration of growth and bookings with margin concerns that were overblown heading into 2018, said Daniel Ives at research firm GBH Insights.A slowly improving PC environment is also a modest tailwind for Microsoft with cloud remaining the Trojan horse growth driver for Redmond over the coming years.The technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 84 cents per share, up from $5.67 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier.(bit.ly/2lkGlyz) Revenue rose 12 percent to $24.54 billion.Microsoft's shares had risen nearly 27 percent this year through Thursday, eclipsing the 14.4 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 .SPX.

CSX executive shakeup rattles employees, investors; shares drop:::::(Reuters) - The resignation of two prominent female executives at CSX Corp (CSX.O) hours before CSX canceled a long-planned investor conference this week rattled employees and investors on Thursday, sending the No.3 U.S. railroads shares down 1 percent.FILE PHOTO: Hunter Harrison, CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, speaks to the economic community at a business luncheon in Toronto, March 2, 2015.REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo The resignations prompted concerns over the health of 72-year-old Chief Executive Hunter Harrison, and fears of deeper turmoil as CSX undergoes a major overhaul.We think investors suspect there could be something else behind this, said Cowan & Co analyst Jason Seidl, adding that he received many calls and emails from concerned investors.We do not think the departure of these three people, long-tenured executives at the firm, came on completely amicable terms.Jim Foote, who worked for Harrison at Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) and is well-versed in his precision scheduled railroading model for driving efficiency, will replace Chief Operating Officer Cindy Sanborn and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Fredrik Eliasson, who both plan to resign next month.CSX said the decision to postpone the investor conference was to allow Mr. Foote to familiarize himself with the companys operations and the teams he is now leading, so he would be in a better position speak to CSXs future opportunities.Sanborn, and corporate counsel Ellen Fitzsimmons, who will retire, were likely the two highest-ranking women in the rail industry, said independent rail analyst Anthony Hatch.Harrison praised the departing executives in an internal e-mail seen by Reuters.Although we will miss the talents of these valued leaders, we are pleased to welcome another highly capable leader to our executive team, he said.One senior CSX manager who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said Sanborns resignation was deeply unsettling.Sanborn joined CSX in 1987, is the daughter of a former president of Conrail, acquired by CSX and Norfolk Southern (NSC.N) in 1997, and holds $6.47 million in CSX shares.She is not the kind of person who would automatically resign unless she was forced to, the manager said.Another Midwest-based employee said the departures suggested Harrison was removing executives who disagreed with his operating philosophy.Sanborn is a major stockholder, she has a lot of influence with big customers, a lot of influence in Washington, the employee said.Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker wrote in a client note that changes matched Harrisons record at Canadian railroads he turned around before taking the helm at CSX in March.Its hard to argue with his results at Canadian National and Canadian Pacific (CP.TO), Schoonmaker wrote.CSX shares closed down just over 1 percent at $52.35 on Thursday, but are up nearly 46 percent so far this year.
Toymaker Mattel to miss FY revenue forecast, halts dividend:::::(Reuters) - Toymaker Mattel Inc (MAT.O) said on Thursday it would miss its full-year revenue forecast and decided to stop dividend from the fourth quarter to beef up its faltering business that has been hurt by the bankruptcy of its largest customer ToysRUs.FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The Mattel company logo is seen at the 114th North American International Toy Fair in New York City, U.S., February 21, 2017.REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo Shares of the company, which reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results, fell as much as 25 percent in after-market trading.(For the) full year, we will clearly not achieve the top line expectation we discussed in June, Mattels Chief Executive Margo Georgiadis said.The worlds largest toymaker had forecast mid-to-high single digit revenue growth for the medium term in June.Mattel has been struggling with lagging sales for four of the past six quarters and is facing an inventory glut amid weak demand for its core brands from retailers.Key retail partnerships for its brands such as Thomas & Friends and Monster High were 15 percent to 20 percent lower than in 2016, Georgiadis said on the call.Under Georgiadis, who became the CEO in January, Mattel is trying to free up funds and save at least $650 million in net costs over the next two years.The company replaced its veteran finance chief Kevin Farr last month and decided to cut its dividend payout by more than 60 percent.FILE PHOTO: Comic Con fans gather at the Mattel booth they participate in the opening preview night at Comic Con International in San Diego,California, U.S., July 19, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The latest suspension of its quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share is expected to save $50 million per quarter, the company said on Thursday.The company said the bankruptcy of ToysRUs resulted in half of the decline in its North America revenue and most of the 7 percent fall in gross margins.The toy retailer, which filed for bankruptcy in September, contributed 11 percent to Mattels revenue in 2016.ToysRUs owes creditors $5 billion with Mattel exposed to about $135 million in unsecured claims for payment.However, the retailer is set to receive $3.1-billion debtor-in-possession financing, which is likely to help the ToysRUs pay some of its suppliers such as Mattel and keep 1,600 stores in operation for the crucial holiday season.Rival Hasbro (HAS.O) and Jakks Pacific (JAKK.O) too were impacted by ToysRUs going out of business.Net sales fell 13 percent to $1.56 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, while the company posted an adjusted profit of 9 cents per share.Analysts had expected revenue of $1.81 billion and adjusted profit of 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The companys shares were down 18.7 percent at $12.49 in after-market trading on Thursday.
Subaru was lax on final inspection rules for Japan cars: sources:::::TOKYO (Reuters) - Subaru Corp (7270.T) failed to follow proper inspection procedures for vehicles destined for the domestic market at a factory in Japan, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.FILE PHOTO - The Subaru logo is seen on a wheel in this picture illustration April 23, 2016.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo The revelation follows a similar issue at Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and comes as Japanese manufacturers grapple with wider compliance problems with Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) saying on Thursday it had found more possible cases of data fabrication on its products.Shares of Subaru fell more than 3 percent in early trade, underperforming a slight rise in the broader Tokyo market .N225.Japans transport ministry had instructed domestic automakers to conduct internal investigations after Nissan found violations on inspections governing vehicles sold in Japan at its domestic factories.The ministry had set an end-October deadline for submitting the results.The sources told Reuters that Subaru had allowed uncertified technicians to conduct final vehicle inspections at its main Gunma factory complex, north of Tokyo, which violates ministry requirements.They asked not to be identified because they were not authorised to disclose the information.The Nikkei business daily reported earlier that Subaru had yet to determine whether a recall, which could affect 300,000 vehicles, would be necessary.A Subaru spokesman said the company could not comment on the inspection issue because the automaker had not submitted results of its internal investigation to the transport ministry yet.Kyodo News reported separately that Subaru had been letting uncertified technicians oversee final inspections for over 30 years, without citing its source.
Mattel suspends dividend after earnings:::::Toy maker Mattel saw its sales pummeled by the bankruptcy of one of its biggest customers, Toys 'R' Us.The company said on Thursday that it suffered a 13% sales decline worldwide -- 22% in North America.Mattel (MAT) is also suspending quarterly dividends starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to free up about $50 million per quarter.And the brand wildly missed Wall Street's expectations: Mattel reported earnings of $.09 per share -- well below analyst forecasts of $.57 per share.Related: Hasbro hurt by Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy Mattel offered a few reasons for its dismal report: Primarily, Toys 'R' Us' financial woes has made it hard for Mattel to perform.It's no surprise.The retailer was once responsible for nearly 10% of Mattel's sales.And Mattel's not the only one feeling the impact of the Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy.Hasbro (HAS) rattled investors when it warned this week that sales for the holiday fourth quarter could be lower than expected, citing Toys R Us as one reason.The news sent Hasbro stock tumbling by about 10%.Related: Toys 'R' Us files for bankruptcy But Hasbro has a lifeline in the form of its Star Wars, Marvel and Disney Princess toys, and it reported sales and profits for the third quarter that topped forecasts.Mattel toys, on the other hand, have been performing poorly for the past few quarters.This past quarter, its signature toys sold poorly again.American Girl sales were down 30% worldwide compared to this time last year.Fisher Price sales fell by 15%, and Barbie sales were down by 6%.The company said it wants to cut at least $650 million in costs over the next two years to help put it back on track.-- CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed reporting to this story.
Google's ad sales machine is unstoppable:::::Even the unfolding crisis over Russian-bought election ads and an uproar over the firing of an engineer over a diversity memo couldn't slow down Google's advertising sales machine.Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), the parent company of Google, said Thursday that its sales hit $27.77 billion for the third quarter, a gain of 24% from the same period a year earlier.The sales growth, among its best in recent quarters, was driven in part by Google's continued traction serving ads on mobile devices and YouTube.In a statement, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat also credited the "strength" of Other Bets, which refers to the company's various moonshot projects.The category, which includes Nest and high-speed Internet access, saw sales jump to $302 million in the quarter from less than $200 million a year earlier.Losses for these costly bets narrowed slightly as well, but remained high at $812 million for the quarter.The company's stock popped 3% in after hours trading Thursday following the earnings report, pushing the company back above $1,000 a share.Related: Google's open culture tested by engineer's anti-diversity memo In the weeks leading up to its earnings report, Google has found itself in the crosshairs of Congress over Russian-bought ads on its platform intended to spread misinformation and divisions in America before the 2016 presidential election.Google, Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) have all been asked to testify before Congress."Over the near-term, the top risk is regulatory," James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, wrote in an investor note ahead of Alphabet's earnings."And we don't mean the EU, but rather investigations regarding Russia resulting in optically damaging transparency around privacy."If there is a damaging impact to Google's reputation, it has yet to show up on Google's bottom line.Likewise, an advertiser boycott over extremist content on YouTube appears to be largely resolved."The overwhelming majority of advertisers never left," Porat said on an earnings call Thursday, "and those who did, many are back on the platform."
CVS reportedly in talks to buy Aetna:::::CVS and Aetna are said to be weighing a massive tie-up.The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that CVS Health (CVS) is in talks to acquire the health insurer for $66 billion.The story, which posted just before the market close, caused Aetna (AET) shares to skyrocket as much as 12%.Shares of CVS fell almost 3% after hours.Both companies declined to comment on market "rumors."If the merger is approved and goes through, it would reshape the health care industry.CVS Health controls a massive drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits management system, while Aetna is one of the nation's largest insurers.Related: Here's what you'll pay for Obamacare in 2018 But mergers involving health insurance companies have run into roadblocks in the recent past.In 2015, Aetna and Humana announced a $34 billion merger, while Anthem agreed to acquire Cigna for $54 billion.Both deals were called off in February after they were targeted by the Justice Department over antitrust concerns and blocked by federal judges.
Democrats want ethics probe of Wilbur Ross financial disclosures:::::A group of Democrat lawmakers is pressing the government's chief ethics agency for answers on Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's financial disclosures.The request to the Office of Government Ethics was prompted by a story in Forbes last week that raised the possibility that Ross should have disclosed assets worth $2 billion before his confirmation earlier this year."It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people," the six lawmakers, led by Senator Richard Blumenthal, wrote to David Apol, acting director of OGE.Apol did not reply to an email seeking comment.OGE helps evaluate whether appointees have resolved potential conflicts between their government roles and their financial holdings.Although OGE doesn't have authority to investigate, it can refer matters to inspectors general and the Department of Justice.At issue is whether Ross should have disclosed $2 billion of assets Forbes said he transferred to a trust.The Democrats want to know when Ross moved the money and whether he controls the trust.Those details will help determine whether Ross possibly violated disclosure rules and conflict laws.In a statement, the Commerce Department said, "It is unfortunate the inaccuracies in the Forbes story have created the confusion expressed in this letter.The secretary remains committed to the highest ethical standards, and continues to work closely with Commerce ethics officials in service of the department's mission."Ross may have violated disclosure rules if he intentionally failed to disclose reportable assets or any income from them, said Virginia Canter, executive branch ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.(CREW, which policies potential ethics problems in government, is suing President Trump alleging his business interests violate the Constitution.)Canter pointed out that OGE's financial disclosure requires appointees to list income received above $200 within the reporting period, which in this case includes all of 2015 through December 19, 2016.Even if Ross transferred the assets before the election, he needed to report any income from those assets in that time period if it exceeded $200."At the risk of stating the obvious, $2 billion is not a rounding error," Senator Blumenthal said.
Penguin Press cancels Mark Halperin's 'Game Change' after harassment allegations:::::Penguin Press announced on Thursday night that it had canceled plans to publish the 2016 installment of the bestselling "Game Change" books after CNN reported five women have accused co-author Mark Halperin of sexual harassment."In light of the recent news regarding Mark Halperin, the Penguin Press has decided to cancel our plans to publish a book he was co-authoring on the 2016 election," Penguin Press said in a statement.HBO had said earlier in the day it had canceled plans to move forward with a miniseries about the 2016 election based on the book."HBO is no longer proceeding with the project tied to the untitled book co-authored by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2016 Presidential election," HBO -- which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner -- said in a statement."HBO has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions."Related: Five women accuse journalist and 'Game Change' co-author Mark Halperin of sexual harassment Other companies and people with whom Halperin has professional relationships are also reacting to the CNN report.Showtime, for which Halperin has co-hosted the series "The Circus" is "reevaluating" its relationship with Halperin, it said Thursday."During Mark's time working with us, we have not seen nor have there been allegations of any untoward behavior," a Showtime spokesperson said in a statement."We are aware of these reports and will continue to evaluate all options should we decide to move forward with another season of The Circus.There is no tolerance for sexual harassment within Showtime and its productions."On Wednesday, CNN reported that five women said Halperin sexually harassed them while he was political director at ABC News."During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me," Halperin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday night."I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain.For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation."The stories of harassment shared with CNN range in nature from propositioning employees for sex to kissing and grabbing one's breasts against her will.Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed.Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women.MSNBC, where Halperin is a senior political analyst, said on Thursday that Halperin would leave his roles at that network and as an analyst at NBC News "until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood."Halperin's long time co-author and co-host, John Heilemann, declined to comment when asked about the allegations Halperin is facing and whether he will continue his professional relationship with him.ABC News, where Halperin was working during the time the alleged harassment took place, sent a note to its staff on Thursday encouraging them to report harassment or misconduct."We hold everyone at ABC News accountable for our behavior and how they we conduct ourselves," ABC News president James Goldston wrote in the memo to staff."We know we do our best work in an environment where people feel respected, safe and supported.Harassment or retaliation of any kind is never acceptable."In a statement provided to CNN early Thursday morning, after CNN's initial story about Halperin was published, ABC News said, "Mark left ABC News over a decade ago, and no complaints were filed during his tenure."
Amazon now has more than 500,000 employees:::::Who you calling a job killer?Amazon now employs more than half a million workers.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) revealed Thursday that it had 541,900 employees in the third quarter, up from a little more than 300,000 in the same period a year earlier.Put another way: Amazon has added nearly a quarter million employees to its headcount in a single year.Part of that growth likely comes from its deal to acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion during the quarter.At the time the deal was announced, Whole Foods had about 87,000 employees.But Amazon also said at the beginning of this year that it would create 100,000 U.S. jobs as it staffs up fulfillment centers and hires customer service representatives.Amazon is currently weighing possible locations for its second headquarters to accommodate some of those employees.It received bids from 238 cities and regions across North America.Related: Puerto Rico wants Amazon's second headquarters, too Amazon remains well behind Walmart (WMT) however, which has 2.3 million employees globally.But Amazon's staggering headcount growth highlights its ambitions to upend retail, grocery stores, entertainment and more.Amazon has been investing aggressively in original video content, hardware, and fulfillment centers in the U.S. and abroad.Despite that investment and hiring, Amazon far exceeded Wall Street estimates for profits.The e-commerce company's profit climbed to $256 million in the third quarter, up from $252 million in the same period a year earlier.That marks the tenth straight quarter Amazon has been profitable.Its stock popped 8% in after hours trading Thursday following the earnings report.
$300 million Puerto Rico power deal now under government review:::::A $300 million contract awarded to Whitefish Energy, a small Montana utility company hired to restore power in parts of Puerto Rico, is now under several government reviews after being mired in controversy in recent days.The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general has launched an inquiry into the deal with Whitefish following calls by the press and lawmakers on Capitol Hill.The agency considers it one of their highest priority cases, a spokeswoman told CNN on Thursday.The inspector general plans to look into whether the appropriate process was followed by state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, when it awarded the contract.Thus far, the Whitefish deal is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.There will be 'hell to pay' The contract has raised a few eyebrows given that the firm is based in the same hometown as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and it employed just two people at the time Hurricane Maria made landfall.Such concerns prompted a separate House committee on Thursday to also open a review of the multimillion dollar contract.Rep.Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to Richard Ramos, the head of the PREPA, requesting further information on the contract.In addition, Sen. Maria Cantwell, a ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has asked the Government Accountability Office to review the matter.A GAO spokesman said the agency has received the letter and is reviewing the request."Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico power contract A White House spokesman told CNN the decision to give the contract to Whitefish was made exclusively by PREPA."The White House is not aware of any federal involvement in the selection," White House spokesman Raj Shah said.In a letter to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello requested that the government oversight agency complete its review of the Whitefish contract by October 30.Rossello also noted that he recently asked Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget to audit the Whitefish contract in order to ensure it's in compliance with all of the appropriate laws.The results of that audit are due Friday, Rossello told CNN."If there is no wrongdoing, if it has been done correctly then we will push forward," Rossello told CNN."If there is wrongdoing in this process or any process there will be hell to pay."A Twitter battle ensues Since the company announced the deal last week it has been swept up in controversy.On Wednesday, a public feud erupted between Whitefish and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on Twitter.Whitefish later issued an apology to Yulin Cruz after criticizing her and threatening to pull workers from the city she represents.In an earlier interview with Yahoo News, the mayor had called the multimillion dollar contract awarded to Whitefish "alarming" and pressed for the contract to be canceled immediately."The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said of the two-year old electrical utility in the interview Tuesday.Related: San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract In response, Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames posted a statement on Twitter calling Yulin Cruz's comments "misplaced.""We find her comments to be very disappointing and demoralizing to the hundreds of people on our team that have left their homes and families and have come here to help the people of Puerto Rico," Whitefish tweeted Wednesday.By the afternoon, the situation grew heated.Yulin Cruz tweeted back: "If @WhitefishEnergy feels that asking for transparency is "misplaced", what are they afraid we will find.""We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?," the utility company replied.Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico contract "Threats received by @WhitefishEnergy.The implication is if I do not "play nice" they will not do their job.Nasty!," the mayor tweeted back.She said Whitefish's response implied it would not treat San Juan with the "diligence it deserves."Whitefish later said it is committed to restoring power in Puerto Rico and then apologized to the mayor."Mayor Cruz and everyone in Puerto Rico... we would like to apologize for our comments earlier today, which did not represent who we are and how important this work is to help Puerto Rico's recovery," the company posted on Twitter late Wednesday night.Yulin Cruz does not have authority over PREPA and the contracts it issues.She has long been a critic of Rossello, who backed the Whitefish contract, and has criticized President Trump's handling of relief efforts on the island.Hometown connections in question PREPA's Ramos told reporters during a press conference last week the cash-strapped island chose Whitefish because it didn't require a big deposit upfront.The other contender, Power Security, wanted a $25 million down payment for the work, Ramos said."In that moment, we were not in a position to offer that collateral," said Ramos."The other company did not ask for a guarantee of payment."In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Ramos said he had no regrets about picking Whitefish out of the seven companies he spoke with about working on the recovery efforts."If we went back in time, I would do it all over again," Ramos said, adding the company is "doing a great job."But some on Capitol Hill are concerned that Whitefish may have stood out for another reason.The tiny utility company is based in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be Zinke's hometown.Both Zinke and Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski acknowledge knowing one another.Zinke's office described Whitefish as a "small town" with a population of roughly 6,000 people.One of the secretary's sons "joined a friend who worked a summer job at one their [Whitefish's] construction sites."Related: FEMA just got another $6.7 billion to help with hurricane relief Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce confirmed an Oct. 1 report by NBC Montana, which quoted Techmanski as saying he reached out to Zinke after winning the contract to help get resources to the island more quickly, But Luce told CNN that the company did not make any requests to the administration before the contract was signed on Sept. 26."The secretary had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish getting the contract," he said.Techmanski, who has described the firm as specializing in "difficult and mountainous terrain projects," has downplayed any ties to the administration."All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN Friday, referring to a call from director Ramos."We called each other."PREPA, which is $9 billion in debt, could have requested aid after Maria through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.That's what Texas and Florida did after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Ramos told CNN on Thursday that the closest states to Puerto Rico were already dealing with their own aftermath of earlier hurricanes and he believed they would not be able to respond quickly to the island's needs.The bankrupt utility also couldn't afford to cover the costs of utilizing the network either, he added.Related: Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous lines' Whitefish does have another tie to the administration.HBC Investments, which was founded by a big Republican donor named Joe Colonnetta, backs the firm.Colonnetta and his wife donated more than $20,000 to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and more than $30,000 to the Republican National Committee last year alone, according to a filing from the Federal Election Commission.A representative for Colonnetta was not immediately available to comment on the donations.Luce said the investment firm learned of Whitefish last summer through an unnamed mutual acquaintance in the energy industry."Techmanski is the type of entrepreneur HBC likes -- a family guy with a good business plan," Luce said, noting that the Whitefish CEO had previously managed contracts of up to $250 million.Additional reporting by Julia Jones, Martin Savidge and Paul Murphy.
Uber sued for gender, racial pay inequity:::::Uber is still fending off accusations of an unfair work environment.This week, the embattled ride-hailing company was sued by three Latina engineers who allege that they, as women and people of color, were paid less than their white or Asian male colleagues.Two of the women -- Ingrid Avendao and Roxana del Toro Lopez -- left Uber this summer, while Ana Medina is still employed by the company.They allege that Uber uses a "stack ranking" system for evaluating employees, meaning they're evaluated from "worst to best."Related: What happens if Uber loses London for good?"In this system," the suit says, "female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued....because [they] receive, on average, lower rankings despite equal or better performance."And those stack rankings are then used, in part, to determine promotions.Additionally, Uber sets employee pay based on their past compensation, which inherently disadvantages women, they say.As a result, the women "have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to lost earnings, lost benefits, and other financial loss, as well as non-economic damanges."The suit, which was filed this week in San Francisco County, claims that Uber is in violation of the Equal Pay Act.The women are suing on behalf of all similarly impacted employees under a state law called the Private Attorneys General Act.Under that law, the state receives 75% of any civil penalties and relief, and aggrieved employees will receive 25%.Related: Tesla factory at the center of discrimination lawsuits Uber declined to comment on the lawsuit.In July, the company said it took action to ensure its employees are fairly compensated.That meant bumping up salaries to ensure all employees -- regardless of gender or race -- are paid equally based on their location, job and tenure in the role."Thanks to feedback from our employees, we're making the right investments to set ourselves up for the future," an Uber spokesperson told CNN Tech at that time.The company has worked to weather a series of crises this year.That includes probing explosive sexual harassment allegations from a former engineer in February.A months long investigation into its work culture ultimately resulted in the departure of its CEO and cofounder Travis Kalanick in June.According to the lawsuit, Avendao provided written notice to Uber in June about the legal claims.She notified the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency of her complaints in June, too.
Included: A powerful new super PAC, NAACP's American Airlines alert:::::Welcome to Included, which catches you up on the week's top stories about culture and identity in business and tech.This week, we dive into a potential new black super PAC, the NAACP's new travel advisory, an illuminating study on sexism at work and more.A venerable new super PAC Some of corporate America's most powerful black executives reportedly taking steps to form a political action committee by early next year.The group would not be affiliated with any political party, but it plans to focus on issues of employment, education and voting rights, according to The New York Times.Its leaders reportedly include Infor CEO Charles Phillips, Lazard co-chair of investment banking Bill Lewis and Yumanity Therapeutics CEO Tony Coles."They plan to create three structures: a 'super PAC' to run political ads or host events; a federal PAC to support candidates; and a 501(c)(4) group, or social welfare nonprofit, that will do a mix of the two," writes the Times' Kate Kelly."What we've been doing is just writing checks for years, and we don't know what happened," Phillips said."We've got to learn from the Koch brothers, do what they do, have them sign pledges."Related: Soon, there will be just 3 black Fortune 500 CEOs NAACP sounds the alarm The NAACP issued a travel advisory on Tuesday "warning African Americans about their safety" when traveling with American Airlines.The notice stems from several troubling recent incidents, including four examples of black passengers being removed from their flights or their seats.These cases "suggest a corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias," said the NAACP, and "may represent only the 'tip of the iceberg' when it comes to American Airlines' documented mistreatment."The alert comes just months after the organization put out its first-ever travel alert, which urged minorities to travel "with extreme CAUTION" in the state of Missouri.Related: Get ready for a more militant and 'woke' NAACP "Gender inequality is due to bias, not differences in behavior" A study published in the Harvard Business Review used sensors (yes, sensors!)to track how men and women behave at work -- and found almost no noticeable difference.In tracking who people talked to, and for how long and when, researchers found that men and women had the same amount of face-time with senior leadership, the same contacts and similar scores on performance evaluations, among other variables.So what gives?If men and women act the same, why do men and women advance at different rates?It comes down to bias in and out of the office, the study suggested.Bias occurs when two groups "act identically but are treated differently," researchers said.In other words, if two groups act the same, the difference lies in how their actions are perceived.This, researchers said, could question "Lean In" and other mentorship programs that encourage women to alter their behavior to advocate more for themselves."If women talk to leadership at similar rates as men, then the problem isn't lack of access but how those conversations are viewed," researchers wrote.Related: How to fight 'subtle sexism' in the office Some of the things we're reading this week:
Walmart is putting even more robots in its stores:::::More robots may be coming to a Walmart near you.For the past three years, the company has been testing shelf-scanning robots in some stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California.The machines, which move up and down aisles, look for out-of-stock items and products that are mislabeled or incorrectly priced.They then flag these issues to store workers.On Thursday, Walmart (WMT) said it will expand the test to 50 stores.The bots are set to arrive in places like El Paso, Jacksonville and Fort Worth by the end of January.The company has been careful to pitch the robots as machinery to help staffers, not replace them.Related: 2017 just set the all-time record for store closings "We will always need great people in our stores working hard for our customers.This technology is a tool that helps our associates know where they can make the biggest difference for our customers," Walmart spokesman Justin Rushing told CNNMoney.Still, the move seems to be a harbinger of the retail world to come.With Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) cutting into foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores, many companies are opting to cut jobs.Automation could speed up that process.The good news for Walmart employees is that the company has had a strong 2017, bolstered by investments in its own online operation.Walmart is betting big that it can compete with Amazon with a string of takeovers, from its purchase of online marketplace Jet.com to its acquisition of Parcel, a 24-hour delivery service in New York City.The company is also experimenting with new technology in the delivery space.Last week, Walmart announced that it's testing a straight-to-your-fridge delivery service -- which customers can monitor via their phones using in-house cameras.
Amazon Key trades privacy for convenience:::::Amazon's latest service wants you to feel comfortable letting delivery people into your home to drop off your packages.The concept may sound a bit alarming, but the company says the service, called Amazon Key, for Amazon Prime members, is not only convenient but secure.Amazon Key is a two-part service with the Cloud Cam security camera and a compatible door lock.Users can let Amazon couriers into their homes while they are away and can keep watch through an app to make sure the drivers don't do anything besides deliver a package and leave.The Cloud Cam can be purchased separately, and collects and stores video clips for up to 30 days with a subscription.According to Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), couriers will be vetted with background checks and motor vehicle records reviews, and will only get access to homes once for each delivery.It's a pricey solution: $250 for the Amazon Key bundle, and security camera subscribers can pay for the Cloud Cam service starting at $69 per year.The move is a part of an effort to make deliveries easier for Amazon customers and keep packages safe from inclement weather or potential thieves.Walmart last month announced a similar service with smart lock company August.Critics say the benefits of the service, available starting next month in select markets, might not outweigh the potential privacy and security concerns.Not only will strangers and Amazon be entering your home, but it could become a target for hackers, too."I don't think people fully understand the ramifications of storing 24-hours of internal home surveillance video and audio that wouldn't necessarily equal what the tradeoffs are for convenience," says Katie Moussouris, founder of Luta Security.Related: Amazon will let delivery people inside your house People have long given up personal data in exchange for using products and services.For example, Facebook (FB, Tech30)is a free service that monetizes human data by selling targeted advertisements.Turning on location services on your phone lets maps and other apps track your whereabouts.Smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home are "always-on" listening devices that can connect to your calendar, Uber accounts, and more.The devices are triggered by a verbal command and act as your personal assistant.As companies provide more tech solutions to everyday problems -- such as not being home to sign for a package -- they're asking for permission to embed themselves deeper into our lives."We all have this tendency to decide what is worth it to us to give up some of that privacy," Moussouris said."Society is being steered right now by companies that see better ways to target ads or drive profit."The data collected via Cloud Cam won't be used for advertising purposes or in other Amazon products, the company confirmed to CNN Tech.According to analyst Michael Pachter with Wedbush Securities, Amazon Key is a way to sell cameras."I believe this 'service' is a Trojan Horse to enter the home security market," Pachter said."If Amazon can convince 10% of its estimated 55 million U.S. Prime members to buy a camera and sign up for a home security [system], it will generate well over $1 billion in revenue initially.It could conceivably generate another $500 million or more annually in service revenue."Related: Amazon's new plan aims to get teens hooked Although many consumers say they value privacy, some studies indicate that people will happily give that up for small incentives.According to research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, consumers are willing to relinquish privacy when offered incentives, or faced with additional steps to be more secure.In one part of the study, students were offered free pizza in exchange for friends' email addresses -- most students obliged.Further, when offered encryption on an account, a majority of the participants skipped setting up the privacy feature and chose an easier to implement but less secure option.There are also potential security concerns with Amazon Key that comes with adding an internet-connected device to the home.In 2016, the Mirai botnet, which is an an army of computers controlled by one hacker, used connected security cameras to take down major websites.Meanwhile, some hackers have been caught spying on people through webcams -- even built-in ones on Mac computers.If vulnerabilities are ever found in Amazon Key's software, a patch will have to go out quickly, Moussouris warned.Otherwise, the cameras could turn into a botnet, too.The Internet of Things is only growing -- as is Amazon's ecosystem of services.Research firm Gartner estimates there will be 20.4 billion IoT devices in use by 2020.With each new addition -- from books to groceries to Echo to Key -- the company is asking its consumers for both their trust and personal information.According to Vineetha Paruchuri, security researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, there's no perfect framework to help people make security decisions.And for some, the benefits and ease of use of smart technology are more important than the potential risks."A simple rule of thumb here could be to visualize the best case, average case, and worst case scenarios," Paruchuri said."See how each of those affect you, and [make] a call on whether you are equipped to deal with the fall out, and whether the tradeoffs are worth the convenience."
Tesla fired union supporters, UAW charges:::::Tesla fired workers because they were trying to start a union, according to a complaint by the United Auto Workers.The UAW, which is trying to organize at the upstart auto company, has asked the National Labor Relations Board to order the workers reinstated.Tesla says they were let go because of bad performance reviews.Other workers were intimidated, harassed and disciplined unfairly, the union says.It issued statements from what it said were union supporters at Tesla who were dismissed despite not having any problems on their reviews."I worked hard for this company for five years, sometimes 72 hours a week -- and never had any performance-related complaints," said Mike Williams, who the UAW says was fired for "performance issues" and being a bad influence on coworkers."I did, however, wear a union shirt," he said."And I had union stickers on my water bottle.And I believed that a union would make us safer, and would make the company more organized and more efficient."The employees were fired or harassed over the past six months, according to the complaint.The union says hundreds of employees have been dismissed in that time, though it didn't say how many it contends were fired for supporting a union.About 33,000 people work at Tesla.CEO Elon Musk has sparred with the UAW repeatedly over the past year as the organizing movement has tried to take hold.But the company says no employee has ever been punished for supporting a union.Tesla would not comment on the reasons that any specific employees, including Williams, were dismissed.It calls the complaint an organizing tactic by the union.Related: Tesla could face an uphill slog in China "At Tesla, we strive to be a fair and just company, the only kind worth being," the company said in a statement."Performance reviews result in promotions and occasionally in employee departures."The UAW has filed previous unfair labor practice complaints against Tesla, though never any that accused Tesla of firing people for backing the union movement.Tesla also faces a lawsuit in California state court claiming that it failed to provide two months' notice for layoffs as required by federal law.That suit, filed by a former employee, seeks two months' pay for the workers who were let go.Tesla says it is hiring to fill the "vast majority" of the positions left open by the terminations, and thus did not have to provide a notice of a layoff.It says the terminations took place in all areas of the company.Related: Tesla factory at center of discrimination lawsuits In addition to the disputes about firings, Tesla (TSLA) has been hit with four lawsuits in recent months from workers alleging racial, LGBT and gender discrimination at its plant in Fremont, California.Tesla has told CNNMoney that it takes all complaints seriously, but, "in the history of Tesla, there has never been a single proven case of discrimination against the company.Not one."Tesla is ramping up production of the Model 3, its first mass-market car.It has hundreds of thousands of potential customers who have put down $1,000 deposits and are waiting for one.But the company has had trouble meeting the production targets.In the third quarter, it built only 260 of the 1,500 cars it expected to build.The company blamed bottlenecks at its battery plant in Nevada and its assembly plant in California.
Yes, the NFL's TV ratings are down, but so is the rest of network television:::::Critics, including the President himself, have been quick to point out that the NFL's ratings are down.But what they won't tell you is that the NFL is down significantly less than the rest of broadcast television.Through week seven, the NFL is down 5% overall from the same point last year.That's a troubling drop for the biggest ratings powerhouse on TV, but it seems less dire when you consider that the four major networks are down an average 8% in prime time.NBC is down 4%, CBS is down 6%, ABC is down 11%, and Fox's prime time viewership dropped 20% through the first month of the new TV season, according to Nielsen data.And those numbers are down despite the inclusion of live sporting events, which usually bring in big audiences.The NFL's sluggish viewership may be less a symptom of the league's problems and more about what's happening in the TV environment overall.The landscape has become incredibly fragmented, thanks to a flood of programming and competition from streaming services and from the internet, not to mention a 24-hour news cycle that comes with a breathtaking amount of content.Television, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are all vying for the same eyeballs, and there are no signs that the deluge of programming will ebb any time soon.The numbers for network TV are also partially tied to the NFL's struggles, since CBS and NBC both broadcast games in prime time on Sunday and on Thursday nights."Regardless of the declines, the NFL is still by far the highest rated sport on TV and often the most watched broadcast on TV," said Brian Hughes, a senior vice president at Magna, which monitors audience trends."Last year when the ratings were down, it seemed like a shock.This year looks to be a part of a trend rather than a big disruption."The league's viewership took a hit last year, which means that not even the mighty NFL is immune to the changing world of TV.Some observers blamed the drop last season on a number of issues, one of which was a contentious presidential election.This year, the league's declines have been a focal point for President Trump, who has attacked the NFL over players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police violence.Executives and observers will continue to watch the NFL's ratings and try to figure out what's causing the falling viewership for the biggest show on TV.Critics have cited everything from lack of star power at the quarterback position to lopsided games as reasons for the down numbers.21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch offered another reason: over-saturation."You're asking a lot from customers to watch Thursday," Murdoch said at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday."They watch a lot more college football game on Saturdays, and then on Sundays, and then on Monday Night Football, etc.It's a lot.So I do think that preserving the scarcity value of those events and that audience is something that is worth thinking about."But as the falling broadcast numbers show, problems around TV ratings may be bigger than just the NFL.
Most Americans say success means not having to clean your own home:::::All Americans really want is a housekeeper.A recent survey conducted by Discover (DFS) asked 1,000 Americans to share what their lives would look like if they were successful.When asked what type of service employee would make them feel like they'd truly made it, 53% of respondents picked a housekeeper.Less than half, or 40%, of respondents said the help of a financial adviser would make them feel successful, and 39% said a groundskeeper or gardener would do the trick.About a third, or 30%, said a personal trainer would make them feel rich.Overwhelmingly, respondents said they just want to travel.Nearly 9 out of ten respondents, or 87%, said that the ability to take vacations was an important metric of success.Related: What wealth means to women When asked about their homes and cars, most respondents said they'd need an upgrade to feel prosperous.On average, respondents valued their homes at $203,000 -- and their dream homes at $408,000.Similarly, respondents said on average that their ideal car would be worth twice as much as the one they have now.The results echo those of the Charles Schwab Modern Wealth Index, which found that 24% of Americans defined "wealth" as being comfortable or enjoying life, and 22% as having material items or being able to afford anything.Just over one quarter of respondents, or 27%, said they see wealth as having money or lots of money.Related: The jobs market is strong.Here's the asterisk.Many Americans have reason to feel dissatisfied with their current incomes.The stock market has surged since Donald Trump was elected president, but the rally has done little to improve the finances of many Americans.According to the Fed, barely one-third of the families in the bottom 50% of earners own any stocks.And while the job market is strong -- unemployment is at a 16-year low -- wage growth is weak, making it harder for consumers to keep up with inflation.
Kellogg's gets rid of racially insensitive art on Corn Pops box:::::Kellogg's says it's changing the art on its Corn Pops cereal box after a consumer complained it was racist."Kellogg is committed to diversity & inclusion," tweeted the Kellogg' (K)s company on Wednesday."We did not intend to offend -- we apologize.The artwork is updated & will be in stores soon."The company's statement came after an author named Saladin Ahmed tweeted an image of the Corn Pops box, which depicts dozens of yellow-hued Corn Pop characters, except for the lone brown Corn Pop in a blue uniform pushing a floor buffer."hey @KelloggsUS why is literally the only brown corn pop on the whole cereal box the janitor?This is teaching kids racism," tweeted Ahmed.hey @KelloggsUS why is literally the only brown corn pop on the whole cereal box the janitor?this is teaching kids racism.pic.twitter.com/Nh7M7IFawW Saladin Ahmed (@saladinahmed) October 24, 2017 Kellogg's reply came about five hours after Ahmed's original tweet that morning, presumably during breakfast.Ahmed replied that he appreciated the "rapid response."Since then, many of his tweets have either been pitching his upcoming comic book "Abbott," which he describes as a supernatural crime thriller set in his home town of Detroit, or complaining about getting "hate retweeted" by racists.Ahmed has published several science fiction novels, including "Throne of the Crescent Moon" in 2012, which was nominated for Hugo and Nebula Awards.Kellogg's and Ahmed's publishers Penguin Random House and Boom!Studios did not immediately return messages from CNNMoney.Ahmed did not immediately respond to a message on Twitter.Related: Dove 'missed the mark' with racially insensitive ad A string of companies have come under scrutiny for racially insensitive advertising, like a Dove ad earlier this month which prompted the company to admit it "missed the mark."But Cheerios received attention of a different kind when it featured a mixed race couple and child in a commercial in 2013, which won praise from some consumers, but backlash from racists.
How much has Bill O'Reilly's star power faded?:::::It still isn't clear if Bill O'Reilly will ever return to television.What is clear is that he probably won't ever regain his previous star power unless he does.In the six months since he was fired by Fox News over the revelation of multiple settlements paid to women who had accused him of sexual harassment and of inappropriate behavior, O'Reilly has become decidedly less visible.After reaching millions of people each night on "The O'Reilly Factor," long the number one show on cable news, O'Reilly now commands a significantly smaller audience online.Related: Bill O'Reilly 'mad at God' over sexual misconduct allegations But it is a testament to the O'Reilly brand that "Killing England," his latest book and the first to hit shelves since his ouster at Fox, has still been a commercial success.It's claimed the top spot on the hardcover nonfiction category of the New York Times' best seller list for the last three weeks, even besting "What Happened," the highly-anticipated new memoir from Hillary Clinton.But its sales have been dwarfed by previous installments in O'Reilly's wildly successful "Killing" series, a collection of pop history books he's co-authored with Martin Dugard."Killing England" sold 212,000 copies in the four weeks since its September 19th release, according to The NPD Group, a marketing research company that measures book sales.It's the lowest opening month of sales since the first title in the series, 2011's "Killing Lincoln," which sold 190,000 in the first four weeks.Related: Bill O'Reilly's 'Killing England' sees sales drop from last 'Killing' book The previous five "Killing" books each outsold "Killing England" in their first month on shelves by more than 100,000 copies.Two books, "Killing Patton" and "Killing Jesus," each eclipsed 400,000 copies in the four weeks following their release.But O'Reilly's future as an author was thrust into uncertainty on Thursday, when William Morris Endeavor, which handles his book deals, said it will drop him as a client after his contract expires.Before that, O'Reilly was dropped by United Talent Agency, where his television agent there represented him for decades.The abrupt cancellation of the "O'Reilly Factor," which drew nearly four million people on some evenings, denied O'Reilly a precious promotional vehicle.Night after night, O'Reilly hawked his myriad bestsellers, urging viewers to become premium members of his official website in exchange for a copy of one of the books.O'Reilly was able to use Fox to promote "Killing England," going on Sean Hannity's talk show last month for what was a highly-rated episode.The Washington Post reported previously that O'Reilly's book sales dipped precipitously after he was sacked by Fox in April.And O'Reilly's chances of staging a TV comeback may have been severely damaged last weekend, when the New York Times reported on a $32 million settlement paid to a former Fox News personality who accused O'Reilly of sexual misconduct.Related: Does Bill O'Reilly still have a future on TV?O'Reilly decried the latest revelation as a smear and accused the Times, which also reported on the settlements that led to his firing in the spring, of trying to take him out of the marketplace.Earlier this week on his podcast, "No Spin News," O'Reilly claimed that the Times was motivated by the success of his new book and fledgling online enterprise."And so the New York Times said, 'You know, we didn't kill him, so we've got to kill him again,'" O'Reilly said."So they came back with another bunch of garbage.""No Spin News," which is posted four nights a week on O'Reilly's website and can be accessed only by a paid membership, has become his primary post-Fox platform.O'Reilly has repeatedly touted the success of the show, which is sometimes recorded in studio space owned by Newsmax, a conservative outlet that has been floated as a possible landing spot.In June, O'Reilly told Newsmax that the show draws "hundreds of thousands" of people.He said this week that his website had more than 300,000 visitors on Monday night, when he used "No Spin News" to deliver a dramatic rebuttal to the allegations.But the site traffic has dried up in the months since he was dropped by Fox.According to comScore, a data analytics company, BillOReilly.com drew 469,000 visitors in April, the month of his firing.But O'Reilly was unable to sustain that audience throughout the summer and, last month, the site had only 125,000 visitors, its lowest total in two years.The site now serves as O'Reilly's primary promotional vehicle and, just as he did for years on the "Factor," he dutifully promotes his merchandise to people who are still buying what he's selling.On Wednesday's edition of his show, O'Reilly read a message from one such fan."Bill, any time the media puts out fake stories about you," the fan wrote."I purchase something on BillOReilly.com."
A bond market freakout could derail the rally in stocks:::::Historically low interest rates are a critical ingredient in the remarkable stock market rally.All that easy money has fanned the flames by keeping borrowing costs low and forcing investors to take a gamble on risky stocks because bonds hardly make any money.But what if the recipe of steady economic growth and extremely low rates suddenly changed?A rapid spike in interest rates could disrupt or even derail the relentless run on Wall Street.Investors were dealt a fresh reminder of the market's addiction to ultra-low rates this week as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.44%, the highest since March.The closely watched Treasury rate, which moves opposite the price, is up dramatically from 2.27% on October 16.The selloff in bonds has been driven in part by expectations for faster growth and concerns that President Trump's choice to lead the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively than Janet Yellen would.Some also worry that Trump's proposed tax overhaul could overheat the economy.The sudden move in rates led star bond investor Jeff Gundlach to warn on Twitter that "obituaries need to be written" for the 30-year bull market in bonds if the momentum doesn't reverse soon."The moment of truth has arrived," the billionaire said.Mike LaBella, portfolio manager at QS Investors, believes rates are still low enough to keep the party going in the stock market."But if rates climb at this accelerated pace, that could potentially hinder this recovery.Well above 3% or closer to 4% would definitely be alarming," LaBella said.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Of course, it's way too early to say the great bull market in bonds is done.And steadily rising interest rates aren't a bad thing.If anything, investors alarmed by how long rates have remained extremely low would welcome a return to normalcy.As would those who own shares of banks, which have struggled to make money in the low-rate environment.That's why Wall Street has largely applauded the Federal Reserve's efforts to gradually raise interest rates."The economy can absorb slowly rising interest rates," said Art Hogan, chief equity strategist at Wunderlich Securities.But he conceded that the recent spike is "not gradual" and has forced investors to "sit up and take notice."It's no secret that ultra-low rates helped fuel the bull market in stocks.Bond returns are so low that investors are willing to accept more risk in stocks, even stocks that are very, very expensive by historical standards.After getting accustomed to low rates for nearly a decade, investors may be caught off guard by a sudden spike in rates.The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research published a heat map this week identifying weaknesses in the U.S. financial system.Just one of the map's six categories flashed red, signaling high vulnerability: market risk.Within that category, the report indicated that the biggest risk is that the market is unprepared for higher rates.Related: Caution: U.S. stocks have rarely been this expensive Trump's effort to overhaul the tax system could push rates higher.If it gets through Congress, tax reform could spook the bond market by adding to the federal deficit or overstimulating a healthy economy.And the bond market could sell off if the European Central Bank and the Fed unwind their emergency bond-buying programs more aggressively than investors have been anticipating.Yet Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital, thinks it's "silly" to predict the end of the bond bull market because Treasury rates remain very low, hovering just above their five-year average.And bond bulls believe demand will stay high because the population of the world's major economies is getting older, and those people want safe, steady income."That's a trend that isn't ending anytime soon," LeBas said.If that's true, rising rates may pose a risk to the stock market, but perhaps not an imminent one.
Launching the Dodge Demon on a drag strip:::::I have mixed feelings about the Dodge Challenger Demon.It's both an engineering masterpiece and, frankly, kind of dumb.It's an 840 horsepower Dodge Challenger muscle car that has been engineered specifically to do two things: Run the quarter mile in under 10 seconds and lift its front wheels off the ground during a hard launch.So, at the big automaker party where all the other car companies are talking about solving the world's transportation issues with electric cars and automated driving, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Dodge's parent company, is challenging everyone to a chugging contest.And that obnoxiousness will, of course, be the talk of the evening.That's the whole point.Sometimes the best way to cut through all the chatter is with a lot of noise and a big cloud of smoke.So when Dodge asked me to come down to a drag strip to try it myself, of course I said "I'm in."Next to me in the Demon was Jim Wilder, one of the engineers who created the car.(Passenger seats in the Demon are optional.Jim's seat cost $1.00.)He talked me through the steps required to launch a car down the drag strip.It's not easy as just mashing down the gas pedal.First, smoke the back tires.It's a must-do before a drag strip run.Spinning the rear tires against the pavement like rubber sanding belts heats them up, which helps them to stick more, and also removes pebbles and grit from the tires' surface.Fortunately, the Demon has a setting just for this.I selected "Line Lock" on the car's computer display screen, held down the "OK" button on steering then pressed the gas pedal.The front brakes stayed firmly locked while the back tires noisily spun out a cloud of rubber-scented smoke.That was the easy part.The next part actually required skill.I could have just used the "Launch Control" setting the Demon has, just like most performance cars these days.With that, the car could, on my command, perform a perfectly executed take off, meting out power to the back tires for maximum speed with minimum tire spin.There are other launch methods, too, but Wilder suggested that, as a raw beginner, I use the simple two-foot technique.I kept one foot on the brake and used the other to press the gas pedal, getting the engine to around 1,200 RPM.Then when the time was right, I released the brake and pounced on the gas.At first, the back tires spun uselessly against the track.I let up on the gas and the tires finally caught against the track's surface.The Demon's nose lifted up and the road ahead came rushing in towards us while my helmeted head squeezed against the headrest.There was a monstrous "Whooosh!"as the Demon's supercharger sucked in air like a giant filling its lungs.It was an impressive performance especially as I got better at it.Even more so when Wilder himself did it.The closest thing I'd ever experienced was a Tesla Model S in Ludicrous mode but, still, that's like comparing badminton to a bar fight.There is far more violence in the Demon.Out on the street, the Demon is surprisingly comfortable.This one I drove had all its seats and a pile of comfort options.The drag-tuned front suspension is old-sofa soft.Driving it at slow speeds reminded me of the Oldsmobile I used in driver's ed in the 1980s.Until, of course, for what happened when I pressed the gas pedal.Fiat Chrysler will only make 3,300 Demons with prices starting at $85,000.But Dodge executives say the Challenger, of all sorts, is having its best retail sales year in history and they credit the Demon for attracting that audience.Those are the performance numbers that really matter.
American Airlines CEO: 'We want to be even better' on race relations:::::American Airlines CEO Douglas Parker said Thursday his airline can do a better job in race relations with its customers.Two days after the NAACP issued a "travel advisory" saying that it has noticed "a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African-American passengers, specific to American Airlines," Parker told Wall Street analysts that executives are disappointed with the criticism because American (AAL) prides itself on its "inclusiveness and diversity."But he also said there is room for improvement."Discrimination, exclusion and unconscious biases are enormous problems that no one has mastered, and we would never suggest that we have it all figured out either," he said."What we know is we want to keep learning and we want to be even better."Related: NAACP warns black passengers about traveling with American Airlines He repeated an earlier statement that he hoped to meet with leaders of the NAACP about its complaints."Organizations like the NAACP can help us.So we welcome the opportunity to work with them," he said."Indeed, we are excited about it and enthusiastic to sit down and listen and learn together."Parker's statement Thursday goes beyond his initial response Wednesday, in which he said he was disappointed with the advisory and vowed, "We do not and will not tolerate discrimination of any kind."The civil rights group's statement earlier this week cited four examples of black passengers who were forced to give up their seats or were removed from flights.The group said the incidents "suggest a corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias," and advised travelers to exercise caution."Booking and boarding flights on American Airlines could subject them [to] disrespectful, discriminatory or unsafe conditions," the advisory said.But Parker's statement Thursday was encouraging, said Hilary Shelton, the NAACP's Washington bureau director and senior vice president for advocacy and policy.He said it recognized the need to address problems."I'm delighted to see that American Airlines is at least saying the right things now," Shelton told CNNMoney."Our hope is that they are able to follow through with something much more comprehensive."The NAACP has called for boycotts of companies and places in the past, but this was only the second time it has issued a travel advisory, Shelton said.Over the summer, it issued an advisory for travel to Missouri, citing several instances of discrimination as reason for black visitors to use "extreme caution."The decision to issue a warning about American Airlines came after the NAACP fielded roughly two dozen complaints over the past two years, Shelton said.The decision was also driven by higher-profile incidents.Civil rights activist Tamika Mallory said she was removed from a New York-bound flight after her seat was changed without her consent.Shelton stressed that the American Airlines advisory was not a boycott.He likened it to a warning from the State Department when it deems a country dangerous to visit."They have to make a decision," he said of black fliers who are thinking of booking on American."Is that the airline you want to get on?But they'll have the information, the experiences that have occurred, and hopefully very soon, how American Airlines is going to respond to this, so they can make that informed decision."Shelton said the NAACP has received complaints about other airlines, but none as consistently as American."There is a pattern that has come up -- a pattern and a practice that is deeply concerning," he said.He added that his office in Washington has received two dozen complaints about American since the advisory was posted, including some from employees who have raised concerns about their experiences inside the company.-- CNNMoney's Rob McLean contributed to this report.
Twitter pulls RT, Sputnik advertising:::::Twitter has pulled all advertising bought by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik on its platform after concluding that both news organizations attempted to interfere with the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Russia."This decision was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 U.S. election and the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government," Twitter said in a statement.RT and Sputnik accounts will be allowed to continue producing content on Twitter, but can no longer advertise on the social network.Additionally, Twitter said it would donate the $1.9 million of ad revenue it has received from RT to external research into Twitter's role in civic engagement and elections.Related: From Silicon Valley to Staten Island, Russian troll sites kept online by American companies The announcement comes one week before a public hearing on Capitol Hill in which Twitter, Facebook and Google will address the roles they inadvertently played in Russia's efforts to meddle in American politics.RT and Sputnik are both Russian state-owned media organizations.In January, an intelligence community assessment said both networks had been used as part of a Russian influence campaign aimed at denigrating Hillary Clinton and undermining the integrity of the 2016 presidential election.Twitter said it made its decision about RT and Sputnik based on its own internal research and those companies inclusion in the January 2017 intelligence report.Responding to the announcement on Twitter, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said RT was "an exemplary @Twitter partner," then took a shot at its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, who she said had encouraged RT to buy ads around the 2016 election."Hope @jack won't forget to tell @congressdotgov how @Twitter pitched @RT_com to spend big $$s on US elex ad campaign."Simonyan included in her tweet a picture that appeared to show a proposal for RT advertising on Twitter.An RT spokesperson also sent CNN a link to an RT article published Thursday headlined, "Revealed: How Twitter pushes RT to spend big on 2016 US election."In response, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN: "We do not have any comment on our private conversations with any advertiser, even a former advertiser."Sputnik's press office told CNN, "Sputnik has never used advertising on Twitter.Sputnik news channels are followed by people who are tired of the mainstream media and who are looking for an alternative perspective on the news."
Companies are looking for diverse ad teams to avoid blunders:::::CoverGirl executive Ukonwa Ojo was struck when the team from an ad agency entered the room to pitch ideas for revamping the cosmetic company's image.For the first time in Ojo's more than 20-year career in business, she found herself working with an African-American creative director.That meeting would ultimately result in a marketing campaign that challenges conventional ideas about beauty.It features celebrity women from a spectrum of races, ages and professions, including Issa Rae of HBO's "Insecure," motorcycle racer Shelina Moreda, celebrity chef Ayesha Curry and dietitian Maye Musk, 69."To have an African-American creative director walk in the room and present this to me, I thought, 'Oh, my God, this is amazing,'" said Ojo, who is Nigerian-American."I think we can see the power of the work because of that."Diversity in the advertising industry is becoming a higher priority for consumer product companies as they try to reach a new generation of customers with evolving sensibilities on ethnicity, age, gender and sexuality.Many companies have come to believe that having people with a variety of backgrounds in the room can not only produce a smarter marketing campaign but also help avoid the kind of blunders Kellogg and Dove were recently accused of in today's politically combustible environment.Despite efforts by Madison Avenue to ramp up recruiting of minorities, just 7 percent of the 67,000 people working as advertising and promotion managers in the U.S. in 2016 were African-American, less than 5 percent were Hispanic, and about 1 percent were of Asian descent, according to the U.S. Labor Department.Women accounted for about 56 percent of managers in the industry.In the case of CoverGirl's makeover, which replaced the company's familiar "Easy, Breezy, Beautiful" tagline with "I Am What I Makeup," the team from the ad agency Droga5 had two black creative directors, Shannon Washington and Ray Smiling."The team that worked on this idea and this campaign came from very different backgrounds from a male and female point of view, different races, different ages," Droga5 CEO Sarah Thompson said."I think that more than before, what's important is getting that narrative, that story, right and really pressure-testing.Is it authentic?Is there anything that is going to be misinterpreted?"On Wednesday, Kellogg apologized after the artwork on its Corn Pops cereal boxes was attacked as racist.The box shows cartoon Corn Pops hanging out in a mall.The only brown one depicted is a janitor scrubbing the floor.Dove was similarly criticized earlier this month over a commercial for a body wash. A short version of the video on Facebook showed a black woman taking off her shirt to reveal a white woman, who then removed her top to reveal a woman with a brown complexion.Social media users accused Dove of suggesting black skin is dirty.Dove pulled the video, while Kellogg said new artwork for the cereal box will soon reach stores.Neither Unilever, the company that owns Dove, nor Kellogg has said who was behind the content.Other brands, including Pepsi, Gap and Nivea, have faced similar controversies.Ojo, who before joining CoverGirl was senior global director at Unilever, said her former company "always had the best intentions," but "as humans we always have the opportunities to make a mistake."She added: "It can minimize the chances if you have the right people around the table."Having more diversity around the table is seen as a safeguard at a time when companies are under pressure to produce lots of video and other marketing content quickly and cheaply for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, often with no time to test everything out on focus groups."In the good old days, you would have the time to take your TV ad or print campaign and do further testing.You would see how they are rating A and B ad," said Gene Fischer, senior vice president of media innovation at Publicis Health Media."The world of social media doesn't allow for that."Aside from trying to diversify their own ranks, some marketers are turning for help to small agencies that cater to specific ethnic groups.Being Latino, a social media marketing company, has crafted ads for Bud Light, Snickers and Coca-Cola."My entire company, every employee comes from the culture that we are trying to appeal to," said Being Latino founder Lance Rios."We know the do's and the don'ts."Tiffany R. Warren, chief diversity officer at Omnicom, the parent of the some of the nation's biggest advertising agencies, got her start in 1997 through an industry program to recruit top minority students out of college.Since then, however, she has often been the only black woman in the room."I know my presence in the room had led to a lot of meaningful conversations and led to creative products that were more culturally sensitive," said Warren, who is also founder of the nonprofit group ADCOLOR, which promotes diversity in the creative fields.
Amazon's new service will allow drivers to enter your home to deliver packages:::::Amazon announced today that it is launching a service that allows a driver not only to drop a package off at your doorstep but also to go inside your home even when you are not there to make a delivery.Interested in Amazon?Add Amazon as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Amazon news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The tech giant's new in-home delivery feature, Amazon Key, which was announced on "Good Morning America" today, lets customers opt to employ an app, a camera and a smart lock to oversee when parcels are delivered inside their homes.Amazon "A lot of customers would love having their packages delivered in their home even when theyre not there," Peter Larsen, Amazon's vice president of delivery technology, told ABC News, saying the new service comes in response to customer requests.Amazon Key works by alerting customers by phone when a driver arrives at their home and scans their package.That triggers a signal to the Amazon Cloud that verifies the driver, and then the Amazon Cloud unlocks a smart lock on the front door.Amazon Meanwhile, a camera inside the home begins recording, and customers can watch the delivery live or watch the video later.The in-home delivery service will come at no additional cost for the 85 million Amazon Prime subscribers, after they purchase the Amazon Key In-Home Kit, starting at $249.99, which includes the new Amazon Cloud Cam and a compatible smart lock.Larsen addressed the skepticism that many may feel about remotely allowing a stranger to enter their home, telling ABC News that all drivers will be "background checked.""Amazon is really focused on safety and security for all of our customers across the board," he said."These drivers are the same drivers that you know and trust to deliver your Amazon packages today.They're background checked, and they are approved to deliver for Amazon."Larsen acknowledged the cybersecurity concerns some customers may raise when using technology that controls access into their home, saying "all of the devices are encrypted.""The data traveling between the devices and the Amazon Cloud is encrypted," he said, adding that Amazon has an "over-the-air update system so we can update all of the devices if we need to."Amazon Key users have the option to turn off the smart lock whenever they choose, requiring a physical key for entry.Amazon In addition to delivery services, people can use Amazon Key to remotely allow friends or family members to enter their homes without a key.Amazon announced that it hopes to use the new technology to let service providers, such as housekeepers and dog walkers, have access to homes.In a statement announcing the release of Amazon Key, Larsen added that the service can give people "peace of mind" in knowing that their orders "are waiting for them when they walk through their doors."Amazon The new delivery service is one way online retailers are working to combat parcel theft, which is estimated to affect millions of Americans annually.Amazon Key will become available Nov. 8 in 37 U.S. cities.ABC News' Taylor Dunn contributed to this report.
US 30-year mortgage rates rise to 3.94 percent:::::The costs of borrowing to buy a home increased slightly this week, but U.S. mortgage rates are still near relative lows.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose to 3.94 percent from 3.88 percent last week.At this time last year, the benchmark rate was 3.47 percent.The historic average was roughly 6 percent.Long-term home loan rates tend to track the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes.The interest charged on 10-year Treasury notes has risen since early September, possibly in anticipation of tax cuts pushed by President Donald Trump that could cause the amount of government debt to climb.Average mortgage rates began to rise after Trump's election nearly a year ago in anticipation of tax cuts, climbing to as high as 4.32 percent at the end of last year.But rates began to slope downward again this year as the intended tax overhaul is unfolding at a slower and less certain pace than what the president promised.The lower borrowing costs have helped preserve some affordability for would-be homebuyers, who are finding that home prices are severely outpacing incomes.The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, rose to 3.25 percent from 3.19 percent last week.A year ago, the 15-year rate was 2.78 percent.The average rate on the five-year, adjustable-rate mortgage increased to 3.21 percent from 3.17 percent last week.
Southwest beats 3Q profit forecasts:::::Southwest Airlines overcame hurricanes, higher fuel prices and slightly lower fares to boost third-quarter profit 30 percent.The airline predicted Thursday that a measure of pricing power will be stronger in the fourth quarter than it was in the third, in line with forecasts from rivals.A key to the quarter was Southwest's ability to hold labor costs in check while benefiting from solid travel demand that is lifting the U.S. airline industry.Southwest, which carries more passengers inside the U.S. than any other airline, said it earned $503 million, up from $388 million a year earlier.CEO Gary Kelly and other executives were scheduled to speak with analysts later Thursday.Investors will be looking for reassurance that Southwest won't grow too fast and put down downward pressure on fares.Regular customers will be more interested to hear more about Southwest's recently announced plan to begin flying to Hawaii.The airline hasn't said when those flights will start.Excluding special items such as costs to settle fuel-hedging contracts, the Dallas company said it earned 88 cents per share.That was a penny better than analysts had predicted, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.Revenue was up 3 percent to $5.27 billion, just shy of expectations.Southwest canceled 5,000 flights and lost $100 million in revenue in the third quarter due to hurricanes Harvey shut down its operations in Houston for several days.The average one-way fare slipped 2 percent to $143.67.Another revenue figure, the cost to fly a seat one mile, which is tracked closely by airline investors, fell 0.5 percent.Southwest said the same figure would rise by up to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, a hint of higher fares to come.The company spent 7 percent more on fuel but 6 percent less on labor than it did a year earlier.Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. edged lower by 39 cents, to $56.75, more than an hour before the opening bell.Through Wednesday, the shares had gained 15 percent this year.Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.Access a Zacks stock report on LUV at https://www.zacks.com/ap/LUV
Lord & Taylor sells its flagship Manhattan store to WeWork:::::Lord & Taylor's flagship store in Manhattan, known for its holiday displays along Fifth Avenue, is being sold to the office space sharing company WeWork.The nearly 100-year-old building will be converted to WeWork headquarters, with less than a quarter of the space remaining for a Lord & Taylor store.Ten of the building's 11 floors are now devoted to retail.WeWork attracts millennials who are looking to share office space, a consumer segment that Lord & Taylor owner Hudson's Bay and other department stores want to attract.So store executives expect the stores to benefit from WeWork members going in and out of the building, and hopes they'll be shopping.Lord & Taylor will keep the whole building with its usual operations through next year's holiday season.And the holiday displays will continue to go on this year and next year, a company spokeswoman said.The department store was the first to create Christmas windows for sheer entertainment, rather than for selling merchandise.It also pioneered the animated window display back in 1938.Company officials declined to share details for what the redesigned Lord & Taylor store of about 150,000 square feet will look like.The $850 million sale, announced Tuesday, is part of a plan by Hudson's Bay Co., which owns Lord & Taylor owns stores under its own brand as well as Saks Fifth Avenue, to pare down debt and reinvigorate sales.Richard Baker, chairman of Hudson's Bay, told The Associated Press that WeWork will also lease space in the upper floors in three of the company main stores Hudson's Bay stores in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, as well as its Galeria Kaufhof in Frankfurt, Germany.Department stores have been struggling to follow their customers online, with many closing stores and selling lucrative real estate.Big chains like Macy's had been under pressure from shareholders to get more value out of their real estate holdings.But the Hudson's Bay deal with WeWork is a change in how retailers are trying to capitalize on their real estate."We definitely think there is a future for department stores for people who reinvest in the business," Baker said.On Friday, Hudson's Bay had said that CEO Jerry Storch would step down at the end of the month.Follow Anne D'Innocenzio at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio
Union Pacific's 3Q profit grows 6 percent despite challenges:::::Union Pacific delivered a 6 percent improvement in third-quarter profit even though it hauled 1 percent less freight and dealt with disruptions from Hurricane Harvey.The Omaha, Nebraska, railroad it earned $1.19 billion, or $1.50 per share, in the third quarter.That's up from $1.13 billion, or $1.36 per share, a year ago.Union Pacific said Thursday that one-time events related to Hurricane Harvey, laying off 800 workers, a land sale and a lawsuit settlement created a net 5 cent drag on earnings in the quarter.The industry analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had expected the railroad to report earnings per share of $1.49.The company's revenue of $5.41 billion topped the $5.31 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street.Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee said the railroad delivered solid core results and increased freight rates during the quarter.Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz said he's optimistic about the railroad's prospects next year as the economy is expected to continue growing slowly and the truck market is likely to be tight.The layoffs and other cost cuts Union Pacific made this year should help it remain competitive."We think that decision made us much more agile," Fritz said about the layoffs.Shares of Union Pacific Corp., which have increased slightly more than 6 percent since the beginning of the year, rose 4 percent, or $4.49, to sell for $114.76 Thursday.Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.Access a Zacks stock report on UNP at https://www.zacks.com/ap/UNP

rhymes with stitches.What are you doing here?I can see it's on the book.Are you blurring it out.Blurring it out right there.You did start with a warning.I start the book with a warning.Listen, here's how I wrote the book because I -- I voted for Hillary Clinton but I didn't want to, okay.I thought she was a terrible candidate.They don't know what to clap for.[ Laughter That's like, Donald Trump, I didn't vote for Donald Trump obviously.I knew Donald Trump.He did a cameo on an ABC sitcom I did years ago called "The job."He also did a tinge on "The apprentice" for my foundation.He was a nice guy.He was generous.He was on time.He knew his lines when he had them memorized but he was a different color.He was white.He was actually -- he made me look like I was a dark skinned person.He was so white so it was a different guy.But he -- whatever you want to say about trump, he has changed the game.So after the election I did -- I do this concert every year for the cancer foundation at T.D.Garden.This year it's November 18th.Yeah.So four days after the election, I did a concert and what I basically did was go up and stage and vent against Hillary and against trump and the audience was explosive so people -- I could tell they had -- half voted for Hillary and half voted for trump so to me I thought I got to write ray book about it because it got more and more divisive and nothing is getting done.So in trump's world which he's changed the game, celebrities can now become president so I think we have to look at it that's why I said George 2020.Weed to to stop -- yeah, let's change the process.I want to have -- talk about so you think you can dance or "Dancing with the stars" we should have a reality show to elect the next president.Someone said we already did that.Right.I mean, because the debates suck.We don't learn anything at the debates so I say you have a 13-week reality show called "President idol" as Howard Stern was calling it or I call it "America's got leaders."Four celebrity judge answer have all these people that want to run for 1 week, give them tanks, make them dance, sing, whatever you want to do and on November 2nd or 7th we vote by phone.That's it.No electric tort college.That's it.The winner is the winner.I mean I think that's the future, you know.Something to think about.It's so scary.Nick lachey would be a great presidential candidate on that show.I'm telling you.Justin Timberlake could be president.I think we need a woman.I want Oprah.Yay.There we go.I want Oprah.There you go.Because --S if.Oprah would be so great because you know every three weeks she'd give us free stuff.You know what I mean.That wouldn't suck.That would be great.That would be awesome.So anyway the book is about -- it starts with the election and just want to remind I'm out to make people laugh their asses off but I want to talk about racism.All the stuff that was so divisive that's still happening, racism and sexism and all that stuff and make people laugh about how twisted we have been in the last couple of years.And that we don't suck.And we don't suck?That is nice and remind ourselves how great of a country we are and like my democratic friends have lost their sense of humor.My Republican friends have lost their sense of humor and nothing is getting done.Look at the carvilles.No, no, no.You don't want me to be president.I'd be impeached within four months.All I would do can just a free beer for everybody.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.But you can doesn't "Why we don't suck," it's out today.Out today.Are we done?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

'Real Biz With Rebecca Jarvis': Hyperloop One co-founder Video:::::Transcript for 'Real Biz With Rebecca Jarvis': Hyperloop One co-founder Hey everybody I'm Rebecca Jarvis happy Friday welcome to reeled is here coming to you live from ABC news.We have a great guests today with us Schuermann commissioned art he is co-founder.She'll avengers and co-founder of virgin hyper loop one looking out my paper because.Your company hyper loop want you just got to name change because of the big investment from none other than Richard Branson this week hyper loop one knows sell this big investment.From a Richard Branson you also are now changing the name to virgin hyper loop one true.Tell people out there who haven't heard about hyper loop one until now what idiots like an all about.Well I believe one is revolutionary new transportation.Company and that is pursuing the idea that you on Moscow originally proposed.During transportation that airline speeds and into.And the way you accomplished.You basically in venture on sky in side of the steel tube.You create a vacuum in your vacuum you basically suck out here of that vacuum.For the same time you have levitation on the parallel tracks city of the pot actually levitating about it and should above two of a Christian and there are.Then you have a propulsion system the U we've invented over the last three years since just got enormous the company.The propulsion system.We've invented from Scruggs and we manufacture in Vegas.That is probably the biggest breakthrough that we've done he engineers.Virgin have removed one now.Are are really some of the very the most brilliant minds in the world.And just struggle is one of those I say.He's got one of those Manhattan Project type of brains.He can actually.You know invent these things created and build it was time incredible people around the world that he's been able to recruit.So now or it's last summer we reached a major milestones and actually.Launch the first pod.We didn't launch in North Las Vegas and in the deserts of Vegas.We bought the land.And thanks to the leadership of the governor and manner of governor of Nevada and the mayor of North Las Vegas we are able to accelerate the regulatory process.So we didn't have the usual obstacles that should build the structure and the structure is pretty epic it's.About two million pounds and we Bolton eleven months.Which will get to in a second is a signal.There were living in a pretty historical time we're actually able to build these tapes and shod.Challenges and faster periods of time than any other time in human history.That should get a lot of hope to people who are watching if they have dreams of building.You know incredible things that might seem impossible and and you know there are.We're here to tell you that this is actually in our over if you are you know.Have the tenacity and the commitment you can ban together with a bunch of people who also are believers.They make ideas that seem like Tennessee is actually real.We're living in a time where private companies are doing what nations used to do.You on this shooting rockets into the sky right.He's trying to colonize Mars.You sound like you know science fiction books I think that we grew up.Something like Asimov would have dream 4050 years ago.Except now it's not just streams in science fiction.This session the reality of our lives.Her physical laws so there's George Jess and dreams and cartoons that we June grew up was.And tables.Welcome to the future.I want to let people out there who are listening to you sure tonight top now.That we're taking your questions you can post your questions below I also have questions here from many of you who have already written to me on Twitter.I'm sure there will be a lot of that because.This whole thing everything that you described it is sort of like at page street Adams five but it isn't coming to life gives you had your test mission in that would could you call it a test mission load Goldberg hitting a moment your yacht it is losing your first flight how the first flight go how far.Did you did it actually helped.And two great questions so we Dylan.Pond and may and June unmanned July.We actually tested the entire system full skilled so this is a says two million pounds.The to really build on pile ons in the desert.With a fully integrated system.It's about almost twelve feet wide so it seems pretty much.It's above ground above ground an.I wanna just clarify for people because Ilan mosque between mention was one of the first people to start talking about this he has his boring company and their underground frighten him so can you let her above ground they're under I don't know we know it's not.So the on the choice point yes as you can you can do above ground now for version of who won you can also do.Underground for the tunneling they need and also do on the ground so many of you base of the use right of way is exempt existing right of ways.To build this.And you can also basically tunnel on borer your way and so.Now art it be going back to the original enough art at Al so me this structure.It's 500 meters long.What we do with the pod and and in the actual full full house.We we when 290 miles per hour in 500 feet and stop safely.So bit of mistrust us of seeing you know in that kind of environment could be make this happen we see if we break the answer was yes.The key thing that's important for you in the audience to understand.Is that all of the system and everything that we've built in the tests that we showed actually proves that we will get to settlement miles per hour.The only limitation was the distance of the tube itself.Still the tube went from 500 meters to three kilometers.OK and it would hit 700 miles per hour with the existing.System in design that we did that's why we're we say is worried there.OK if you can hit a 192 miles per hour in 500 feet the means are gonna hit southerner miles per hour in three kilometers the reason as.There's no friction it's a near vacuum.The propulsion is gonna continue into two speeded up.And in about thirty seconds forty seconds later it's gonna hit 700 miles per hour in that distance.Now when you commercialize a woman gets in his next phase which were and now we're in commercialization.Is.With.Visionary like Richard Branson.And investment by by virgin group.And how they were to join the board.That's gonna help us in the commercialization process we've graduated now from the R&D process solution on all the works so now we go to phase of signing contracts with governments and actually building.And breaking ground high food systems around the world five version if we bought.How far away are we from that actuality of governments signing up for this and saying.We're cool with S we're gonna regulated in some capacity and we're gonna allow you to take up the space to make this happen.It's a great question we're right there I think.You know and I was finished within.The and the next year.We should deal to make announcements of our first contracts with governments around the world not and the U.So most likely we're going to be building the first article loops and and places like.The middle East Asia and potentially your of my dream of course would be the bring it to America would love to build you a New York to DC.And do you know 35 minutes travel.Basically turning the citizens of metro stops.Bends the idea of Kano where you live and where you work.To zipping ghost city Center City center.And that's reality is we don't need a lot of realistic to build I believe stations they can be in the middle of the city.And then you're gonna build it you know transfer people on things done for us.So some of the questions 11 question we got from bong bong.Well I think it I don't know what your name is on bond but that's your Twitter handle Obama bonds BO and GE O Yong -- so bond bond asked.Will brands and hold a controlling interest what's his role in all of.It's.Richard Branson and the virgin group Vuitton made a minority investment and and and having of one.Richard is join the board of directors.We better than to a strategic partnership.For the same time we've merged goodies to global brands I've who have won and version.Together and we'll be rolling out of ground is version has bloop on.In the name in the company were illegally also changed to reflect that.So that's that's.He seems like up the kind of partner that would be very useful in this and that he in figuring out virgin airlines worked with government is accustomed to you.Dealing with some of the bureaucracy.And that weighed it definitely be in the path of any kind of moon shot venture likeness.Yes of soil amid.I've looked up to Richard for very long time he's on the great.Hunters in the world is built Brandon done is known worldwide.He inspires a lot of people's well and has a good human being.How many conversations dictate to sell him on the idea.Well we've known each other for some time so he's a for and became a virgin galactic astronauts some years ago early on.And so I wanted to go to space for the childhood you know my name is.Hide myself under coffee table I was growing up and Legos and spaceship.For hours and hours traveling on space so.That's why I signed up for virgin galactic and I look forward to making that trip in the future.What comes first your trip to Mars or someone taking a higher early.One the virgin higher early line from New York to Washington DC it.Over neglecting his has been around for along time that coin of you know goal takes time.You know long term vision.I think there are there they're nearer.You know getting there.So.I don't know what the exact dates are but.I would I would think that it's it's eminent.In terms of in order through so I guess you only announced it.Then.The in terms of Turkoglu.You know working around the world virgin have who have won tends to kind of break ground and build these things and you should be seeing them operational in the next 24 years.Two to four years and all right we have a question from Kalla who wants to know the estimated price for one way travel do you even have a sense for what pricing could be like.Sure.Well the key way to understand.The answer that question.As we don't intend to really try to you know profit from passenger travel or business model from the beginning when it started the company.One of two.Basically focus on cargo.And logistics because in the movement of goods is actually a much more.Interest and business model in the world if you can kind of shrink.Commerce.You can accelerate the economic growth of the world and create economic opportunity for many many more people are on the world.So this is very much on a mission driven from now perspective it is also was.The ideas the business phone I think is a beautiful business model and what I mean by the if you can move you know people on things as fast if he can move things in cargo this house.And by the way green.Queen lane.Then you can actually take the ports around the world and most salute the in the major ports in the world.Our.Because of their function.And the existing technologies are on the water fronts of all the major cities of the world.Now there's something about waterfront property.Real estate.It's actually quite valuable.Waterfront properties of these cities around the world are extremely valuable but they have they're forced to use it.To be able to bring goods and guess what happens in LA port.The value of the real estate deal and poors were worth about 200 billion dollars just by itself.It also brings in about 8000 trucks and these aren't small trucks is are 8018.Wheelers they go on the highway systems of LA every single day.That's a waste.Causes pollution causes congestion and it causes a lot of pain and loss of productivity.So you can actually move the port and make it in the desert.The trucks move out of the way have a cleaner city of less congestion.Also on law 200 billion dollars of those states to develop.And guess what that subsidizes the other business model which actually should make it very cheap for people travel back and forth.And the reason is if you're gonna unlock all of those goods.In that way and you gonna move those goods and real time.You actually want people moving around you wanna make the very cheap because that's gonna make the economic flows mover on the city's.And those reasons regions much not faster than ever before.I can hear the argument but with the way that you would lay this out to any and regulatory authority and government in terms of making the case for a why you should be on site be.Should there be subsidies for example for what your trying to build out I do think we have some questions coming in is that right Taylor human.Okay.Furnish Thomas that this isn't capable of withstanding a joke and he is.Good question some parishes are people out there in case they can hear it garish asked how much can the system withstand natural calamities if there's an earthquake or hurricane what happens.Sure thanks Dershowitz a great question I'm safety.Is extremely important for version has moved on.And it's actually quite term months to how we think about things.If you look at can a safety.Airlines.From the airline perspective.You're in a tin can up in the air 30000 feet if anything goes wrong.You know what's gonna happen for an it's not a very safe.Environment at that point so.In on the trains side.If you have the real man's.Due to any other cause.Because it's in open error.When a train or high speed rail.The rails.What happens is that.It moves all over the place it did it crashes.And that's also not very safe.If you have an environment where you're controlling the whole environment here and steal to.And you.The system we've designed.We've been very mindful of it reduces the possibilities of any kind of derailment.We've also designed the pods.Who also designed the pylons.So that they actually shift.We did that in terms of actually shifting towards temperatures and so it expands and contracts to the tube itself can slide around.Because of what we've actually invented so I can show that you if you ever come to Vegas.How big is is one pot how many people could be it seated in one hot and and do you believe that.The people would also be traveling with the cargo.Considered your very question you wanted to be bi directional C to use ago both ways it.You could and turned mixed pods.Where we are one part house cargo in the other part 'cause people.And so you will be able to makes those around.Because of the speeds that it goes you want and also have enough buffer in between the pods.And all of its automated so that it's extremely safe if you need one part of the stop.It creates a there's a sixty.And of logic to you actually regulate.Through the automation system all of those rules.Then on the cargo side and the people's side you want ability to different kinds a cargo and he also won a house.Plaza might fit more people and less people depending on you just let your location that's right.So the size of the plot does not need to be uniform.But you know if we need a pod for 35 people are putt for 65 people we can make that work.Because this is all inside of a steel container and the steel container this does the sides of it won't change all of that much.Does the technology to propel different shapes and sizes of pods for example or different sizes rather of pods.Did that technology have to change and adjust and given that and what happens if you know there are multiple different size pods all traveling within this this.That that the steel container.Sure.We'll some some to you and me wider than others depending on you know function.So so the idea wouldn't be an necessarily have different size pot in one Q that would just be different routes are going to be different sized chips right.And so it kind of you gotta think about it and kind of morphology -- ensued.If the functions and to determine what the actual design vision of the year of the size of the actual tube.The pods.You're not gonna have different widths of positive of this you know if I would.I have longer publish order prods.The other hospital this is you know creating a people talk about self driving automation etc.but the pause themselves should be able ago until April.And if you design different kinds of pods you can actually.Have the pods continue to do the last miles well so once you get in between mostly in Europe DC.The paused and then leave and take you home or to due to the office.You can kind of could you know create.Pooled situations where you know people commuting together.But all of these are electric bill that screen.I'm reminded of there's a boat in Chicago then starts out as a bus and then turns into a boat that takes people around the Chicago river anyway it'll exam the article yet that it's not.A we when my another ten million of them don't pogs.By luck.Of the teamwork.Meeker.And me.No Manila.Do you have any schedule through market rollout.Schedule for market roll out Malden.I am 08.Day.Her thoughts on.But the thanks to your questions in terms a commercialization.Version have to move on.The role it is you know once we sign the first contraris.We'd like to be able to break ground.Somewhere in the world in 2019.And then be operational by two points when he won 21 to.And those who believe.Either cargo or passenger.Just depends on what you know it the government there were talking to.What they need.For the nation.Here.Killing my math.It really be powered by.Funny adversity and we will really be powered by humans humans what a picture on its parent had great close.You know my daughter's favorite movie news monsters things and is remembered.They went from.Screams to laughter and joy actually high approval be powered by human joy people are going to be extremely happy.To deal move around them save time.In a way that you know changes if Robert I think the way people live their lives not just in terms of jobs.Mostly personal if you can go visit your.And parents or grandparents of the grandchildren can be around.People can come and visit each other there's not just going to be enjoying the experience of being transported there.We'll have more moments of life

of people and we put that on the Starbucks app.And a few months later we discovered that sixty million people.Watch those stories sixty million people yet and so the question is why what happened.And really what happened was we shine a light on a sense of humanity and compassion and empathy and human kindness.And people were drawn to it so naturally we wanted to do it again and I think.This year the launch of the series today it's even more relevant given that the tree all in the division that exist.In the country and unfortunately much of it coming from Washington so.We've had an extraordinary experience meeting these people and last night we had an event where we showed every episode to a live audience.We had many up standards here.And I you know what I have discovered.In West Virginia and Montana.In South Carolina is people.Demonstrating every single day the true spirit of the country's true promise of America.And we need a more compassionate society and I think people are longing for these kind of stories.A special mullah especially in light meals and were Alter a stick and I think.Recognize authenticity when they see it in these are true stories which we didn't invent them.We're not prescribing them we just sharing it with the American people there's no Starbucks advertising and so Starbucks placement.It's not about marketing economist selling more coffee it's really about just telling the American story.And by the way anyone out there who has a question for Howard were gonna make sure that there are there's China into this conversation for your questions so feel free rape comments if you have a question.So these are real stories how did Starbucks buying all the people.Well my partner and all this is Raj each undersea Koren who was a Washington Post correspondent for many years seasoned professional journalists.I think after last year it wasn't difficult people have been submitting stories to us all year long.And we could have done thousands.And the hard part was getting it down to eleven.And their business so many stories I mean we met this woman Mary school in Montana as an example.Who against all odds is bringing Syrian refugees to Montana.We met a doctor in Miami who against all odds spent five years creating free needle exchange.In a state that did not have that legislation.I could go on and on but I think every story has a deep sense of vulnerability.And also if you you see in these stories the difference of opinion.That certain people in certain groups have but despite the differences there was a opportunity to listen.There's an opportunity for civility in even though people might disagree.We did not have the vitriol that we see taking place in Washington DC.It seems to me you've always been an outspoken.You're always outspoken CEO of start at young and end it's kind of rare that you would see that from a public company's CEO.But it strikes me that.In the current air we are hearing a much more outspoken class of executives and in particular executives from.Public companies do you think the role of CEO has changed in the last decade or two decades and why do you think that this.While forty years ago at a public Starbucks meeting Cherilus meaning I I said that I thought there was a need.For the role and responsibility of a public company and business leaders to change and to redefine a responsibility.Not only to creature over profit and and make money but also for social impact.I think the rules of engagement in our country.The crucible that the country is facing in the American people are facing.Is putting.More responsibility on public CEOs to demonstrate to their employees.And their customers.That we stand for something beyond making money and we we need America to be healthy.And as result of that I think people are speaking up speaking out on issues that are important them.I don't think it's across the board.But I think it's very very important that all of us.In the sense B of standards and not be bystanders and recognize that we all have a role to play and in our democracy and we have we have to.Make sure that would being heard and the next place for that happened is in November mid term elections.Which I mean it we've talked about this before.But weight tock and you talk about actions that you talk about politics used satellite that kind of person who might be thinking about how her.X no the united I think about politics but I have no intention of running for public office and I think about politics as I'm concerned about.The knee that we have for true authentic leadership in the country and.You believe that you can make.A bigger impact as executive chairman of the Starbucks or as the CEO the company then.In political office.I think that my role and responsibility.In the fact that almost a hundred million people we come through throughout Starbucks stores and weren't 75 countries.And that does agree to a level of trust in the equity of Starbucks brand gives me the opportunity.To do these kinds of things.I'm not running for political office and I feel I'm in the best possible position I am right now on into the things and.I don't look.The current state of affairs in terms of how companies are are looking at there workforce in terms of how others treat their employees.Starbucks has taken a number of initiatives also the scholars program where you're actually helping.All of your employees get a college education at ASU if they wish to four year college degree for free for free.Firfer.There are not many companies I mean you're revealing what he's doing Matt and there really aren't that many companies.That are doing these kinds of things what is holding corporate America back at this point.From doing that kind of thing with there employed.Law obviously.Starbucks is on a proxy for every company and I think.Wall Street puts a lot of pressure on companies to make money on a quarterly basis.Or been on a monthly basis.I think our history for many many years as a public company for 26 years has been the balance profit with social impact.And that started with health insurance equity in a form of stock options.Free college tuition hiring veterans hiring refugees.Do we all kinds of things that we felt worse in keeping with the culture and values of our company.There are many companies who do a number of very good positive things for their communities and there.Employees what I've what I've been seeing though is.That if you want to build a great enduring companies in this kind of operating environment.Where.The web basically has created such transparency.Where everything about you in your company is known.That the kind of companies that are going to succeed.Are those companies whose values are compatible.With your customers.In for us the brand of Starbucks has been built by or people who Wear the green apron the intimacy of that relationship.So we as a company many years ago kind of inverted how we built our brand it wasn't customer facing war marketing.It was basically investing in our people on as managers saying in order to exceed expectations of our customers we have to exceed the expectations of our people first.I've been asked to speak so many colleges and other companies and and I speak about that these kinds of things not to prescribe or other companies can do but.I know for fact that our financial performance which has been so good for many years.Is directly link in the kind of policies we've had in advancing the value creation for of people.In in thinking I'm Wall Street yes.We have these proposed tax cuts on the table for a corporate America.Potentially a really sizable cut in what companies pay in taxes and then there's the repatriation.If that happens.What will accompany like Starbucks tea with the savings.Is it going towards.Buybacks and dividends or is it going to be invested in the employees in.Raises ending in new types of things for the employees new benefits for the employees.Well look let me begin by saying that.The corporate tax cuts that is being spoken about now.I would take a different approach and that is you can't have a corporate tax cuts without having any transformation.In complete tax reform.And if there's going to be a corporate tax cut that is connect and to the national debt.Which could be 25 trillion dollars.In the next two years.Then I think it's a mistake so you think tax cut for corporations right it was as if it's if it is isolated.And it's not part a complete overhaul.The need for complete transform and of tax reform I don't agree with it.Which would basically mean.If it was going to work you would have to raise taxes somewhere.In order to compensate for that without adding the deficit.Yeah and I think you know we've we've we've got a significant problem of 22 trillion dollars.Sitting on the balance sheet of America I mean it's or any company in the world that could survive with that kind of debt the interest you know.And so.You you just you can't.Isolate tax reform by starting with corporate tax cut and leaving it there.And I guess you know this is the the problem we have in that we we can't seem to.Move away from ideology.And really kind of have all the representatives.Of congress.In the current administration really literally walk in the shoes of the American people and recognize that there has to be a real balance.In a real level of compassion to the kind of reform that we need.So if the tax cuts do happen as our proposed right now yes.How do corporations spend that money how in your view do you expect corporations.To.Give raises to their employees with those savings I am the unemployment rate is four point two you know that's or already near historical was.But do you see the majority of companies in America using those savings to invest back in their employees and their company is.Or do you see them doing more of what has already happened over the last eight years or so which is primarily stock buybacks and it.It's now become an aunt's again and in the long form if you don't mind.Let me say this the the current.Level.Enthusiasm.And optimism that exists in the stock market today.In that in my view is not a proxy.For the US economy.And so a continuing to drive corporate profits.As a result of a corporate tax cut.Is not going to advance the economic issues of inequality in America.And when you have almost five million young kids mostly African American Latino or not working and not in school.When you have one out of six people going hungry.Every night in America.So.Again the corporate tax cut.Is a good thing to do if it's part of an over riding.Approach to.Transforming the tax code.And it would do we might hope that most companies if there is going to be a corporate tax cut.Would not use that primarily.To increased corporate profits I would hope that they would use it.In ways that would advance the air employees to work we need to do in our communities.And building a better society Hewitt help.I mean that's that's what I would be doing.Hopefully start us we'll do that understood it there's no doubt my monitor service would do.When it comes to your career and that choices that you made along the way how much of your trajectory and is especially in those early years as CEO of Starbucks.How much of that trajectory do you think was based on.This larger mission statement verses the focus on the core business that is.Selling Cochran to people all over the world.Well I think like.All of us in life our life experience.As a child or young adult has defined us in my life experience growing up in public housing and and literally seen fracturing of the American dream and hopelessness in the spares a young kid.Defined how I would see the world and basically.The company that I try to build.Is a company that my father never got a chance to work for that would respect and dignify everyone.And if a look at that in the broader way in terms of the promise of country.Regardless of the color of your scan earlier sexual orientation or gender or station life.You should of axis of the American dream and we've tried to build the kind of company.That everyone has gotten a piece.The value creation of Starbucks so early on.When we were a small company and even we were not even making a profit.We were telling people that we were gonna get health insurance and equity in the form of stock options to every employee and people so that's going to be dilutive to shareholder value.And my argument then and certainly it's proven now there's no that's going to be an investment in our people that's gonna give a greater value.Two shareholder values of Starbucks stock is up almost 20000%.Since we went public in June of 1992 and not because we're.We're smarter than anyone else oral we've got a better business mind but I think our business proposition.Things we've tried to do.Is directly linked to our financial performance and also say in going back here questions about what's CEOs might do what they should do.We all have to recognize that financial performance is a price of admission we have to we have to perform.But when she performed the question is.People want to be part of something larger than themselves and are urged to attract a retaining great people.It's pretty shallow goal just to say we're visits to make money and that's that's who we here do.People don't wanna be part of just that they want to do something that advances the cause of humanity.And that's we're trying to do today and around the world who we have 3000 stores in China we just gave.Critical care health insurance to the parents of our employees in China.And so it's not just what we're doing here in America to were doing around the world.And you know the fact that we've hired 151000 veterans.Retired 40000 opportunity used in the last street years.These are things that we're not promoting these are things that are not part of a press release but it is the DNA the values and culture of Starbucks it drives her success.What do you say to.The companies out there that the CEOs and executives out there who are on board with the mission they like what they're hearing.But they don't think that they can make the case to they're bored they don't think that they can make the case to their shareholders.What I see is that.We'd all be better off if there was a longer view.What is were trying to do not just a short term focus.You you have to build trust with Wall Street if you are public company and you've got to create.An understanding with them and you have to perform but.Would you go public if it Starbucks today it was a private company you don't.Would you still think about taking it public or would you consider state cracked it given the pressure sure Wall Street but I'm.We would still go public and I I think.You know we've had a pretty.Over time charm public life one because we performed any other is because we've been very transparent with the street about what is we're trying to do and and how we're going about our business.But being a public company today vs 25 years ago is very different in terms of the pressure the short term mentality.And the depression to perform in the moment.But what really talking about his leadership.And the kind of leadership that builds trust and confidence with multiple constituencies.We talked about automation in the past and how much that is changing and potentially even much more so going to change our workforce and one of the things that struck me in our last conversation.Was this idea that Starbucks.He's the people.So while a number of retailers and a number of of restaurants and bars are all trying to find ways.To do the same thing with fewer people.You talk to me about this idea that no Starbucks is the people we don't want it to you what we do with your people.Well let me say this I think.And I don't think any company in any industry.Can survive today.Without being a tech company in side your company.It just it's impossible to be relevant today.Without having the engineering capability in the tech capability.To drive your business having said that.The environment inside a Starbucks stories based on people humanity the emotional connection.But if you look at the investments we've made in digital and mobile.And all the things we've done on mobile page that is really driven our business.And you'll see a lot more than that the be the launch of standards today's we're in the content business now.I which is an engineering feat unto itself.Not only in terms of the creative side but integrating that into our mobile and doing that with partners so.We're not can replace our people but we're gonna take full advantage of innovation and do everything we can.To make sure that Starbucks maintains its relevancy with our customers.And that means being relevant where they live where they work with their play and making sure I'm people's device on their phone at the Starbucks experience is alive and while on that is ten days.I spent a day at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh about a month ago.I drove in a I think I was in that seat in a driver Lewis Carr.I saw a a up close I saw a robotics.And in the world is moving at light speed.It was.It was it would if it was it was a real it was like.I don't think it's ready for prime time but it's coming out.Just if I say five years.Five years for profit would be no not a whole row but I think they'll be a number of drivers 1005 use invited I don't know anything.About that world other than I was in a car I drove in Pittsburgh.I united increment fires out.Yeah that's a little bit of that but and that there was so ornery on the wheeled god forbid swimming and that you have to it was fascinating to see and again I want to I want to be as curious as possible.So that Starbucks days ahead of the growth curve and all of these areas.And I think every company must recognize.You know you you've got a fraction status from look at her office were having me give you be doing something like this two years ago.I really mean I mean literally I mean this is group there are.History if you could only see the rest of yeah professional aspect of the pool while most it would take credit.I think I notice after an I was invited her it was a few weeks ago.Our.I was entering a pajama party.Buddy is a credit to you think you're doing these things and I think it's fun I think it's like yeah I'm glad and I'm glad it.Like about it by the way de Beers.There's so many different aspects.Numbers it's relaxing.Well as for you getting.Yeah it was the biggest surprise at.The base unexpected day.What we may eleven episodes that are about 56 minutes long so now.However.It is really hard.Two films six minutes.And takes a lot more I was shocked by that the editing process and but the quality of this production what we've done is extraordinary.But it wasn't that it was really a.The the people's willingness and interest in telling their story.And being hurt.And also how respect for people were that we came to them.That we went to West Virginia who went to South Carolina went to Montana.And we we we just said we've we want to shuttle landing your story.It's just beautiful is really moving.Something I personally faces a journalist and I know a lot of other people.In the field feel this way to you people asked for certain types of stories the onions as we want to hear these stories like ups ignorant.But then when it comes to what people actually click.From.A lot of it is the salacious.You know a lot of it is whatever headline grabs your attention whatever you can consume like.You know packet of sugar OI got my six and the next thing.Did you ever face any concerns like that about this project means sixty million views this incredible figure yes and I'm sure a lot of people would have said to you.Beforehand.There's no way you're gonna get that kind of action on your common.I think the truth is of stand as one was kind of an experiment we do know what to expect.We certainly had a lot of naysayers saying this as it makes sense why do in this.But the truth is we have a built an asset and that people are paying.Twenty million almost thirty million people are paying with their phone Starbucks of weakening.Content into your phone while your pain.Yeah it is a great opportunity you're gonna click and watch and once said.Once people do that it went viral so we had a captive opportunity.And innocent Starbucks is a network.In a very non traditional sense.But I also think.If you make it easy for people.They're very interested and they are longing.For truth authenticity.And not everyone is looking for war.The Latin you know the next rumor or as he sits salacious story I think people want.To be inspired me.I I absolutely unit that that's why I'm committed to having these covers and that's why I'm committed to doing my part here is no limits.I want to make sure we're answering your questions out there as well and Taylor tells me she's getting some great ones that Taylor you can read a mop.Well.Great question Brentson just order what can hear Taylor does behind the camera and she just read an opt.How Starbucks Howard continuing to change and develop with the times.I think the best example that is.The amount of people today who are.Coming in to star rocks in pre ordering.Through their for the mobile.And it's incredible to me that that in that did not exist eighteen months ago millions of Starbucks customers every day.Are not owning pre ordering but we're telling them when they pre order.When it's gonna be ready and we're also prompting them a U when a car or are you walking in here is the closest store.So these are the kind of things that we're doing also I think in the months to come they'll be a level personal position where.Will know that what would drink you like him will be kind of suggesting things that are.Probably compatible with your case profile.I think the be more content coming as a result of the success of votes to Anders.And I think.You know we are.Doing things at the Starbucks rose street which in Seattle the next one opens in China.We're building the super premium brand will be opening one in New York.Imbedded in these were in their groceries is a mechanism to pay that is not true it cash register.So is its apple like in a sense.So our payments cyst.The exchange of information between our customers and ourselves is changing.And I think store design and the elegance of Starbucks.The transparency of Wear a poppy comes from.In less than a year you'll be able going to star bookstore.Point your phone addict at a coffee bag and we'll tell you exactly where it's from and we'll show you a story of the coffee.And of these the kind of things that I think a.After they are that you yes OK you know nineteen customers are coming to expect them.It's an interesting point eight.Obviously not it connected at all to start that's what this morning Good Morning America we talked about Wal-Mart they have this new.Returned mechanism where basically you can scan your items when they're apt and then you bring it and it's the thirty back in exchange for his multiple minutes and exchange.So it does strike me that.All companies that play the game that Starbucks plays anything where there's a customer service aspect you it.Speed and knowing what the customer wants prior to the treatment if something is really really key to be six.I think that's all true but our own research also suggests that as a customer.There is great value.In a emotional human experience.And it giving about the success to start Rex has had over these many years.It's the sense of community and the third place between home and more home and work and we don't want we don't want technology to strip that away.We want technology to be complementary.To that.So you're never gonna go walk into a Starbucks store and not be greeted.By people who have knowledge about coffee and want to do everything they can to enhance your experience in the store.More questions.I.Actually yeah and actual locations.We are testing.A number of concepts.It's interesting that people know know that we've we've we like to test things under the radar.So we are testing new food concepts.In a number of cities and we think there's a big idea.For Starbucks and meal replacements and more food so the answer to that is.We're experimenting with the test looks very positive and you probably will see more food a storm what type of very high quality the organic natural food.That is.Value prized and fresh.With the new supply chain system.And we believe that our customers would like this he Starbucks create.A food environment that they can take home and eat for dinner is an example.An analyst yeah cash payments and future.I would not be surprised of cash was payments.Becomes the standard over time not immediately.But I think it is no doubt that that's were it.It.Why just mentioned who in the building of this new super premium brand Starbucks reserve so there's.Large grocery in Seattle which is like the Willie Wonka of coffee.The next one opens in Shanghai December 5 and and we come to New York on the corner of ninth and fifteenth next to the Chelsea market.And then were opening in Italy for the first time a year from today.A year from today and what is the ninth and fifteenth in New York I think August September VT are.It.RC you're the executive chairman now what is the difference between being executive chairman vs CEO chairman of the Starbucks company.Well as CEO I'm.I'm I'm operating a company which deterred the leadership team and the direct reports of the company or.Remote recording to me.Today the only group that reporting to me of the new registries in new.Brand and massive social impact agenda.So I'm staying out of the way Kevin Johnson is.The new CEO he's done a fantastic job.And I'm caring the flag of Starbucks around the world and doing the things that I think are important.To preserving and enhancing the promise of America.I know you believe it happened.This is not a question to undercut him ya but is there ever a day it where you wish you could be CEO again.No the Disco and now Kevin in my office with Kevin is connected so we see each other a law.No I do not wish.On any day that I'm the CEO and very happy in the Roland.Do you wait company later you know I'm my own life or end with a program for 5450.The other ashamed of yourself an additional fifteen minutes or less.I'm still you know Mike my body clock has not changed at my body can't does not know that I'm not the CEO.You wake up at 415 you do your right you make yourself copy is that is that.I read three papers.I'd do my work make a French press a coffee if my wife and I and I'm I'm I'm out the door.And and sure there people were watching right now familiar star acts order.But for those you haven't heard the start at the start ups or a depending on the time of the day but this morning Tokyo espresso market.You expressed.Our ourselves thank you so much for joining

Brooklyn Decker on balancing motherhood with her career Video:::::Transcript for Brooklyn Decker on balancing motherhood with her career Everyone I'm Kathleen masters senior entertainment editor of ABC near that I'm hearing New York City Rick Brooklyn Decker in town for brief sack and to talk about this nuclear view clear blue.I've elation cats as you yourself are expecting.Yes so clear blue say what acts are spreading my second baby and and I have a very busy schedule work like Louis woman have very busy schedules these days.And I wanted to take on stress out of making a baby can be incredibly stressful for women about this process as I think listened intently to.And sort of you know let me take all the you know doctors and figure out what is this ovulation pain what is my when what is going on.And so I use the crew will ovulation test which he originally just cannot clear the connected.Which is an app that connects to the test of actually detection hormones and tell you we near fertile and those are which sounds crazy.But why haven't we had to write it help us with this before and it technology for literally everything people's refrigerators and communicating to meet with at lake you can see the inside of your refrigerator through the outside it's magical.You can actually know when Mike prime baby making time slime.Well congratulations.I didn't get to that point to congratulation on the damage here but we're talking Cuba where that.Either we were paying attention in biology or this is something that women weren't really.Kept kept in the know about for a really long time so this this extra exciting because this Tippett thing didn't exist.War and her ever I mean a thing is I think we neared a growing up you or.Your ear your title bouts.How not to get pregnant right right it's old you are learning all of these things in school and and so because of that I don't think we learn about fertility when as I don't think we actually hear about how difficult it can be for women and frankly I think.And who recently women's and talk about.The processor actually let capping a child in conceiving.And so it's happening a tool that actually helps you make in a file those things better and understand you're reproductive health and your body better again and it's about time.Right why don't we know are fertile window why don't we hear a fertile ground until it comes actually wanting to have a family racket and so clear blue generally good job of leading the way well and as a one and it's empowering to people that he controller your body and make decisions that makes sense for you when you're exactly antenna I mean it's that one of the biggest decisions of knocking because its economic life is when you we're going to it ever have children.As it's not have all the tools to help you make those decision seems completely crazy to me to the fact that now we have tools that are out and help us.It's it's I think we'll go along in helping women so you have.Two year old right you there yet so how are you dealing with the concept.Having to by the end but at the end of the year yeah and they into the year I mean tonight don't.Mostly because I have this idea that could be really easy in on what clinic eat at me and love my child now it's going to be perfect ending think your body is programmed to make you forget.How sort of difficult those early days are lake the constant feeding him a couple of hours in the being awake and the lack of that all of that I think your body really makes you forget Brett so I am totally blissful about the whole idea of having a child asked me a few months pregnant right look to for Canada right nobody would have perhaps that's what I hear a thing here I hear that your men attack actually forget about that the tough for months now your tank now that he's expecting it says Starr yes how has he.How he processed.He's very excited.That he keeps talking about her crawling out of the tunnel.Look at flatly which is chair I did.I'm like really that's been thinking though think you should crawl out of the tunnel which is kind of true.Equally terrifying so that's how he thinks children carnage this well I don't know where he got this idea but he thinks his little sister is going to crawl out of the tunnel.Which already know that you mentioned thanks Hank patents that pattern of comforting lesson for me Assam that it really exciting process I have a Nokia super excited.I don't know that you can really understand what a sick child actually needs in the house.I don't know that it thirty I commanders in the second child means the house but he's really excited about.So we had a picture that you share to Amsterdam that you can't see you they are going to show at U putting together our.A play kitchen oh yeah.For Hank.Without from his little sister with fat something to hide the use them into the AG but he'd be sharing a house with another human to good that's actually would have been much more well thought out we did it was his second birthday and he loves being in the kitchen and gloves on when cooking things he loves being a part of that and so I.Thought that I look at packaging together about thirty minutes on his actual birthday suit during nap time my set I'm gonna put this kitchen together and I didn't realize that it actually takes about six hours.So Hank didn't get his birthday present on his birthday at.And gotten the next morning he doesn't know when I sit up until May be 1 in the morning working on that thing with two friends and just I keep them whine and sent like you're came to this fully and luckily they did and we got done but.Hanks birthday was a bit gently because I. Ditty like.Let's he cooks need.An and is an onion separate it and maybe applicant budding shaft young meaning we'll see we'll see flawless so.You talk about having to you.Puts her kitchen at nap time obviously.You have.A thousand other things going nine of grace and Frankie you have your act you have so many other things.How you mean that's at Hampshire so bored of being asked but how do you find time to credit Alan separate bank.I don't think anyone can do it alone and that's where when I look at single moms.In this country or anywhere and they are in the unsung heroes.Of our worlds they really are IA.I have a nanny you know I have a husband who is retired and doesn't work full time and so we have a really great system where.There's someone with my age child at all times and it's like an on hands on deck approach you know I was raised by neighbors and friends and faintly in.I'm a big believer in you know the community raising vacated.But I would be lying if I told you that I'm sitting here doing at all perfectly on my second it takes a lot of people to help but so refreshing to hear because I think a lot of people.Make women feel badly when they think that they see somebody

about like you can controlling your finances you can now controlling her ovulation or at least track it.Can manage it you can manage your music and there's nothing taxi manager clothing.And women will spend more money on their clothing of their education isn't fashions this because women need to address every day.And we finally create a management solution for at and so hurt it Harvey's island in Austin our CEO action news New York but used to live in Houston.Worked their for many years so.As it connect it really I think everyone when he heard about Harvey but I think being Texan.You really feel a connection to it.And and you know recently have women there are two million unique pieces of clothing on our sages inventory that women haven't posits that 80% which is not being warned.Recent past a way that we can actually put this clothing to work right.And so when you Boehner say it and you sent out an olive your clothing comes on automatically.From the last ten years on your purchases

you had a professional setting.And he need to look at certainly at work table to alleviate that stress is really important to us feel sick and I'm not sure this was sort of what you were thinking when you've developed the app but to be able to use it for such a Philanthropic.Cause it was not the goal and I'll be really just wanted to do when their productivity tool to make their lives a little bit easier than they weren't spending all this time in the closet figured what they wanted to Wear.We just found that it was a miracle by products that are technology can do very easily there.And I really creditors CEO which means my business partner who thought of it she's like we've all this inventory let's put to use.Also I think women have.So much.That they don't really isn't the only anymore and that's hanging in their closet.And they at a wanna sell it or want to give it away you know they want I think women want to prove what they own and kind of and we keep what they really need.And so did it wouldn't do it hurts her really help other women get back to work and support their families it seemed like a no brainer for us so.Well and speaking of and I know you also recently treated about Harvey Weinstein scandal has.That's been sort of talked about it a lot of days.To wade into that was that nerve wracking for you with something you just felt he needed to speak out.Tiny.What when he heard about that I felt a lot of guilt to the question is a think.And Hollywood this is behavior that we accepted as normal on an excuse used.And I really need for some reason is really bother me I felt this responsibility that if we're going to bash certain behavior by certain people in this country which we do regularly.They needed a accountable and we excuse for years.Done and I felt that it was frankly incredibly hypocritical that I'm sitting here I I've heard rumors and and I AIA you know.Along with I think everyone else sort of let it slide under the rug.But yet I call out pussy grabbing you know sorry but I do you know and so like when alive sorry.I Colin not anything I think it's really important I I just I really wanted to point out that you know this is none of its except ball.Talking about unacceptable acting on its unacceptable and we should all be accountable if we.Allow people to continue with this kind of behavior as a woman in Hollywood and someone who works in modeling industry very very long time is sexual harassment and it's.This treatment of women an issue that you've seen.Throughout your career or.Yes I mean I I was very fortunate that IE didn't have to hit ever B is subjected to what a lot of easily have gone through.I'm so I'm certainly not an ever compare any of my instances was there risk has done what they've gone through is entirely different.But I will say there is behavior in both fields that has been excused for years because we just accepted as the norm and if someone is powerful enough and lacks a certain way.We are complicit.And you know I remember being very young knowing that there were served art lovers who are incredibly inappropriate but knowing that they would propel your career.And I excuse behavior by shooting with these photographers and and the same goes for filmmakers and I think.I'm I'm I'm glad that brave women are coming out and talking about it because it into the personal action haven't real dialogue.But I get I I eight I certainly didn't encounter too much of it on my own but I I definitely think.That there is behavior that was just accept it is the norm in both industries for a very long time.So where we got from hearing that we've talked about motherhood and we've talked to you're what but the theme of all of that it is that you're very.You're clearly passed in the idea of empowering women and promoting women.Becoming strong and having a daughter what does that song mean for you and how an end to that sort of translates how he planned for our.It's funny so I have to usually honest I actually hate the word of power now because a cool might say that I can give anyone power rate laid entirely at.It seemed that we can supply power tip.Women I think the biggest in

snapper he can do that they being able to organize your time matters that you can actually stay with your feeling two hours a week by having closet or whatever it is.These little tools go along way in helping women actually issue but they want to achieve and I think those are conversations we should be having.And I mean that the best women the best people in my life for the most part have been women.So I just grow up with amazing women supporting me and and so I try to do the same ten.My dilemma around me pain or heard yet exactly credit for thinking so much it's either he much fun talking

American Airlines CEO sees opportunity in NAACP criticism:::::The CEO of American Airlines said Thursday he is looking forward to company representatives meeting with the NAACP to discuss the civil rights group's charge that carrier has a culture of racial insensitivity.The NAACP earlier this week warned African-Americans that if they fly on American, they may face discrimination or even safety issues.CEO Doug Parker said his first reaction to the NAACP's charge was, "How can that be true of us?"He described the airline as having "a diverse and open environment and organization."But he says he now sees a chance to improve the airline."Once you get past that, this is a fantastic opportunity because we want to get better," Parker told reporters during a call to discuss the company's latest financial results."If the NAACP wants to talk to us and wants to help us get better, we are excited about that."The NAACP issued a "travel advisory" and cited four recent incidents where African-American passengers, including an NAACP official, believed they were mistreated because of their race.Since the start of 2016, passengers flying on American have filed 29 complaints of racial discrimination with the federal government, the most against any U.S. carrier, followed by United Airlines with 17.In 2015, when the type of discrimination was not identified in U.S. Department of Transportation reports, United had 14 complaints and American nine.As of 2016, about 15 percent of American's workers were African-American, according to figures provided by the company.That is higher than the percentage of African-Americans in the U.S. population 13.3 percent, according to the Census Bureau.American's figures did not give racial breakdowns for different work groups.In aviation, African-Americans are notably under-represented in the cockpit accounting for only about 3 percent of airline pilots, according to the Labor Department.Parker was asked if he is concerned that the controversy with the NAACP could hurt American's bookings."We haven't seen anything, but that is not the point," he said."The work we're doing ... is not about whether or not it has a financial impact on our company."The NAACP's "travel advisory" on Tuesday stopped short of calling for a boycott of American."We're not telling people don't do or to do, but we want people to have the necessary education to be informed about how they leverage their dollars," NAACP President Derrick Johnson told C-SPAN.Jesse J.

Companies are looking for diverse ad teams to avoid blunders:::::CoverGirl executive Ukonwa Ojo was struck when the team from an ad agency entered the room to pitch ideas for revamping the cosmetic company's image.For the first time in Ojo's more than 20-year career in business, she found herself working with an African-American creative director.That meeting would ultimately result in a marketing campaign that challenges conventional ideas about beauty.It features celebrity women from a spectrum of races, ages and professions, including Issa Rae of HBO's "Insecure," motorcycle racer Shelina Moreda, celebrity chef Ayesha Curry and dietitian Maye Musk, 69."To have an African-American creative director walk in the room and present this to me, I thought, 'Oh, my God, this is amazing,'" said Ojo, who is Nigerian-American."I think we can see the power of the work because of that."Diversity in the advertising industry is becoming a higher priority for consumer product companies as they try to reach a new generation of customers with evolving sensibilities on ethnicity, age, gender and sexuality.Many companies have come to believe that having people with a variety of backgrounds in the room can not only produce a smarter marketing campaign but also help avoid the kind of blunders Kellogg and Dove were recently accused of in today's politically combustible environment.Despite efforts by Madison Avenue to ramp up recruiting of minorities, just 7 percent of the 67,000 people working as advertising and promotion managers in the U.S. in 2016 were African-American, less than 5 percent were Hispanic, and about 1 percent were of Asian descent, according to the U.S. Labor Department.Women accounted for about 56 percent of managers in the industry.In the case of CoverGirl's makeover, which replaced the company's familiar "Easy, Breezy, Beautiful" tagline with "I Am What I Makeup," the team from the ad agency Droga5 had two black creative directors, Shannon Washington and Ray Smiling."The team that worked on this idea and this campaign came from very different backgrounds from a male and female point of view, different races, different ages," Droga5 CEO Sarah Thompson said."I think that more than before, what's important is getting that narrative, that story, right and really pressure-testing.Is it authentic?Is there anything that is going to be misinterpreted?"On Wednesday, Kellogg apologized after the artwork on its Corn Pops cereal boxes was attacked as racist.The box shows cartoon Corn Pops hanging out in a mall.The only brown one depicted is a janitor scrubbing the floor.Dove was similarly criticized earlier this month over a commercial for a body wash. A short version of the video on Facebook showed a black woman taking off her shirt to reveal a white woman, who then removed her top to reveal a woman with a brown complexion.Social media users accused Dove of suggesting black skin is dirty.Dove pulled the video, while Kellogg said new artwork for the cereal box will soon reach stores.Neither Unilever, the company that owns Dove, nor Kellogg has said who was behind the content.Other brands, including Pepsi, Gap and Nivea, have faced similar controversies.Ojo, who before joining CoverGirl was senior global director at Unilever, said her former company "always had the best intentions," but "as humans we always have the opportunities to make a mistake."She added: "It can minimize the chances if you have the right people around the table."Having more diversity around the table is seen as a safeguard at a time when companies are under pressure to produce lots of video and other marketing content quickly and cheaply for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, often with no time to test everything out on focus groups."In the good old days, you would have the time to take your TV ad or print campaign and do further testing.You would see how they are rating A and B ad," said Gene Fischer, senior vice president of media innovation at Publicis Health Media."The world of social media doesn't allow for that."Aside from trying to diversify their own ranks, some marketers are turning for help to small agencies that cater to specific ethnic groups.Being Latino, a social media marketing company, has crafted ads for Bud Light, Snickers and Coca-Cola."My entire company, every employee comes from the culture that we are trying to appeal to," said Being Latino founder Lance Rios."We know the do's and the don'ts."Tiffany R. Warren, chief diversity officer at Omnicom, the parent of the some of the nation's biggest advertising agencies, got her start in 1997 through an industry program to recruit top minority students out of college.Since then, however, she has often been the only black woman in the room."I know my presence in the room had led to a lot of meaningful conversations and led to creative products that were more culturally sensitive," said Warren, who is also founder of the nonprofit group ADCOLOR, which promotes diversity in the creative fields.
Mattel shares plunge after reporting loss, plan to cut costs:::::Shares of Mattel Inc. dropped nearly 20 percent in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported a third-quarter loss of $603.3 million and said sales were hurt by the bankruptcy filing of the toy chain Toys R Us.The company also announced plans to cut $650 million in costs over the next two years and suspend its quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter."Clearly disappointing" was how CEO Margo Georgiadis characterized the third quarter.The company said results were also hurt because retailers were managing inventory more tightly and some brands had not performed as expected.Toys R Us, hobbled by $5 billion in debt and more intense competition, filed for protection from its creditors in September but said it planned to continue its normal business operations and work with suppliers.Mattel had reported a profit in the same period a year earlier.On a per-share basis, the El Segundo, California-based company said it had a loss of $1.75.Earnings, adjusted for pretax expenses and non-recurring costs, were 9 cents per share.The average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had been for earnings of 56 cents per share.The toy maker posted revenue of $1.56 billion in the period, also falling short of Wall Street forecasts.Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $1.84 billion.Mattel's stock was down $2.87 to $12.50 in extended trading following the release of the earnings report.Through the close of regular-session trading Thursday, it had declined 44 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 14 percent.Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.Access a Zacks stock report on MAT at https://www.zacks.com/ap/MAT
Business Highlights:::::___ House backs $4T budget, faces challenges on Trump tax plan WASHINGTON (AP) Republicans powered a $4 trillion budget through the House on Thursday, but only by a razor-thin margin that underscored the difficulties ahead on delivering President Donald Trump's promise to cuts taxes.Republicans sidestepped divisions with the party with a 216-212 vote that permits them to begin work on a follow-up $1.5 trillion tax cut without fear of blocking tactics by Democrats.The landscape ahead is strewn with land mines, however, as GOP tax writers pick winners and losers.New screenings begin for passengers on US-bound flights DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) New security screenings have begun for all passengers onboard U.S.-bound flights, including airlines interviewing travelers about their trip and luggage.The new measures began on Thursday.In Dubai, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from.Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched along with their electronics.European Central Bank to reduce stimulus but slowly FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) The European Central Bank will ease the pace of its bond-buying stimulus program, which has helped the eurozone recover from the financial crisis.The ECB said Thursday that it would reduce its bond purchases to 30 billion euros ($35 billion) per month from 60 billion euros currently, starting in January.The move is a cautious attempt to wean the economy of the support as growth improves but inflation remains below target.Banks and tech companies help stocks higher;

American and Southwest signal rising airline prices ahead:::::American and Southwest are expecting their average prices to move higher the rest of this year, which would mark a shift from fare wars that have cut into profits and created turbulence for airline stock prices.Both carriers said Thursday that they see a key measure of revenue per mile rising in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier.They said demand for both business and leisure travel remains strong.The comments signal an upbeat end to the third-quarter earnings season for airlines, which hit bottom last week when United executives gave a glum revenue forecast and failed to reassure investors that they had a plan for success.It has been an up and down year for airline stocks, and that volatility continued Thursday.Despite the optimism over revenue, concern about rising costs helped push most airline shares lower.American, for example, expects its costs to rise sharply in the fourth quarter before easing next year.On Wednesday, questions about Alaska Airlines' ability to control costs after buying Virgin America contributed to a 13 percent drop in its stock.And last week, concern about rising costs was a key reason that United's stock fell 12 percent in one day.American, the world's biggest airline, reported earning $624 million in the third quarter, down 15 percent from $737 million a year earlier largely because hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused it to cancel more than 8,000 flights, which cost the airline $75 million in pretax earnings.The profit was slightly higher than analysts expected, and revenue rose 3 percent to $10.88 billion.Southwest's profit jumped 30 percent, to $503 million from $388 million a year earlier.Revenue rose 3 percent to $5.27 billion despite the loss of $100 million blamed on hurricanes Southwest canceled 5,000 flights in Houston, Florida and the Caribbean."Despite all these challenges, it was a very strong quarter, and fourth quarter looks better," Chairman and CEO Gary Kelly told analysts.Like American, Dallas-based Southwest narrowly beat Wall Street's profit forecast.Airline investors intently watch an arcane figure: revenue for each seat flown one mile.It is a measure of pricing power in the airline business, and it goes up with rising average fares and full planes.That figure rose 1.1 percent at American and fell 0.5 percent at Southwest in the third quarter, but both airlines see it climbing higher in the fourth quarter.Southwest predicted it will increase up to 1.5 percent, while American was more bullish, putting the likely rise at between 2.5 and 4.5 percent.Cowen and Co. analyst Helane Becker noted that American executives have repeatedly said the pricing figure would improve from the third quarter into the fourth.The market doubted that forecast, she said, and so Thursday's reassurance by American was a plus.At much smaller Spirit Airlines Inc., profit fell 26 percent to $60 million because of hurricane-caused canceled flights and the effect of fare wars with United and American.Spirit CEO Robert Fornaro demand was already firming up for peak travel days during the rest of the year."It's going to be a strong fourth quarter, especially the holiday periods," he said in an interview.American Airlines Group Inc., which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, fell $2.41, or 4.7 percent, to close Thursday at $48.61.Southwest Airlines Co. dropped $2.05, or 3.6 percent, to $55.11.Miramar, Florida-based Spirit jumped $2.34, or 6.9 percent, to $36.08.
Amazon and Alphabet report sales surge:::::Image copyright Getty Images Tech giants Amazon and Google's parent Alphabet have posted a surge in sales over the last three months.Shares in Alphabet jumped above $1,000 in after-hours trading after the company reported sales up 24% to $27.8bn.Amazon, the world's biggest e-commerce site, saw sales rise 34% to $43.7bn - nearly the size of Slovenia's economy last year.Meanwhile, Microsoft's profit beat estimates on gains from cloud services.Alphabet's profits for the three months to 30 September rose to $7.8bn, from $5.6bn for the same quarter last year.The company's chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was delighted with the way it was performing."We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets," she said."Our momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products and partnerships."Google continues to make up the vast majority of Alphabet's revenue and income.However the so-called Other Bets unit, which includes the Waymo driverless car business and the Project Loon WiFi-enabled weather balloon venture, saw revenue increase and losses fall.Total Other Bets revenue was up to $302m, from $197m last year.YouTube continued to see "phenomenal growth", said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in a conference call, with more than 1.5 billion people spending an average of an hour a day watching videos there on mobile devices, and surging use on television screens in homes.Amazon Despite Amazon's sales growth, the firm's profits were nearly flat as it ploughed money into tech gadgets, streaming video, data centres and warehouses to support its growing empire.The firm said profits in the three months to the end of September were $256m, up from $252m in 2016.Shares surged in after-hours trade anyway, as investors, who had been expecting a smaller number after being warned to expect the reinvestment, cheered the firm's growth prospects.Chief executive Jeff Bezos said the Amazon sales increase was in part down to the growing demand for the firm's smart home products, which are powered by artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa."In the last month alone, we've launched five new Alexa-enabled devices, introduced Alexa in India, announced integration with BMW, surpassed 25,000 skills, integrated Alexa with Sonos speakers, taught Alexa to distinguish between two voices, and more," Mr Bezos said.Upmarket grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in August, brought in $1.3bn in sales in the quarter.Excluding Whole Foods, sales increased 29%, Amazon said.Sales were up 35% overall in North America, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's business.They increased 29% in its international division thanks in part to a Prime Day surge, but the unit is still running at an operating loss.The firm also said it now has nearly 542,000 full and part-time staff, including workers from Whole Foods.It continues to look at ways to expand its physical stores as well.Microsoft Microsoft said it earned revenue of $24.5bn in the three months to end-September, up 12% year-on-year.The firm's profits were $6.6bn, rising 16%.Microsoft shares rose 3.1% after-hours to a record $81.2.Microsoft said growth was driven in part by its cloud computing products, which it has focused on in a bid to be less reliant on computer sales and older software.Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Microsoft, called it a "strong start" to the year.The firm reported $6.9bn in revenue from its intelligent cloud unit, up 14% year-on-year.Its productivity and business processes division, which includes sales from Office 365, reported $8.2bn in revenue, up 28%.A fourth tech company, Intel, also posted a jump in revenues and profit.The world's largest computer chip maker said revenue rose 2% during the quarter to $16.1bn, with net income up 34% to $4.52bn.
NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now "get their act together".WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to 230 ($300).The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said."Before 12 May 2017, the Department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is ransomware?Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients.how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.His "kill switch" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' The NAO said the NHS "has accepted that there are lessons to learn" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.WannaCry was "a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice," said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO."There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."Keith McNeil, chief clinical information officer for health and care at NHS England, said emergency plans were activated quickly and staff "went the extra mile" to provide care.Image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts.When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS.Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem.And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.
RBS culture criticised as bank settles US fraud claims:::::Image copyright Reuters Royal Bank of Scotland has settled a US criminal investigation that accused its traders of lying to clients over investments between 2008 and 2013.The US Department of Justice said RBS will pay $44m (33.4m) under the non-prosecution agreement.US Attorney Deirdre Daly said: "For years, RBS fostered a culture of securities fraud."RBS said it self-reported the issue to the US authorities and was pleased the matter was now resolved.The settlement is separate to what is expected to be a far larger penalty in the US over claims RBS mis-sold mortgage bonds leading up to the 2008 banking crisis.Thursday's settlement came after RBS was accused of cheating about 30 bank and investment clients over the prices and commissions of assets backed by mortgages.Among the victims of the fraud were Barclays, Citigroup, Soros Fund Management, Elliott Associates, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Ms Daly said: "Those in a position of authority taught and encouraged fraudulent trading practices.Worse, those supervisors and compliance personnel then took steps to prevent victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme."By entering into this agreement, RBS has admitted the seriousness of its past criminal conduct and made a clean break."A spokesman for RBS said: "Having identified misconduct and self-reported the matter to the authorities, RBS has extensively co-operated with this investigation."Two former managing directors have pleaded guilty, and RBS has zero tolerance for market misconduct."We are pleased to be able to resolve this issue as we continue to build a simpler, stronger bank that is fully focused on serving our customers well."The announcement comes after the Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday it may take action against RBS despite dismissing "serious allegations" about how the lender treated small business customers inside the Global Restructuring Group.
Twitter bans RT and Sputnik ads amid election interference fears:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Twitter is to donate all money earned from the outlets Twitter is banning two of Russia's biggest media outlets from buying advertising amid fears they attempted to interfere with the 2016 US election.The ban on advertising from Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, and all linked accounts, was "effective immediately".US authorities say both act as "a platform for Kremlin messaging".The social media giant will donate an estimated $1.9m (1.4m) made from the outlets into research on Twitter's use in "civic engagement and elections".Twitter said the decision "was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 US election and the US intelligence community's conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government".The statement, published on the social media platform's blog, continued: "We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter."The decision has provoked an angry response in Russia, with the country's foreign ministry accusing Twitter of bowing to pressure from the US intelligence services, saying the move was "another aggressive step" aimed at blocking Russian media in the US.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation It added "retaliatory measures" would follow, according to RIA Novosti news agency [in Russian], Meanwhile, responding to the allegations, RT's deputy editor-in-chief Kirill Karnovich-Valua said the outlet "has never been involved in any illegal activity online, and that it never pursued an agenda of influencing the US election through any platforms".His comments followed those of RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, who used Twitter's own platform to accuse the social network of pushing them to "spend big" during the election.Twitter did not comment when asked about the accusation, Reuters news agency said.Sputnik told news agency AFP it "has never used advertising on Twitter".Twitter is one of a number of companies keen to show they can self-regulate after it was found that Russian-backed groups were exploiting its ad platform.Its lawyers are due to appear before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees to discuss possible interference on 1 November.Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the 2016 elections.US intelligence services accuse the country of trying to sway the vote in Donald Trump's favour in various ways, including by spreading fake news and hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks in order to undermine rival Hillary Clinton.The allegations have sparked an investigation into possible links between Russia and Mr Trump, led by special counsel Rob Mueller, a former FBI director.Mr Trump denies there was any collusion.
Barclays shares close down 7% after profits disappoint:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Barclays boss Jes Staley is under investigation by the City regulator Shares in Barclays closed 7.4% down after its third-quarter profits figures came in below analysts' expectations.Profits for the period were up by 31% to 1.1bn, giving the bank a profit for the nine months so far of 3.4bn.But its investment banking profits were down from 1bn to 652m, in what the bank said had been a difficult quarter for its markets business.Barclays boss Jes Staley is currently being investigated over claims he tried to uncover the name of a whistleblower.The whistleblower wrote a letter that raised questions about the decision to employ one of Mr Staley's old colleagues from his JP Morgan days.Analysis, Simon Jack, business editor Barclays shares are getting hammered on continuing concerns over the performance of its investment bank where revenues were down 18%.Reviving this bit of the bank is the centrepiece of chief executive Jes Staley's strategy and there is little evidence he's delivering as Barclays is underperforming its peers.Already under scrutiny by the regulator for his handling of a whistleblowing incident, he is now under pressure from shareholders growing impatient with the profitability of the UK's only global investment bank.Barclays is also embroiled in a fight with the US government over how many billions it should pay in fines for its role in selling risky mortgages.Plus, it's been charged with fraud over funds raised in Qatar after the crisis.Mr Staley asked shareholders to keep faith with him today - but with the bank currently valued at just over half what its worth on paper - for now, he's preaching to the unconverted.Barclays has already reprimanded Mr Staley for his conduct, but the matter is still being investigated by financial regulators the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).Mr Staley is in charge of the UK's only remaining major international investment bank.Weak profits in investment banking are widespread, as activity in bond markets is muted against a background of abnormally low interest rates, which make it difficult for banks to slice off profits.Barclays, however, said profits growth had been driven by a 932m reduction in operating expenses and its performance had been encouraging.Its UK banking division saw an improvement in profitability and what it said was a "good underlying return" from its consumer, cards and payments business.Mr Staley said these results were important as they were the first for many years in which "we have not been in some state of restructuring".They were also helped by an absence of further provision for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling.In the first six months of the year, the bank set aside 700m.Its total provisions for PPI stand at 9.1bn.That could spell the end of the PPI scandal that has blighted UK banks' reputation and results.The bank also confirmed it was setting up a separate UK banking division to keep its day-to-day banking operations apart from the riskier investment banking, as required by new rules brought in to stop a repeat of last decade's credit crisis.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, gave a broad welcome to the results, but highlighted the investigation into Jes Staley - and the long list of other inquiries - as worrying."Litigation still remains a risk for Barclays, with more than 20 separate investigations ongoing, not least one relating to Jes Staley's attempt to uncover a whistleblower in his own ranks," he said.
Founder of US drug company arrested:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption William D Weinreb, acting US attorney in Massachusetts, announced the arrest US authorities have arrested the billionaire founder of a drug company and charged him with leading a conspiracy to bribe doctors to over-prescribe a powerful painkiller.The arrest of Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor follows years of investigation and actions against more than a dozen former Insys staff.Mr Kapoor has vowed to fight the charges.The suit comes as the US grapples with rising deaths tied to opioid abuse.On Thursday, President Donald Trump identified the problem as a public health emergency.William D Weinreb, acting US attorney in Massachusetts, said the charges, filed on Thursday, showed authorities are attacking the opioid problem at many levels."We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable - just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer," he said.An attorney for Mr Kapoor, 74, said he was innocent.He faces prison time and other penalties if found guilty.Insys declined to comment.Shares in the firm - once a fast-rising stock - plunged by more than 20% after the charges were announced.What are the charges?Prosecutors said Mr Kapoor led the drug company's efforts to boost sales of Subsys, a spray intended for cancer patients experiencing intense pain.Subsys contains fentanyl, which is addictive.They said the firm offered kickbacks and bribes to doctors and pharmacists who wrote "large numbers" of prescriptions for people who had not been diagnosed with cancer.They said they also worked to defraud insurance companies over reimbursements for the medication.Insys told investors in August that it has already paid millions of dollars to settle state investigations of practices related to Subsys and could pay more.Mr Kapoor's charges add to a case filed against six top managers last year.
BT to cut landline costs for up to one million people:::::BT will slash costs for customers who only have a landline, after a review by regulator Ofcom.From April 2018, the telecoms company will reduce the price of its monthly line rental by 7, a 37% decrease from the current cost of 18.99.The reduction will save up to a million households 84 a year, and customers will have their rental costs capped at the rate of inflation.Ofcom expects three other providers to follow suit.Nearly two-thirds of BT customers with only a landline are over 65 and more than three-quarters have never switched provider, the regulator said.Ofcom said they had been getting poor value for money in recent years, compared to those who buy bundles of landline, broadband and/or pay-TV services.Phone bills 'soar' BT said it welcomed "a balanced voluntary agreement with Ofcom" and that it had "listened to the concerns of our line-only customers".Two other providers have increased their rental charges by even more than BT.According to Ofcom, both Sky and Virgin Media have put up their charges by 47% above the rate of inflation since 2009.At the same time the wholesale cost of providing the service has actually fallen by 27% in real terms.Image copyright Getty Images "For many people, their landline is their lifeline," said Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition group director."But households who only have a landline - and no broadband - have seen their phone bills soar.Many are elderly and have been with BT for decades.We've been clear that they must get a better deal."The other firms that provide landline-only deals, Virgin Media, Sky and the Post Office, have not yet commentated on whether they will reduce their charges.However Virgin Media said it had already frozen rental charges for elderly and disabled customers at 17.99 a month.The Post Office said it would look again at the issue.Talk Talk withdrew from that part of the market, to concentrate on broadband and phone bundles.Age UK said it was disappointed that BT had to be prompted to cut charges by the regulator."We welcome the reduced tariffs, but we do find it disappointing that it has taken the intervention from Ofcom for this to happen," said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK.Ofcom also said it wanted to help those who buy a phone service from one provider and broadband from another.
Earnings fall for first time in three years:::::Image copyright Getty Images Official figures show wages fell in real terms by 0.4% in the year to April 2017.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this was the first fall in three years.It says that although wages rose by 2.2% in the year, inflation rose by more, eroding any gains.The median - middle - amount earned was 550 a week.Other data shows a narrowing of the gender pay gap to 9.1%, its smallest since the survey began in 1997.The weekly income figure shows the first recorded fall since April 2014, and follows a rise in inflation in the wake of the Brexit vote in June last year.Earnings, not adjusted for inflation, rose in 2017 by more among the lowest-paid workers.For those in the lowest 10%, full-time earnings rose by 3.5% compared with 2016.The percentage of those earning less than two-thirds of median hourly earnings has edged down from 19.4% in 2016 to 18.4%.Full-time workers in London are paid the most, on average, with a weekly wage of 692.Wales, the North East, Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and the Humber, and East Midlands all have, on average, 500.Gender 'chasm' ONS statistician Roger Smith said: "This year saw the joint highest rise since the economic downturn in 2008, in cash terms."However, higher inflation meant real earnings were down overall on the year for the first time since 2014."This wasn't the case for everyone, though - the lowest paid 10% of workers and those in some regions like the East Midlands still saw real increases, while other areas saw decreases."The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: "The full-time gender pay gap has inched a bit smaller but there is still a chasm between men and women's earnings."At this rate, it'll take decades for women to get paid the same as men."Six months after the government ordered large firms to reveal their gender pay gaps, the majority have yet to publish their figures.Charities, private and public sector employers with 250 or more employees must publish their figures by April 2018, in a bid to tackle workplace discrimination.Ms O'Grady said the government should "crank up the pressure on employers" and that, as well as publishing their gender pay gaps, companies should be forced to explain how they will close them.The Minister for Women and Equalities, Justine Greening, said: "Eliminating the gender pay gap is key to building a stronger economy where everyone plays by the same rules."It is simply good business sense to recognise the enormous potential of women and to take action to nurture and progress female talent."
Ford profits jump but China challenge remains:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ford has said it will focus on successful lines, including trucks Strong pickup truck sales in North America boosted profits at Ford in the third quarter, but the US car maker still faces an uphill battle in China.The firm had profits of $1.6bn (1.2bn), up more than 60% compared to the same quarter last year, when a recall raised costs.The gains in the US came despite a slowdown in sales of new cars there.Ford has looked to strong demand for pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to keep sales steady.A large part of the company's profits came from its F-Series pickup trucks, which have been the best-selling vehicle in North America for decades.Ford said the average transaction price for its trucks rose $2,800 to $45,400.But the firm is feeling pressure to boost its share price, which has drifted lower in recent years.Investors say Ford is behind when it comes to self driving car technology and has not made strong enough inroads in China - the world's largest vehicle market.China challenge The firm said in September that it had sold about 833,000 vehicles in China in the first nine months of the year, down about 5% compared to the same period in 2016.By contrast, rival General Motors and its joint venture partners sold more than 2.7m cars in the first nine months, up about 1%.Ford told investors it sees "enormous opportunities" to improve its performance of its Asia Pacific division, including in China.In August, Ford said it was exploring a joint venture with Zotye, a local firm focused on electric vehicles.But it warned investors that competitive pressure to keep prices low in China and the rising cost of raw materials may limit profit margins in coming months.Ford revenue in the three months to the end of September was $36.5bn, up 1% year-on-year.Ford chief executive Jim Hackett, who was installed this spring, said the firm is investing in autonomous vehicles and will start to test-drive cars in some US cities next year.Ford also is developing new business partnerships with unnamed companies to use its self-driving vehicles in commercial applications other than ride hailing, Hackett said.He declined to confirm whether Ford still planned to put those vehicles into service by 2021, executives have said.Rival General Motors Co said in recent weeks it plans to accelerate the commercial application of its self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, some of which could be in operation before 2020.GM also plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles by 2023.Shares in Ford rose 0.8% in morning trade after the results were released.
ECB to halve €60bn bond-buying programme:::::Image copyright Reuters The European Central Bank (ECB) will cut back its scheme designed to boost the economies of the eurozone.From January of next year, it will reduce the amount of assets it buys every month to 30bn from the current level of 60bn.The programme, which aimed to fend off the threat of eurozone deflation and help boost employment, could finish by the end of next year.Inflation is likely to be below the 2% ECB target for the next few years.The ECB said the reduced programme would run to the end of September 2018, "or beyond, if necessary".If economic conditions become less favourable, or if no progress is likely to be made towards the ECB's inflation target, it could increase bond-buying again, it said."Our programme is flexible enough that we can adjust its size smoothly," ECB President Mario Draghi told a press conference.There will be no sudden end to bond-buying, he said.Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker The recovery in the eurozone is gaining momentum, so the ECB will ease the pressure on the accelerator a little, but only a little.The economy still needs a lot of help from the ECB's policies.The quantitative easing (QE) purchases will continue and even when they finish - next September at the earliest - the ECB will have a large stock of assets that would normally be in private sector hands.And then there are the ECB's ultra-low interest rates, with its main rate at zero and one of them below even that level.That won't change until well after the QE purchases are over.So yes, the ECB is moving its policies back towards normal.But it has a long way to go yet.The ECB kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro unchanged at 0%, and its deposit rate at -0.4%.The central bank charges banks and other financial institutions to deposit excess money with it to encourage banks to lend."Today's monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards [target]," Mr Draghi said.He said the ECB will reinvest the principal investment from maturing bonds for an extended period after the end of the bond-buying programme, which could run to billions of euros per month.The decision to cut quantitative easing measures was not unanimous among ECB policymakers, and a large majority favoured keeping monetary stimulus open-ended, he said.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Draghi had been signalling the move for months He was asked whether the political situation in Catalonia was a threat to financial stability in Spain and in the eurozone."It's very very difficult to comment about developments that change every day."Mr Draghi said."Of course we are following what's happening.The importance of what's happening is significant.To conclude now there would be financial stability risks would be premature, we'll have to see what's going to happen.But rest assured, we look at that with attention.Great attention," he said.Markets muted Mr Draghi has been signalling for months that the bond-buying scheme will be reduced."Mario Draghi's main goal for months now has been to gently steer markets into thinking that this tapering would come today.He's done that so markets take the announcement in their stride, which they will," said Patrick O'Donnell, Aberdeen Standard Investments senior investment manager.One of the key provisions made by the ECB was the open-ended nature of the programme, said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics."We do not expect a hard stop for quantitative easing in September next year, and see the ECB buying, albeit at a reduced pace of 15bn to 20bn, until the end of 2018, at least," he said.
FTSE 100 closes up despite Barclays' woes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Barclays was the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 as its third-quarter results failed to impress investors.The bank's share price closed 7.4% down after a weak performance in its investment banking division led to lower-than-expected profits.Housebuilder Barratt also fell heavily, down 4.2% after going ex-dividend However, a 3.3% rise for Unilever and a strong trading session for mining stocks helped the FTSE 100 closed up 0.53% at 7,486.5 points.GlaxoSmithKline shares fell 3.4%, extending Wednesday's post-results losses to hit their lowest for more than a year after Credit Suisse cut its target price on the pharma stock.Analysts at the Swiss bank pointed to uncertainty over Glaxo's HIV segment ViiV and said the company's post-results call was more cautious than expected.So far, this third-quarter results season has been marred by significant share price drops from large-cap firms such as Convatec and Whitbread, as well as profit warnings from small-caps Pendragon and Dialight earlier in the week."If you look at UK domestic firms, there's quite a lot of bad news that's expected because Brexit is hanging over results," said Hargeaves Lansdown's Laith Khalaf.On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.69% against the dollar at $1.3169.But it was up 0.3% on the euro at 1.1257.
Twitter nears profit as it adds users:::::Image copyright Reuters Twitter said it may turn a profit in the fourth quarter as the tech company narrowed its losses and added users.The firm, which has not posted a profit since going public four years ago, said its losses narrowed from $103m (78m) to $21m in the third quarter.The number of monthly active users grew by four million to a total of 330 million at the end of September.Twitter said its revenue reached $590m, a 4% decrease compared with the same period in 2016.The social media company, which faces intense competition from the likes of Facebook and Instagram, said it had previously mis-stated the number of users, as it "had included users of certain third-party applications".It revised those figures down by two million users in the second quarter."This quarter, we made progress in three key areas of our business," Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said."We grew our audience and engagement, made progress on a return to revenue growth, and achieved record profitability."The numbers come as Twitter ramps up efforts to boost engagement, following mounting criticism that it is not doing enough to tackle abuse on the social network and that its ads platform was misused.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chief executive Jack Dorsey has been taking action against abuse on Twitter Earlier this month, Mr Dorsey said Twitter would take a more "aggressive stance" against online abuse.The firm also promised to penalise users who post messages that glorify or condone violence and to review user complaints more quickly.Twitter has also been focusing on boosting engagement through video and live events.Many social platforms are adding millions a day by comparison and "Twitter is done growing," said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki.Video has not made much of a difference and its ad platform has made little progress, he added.
Debenhams annual profits fall sharply:::::Image copyright Reuters Department store chain Debenhams reported annual profits down by 44% at 59m amid what it called an "uncertain" trading environment.The figure included 36.2m of exceptional charges, in part relating to store closures and the closure of its Northampton distribution centre.Same-store sales in physical outlets were flat, but mobile sales are growing fast and were up by 57%.Chief executive Sergio Bucher said the company was "making progress".Mr Bucher, who took over a year ago, said in the statement: "We are making good progress with implementing our new strategy, Debenhams Redesigned, and are encouraged by the results from our initial trials, as well as the number of exciting new partners who want to work with us."But he warned: "The environment remains uncertain and we face tough comparatives over the key Christmas weeks."Gift foods Sales of beauty products, accessories and food and drink helped to offset what was a weak clothing market, Debenhams said.Food sales were one of the better performers, rising by 8%.The chain has a cafe or restaurant in most stores, and sells a range of gift-type food, such as prosecco mixers, chocolates and chutneys.The company said at the time of its interim results, in April, that it would close 11 warehouses and put up to 10 stores under review.The company is also slimming down its in-house brands.Mr Bucher said the "early signs from our activity to date confirm that we are moving in the right direction towards a successful and profitable future for Debenhams".George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that, as a former Amazon executive, Mr Bucher was well qualified to guide Debenhams: "The obvious solution to the problem of declining high street footfall is to steer the ship towards 21st-Century sales methods."He points out that many of the stores have long leases, so Debenhams is tied to physical outlets and has "little more flexibility than a supertanker just now".The company is making the best of this.As well as putting in place restaurants, it has opened gyms in some of the excess space in store.
Las Vegas Sands to build London-themed resort in Macau:::::Image copyright Press Association US gaming giant Las Vegas Sands has unveiled plans for a London-themed resort in Macau.The resort is part of plans to spend $1.1bn (830m) on renovating the firm's five properties in China's gambling enclave.Sands said that the revamped resort would feature some "recognisable landmarks".The move comes as Macau's gambling revenues begin to bounce back after a Beijing-led crackdown on corruption.The Londoner will replace Sands Cotai Central, which currently features more than 6,000 hotel rooms, 4,000 sq ft of retail space and a 1,700-seat cinema.Robert Goldstein, Sands' president and chief operating officer, said the resort's facade would resemble "something with all the iconic architectural look and feel of Big Ben"."If you think about London, it's iconic in so many ways, the buses to the Beefeaters, and there's just so many opportunities there," he added."Our team is having great fun playing with that."Sands has invested more than $13bn into the region since 2002, when it became the first US company to open a casino there.Its latest announcement comes as Chinese authorities place increasing pressure on the region to diversify away from gambling, leading to a race by major firms to build resorts before casino licenses start to expire in 2020.Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal, but its reputation as a money laundering centre recently made it the focus of prosecutions against several high-profile government and casino officials.But more gambling money is making its way into the semi-autonomous region of southern China.Macau's Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau reported gambling revenues of 67bn patacas ($8.3bn) between July and September this year, up 22% from 2016.In its latest quarterly results, the firm said that during the same period, total net revenues for Sands China - its Chinese subsidiary - increased 12.2% to $1.93bn."Our strategy to again boost our investment in Macau is testimony to our unwavering belief in the secular growth trend in China," said Sheldon Adelson, the founder, chairman and chief executive of Sands.
UK car manufacturing falls in September:::::Image copyright PA UK car production fell during September as confidence was hit by Brexit uncertainty, according to a major car industry body.Plans to improve air quality also added to the decline in car output, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.A 14% fall in demand in the UK market drove the overall drop, it said.But a government spokesperson said "the UK's automotive industry remains a great British success story".Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: "With UK car manufacturing falling for a fifth month this year, it's clear that declining consumer and business confidence is affecting domestic demand and hence production volumes.""Brexit is the greatest challenge of our times and yet we still don't have any clarity on what our future relationship with our biggest trading partner will look like, nor detail of the transitional deal being sought," he said.Mr Hawes said that "uncertainty regarding the national air quality plans also didn't help the domestic market for diesel cars, despite the fact that these new vehicles will face no extra charges or restrictions across the UK."In July government set out statutory plans to reduce roadside nitrogen dioxide pollution.Mr Hawes added that "leaving the EU with no deal would be the worst outcome for our sector" and urged the government to "safeguard the competitiveness of the industry".UK car output fell more than 4% to 153,224 vehicles in September.Image copyright Getty Images Production also fell in April, May, June, and August.Domestic demand dropped 14.2% to 31,421 units in September, contributing to an overall year-to-date production decrease of 2.2%.But a Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: "We have seen significant recent investment in the UK from companies in the sector."The government has already put 260m into "advanced propulsion" research, and has invested 246m over four years in battery technology, the spokesperson said."This will ensure the UK builds on its strengths and leads the world in the design, development and manufacture of electric batteries to secure the future of our automotive sector in the low carbon economy," the spokesperson added.In September general UK manufacturing growth accelerated, a closely watched survey indicated.Arndt Ellinghorst, head of global automotive research at Evercore ISI, said consumer confidence had been on the decline.But he said UK car production had been at a "very high level" earlier in the year, and was "due to correct anyhow".He added that about 70% of UK car production was for export, so the "overall numbers are still ok", and that manufacturers such as BMW were doing well.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce feted for backing gay marriage:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Qantas boss Alan Joyce tells Today why Australia is an incredible "meritocracy" Alan Joyce, boss of the Australian airline Qantas, has been named the world's most influential LGBT business executive in an annual listing.He was chosen for his vocal campaigning in favour of same-sex marriage, an issue Australians are voting on now."No one should feel like they need to live a double life," said Mr Joyce.Networking group OUTstanding and the Financial Times compile the annual list recognising positive LGBT role models in business."In the past year I've worked hard to drive changes in my own workplace and indeed my own country," Mr Joyce said.As well as speaking up personally on the question of same-sex marriage, Mr Joyce has encouraged other business leaders to join him in campaigning for a "yes" vote in the Australian ballot.He said more than 1,300 firms have put their name to the cause.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has promised that if a majority of Australians support same-sex marriage in the poll, parliament will debate amending the Marriage Act, which could lead to the country becoming the 25th country to permit same-sex marriage.The ballot will close on 7 November; latest reports indicate that nearly three-quarters of eligible voters have already returned their ballots with nearly two weeks left to go."As an openly gay man and being the leader of this organisation and a high profile business leader in Australia, I felt it was very important that I led by example and was out there promoting the case," Mr Joyce told the BBC.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Results of the postal ballot will be announced on 15 November Mr Joyce was born in Ireland and took over as chief executive of Qantas in 2008.Last month eyebrows were raised as his remuneration package almost doubled to nearly A$25m (14.5m) following a significant rise in the Qantas share price."I think Australia is a great meritocracy.Where else in the world would you have an openly gay Irish man coming to this country to run probably the most iconic Australian brand in the world?"he said.However, in March Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton criticised Mr Joyce and other business leaders for intervening in the debate.And in May a man smeared a lemon meringue pie in Mr Joyce's face during a public event, apparently in response to his pro-equal marriage stance.The OUTstanding list, which has been running for five years, also names the chief executive of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison, as the leading "Ally Executive" for her role in supporting members of the LGBT community in the workplace.The list's authors said Ms Morrison had gone further than other executives in supporting diversity, through policies such as celebrating Pride events, offering a gender-neutral parental leave policy and urging the repeal of a measure in North Carolina requiring transgender persons to use bathrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate.Stuart Barette, a senior project manager at HSBC, was named OUTstanding Future Leader and praised as a transgender role model.
Hurricanes dent profits at insurance giant Munich Re:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Flooding on the outskirts of Houston, Texas following Hurricane Harvey One of the world's biggest insurance firms has said it will take a loss in the third quarter because of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.Munich Re expects the hurricanes that ravaged parts of the US and the Caribbean to cost it 2.7bn (2.4bn) owing to major loss expenditure.The firm, which insures other insurance companies, said estimates were "still fraught with considerable uncertainty".The insurer now projects a "small" profit for 2017 because of the claims."High losses from severe natural catastrophes are part and parcel of our business," said Joerg Schneider, chief financial officer of Munich Re."We will continue to offer our clients full reinsurance capacity."Mexican earthquakes and other disasters will take overall losses for the quarter to about 3.2bn.Munich Re is not the first major insurance company to see its profits dented by the hurricanes.Image copyright AFP Image caption The French island of Saint-Martin was one of the hardest hit by Hurricane Irma Swiss firm Zurich Insurance this month estimated the three hurricanes would result in about $700m (529m) in claims for the quarter, with losses expected to reach about $620m.Swiss Re projects that claims from the hurricanes coupled with the earthquakes in Mexico may reach up to $3.6bn.
Deutsche to pay $220m over Libor probe:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Deutsche has paid billions to settle investigations of interest rate rigging Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay $220m (150m) to resolve a US investigation into its manipulation of interest rates.It is the latest settlement stemming from banks' involvement in the rigging of the benchmark Libor rate.The sum is more than twice the $100m British bank Barclays agreed to pay last year to end a similar probe.It comes on top of a $2.5bn fine US and UK regulators levied against Deutsche in 2015, also over rate fixing.The latest settlement was announced by top attorneys in New York and California, who led the investigation into interest rate rigging on behalf of 45 states.The probe found that Deutsche Bank defrauded government entities and charities by making false or misleading submissions to set benchmark rates, including Libor, and trying to influence submission proposed by other banks.The aim was to move the rates to benefit internal trading positions.The misconduct started as early as 2005 and continued through the global financial crisis.Libor, which is set by leading financial institutions through regular submissions of inter-bank rates, influences the rates used for borrowing on credit cards, mortgages, student loans and other transactions.Charities and government entities were defrauded of millions because of the activities, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.Those groups will be eligible for about $213m from the settlement, with the remainder going to pay legal fees."We will not tolerate fraudulent, manipulative or collusive conduct that interferes with or undermines confidence in our financial markets," said Mr Schneiderman."Large financial institutions, like all other market participants, have to abide by the rules."Deutsche said the penalty resolves its final inquiry from US regulators.The US regulators said their investigation of other banks continues.
Kobe Steel loses quality seal for copper products:::::Image copyright Getty Images Kobe Steel is losing Japan's quality seal for copper products, following its data falsification scandal.Kobe said the government-backed Japan Industrial certification was revoked owing to "improper quality management" at a factory outside of Tokyo.As a result, the quality of copper products made at its plant in Hatano will no longer be certified by Japan.The decision could further hurt Japan's third-largest steelmaker as its clients have been switching to its competitors.Shares in Kobe Steel fell 1.5% after it said it would lose its Japanese Industrial Standards certificate.According to the Reuters news agency, the firm believes there could be four new cases of data falsification.But Kobe Steel has confirmed the safety of products delivered to nearly half of the 525 clients which had received products affected by the falsified data.Car, plane and train makers including Boeing, Toyota and Nissan have been striving to ensure the safety of their own products.The firm added that none of its customers had found any cases requiring their products to be recalled.Kobe Steel's troubles began earlier this month, when it admitted faking data for more than a decade on the quality of some of its products.Since the scandal emerged, Kobe Steel's shares have fallen close to 38% including the latest drop on Thursday.
Bombardier sheds 280 jobs, Schlumberger plans plant closure:::::Image copyright Pacemaker Aerospace firm Bombardier is planning to cut another 280 jobs at its Northern Ireland operations.It is the latest in a series of redundancies which form part of the company's five-year plan to cut costs and increase profitability.Meanwhile, the oil field services firm, Schlumberger, is proposing to close its Newtownabbey plant next year putting more than 200 jobs at risk.It said the industry was enduring the worst "downturn of the past 30 years".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland Last year, Bombardier cut 1,000 jobs in NI - about 20% of its local workforce.In September it said a further 95 support staff would be made redundant.Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics & business editor It has been a gloomy week for manufacturing: Production ceased at JTI in Ballymena, Bombardier is making more redundancies and Schlumberger's plant faces closure.But the full picture is more complicated.The latest quarterly employment survey for the quarter to June 2017 showed the sector is still adding jobs, albeit at a marginal rate.The number of manufacturing employees was up 1.1% over the year to 82, 970.On a longer view of the recovery, from June 2012 to June 2017, manufacturing jobs increased by 11%, making it the best performing sector.It may be that the next survey will show employment falling as previously announced redundancies feed through.But manufacturing still remains an important part of the Northern Ireland economy.In a statement, Bombardier said: "We continue to review our manpower requirements in Belfast and regret to confirm that we must reduce our workforce levels by around 280"."Those impacted will be functional support personnel, including managers and professional staff."The company has faced severe financial pressure as cost overruns on its new C-Series jet drained cash out of the company.That pressure was eased last week when Airbus said it would take a majority stake in C-Series project with a view to buying it outright.Davy Thompson of Unite described the Bombardier job losses as devastating and "premature"."This news is all the more concerning as it comes despite management pronouncement that the Airbus acquisition of a 50.01% stake in the C-Series programme might result in a potential doubling of production on site," he said."Unite has highlighted the fact that Airbus paid nothing for this stake and that it will only come into effect in the second half of 2018."It means that the deal, while providing some hope for the C-Series in the future, has made little to no impact on the financial pressures faced by the company in the present."Newtownabbey job losses Schlumberger said it currently employs 205 full-time people, including contractors in Northern Ireland.However, it said the oil and gas industry is going through "the most severe downturn of the past 30 years with operators significantly reducing their investment".The company said it understands the impact of its announcement and the impact the proposal to close its Newtownabbey plant would have if it goes ahead.Image copyright Google Image caption More than 200 jobs are under threat at oil field services firm Schlumberger Schlumberger said: "Every effort will be made to support our employees, including potentially transferring some staff to other locations."We will continue to identify opportunities such as this, as they become available."Susan Fitzgerald from Unite described the news as "another hammer blow for Northern Ireland's manufacturing sector"."We are aware that they have transferred much activity formerly conducted onsite at Newtownabbey to other, low-cost locations, including China," Ms Fitzgerald said."We are concerned that the company's global corporate management are attempting to use the downturn in the oil and gas sector as cover to further outsource jobs to low cost alternative locations.If so we will be rejecting their logic."
'Depression lost me my job': How mental health costs up to 300,000 jobs a year:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption James Tringham, who has bipolar disorder, explains that being at work has a "normalising effect" Hayley Smith says her manager encouraged her to apply for other jobs when she told her she had depression.The news about her illness spread across the office."It was horrible - I felt really exposed," she says.After a few anxious, unhappy months, she left.Hayley is one of up to 300,000 people with mental health problems who leave their jobs each year, a report says.The report by mental health experts also says poor mental health costs the UK economy up to 99bn each year.Paul Farmer, co-author of the Thriving At Work report, said mental health was a taboo subject in many workplaces.Mr Farmer, who is chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: "Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need."In many instances, employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support."The review makes 40 recommendations for how to support employees to remain at work, including creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy.Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports.Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report said.Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it showed "we need to take action".The civil service has agreed to take on the report's recommendations.Image copyright Hayley Smith Image caption Hayley Smith lost her job when she told her employer about her depression One employer the report praised is the insurer, Aviva.James Tringham, who has worked for the company for seven years, said it helped him get his life back on track after suffering with bipolar disorder."In 2009, I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor," he says."I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine."Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre."They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up."Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back."There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help.And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Footballer Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support The review says employers should: Create a mental health at work plan Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible Encourage open conversations Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff Routinely monitor employee mental health The review said that people with long-term mental health problems were leaving jobs at twice the rate of colleagues with no such issues, although it did say that some people may be counted twice - if they left one job, returned to work elsewhere after a break but were then unable to continue in their new post.The report also pointed out the cost to employers, estimating they were losing 42bn each year because of staff suffering from mental health problems.Mrs May said: "It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being."What is mental health?For Hayley Smith, support from her employer could have made her chronic depression more bearable.After leaving her job, she started her own company.Five years on, she now employs others."In the long term, it's given me awareness of mental health," she says."And the awareness to make sure I was never going to make people feel the way I was made to feel."

Kellogg's sorry for 'racist' cereal box:::::Cereal giant Kellogg's has apologised after it was accused of "teaching racism" on one of its cereal boxes.It's after a complaint about the pictures on the front of the Corn Pops box which shows yellow characters having fun and a brown character scrubbing the floor.Author Saladin Ahmed tweeted the company saying it is "teaching kids racism".Kellogg's then replied saying they have updated the artwork.Saladin Ahmed is the writer of the Black Bolt series for Marvel Comics and author of the 2012 book Throne of the Crescent Moon.He was outraged because the only brown Corn Pop on the box was depicted as a janitor.A few hours after his tweet, the Kellogg's US Twitter account responded saying they were committed to diversity and inclusion.Saladin later tweeted to say he "genuinely appreciated" the quick response from the company.It's not the first time a big brand has come under fire for racism recently.Just a week ago, moisturiser brand Nivea was criticised for an advert promising one of its products will lighten black skin.And earlier this month Dove apologised after releasing a series of images that appeared to show a black woman turning white after using their soap.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Why are businesses taking a stand on political debates?:::::Image copyright Jigsaw Fashion label Jigsaw is the latest company to take a political stance with a new, pro-immigration fashion campaign titled Heart Immigration.Its advertising campaign includes a manifesto declaring: "British style is not 100% British.In fact, there's no such thing as 100% British.""As a clothing brand, we couldn't do what we do if people weren't free to move around," the advert continues."Without immigration, we'd be selling potato sacks."The campaign has drawn praise from figures including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, but Jigsaw has also come under fire on social media for taking a stance on what is considered a political issue.It's not the first company to feel the heat for expounding its beliefs, and with politics on both sides of the Atlantic becoming increasingly polarised, it's unlikely to be the last either.'All are welcome' "It's not about politics, it's just basic humanity and values for us," says Jigsaw chief executive Peter Ruis.He adds: "Immigration is something very normal, it's living and working in another country.And it seems to have been demonised as a word."Image copyright Jigsaw Image caption "It's just basic humanity and values for us": Jigsaw chief executive Peter Ruis But no matter what the viewpoint of customers, Mr Ruis says "everyone is welcome in our stores"."Our campaign is not about numbers or what are the right border controls," says Mr Ruis, whose company employs people from more than 45 countries."Our campaign is just celebrating Britain, this country that has welcomed foreigners for thousands of years."Jigsaw is one of an increasing number of big businesses overtly weighing in on public debates around controversial political issues.No company has positioned itself as anti-immigration, but senior management figures at several firms have made their opinions on Brexit clear.One of the most vocal advocates of the UK leaving the EU is Tim Martin, founder and chairman of the pub chain JD Wetherspoon.During the referendum campaign, Mr Martin donated 200,000 to the Leave campaign and had 200,000 beer mats printed and distributed across pubs, bearing messages arguing the UK was better off leaving the EU.More recently, he signed a joint letter urging Theresa May to walk away from Brexit negotiations if the EU refused to start trade talks.Vacuum cleaner magnate James Dyson, one of the UK's leading entrepreneurs, has also called Brexit "a liberation and a wonderful opportunity for all of us".Activist consumers Across the Atlantic, major US companies are increasingly taking public stances on political issues, spurred largely by the Trump administration policies on immigration, climate change and other controversial topics.In an Instagram post, jeweller Tiffany & Co said "the disaster of climate change is too real" and called on President Donald Trump to keep the US in the Paris Climate Agreement.Corporate giants including Apple and Facebook also voiced their opposition to Mr Trump's controversial ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries in Africa and the Middle East.Starbucks boss Howard Schultz even pledged to hire 10,000 refugees globally over the next five years.But does this mean that businesses are becoming increasingly moved to act on their conscience, or is something else at play?"Increasingly, people are looking to companies to fill the role of government around social ills as public trust in institutions falls to new lows," says Petah Marian, senior editor at business trend forecaster WGSN."We are describing Generation Z as the activist consumer," says Ms Marian, referring to the generation often known as post-millennials."This cohort will use their smartphone to launch a social media protest or boycott of a product if a brand's values do not meet theirs, which requires brands to think carefully around what it is that they stand for."While the motives of some companies may be complex, one thing is agreed upon: it's a trend that's here to stay.
The flying drones putting workers out of a job:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans.Online grocer Ocado believes it will not need any human labour at all within 10 years.And online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Analysts believe the strong appetite for Asian stocks can continue Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs."Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time," says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors."Now we've moved on from there".Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks."Markets seem impervious to events," says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy."Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent".And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many markets in Asia are trading at historic or multi-year highs Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.Regional growth Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive.Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street.At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been underpinning the broader region for some time.The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates.Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore."China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia," says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.Image copyright AFP Image caption Asia is home to two of the world's three largest economies, China and Japan Japan's economy is also gathering steam.Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher."Japan has a long way to go.There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines," he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds."There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China," Mr Rogers says.Earnings bump That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world.Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost.For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter.CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.It's got a lot to do with memory chips.Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.Which brings us back to North Korea.Image copyright AFP Image caption North Korea insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk.Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as "kind of overblown".That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action.Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.'Unknown' threat Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.Mr Rogers says political risk and "unpredictability" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies.The threat of the "unknown" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region."The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast," says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street.Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump.But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street.History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world."If the US blows up, most things will come off.[Asia] won't be immune," says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors."Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful.Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."
The US and Iranian battle over the pistachio nut trade:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Relations between the US and Iran the two have an outsized impact on the global trade in pistachios There are lots of casualties in international conflicts but this one is nuts, you might say - although strictly speaking the pistachio is a seed.The international pistachio trade has faced unexpected headwinds due to the tensions between Iran and the US.The global pistachio industry is a multi-billion dollar a year sector that is continuing to grow in value as its popularity as a foodstuff grows.The US and Iran dominate the world's trade in pistachios - collectively controlling between 70% and 80% of yearly output for the last decade.Over the last forty years, Iran's growers have faced pressures from sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on their ability to access international financial tools.Although pistachios themselves were not on the list of sanctioned products, restrictions on global banking made trade difficult for Iranian farmers.All that changed in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal, officially The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).This agreement with the US and its allies removed sanctions.It wasn't just Iranian oil that came flowing back onto the international market, pistachio exports began gaining overseas markets.Trump's threat That progress could face challenges though.US President Donald Trump called the agreement created under his predecessor the "worst" deal the US has ever made.In October he decertified the agreement.The move passes responsibility to the US Congress to evaluate and determine whether it believes Iran is compliant with the terms and if the US should remain in the deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Over 90% of US pistachios are grown in California President Trump said in the speech announcing his decision that the agreement "threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline," but had failed to prevent Iran's "sprint" towards nuclear weapon development.For Iran's pistachio industry the threat of losing the deal and reinstating sanctions could mean the return of what Hojat Hassani Sadi, deputy director of the Iran Pistachio Association calls "unfair and unequal competition".Ancient roots The pistachio industry in Iran dates back thousands of years.By contrast, pistachio farming in the US started in the 1930s with Persian seeds.The boom in commercial pistachio cultivation came after the US severed ties with Iran following the 1979 hostage crisis, after which the US and its allies placed sanctions on Iran.Over the next several decades, even in countries where Iranian pistachios were welcomed, restrictions on its companies' ability to access international financing made it hard for the industry to flourish.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Archaeological evidence suggests pistachios were first grown in what is now Iraq in 7,000BC During that time the US market expanded, with farmers - mainly across California - planting the crop.But in 2014. hot and dry weather conditions across the western US cost the industry nearly half its crop and cut profits for 2015 - the year those nuts were sold - by close to $1.4bn (1bn).Globally, pistachio prices rose, but for Iran's growers it was also an opportunity.Price competition The price of pistachios has been on the rise since 2002.Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers (APG) trade association, attributes this to increased awareness of their health properties and global demand for healthy snacks."The industry has been pushing the products with advertising," he says, adding that middle-class demand in developing markets has also boosted exports.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Increased demand in China has been key to sector growth.Between 2008 and 2013 Chinese imports of US pistachios rose 146% according to APG.But the 2014 drought saw the price of California's nuts rocket from $3/lb (453g) to over $5/lb.By contrast Iran's pistachio yield that year was strong.In markets like China, they were able to undercut American prices by close to $0.20/lb.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pistachio plants grow best in arid climates but that leave crops vulnerable to water shortages A strong growing year in 2016 has helped the US market recover and led to a moderation in price.But Iran has another advantage that helps it in global trade - its location."Iran has a transportation advantage.They can certainly take markets away and China is an example of that," says Mr Matoian.Uphill march The advantages and disadvantages for Iran are not only linked to sanctions.Iran claims its pistachios have a better taste, as do several large European distributors, though the US and Iran mainly grow the same strain.(Turkish pistachios, for example, are a different variety.)The US also imposes a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios meaning even without sanctions the US market has been all but cut off for Iran.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aging water infrastructure in Iran is a major difficultly for Iran's farmers Water shortages are another problem for Iran.According to Mr Sadi it is the "major obstacle to growth" for his industry.Iran's pistachio sector is second in the world following the strong 2016 season in the US.And with the two countries dominating so much of the global market, Iran isn't in dire need of a comeback.But for the growing number of pistachio fans around the world increased access to Iran's pistachio exports and decreasing prices would be a sweet outcome.
The 350 million people who don’t even exist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Whenever any report has a "global" subject matter it's never long before there's a massive, global-size statistic, counting people by the millions and billions.News reports on global problems like to gesture to devastation and deprivation on an epic scale, counting out the suffering in numbers so big that they almost lose meaning.And maybe they actually do go astray.Because the annual monitoring report on education from the United Nations education agency, Unesco, makes the point that global figures on access to education could be out by a factor of 350 million.That's not a minor gap in the headcount.That's the equivalent of the combined populations of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Undocumented and invisible These "invisible" people, below the demographic radar, are described as "the poorest of the poorest".These are families growing up in places where censuses and administrators do not reach.These are millions of unregistered lives in sprawling slums around some cities in the developing world, or in families living illegally and undocumented as migrants.Unesco's report says that the conventional means of gathering information - such as household surveys, censuses and records of birth and death - are only likely to be accurate for populations that are settled, visible and accessing services.Image copyright EPA Image caption How accurate are international figures on education targets?Shifting and excluded populations, even in their tens of millions, are harder to identify and can slip away from the spreadsheets and the data gatherers.Children living on the streets might not show up in the numbers not making it to school.They won't even count enough to be absences.The homeless or nomadic are missing from population studies going from house to house.Unwanted refugees driven over borders by political violence can be left uncounted and unrecognised by reluctant hosts.The UN agency estimates an undercount of 250 million in household surveys used in developing countries and says another 100 million are likely to be outside the reach of official statistics, including those living as illegal immigrants in wealthier countries.Taking account This year's education monitoring report focuses on accountability.But the Unesco study highlights that holding governments accountable for failing to deliver education services depends on knowing how many people need to be supported.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.International goals to cut illiteracy and increase access to school places need to recognise that some of the most disadvantaged are not even part of the target.Unesco says that it raises the question of who is responsible for people who don't even appear in national figures.Such discrepancies appear in the UN agency's own range of figures.Unesco says that its annual statistics for children without access to school include an estimate for those hard to reach communities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More pupils are getting access to school - but 264 million are still missing out But in comparisons for inequalities in access and public spending on education, Unesco says these "invisible" millions are not included.The UN agency makes the point that if the "mantra" of the current development goals is that "no one is left behind", for hundreds of millions, they never even get as far as being recognised as existing.As such, "no one is ultimately held to account for protecting their rights".Missing school This year's newly-released figures show 264 million young people without access to primary or secondary school.The report warns of six successive years in which education has received a declining share of aid budgets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Undocumented migrants and the homeless can go below the radar of official figures And an international group of former education ministers, the Atlantis Group, including former UK education secretary Nicky Morgan and US education secretary Arne Duncan, has called for a greater commitment to aid for education.Last month, another UN agency, Unicef, reported there had been "nearly zero progress" in the past decade on improving access to school in the poorest countries.And earlier this month, Unesco's Institute for Statistics warned of a "staggering" problem in lack of quality in schools, with more than 600 million young people who have been to school but are lacking basic skills in literacy and numeracy.Counting in education and making education count remain a challenge.
Why businesses are saving the humble text message:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm that sends two billion text messages per year If you think that WhatsApp is killing the humble text message you may need to think again.A growing number of us are sending far fewer text messages than we used to.Armed with our fancy smartphones, in recent years we have instead switched to the likes of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, and of course WhatsApp for our chats.As a result, the number of text (or SMS, as they are officially known) messages being sent per day around the world has now fallen far behind the more hi-tech rivals.At WhatsApp alone, 55 billion messages are now sent globally every day, more than twice the 22 billion figure for SMS messages.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are switching from texts to the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Yet while the number of text messages being sent by people in the developed world has fallen since 2011, there continues to be one big growth area - notification SMS messages sent from businesses to customers.Most of us are now increasingly receiving such text messages on a regular basis, such as when you are being reminded of an opticians' appointment, when an engineer will come to repair your boiler, or when a delivery is going to arrive.One company at the forefront of this business text messaging industry is a small English firm Esendex, based in Nottingham, in the East Midlands.With just 200 employees, it now sends out two billion text messages per year, on behalf of 30,000 businesses and other organisations, up from 100 million texts in 2010.Image caption Businesses are now increasingly sending text messages to their customers Esendex is already the biggest player in the UK, France and Italy; it is growing strongly in Germany, Spain and Australia.And it is a lucrative business.Esendex has annual revenues of 23m a year, as firms pay it a fee for every text sent.Meanwhile, a report earlier this year predicted that the global business text message industry would be worth $70bn by 2020, up from $55bn in 2014, as more and more texts are sent out to customers.Geoff Love, Esendex's chief executive, says while friends may like to chat over Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, there are a number of key reasons why businesses prefer to send out text messages instead."SMS is the only app that's on every phone in the world, so no matter who you are trying to communicate with, you know they can receive a text message."Test messaging facts SMS stands for Short Message Service The first text was sent in 1992 by British software engineer Neil Papworth.It read simply "Merry Christmas" 15.2 million texts are sent globally every minute Text messages are read, on average, within five minutes of being received Text messages are up to 160 characters in length Google is working on a new version of text messaging called RCS or Rich Communication Services, which aims to make it more similar to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger "That's not the same with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or any of the other applications.SMS is simply ubiquitous," he says."SMS is also very powerful - people read text messages.95% of text messages are read within five seconds, so you know your message will get there quickly and cheaply."And with SMS we know that the text message has been delivered to the person's phone."Image caption Geoff Love says firms use SMS because it is on every mobile phone in the world Majority-owned by a private equity firm, Esendex is continuing to quickly expand overseas through a determined acquisitions policy.Given that the global marketplace is a crowded one, with a large number of firms touting to help businesses send out text messages to their customers, mobile phone industry expert Ben Wood, says Esendex is right to have wanted to grow quickly."It is a cutthroat business, down to fractions of a penny in terms of margins," says Mr Wood, who works for research group CCS Insight."So scale is all important, companies need to be growing in the space in order to make sure that they're able to buy messages at scale, and therefore compete when they're tendering for business."Image caption Esendex's head office is in Nottingham With its main overseas offices in Barcelona, Spain, and Melbourne, Australia, plus others in France and Italy, Mr Love says an attempt to break into the US market failed."Melbourne and Barcelona grew quickly, [but] things were tougher in America, and we ended up closing down our American operation."Not all of the [US] mobile telephone networks could communicate with each other, so you'd be in a situation where you might send a message and it wasn't received because the two networks didn't have any kind of agreement between them to receive messages, which was crazy."This is the second story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.The first feature in the series, looked at a Canadian winemaker who has to battle winter temperatures of less than -25C."In Europe, whilst it appears to be more complicated because people speak different languages, in reality they are far more similar," says Mr Love.Yet there are some differences in Europe, he adds, with companies in Germany demanding far more stringent tests on the software and technology.Image caption The global mobile phone market is taking over the world Entering the Australian market also brought an unforeseen issue - due to the time difference it can't shut down its UK head office computer systems overnight for maintenance, because it is daytime in Australia."It forced us to become a 24/7 business," says Mr Love."That was quite hard to begin with because it meant changing the way we operated... but in the end it turned into quite an advantage because the companies we are working with are using us for mission-critical stuff 24/7 anyway."Our customers are in every single industry you can think of, it could be a very small business or a massive enterprise.But typically it's organisations who really need to communicate with a large number of people very quickly."
Could this 10-year-old fix Pakistan's waste problem?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zymal Umer has discovered there is money to be made in recycling "If people just thought for a moment before dumping their rubbish then maybe they wouldn't do it as it harms our environment."Zymal Umer, 10, sighs as she takes in the view of a makeshift rubbish dump on the outskirts of her hometown Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan.But could the girl dubbed the country's "youngest social entrepreneur" by many have a solution?For now, there are colourful piles of plastic bags, metal and general waste as far as the eye can see.Wafts of smoke fill the air with a putrid and toxic stench as much of the refuse is set on fire.What's in front of Zymal is just the tip of the iceberg that is Pakistan's problem with waste.According to the country's environment protection department, 20m tonnes of solid waste is generated a year and the figure is growing by 2.4% annually.Landfill issues "This is a situation you can find across all of Pakistan - these bags are not biodegradable and people carelessly discard them.They don't really think about recycling," Zymal says.Image caption Zymal turns old newspapers into gift bags Proper solid waste management has never been practiced in the country; only half of the rubbish generated is collected by the government and there is a severe lack of adequate landfill sites.Dumping and burning remain the most common methods of disposal and much of the uncollected waste poses serious risks to public health.Beautiful bags Zeebags is Zymal's bid to try to reduce pollution and increase awareness about the environment.The schoolgirl turns old newspapers into bright and beautifully decorated gift bags which are then sold to family and friends and most of the profits distributed to various local charities.In the space of just three years she has gone from selling a few bags to selling hundreds - worth $4-5,000.Image caption Pakistan has a real problem with waste "I learnt to make the bags by watching YouTube."It is hard to balance my schoolwork with running Zeebags, so I make them at the weekend or during the holidays with my cousins."My father and grandfather pay for my raw materials and if they didn't help me, it would be very hard to keep my project going," she says.One charity Zymal's money goes to is called SOS Children's Villages, which helps orphaned and destitute children across Pakistan.Image caption Zymal has used the money she has raised to help other children "Through my income I've been able to pay for water coolers, washing machines, batteries and the type of things they need for daily life," Zymal explains."To see the happiness on their faces gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to carry on."Her innovative and charitable enterprise has attracted a fair bit of attention with TV and newspaper coverage labelling Zymal as "Pakistan's youngest social entrepreneur".Award winner Zeebags has also won a number of awards in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA."I was very excited to get some international recognition for my work and proud to get some positive exposure for my country and parents."Image caption Zymal believes her business has the potential to grow much larger Selling online has opened up her business to a new world of possibilities."In Pakistan it's thought girls cannot work independently but I haven't faced any difficulties and my aim is to continue my work."I want to become a businesswoman in the future and expand Zeebags through my website and showcase other people's products, too."The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."My biggest ambition is to grow my project not just in Pakistan but also globally," she says.Kalsoom Lakhani is founder of Invest2Innovate, an organisation that helps start-up companies in Pakistan grow and attract funding.She says the country needs to think about the future for entrepreneurs."While we have this enormous potential we need to be always thinking, how we enable that potential and how we continue to not only allow young people to start a business but allow them to grow businesses."Pakistan has already begun to tackle its environmental problems through legislation, establishing government agencies and accepting technical help from international donors.But the response is still fragmented and not a particularly high priority in a country racked with more pressing security and political issues.Image caption Zymal has to balance her social enterprise with her schoolwork This gives Zymal's work even more urgency.She hopes her success will start to change people's minds about the seriousness of taking care of their environment."It is important so future generations can live in a clean and safe world," she says."I want to be able to say I've played my part but it's up to others to do something themselves, too."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music:::::Image caption Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth.She's promoting her new children's album "I Believe in You" and is in top, self-deprecating form, talking to the BBC."It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear.If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone," she tells me.Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them.She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills.At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: "Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business.Image caption Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m "He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.'So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same."As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.It claims Dolly earned $37m (28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.Image copyright Jason Davis Image caption Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (379m) but says this is conservative."We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset."On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."Mr Warner says "I will always love you", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total.He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, "as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%".Image copyright Wes Ramey for Dollywood Image caption The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of "I Will Always Love You" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982.Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard.It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US.The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The proceeds from Dolly's latest album won't be adding to her fortune, though; instead they'll be going to the Imagination Library.Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.Image copyright Keystone Image caption Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general."Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money.She has "always realised the value of a dollar", too."Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item.I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience.So what's the secret of her longevity?"I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family.I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin.I've been around so long I'm part of their family."Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire.The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is "doing well" and she is thinking of franchising it.She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes."I've still got a lot to do...I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!"Dolly Parton is a force of nature and a tremendously successful one at that; it's hard to imagine her ever stopping.
Is this the most influential work in the history of capitalism?:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Renaissance mathematician Luca Pacioli is seen as the father of double-entry bookkeeping In 1495 or thereabouts, Leonardo da Vinci himself, the genius's genius, noted down a list of things to do in one of his famous notebooks.These to-do lists, written in mirror-writing and interspersed with sketches, are magnificent."Find a master of hydraulics and get him to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner.""Draw Milan.""Learn multiplication from the root from Maestro Luca."Leonardo was a big fan of Maestro Luca, better known today as Luca Pacioli.Pacioli was, appropriately enough, a Renaissance Man: - educated for a life in commerce, but also a conjuror, a chess master, a lover of puzzles, a Franciscan Friar, and a professor of mathematics.Today he is celebrated as the most famous accountant who ever lived.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Pacioli is often called the father of double-entry bookkeeping, but he didn't invent it.The double-entry system - known in its day as "bookkeeping alla Veneziana," or "in the Venetian style" - was being used two centuries earlier, around 1300.The Venetians had abandoned as impractical the Roman system of writing numbers, and were instead embracing Arabic numerals.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venice in the 1300s - when Marco Polo set off on his famous travels to the Far East - was already a sophisticated crossroads of trade and ideas They may have also taken the idea of double-entry book keeping from the Islamic world, or even from India, where there are tantalising hints that double-entry bookkeeping techniques date back thousands of years.Or it may have been a local Venetian invention, repurposing the new Arabic mathematics for commercial ends.Intricate transactions Before the Venetian style caught on, accounts were rather basic.Early medieval merchants were little more than travelling salesmen.They had no need to keep accounts - they could simply check whether their purse was full or empty.But as the commercial enterprises of the Italian city states grew larger, and became more dependent on financial instruments such as loans and currency trades, the need for a more careful reckoning became painfully clear.We have a remarkable record of the business affairs of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato, near Florence, who kept accounts for nearly half a century, from 1366 to 1410.They begin as little more than a financial diary, but as his business grew more complex, he needed something more sophisticated.Image copyright Alamy Image caption We can see how Datini tracked his increasingly intricate financial transactions Late in 1394, Datini orders wool from Mallorca.Six months later the sheep are shorn.Several months after that, 29 sacks of wool arrive in Pisa, via Barcelona.The wool is coiled into 39 bales.Of these, 21 go to a customer in Florence and 18 go to Datini's warehouse, arriving in 1396, over a year after the initial order.They are then processed by more than 100 separate subcontractors.Eventually, six long cloths go back to Mallorca via Venice, but don't sell, so are hawked in Valencia and North Africa instead.The last cloth is sold in 1398, nearly four years after Datini's original order.Fortunately, he had been using bookkeeping alla Veneziana for more than a decade, so was able to keep track of this extraordinarily intricate web of transactions.Enormous influence So what, a century later, did the much lauded Luca Pacioli add to the discipline of bookkeeping?Quite simply, in 1494, he wrote the book."Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" was an enormous survey of everything that was known about mathematics - 615 large and densely typeset pages.Image copyright Stockholm University Library Amidst this colossal textbook, Pacioli included 27 pages that are regarded by many as the most influential work in the history of capitalism.It was the first description of double-entry bookkeeping to be set out clearly, in detail and with plenty of examples.Pacioli's book was sped on its way by a new technology: half a century after Gutenberg developed the movable type printing press, Venice was a centre of the printing industry.Symmetry and balance His book enjoyed a long print run of 2,000 copies, and was widely translated, copied, and plagiarised across Europe.Double-entry bookkeeping was slow to catch on, perhaps because it was technically demanding and unnecessary for simple businesses.But after Pacioli it was always regarded as the pinnacle of the art.Image copyright Alamy Image caption This 1585 woodcut shows a German merchant's accountant doing double-entry bookkeeping As the industrial revolution unfolded, the ideas that Pacioli had set out came to be seen as fundamental to business life.The system used across the world today is essentially the one that Pacioli described.Pacioli's system has two key elements.First, he describes a method for taking an inventory, and then keeping on top of day-to-day transactions using two books - a rough memorandum and a tidier, more organised journal.Then he uses a third book - the ledger - as the foundation of the system, the double-entries themselves.Every transaction was recorded twice in the ledger.If you sell cloth for a ducat, you must account for both the cloth and the ducat.The double-entry system helps to catch errors, because every entry should be balanced by a counterpart, a divine-like symmetry which appealed to a Renaissance Man.Practical tool It was during the industrial revolution that double-entry bookkeeping became seen not just as an exercise for mathematical perfectionists, but as a tool to guide practical business decisions.One of the first to see this was Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery entrepreneur.At first, Wedgwood, flush with success and fat margins, didn't bother with detailed accounts.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Josiah Wedgwood used the insight gleaned from detailed accounts to weather a severe recession But in 1772, Europe faced a severe recession and demand for Wedgwood's ornate crockery collapsed.His warehouses began to fill with unsold stock and workers stood idle.Wedgwood turned to double-entry bookkeeping to understand where in his business the profits were, and how to expand them.He realised how much each piece of work was costing him - a deceptively simple-sounding question - and calculated that he should actually expand production and cut prices to boost business.Others followed, and the discipline of "management accounting" was born - an ever-growing system of metrics and benchmarks and targets, that has led us inexorably to the modern world.More from Tim Harford: How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform What tally sticks tell us about how money works But in that modern world, accounting does have another role.It's about ensuring that shareholders in a business receive a fair share of corporate profits - when only the accountants can say what those profits really are.Here the track record is not encouraging.Image copyright AFP Image caption Enron's collapse in 2001 was the biggest in US corporate history A string of 21st century scandals - Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, and the financial crisis of 2008 - have shown us that audited accounts do not completely protect investors.A business may, through fraud or mismanagement, be on the verge of collapse.Yet we cannot guarantee that the accounts will warn us of this.Complacency Accounting fraud is not a new game.The first companies to require major capital investment were the British railways of the 1830s and 1840s, which needed vast upfront investment before they could earn anything from customers.Investors poured in, and when railway magnates could not pay the dividends that the investors expected, they simply faked their accounts.The entire railway bubble had collapsed in ignominy by 1850.Perhaps the railway investors should have read up on their Geoffrey Chaucer, writing around the same time as Francesco Datini, the merchant of Prato.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Accountancy did not protect Chaucer's Shipman character from an audacious con In Chaucer's Shipman's Tale, a rich merchant is too tied up with his accounts to notice his wife being wooed by a clergyman.Nor do those accounts rescue him from an audacious con.The clergyman borrows the merchant's money, gives it to the merchant's wife - buying his way into her bed with her own husband's cash - and then tells the merchant he's repaid the debt, and to ask his wife where the money is.Accountancy is a powerful financial technology - but it does not protect us from outright fraud, and it may well lure us into complacency.As the neglected wife tells her rich husband, his nose buried in his accounts: "the devil take all such reckonings!"Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Will Australia's 'miracle economy' keep on winning?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It was the year Australia went to war in the Gulf, when Monica Seles and Boris Becker won tennis grand slams in Melbourne, and The Simpsons was first shown on Aussie television, while a swooning Bryan Adams was a hit with love-struck teenagers ("Look into your heart, baby").It was 1991, and the last time Australia tasted the bitter economic taste of recession, defined in these parts, at least, as two or more back-to-back quarters of negative growth in real gross domestic product, or the value of all services and goods.Since then, Australia has sidestepped the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and its more destructive big brother that hammered global markets a decade or so later.Australia's economy - the "wonder down under" - has somehow dodged the unstoppable forces that sent other wealthy countries tumbling into reverse.For this, a nation of 24 million people must thank not only sound judgement by those in charge but also good fortune, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist at financial services company AMP in Sydney."I certainly don't see Australia as being a miracle," he says."It has had a bit of good luck and good management, but it would be dangerous to assume that it is never going to have a recession again."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coal production helped the Australian economy stay afloat The economy is growing by about 1.9% per year, according to the Reserve Bank.In 2012, that figure was 3.7%.Weaker growth means that pay packets are shrinking for many workers when adjusted for the rising cost of living, and near-record levels of underemployment are stifling wage increases.In August, retail sales posted their biggest retreat in about four-and-a-half years, falling by 0.6%, with cafes and restaurants reporting declining turnovers.Period of transition?Rocks, coal and demand from China insulated this country from the global financial meltdown in 2008, as a red-hot mining industry delivered unprecedented wealth.Surging commodity prices fuelled the bonanza in Western Australia and Queensland, which propped up under-performing states in the south-east, where most Australians live.Shane Oliver says the situation has now "been turned on its head" and Australia is once again in transition.The mining boom has faded, but areas that once struggled have bounced back in part because of record low interest rates that have unleashed a frenzy into the housing market.Image copyright Getty Images Meanwhile, eye-watering wads of public money have poured into infrastructure projects, which are redefining parts of New South Wales, the most populous state.There was another critical factor that helped Australia to largely avoid the ravages of the global financial crisis - unprecedented spending by the Labor government that boosted public expenditure by a whopping 13% in an attempt to stimulate growth.It was a classic Keynesian economic manoeuvre to use billions of dollars to sustain household spending, demand and employment.Australia loves to win.Here international cricket matches are akin to "wars" and Olympic gold medals - or a lack thereof - are greeted with congratulatory back-slapping - or hand-wringing.If there was a podium for economic success, this is a country that would be bending forward to accept the award.More than 25 years of uninterrupted growth is a remarkable achievement, although there is debate about the competition.Some commentators believe the recent economic prosperity enjoyed by the Netherlands lasted for (only) 22 years, putting it firmly into silver medal position behind the Aussies.Right place, right time Tim Harcourt, an economics fellow at the University of New South Wales, believes Australia deserves the plaudits."This time the 'lucky country' made its own luck."The Hawke-Keating [government] reforms of the 1980s and 1990s - the currency float, tariff changes, and embrace of Asia - set up us up for a quarter of a century of growth."Australia found itself in the right place at the right time and embraced the Asia century," he argues.Image copyright Getty Images But as the economy has soared, some Australians have been left behind.At almost 13%, youth unemployment is more than twice the national average.Labouring work had left 21-year-old Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the son of an Iranian refugee, with endless back pain and homelessness soon followed."I was just trying to apply for jobs online, and then people were just putting me down saying 'you are never going to get that job', so I just stopped trying," he says.'Muddling along' Mohammad is now employed by a hire car company in Sydney, and has ambitions to one day be the boss.He works with Shiv Dhingra, an Indian migrant from Punjab.They are proof that much of Australia's economic might is down to immigration."I am the only one working in my family," Shiv explained."I am the main financial support they have.I am working seven days a week for the last year.I've got plans for my own business."Image copyright Charity Bounce Image caption Charity Bounce runs sessions in partnership with professional athletes Both young men were helped by Charity Bounce, a Sydney-based non-profit organisation that uses basketball to reach out to the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, who, according to chief executive, Ian Heininger, also deserve a slice of Australia's prosperity."We find a lot of the young people are desperate to find work," he says, "desperate to find an opportunity that is going to get them into a place where they are contributing back to the world."But will they be part of an ever-expanding economy?Mr Oliver thinks Australia's luck will eventually run out, but not for a while."The Aussie economy is probably going to continue muddling along, not fantastically strong as housing slows and consumer spending remains a bit weak," he predicts."We are probably going to go for at least another few years before we have that recession some people say is inevitable."
How can you help your local online business go global?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward."One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains."In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges."Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says."Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees."Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time."Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using."You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
Milwaukee Bucks aim to bounce back on and off NBA court:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is an emerging star in the NBA What has historically made Milwaukee famous has been its beer and its motorcycles, but now NBA basketball side, the Bucks, is also hoping to fly the flag for the US city.Although the team situated on the western shore of Lake Michigan has picked up just one NBA national title, in 1971, in its 50th season it is now hoping to transform its fortunes.The club has wealthy owners in the shape of New York hedge fund billionaires, and has one of the top young players in Giannis Antetokounmpo.It has also signed a groundbreaking shirt sponsorship deal with Harley-Davidson, and as the current regular season gets under way it is moving into a new stadium.As well as being specifically designed for basketball and offering a better fan experience, the Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium will also host music and entertainment events.And the playing season has got off to a bright start, with victory in the opening game over Boston Celtics.Championship dream "Our aims are sporting and financial," Bucks president Peter Feigin, who has previously worked in the theme park and executive jet industries, tells me.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption The Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium is due to open in August 2018 "Our owners are very motivated about the team winning on the court, and also about growing the business to be one of the best in US sport."At present the club is closer to breaking-even financially rather than making a profit, but it is hoped playing success can bring wider brand exposure and enhanced commercial revenues.Meanwhile, the new venue where the club will be the main leaseholder will also bring in increased match day income through executive boxes and improved catering.The team has high hopes for the season ahead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks (green) won their opening match against the Boston Celtics 108-100 "There are four rounds of play-offs, we got to the first round last year and the expectation is to go at least one round better this time," says Mr Feigin, a former head of marketing for the New York Knicks NBA team."It is achievable - we are in the Eastern Division, which is not as strong as the Western Division, and if we are healthy for the season and have no injuries we will do great."He adds: "We are in these games to win a championship; it is all directed towards ultimately winning a championship."'International appeal' Central to any playing success is up-and-coming star Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 22-year-old born in Athens to Nigerian immigrant parents."We have the most-emerging star in the NBA, he is already in the top seven of uniform sales, and had tens of millions of video views," says Mr Feigin."He has gone from 'recognised' to superstar in less than 12 months.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Giannis Antetokounmpo sports a shirt with the fans' chant: Fear the deer "We have been able to grow our European appeal and our Asian appeal via Giannis."And the potentially exciting nature of the team has seen the Bucks double the number of live TV games they will be involved in this season, from nine to 18."That will be big for us not only on viewing impressions, but big for the brand too," adds Mr Feigin, who prior to joining the Bucks three years ago worked for Six Flags Theme Parks in the US.He was also previously president and chief operating officer of Marquis Jet, where he was the driving force behind Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's NetJets acquisition of Marquis in 2010.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption NBA rules allow teams to sign shirt sponsors for three years Mr Feigin says Milwaukee as at a city is at an "inflection point" between its industrial heritage past and a newly-modernised future, something which also applies to its shirt sponsors for the next three years - local motorbike brand Harley-Davidson."Harley are trying to reposition themselves for the next generations, and the NBA can help them do that," he says."They want to reach a young, diverse, more international market."Public funding Mr Feigin has been in London this month meeting to publicise the new stadium, pitching it as "a must-play for sports and entertainment" which will host 200 major events a year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Post-industrial Milwaukee is in the midst of regeneration The $524m (395m) arena is a public-private partnership, with just over half the cash coming from hedge-fund club owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, as well as $250m in public funding."It was very challenging to get this approved; especially at at time when there have been questions about the economy, and debates around healthcare and education," admits Mr Feigin."But a professional sports team can bring in much more than the stadium outlay, through income tax and sales tax."Image copyright Alamy Image caption Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led Milwaukee to their only title success in 1971 He says in return for that $250m outlay, the venue will help bring in more than $1bn over 15 years for the state."The stadium will also create a ripple effect in increasing nearby commercial and residential values," he adds.Bucks season-ticket holders and members will be offered deals on entertainment tickets.Conversely, it's hoped music fans will enjoy the stadium experience enough to come back for a Bucks game.Naming rights Building work began on the new stadium last June, with the club due to move into its new home on Labor Day weekend next year - the first weekend of September."The current venue was not built around basketball as the lead sport, but for ice hockey," says Raj Saha, the arena's general manager, and formerly on the management team of the O2 in London.Image caption Mr Feigin and Mr Saha have been in London to get support for the new stadium "The viewing sight lines where we currently play are not ideal for basketball," says Mr Saha, with only one third of the seats close to the action.The club is looking for six to eight long-term founding commercial partners for the new stadium, paying around $2m a year.Those who have signed up include multi-industrial firm Johnson Controls and bank BMO Harris.The search is on for a stadium naming rights partner, which would pay about $7m a year for 20 years."We are still looking for a naming rights partner.We would have loved to have finalised it by now but are in negotiations with a number of potential partners," says Mr Saha.Image copyright Populous Image caption The new stadium will host a variety of non-basketball entertainment As well as music acts, the arena will also host attractions such as UFC martial arts, boxing, Disney on Ice, and other events."We have an idea of how the first four weeks will look," says Mr Saha."Opening night is important and we'll go big for that, but the first 100 days will also be very important, too, to creating a success story."
The Chinese blockage in the global waste disposal system:::::Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day Imagine the world as a global waste disposal system.Now imagine it with a blockage.And what if that waste is backing up around the world, reappearing in places where you really don't want it to be.That blockage is about to happen in China and the flood is going to start seeping out into waste disposal operations around the world.Three months ago, China decided to ban 24 different grades of rubbish as part of its "National Sword" campaign against foreign garbage.Until now China has been importing millions of tonnes of the world's waste every year to feed its recycling industry.The Bureau of International Recycling China estimates that China last year imported 7.3 million tonnes of plastic scrap from Europe, Japan and USA, and 27 million tonnes of waste paper.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's action in halting various categories of waste imports will hit recycling around the world Robin Wiener, president of the US-based Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said: "More than 155,000 direct jobs are supported by the US industry's export activities, earning an average wage of almost $76,000 and contributing more than $3bn to federal, state, and local taxes."A ban on imports of scrap commodities into China would be catastrophic to the recycling industry."The new restrictions have yet to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and China could still change its mind, but the waste is already starting to back up.In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day.Easy option For China the problem is simply one of pollution.Its submission to the WTO reads: "We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials.This polluted China's environment seriously."Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Mike Baxter says sending waste overseas was the easy option Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry.In theory the rubbish from your recycling rubbish bin is meant to be treated or sorted before it goes in the container overseas, but the rules have too often been ignored and rarely enforced.Mike Baxter, external affairs director at the recycler RPC Group, says: "The easiest option for years has been put it into a container and send it overseas where the labour is cheaper and it can be sorted by hand."But with the ban expected to come into full effect by the new year, if not before, the UK industry has written urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help with the expected overflow.Even so, Robin Latchem, editor of the recycling industry magazine MRW believes the recyclers are not spelling out the problems loudly enough, and says: "Why no mention of growing domestic stockpiles of waste and the danger of more fires or incidents of waste crime?"I don't think it is scare-mongering to set out such fears, along with concern that public perception of the recycling industry in its widest sense will be heavily scarred by greater fly-tipping, larger-scale dumping and more plumes of heavy black smoke crossing housing estates."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry No minister from Defra was available for comment, but a spokesman told the BBC: "We are aware of this situation and are looking into the potential implications."Opportunities But there is flip side to the problem - an opportunity for the recycling industry.In the UK for example, a lot of the waste is high quality, such as off-cuts from plastic manufacturing and plastic bottles that have failed quality tests but can be reprocessed.That presents "a great opportunity", says David Wilson commercial manager of Vanden Recycling, a Hong Kong-based company with a new plastics recycling operation in Peterborough, in the UK."China has voluntarily given up a six million tonne a year industry.We'll be selective about it and we'll go for materials we understand and markets we understand, but some of that lost capacity will be rebuilt here," he says.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Vanden Recycling's David Wilson says the China ban creates new opportunities Low quality waste is a different matter, however, and it requires some drastic rethinking of the whole supply chain.As waste begins to back up through the system, like any commodity in oversupply, it loses value.In the UK, for example, local authorities have been able to generate useful income from selling that waste on to the recyclers.That income is going to fall sharply.Andrew Bird, chairman of the UK's Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee (LARAC) says as demand from China disappears, other markets are emerging, especially in India and wider Asia.Nevertheless, "there is going to be a little bit of pinch point, to say the least, and that will have an effect on price - that's the biggest risk for local authorities".New technologies One answer to tackling the global oversupply of low quality waste is the development of new technologies.Recycling Technologies has developed a method of recycling the most unappetising mix of dirty plastic into something it calls Plaxx, a fuel oil which can be used for myriad applications, including as a source for new recycled plastic.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Adopting new technologies is one long-term solution, says Adrian Griffiths Adrian Griffiths, the company's chief executive, admits there's no shortage of "feedstock" - the term for all the raw material that feeds the process."We chemically recycle plastic.We take it back to the original material so it can become more plastic again: plastic, back to oil, and back to plastic again.Anything that goes to landfill currently is feedstock for us, and since the recycling figures are so low the vast majority of the plastic we want is not in recycling use anyway."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But tackling the global back-up of waste after China's changes will require investment.Surprisingly, it is waste paper recycling that can cost the most.A plastics recycling plant could require a 5m ($6.5m) investment to get it up and running, says Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association.But a paper mill could cost up to 500m.However, RCP's Mr Baxter says investors are not going to step in unless there is a market for recycled goods, and he believes governments have a role to play."It's not just a case of recycling the material.It's having markets for the recyclates that are produced, and this is where government could come in."In the UK, he would like to see the government push local authorities and all government institutions to purchase recycled products.For Mr Bird, from LARAC, responsibility for tackling the long term problems of waste must lie throughout the global product supply chain, but especially with manufacturers.And he says one particular change could have a dramatic effect - the widespread adoption of Extended Producers' Responsibility."It means producers having to pay to ensure the products they are manufacturing can be dealt with in an effective, and environmentally cost-effective way."Meanwhile, the waste is piling up and the clock is ticking.Listen to Jamie Robertson's report on China's ban on waste imports here on BBC World Service's World Business Report programme.
The winemaker who battles temperatures as low as -25C:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the wines of Canadian winemaker Norman Hardie are winning fans around the world.With winter temperatures regularly dipping below -25C at his vineyard, winemaker Norman Hardie definitely didn't choose an easy place to grow his grapes."Minus 25 is the absolute death knell for vitis vinifera [the common grape vine], we actually have to bury our vines in the winter [to protect them].It's a huge job," says the 51-year-old."And then we can get snap spring frosts that can quickly ruin a crop.We lost more than 80% in 2015."While most of us associate winemaking with warm countries, Mr Hardie has since 2004 been making wine in Canada.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie Winery is currently continuing with its 2017 harvest Based in picturesque Prince Edward County, Ontario, a two-hour drive east of Toronto alongside Lake Ontario, the summers are more often glorious.The winters, on the other hand, are harsh, which means that the team at Norman Hardie Winery face a race against the cold weather every November."I have 80,000 plants today, so that is almost a quarter of a million canes [the vine's branches] that we have to tie down by hand, and then cover with a mound of earth," says Norman."Before we then carefully open up and untie in the spring."If that wasn't labour intensive enough, come April and May Norman and his team have to light fires and position wind turbines to try to drive away late frosts.But sometimes, such as in 2015, they just aren't that successful.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie says that Canada's cool weather helps him to make excellent wine Up against such challenges, you might question why Norman ever chose to plant vineyards and build a winery in Ontario.He says that despite the challenges, the combination of cool weather and the clay and limestone soil of Prince Edward County allow him to make world class wines."The great wines are always made on the edge, and we're certainly on the edge," says South African-born Norman, who prior to going into winemaking had been a sommelier (wine waiter) in Toronto."I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world because the flavours we get out of these soils are unique."Image copyright Norman Hardie Winery Image caption While many wine regions around the world have cold winters, they aren't as cold as Canada's Primarily making white wines from chardonnay and red wines from pinot noir, Norman Hardie's wines now have a cult following in Canada, and are even said to be the favourite tipples of Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau.But from day one, Norman - who studied winemaking in Burgundy, Oregon, California, South Africa, and New Zealand prior to establishing his own winery - wanted his wines to be sold internationally.This brought his next big challenge - how to persuade a sceptical world to take Canadian wine seriously, when even Norman admits that 30 years ago the country made "terrible wine".Image caption Canadian wine production remains a drop in the global ocean Norman's solution was to turn himself into a travelling salesman, and build up his wine's global reputation "one top sommelier one top buyer, and one top wine journalist, at a time flying around the world, pounding the pavement, speaking to people, changing people's ideas about Canada".So attending wine fairs, visiting wine importers, and knocking on the doors of Michelin-star restaurants, he started to slowly build up export orders.This is the first feature of a new 20-week series called Connected Commerce, which highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Focusing particularly on the UK and New York, Norman says his personal, face-to-face approach enabled him to let some of the most influential people in the global wine world "understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we are doing it".He adds: "You can only do that with face time, and once you have them they are your evangelists."From selling 6,000 bottles in 2004, Norman Hardy Winery produced 240,000 in 2016.From that 6,804 bottles were exported across eight countries - China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.And he still is regularly overseas promoting his wines, including spending five to six days every year in the UK.Back at the winery, there are now six year-round employees, rising to 50 in the busy summer months and at harvest time in late September and October.The business now has annual revenues of 4.1m Canadian dollars ($3.3m; 2.5m).John Downes, a London-based wine expert, who has the top master of wine qualification, says that Norman was right to recognise the fact that as Canada is such a little known wine region he had to do a lot of marketing work to "stand out" on the global stage.Image caption Prince Edward County is now home to 40 wineries Mr Downes adds: "A lot of people in wine don't tell stories, they say 'here's my wine what do you think about it?'."But they don't tell the story behind the wine, and that gives the picture of the wine to the consumer.Norman does that very well."While exporting wine is not without its challenges, such as the need to produce different labels for each country, Norman says that building up a vibrant export business has also boosted his sales in Canada.Now preparing to bury the vines for another winter, Norman says: "That credibility, that international credibility, says you're doing something right."
The human cost of China's economic reforms:::::Image copyright AFP Luo Yanli is worried about the bad smell from the electric car factory over the road and what the fumes might be doing to her baby and toddler.Mr Yu is worried that millions of workers the Chinese government plans to lay off from failing state owned companies will be "abandoned" like he says he was 15 years ago.Mark Weinberger is worried about China's mountain of national debt, the possibility of bankruptcies and - ultimately - what it might mean for the thousands his multinational firm employs in China.All three tell me they support reforms to overhaul China's mammoth economy; but their stories, from three very different parts of China, reveal the consequences and anxieties associated with the changes.Health fears Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What has China's president achieved so far?The early autumn nights are still warm and humid in Shenzhen where Yanli lives in the south of China.But she doesn't open the windows in her apartment because of the strong smell from the sprawling BYD electric car factory."Before we bought the apartment the developer told us the plant would move elsewhere" she says."After we moved here little seems to have changed."The factory was inspected last year after protests.Airtight seals were installed to contain the fumes.When we visited locals told us some production had been moved to another site.With her baby boy on her lap and her daughter playing with a plastic fork beside her, Yanli says: "The smell is very strong and it has severely affected out lives".They don't know if it's dangerous but, like most of their neighbours, they have plants in their apartment in the hope they'll absorb the smell seeping in.Image caption Luo Yanli has concerns about fumes from a local factory The complex is home to the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars.BYD is a global leader in a technology that China hopes it can dominate; electric vehicles, and specifically the batteries that power them.The big push towards electric isn't just about industrial strategy, it's about trying to tackle China's immense pollution problems - the most obvious of which is dirty air.With incentives for infrastructure and aggressive quota demands for, mostly foreign, manufacturers, this is part and parcel of Beijing's effort to make China's economy less focused on government investment and cheap exports - and instead to one that is technologically advanced, with a sustainable base and driven by consumer spending.So is a bad smell and worries about fumes a price worth paying for this progress, I ask Yanli?Yes it is, she intimates.The windows are firmly shut, though.Survival of the fittest Almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) away in Shenyang, taxi driver Mr Yu points to where the lead smelting plant used to stand, where he worked.It's long gone, replaced by car dealerships and apartment blocks.You can buy a Cadillac where he used to walk through the now demolished main gate.It's 15 years since he was laid off in the wave of liberalising economic reforms with compensation of just over a year's salary - about $5,000 (3,700).Despite the years he gets visibly emotional when I ask if there's any part of the city that's still recognisable from his time as a steel worker.He says he was "abandoned" by the government.There was no training for a new job, no support aside from the pay-off.But two children and a taxi licence later he's a believer in reforms that bring competition to the market place.Image caption Mr Yu was laid off from his job as a worker and now drives a taxi "I think the rule 'survival of the fittest' should apply", he says as we drive around, "baggage should be cast aside" he adds.But there is also this, "isn't it true that the people should be properly settled?"They know a lot about "settling" workers in Shenyang.It's the capital city in China's weakest performing province.Liaoning was once the manufacturing heartland.Now it's trying to rescue the towns and cities around the coal mines and steel plants that help make up this country's "rust belt" and is about to get its first privately owned bank, called the "revitalisation" bank.Away from car dealerships and the mega malls we go to Linsheng on Shenyang's outskirts.Food and rubbish is dumped in piles on its main street.One ground floor apartment in a housing estate has a home-made pigeon coop in a bay window.Parts of the building are decaying.It's home for the workers at the nearby coal mine.As China tries to tackle chronic over-capacity in its traditional industries it's also moving away from dirty coal to heat homes and power its economy.Many mines are being mothballed.A bus driver outside Linsheng's pink-painted community hospital tells me he used to do 17 trips to the mine every day, now it's just seven."A lot of people have retired but the company is not able to hire new employees - nobody wants to come because the salary is low."Image copyright AFP Image caption A construction site in Shenyang, the capital of China's weakest performing economic province As the sun goes down a woman who runs a fruit stall says her business had taken a 30% hit in the last two years, which she puts down to workers' salaries falling.The market boss claims people are buying pork and making it last for two or three days instead of buying daily.A retired miner, who like most of the people we talk to in Linsheng doesn't want to go in front of a microphone, says income for some is down 50%.Still growing So what of taxi driver Mr Yu's call for "survival of the fittest"?President Xi Jinping shows little sign of going that far.It looks like his government's early pledge to enhance market forces - giving them a "decisive role" has remained just that, a pledge.Thousands of factories have been closed but that's as much about their polluting effect than their productive inefficiency.There have been consolidations in various sectors of the myriad state-owned enterprises.The (almost all state-owned) banks have come in with debt for equity deals - something close to a bail out - for the most troubled companies.But there hasn't been a wave of bankruptcies.Preserving social stability is likely to be the main reason for this.A wave of concentrated unemployment could see protests that could threaten order.Indeed 2016 actually saw increased cheap credit and a boost in government spending.Rather than an assault on inefficient state-owned entities, many going, only with increased - and cheaper - debt.Still, the world's second largest economy continues to grow, at rates many in the developed world would envy; 6.7% last year, but the rate of growth is slowing, a plateau is approaching.Debt bubble?Debt and risk are the two things that some think will combine to produce an economic catastrophe in China - but not Mark Weinberger, the CEO of EY, one of the big four accountancy firms."I don't see an impending catastrophe," he says, when we met in Shanghai: "The growth is still there to be able to pay off debt".Such optimism is perhaps not surprising from a man who advises the mayor of China's second city.But Mr Weinberger warns nobody should be complacent: "When the debt gets so large it crowds out growth because of the cost of that debt - that becomes a problem".And China's debt is huge; it is currently about 260% of annual economic output and is predicted to rise.What makes it particularly worrisome is that the bulk of this is held by state-owned corporate entities.Risky practice has been growing too, particularly around the so called "shadow banking" sector.So much so that Beijing cracked down on the insurance market in particular, and went after some of China's best known private firms who were deemed too risky in the way they raised money.Image caption EY chief executive Mark Weinberger says he doesn't see "an impending catastrophe" Firms who owned or had stakes in New York's Waldorf Astoria, Deutsche Bank, Club Med and Wolves FC were all targeted.It's steadied the boat, but that appears all.Other far more significant reforms have not yet happened; financial market reforms, substantial rural land reform, changes to the internal passport-like hukou welfare system.One thing that is happening though is a deepening of the role of "the party" at the top of China's state firms.There were reports this summer that foreign owned firms or joint ventures have been asked to give the Communist Party equal say over their major corporate decisions.Xi Jinping faces a multitude of challenges in his country's economy as he embarks on his second term at the top.Strengthening the party's hold on the means of production is one of Beijing's responses.
From torture victim to human rights student:::::Image caption Noura Al Jizawi has come to study in Toronto after escaping Syria's civil war Noura Al Jizawi has survived more than a decade of extreme risk.Now she's going back to her interrupted life as a student.Growing up in Homs in Syria, the 29 year old has been a student activist, experienced imprisonment and exile and has been a leader in Syria's opposition.Now eight months pregnant, she has gone back to her studies, beginning a master's degree at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.Noura's first awareness of human rights - and of their absence - came early: "I remember when I was just a kid, I was angry because we couldn't choose our notebooks."We could have only one type of notebook - one with a photo of Assad's father on it."Missing persons She soon learned that other, much worse things were wrong with her country.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "Many of the students, a couple of years older than me, were mentioning their missing fathers.I became aware we had missing persons in Syria."While I was growing up, I remember hearing mothers supporting each other... they were the mothers of missing persons."Those guys were the detainees arrested by Assad's father in the 1980s.Some of them are still until this moment missing there were no bodies, there was nothing, just silence."Activism and arrests Noura came up against the regime as an undergraduate at the University of Homs - and reading books such as George Orwell's Animal Farm chimed deeply with her own experience.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.Noura's increasing activism, her work as a blogger, publishing imaginative allegorical fiction, and her readiness to speak out, led to two early arrests.Nevertheless she continued this dangerous work, accessing forbidden websites to distribute anti-regime articles, disseminating ideas of democracy and non-violent protest."We never believed there would be a real revolution in our lifetimes," she said.And then, in December 2010, the Arab Spring began in Tunisia, and spread rapidly, arriving in Syria with a demonstration in Damascus in March 2011.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A mother in Homs with a locket of her lost son "For me it was like a dream.We have a revolution."Noura was still in Homs, but was in touch with activists around the country, and abroad.She became an organiser of demonstrations and an advocate for the rapidly rising numbers of detainees.Social media In the response that followed, many of her friends were killed, many others imprisoned and tortured."To be honest we were not shocked, we knew too well that this regime would not allow people to demand their rights."They were more shocked, she said, by the lack of any effective response from the international community."We were saying, back in the 70s and 80s, when there were great massacres in Syria, there was no internet, there no media channels."But we thought, now we have the social media channels, hopefully this would protect us.But it did not protect us."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Noura's young life has been against a background of war: A fighter in Homs Noura moved from city to city, organising, motivating, dodging the authorities - until in May 2012, she was ordered off a bus in Damascus by armed men and bundled into a car."It was not an arrest, it was abduction, a kidnapping," she said.Tortured in prison Noura emerged seven months later.During that time she was detained in some of Syria's most notorious prisons, and said she had been tortured with electric shocks and beatings.She plays this down, saying that so many have endured - and are still enduring - far worse.For her the hardest experience to bear was hearing the sounds of her fellow-prisoners being tortured.Her captors realised this psychological torture would be more effective in her case - but still she remained silent.Noura explained how she survived: "I was not afraid for myself, I didn't care about myself...I cared only about the revolution I cared about the people who were still continuing this revolution outside."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "We were still a non-violent movement on the ground... and I kept thinking about them...I wanted to make sure that in the questioning I would not speak about any one of those activists.I would pray to my body not to break down."Noura was released late in 2012, and believes that an international campaign played a part in this: "For sure, all of those activities protected me.That is why we need this advocacy, all the time, for all detainees and for missing persons."For Noura, the torment continued, as her younger sister, Alaa, had also been imprisoned and was suffering even worse: "They tortured her harder than me, many times, because of me."Alaa was released in a terrible physical state; the family decided they had to leave Syria, and fled to Turkey to get urgent medical treatment."She was my only reason to leave Syria," said Noura."Otherwise I would still be there."Image caption Noura became a representative in peace talks in Geneva In four years of exile in Turkey, she joined the coalition of Syrian opposition forces, (SNC) and became its vice-president in 2014, as well as being elected to sit on its negotiation panel in Geneva.She joined because she realised this much-criticised group of mainly male, middle-aged "hotel revolutionaries" needed "the blood of youth" and also a strong female voice.Geneva was a real challenge for Noura: "I felt I had to be calm and clever, I had do everything I could do, to interact."She worked hard to get an agreement to break the two-year siege of Homs.Many of its surviving citizens were dying of starvation.'Scholars at risk' Noura resigned from the coalition in 2016, but continued working for an NGO she had created, Start Point, which provides advocacy and psychological support to Syrian women who have suffered torture and sexual violence in detention.She had also met her husband in Turkey, another Syrian activist in exile, who was one of a network of cyber-security experts working for the Munk School's Citizen Lab; hence the Toronto connection.Noura came to Canada as one of 24 international students with scholarships in the university's "scholars at risk" programme.With her daughter due to be born next month, Noura is aware of how this might change her activism.But she's determined not to give up the fight.She sees the master's degree as another step to help her continue her work to bring democracy to Syria."I feel also that being a mother makes me closer to the future... this baby is the future, and maybe will not have to live as our generation live."
From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online:::::Image copyright Geoff Pugh Image caption Lavinia Davolio says selling her luxury sweets on Amazon Marketplace has been good for business What are the best ways to sell online?And how do you make sure you have a website that really works?Part one in our eight-part series exploring all things e-commerce.Lavinia Davolio makes luxury handmade sweets inspired by her Italian heritage.She says her business received a boost when she opened a store on Amazon's Marketplace."It's easy for clients to discover something unique and handmade if it's available through such a trusted online platform," she says."And it means we can offer convenient next day delivery at a competitive price and give our boutique confectionary an incredible reach and visibility."Lavinia is one of thousands of small businesses who've decided to set up shop on an e-commerce marketplace - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba's Taobao, Rakuten to name some of the largest - rather than go through the hassles of setting up their own websites.Amazon charges retailers a 15% commission, but in return even the very smallest entrepreneurs can get a slice of the retail titan's global pulling power just by uploading images and descriptions of their products and then setting their pricing.For an additional fee, Amazon will store and dispatch your goods - the kind of one-stop convenience that is ideal for newbies, suggests Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Despite the convenience of online shopping, people still love the physical store "Something like Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer," he says."Entry costs are very low and straightaway you have a very wide marketplace at your fingertips."When you're starting out with your own website you're having to attract the traffic, which means a lot of search engine optimisation [SEO].This can be complicated and mean extra costs if you need outside help."Some e-tailers want more creative control over their online shops, however - and to keep more of the sales income for themselves.Going it alone is certainly a lot cheaper than it used to be, but according to payment processor WorldPay, the average small business spends 2,500 on setting up an e-commerce platform.At its most basic this will cover product display and listing, navigation structure, a shopping cart facility, search features and secure payment gateways - a checklist that swells with business growth.DIY website providers such as Wix, Weebly and SquareSpace, help the technical novice with design templates and SEO support from as little as $4.50 (3.40) a month.And these days, off-the-shelf "software-as-a-service" add-ons can give a basic website selling and fulfilment functionality that "means you can be online and trading for as little as 500," says Prof Braithwaite.But "cheap isn't always best," he warns."It's your front window so it can be worth spending a bit extra - around 5,000 on a developer."And Clare Jackson, founder of e-tailer The Wooden Furniture Store, points out that you have to be prepared to improve and adapt your website constantly or risk losing sales.You can't pay your set-up fee then sit back and relax.Image copyright The Wooden Furniture Store Image caption Clare Jackson says she had to adapt her website's content for mobile screens When they discovered that most customers were coming to their website from mobiles, they had to completely rethink the design."With mobile users likely to be on slower connections it's crucial to get more speed into the user experience, so we introduced image optimisation and a content delivery network."This adapts content to the sizes of screen and devices being used, meaning that the images load much quicker."A fast website loading speed is crucial for e-commerce success.Research by application performance company, Apica, finds that 40% of online shoppers refuse to wait more than 10 seconds for a website to respond.The website change cost just $200 but has contributed to a 500% hike in sales from mobile and a 230% upturn in mobile visitors, says Ms Jackson."As a small business, we combine our agility with the kind of technologies which just a few years ago would have been unaffordable for someone our size," she says.Image copyright Iffley Road Image caption Wife-and-husband team Claire Kent and Bill Byrne moved their running wear business to Shopify Claire Kent and Bill Byrne, the husband-and-wife team behind luxury running wear, Iffley Road, found that replacing their bespoke website with the "easy and intuitive" e-commerce platform, Shopify, made a big difference to their online business.They liked the fact that they were no longer reliant on a third party but could make changes to the site themselves in minutes.Ms Kent, a former Morgan Stanley equity analyst who had never used Facebook or Twitter before, and who admits to being "completely untechnical", says she has found analysing customer data surprisingly straightforward using Shopify.A range of tools gives her data on purchase frequency, customer lifetime value, gross margins and net profit - insights she credits with doubling sales."It's like I've suddenly got glasses on whereas before I was blind," she says."I'd say to anyone that you really need to be looking at analytics every day as you learn so much."More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images She advises retailers to accept that a website will need to evolve with customers' changing expectations."Many SMEs prioritise aesthetics over function; you can have a site that looks amazing but if you don't have the right platform then it just isn't going to deliver."Listening to feedback and acting on it is also crucial, argues Prof Braithwaite."Get friends and families to transact on [your website] and listen to feedback, making sure that payment is secure and seamless is an absolute priority; customers won't come back if this isn't right.""Fail fast, fail often" may be the mantra amongst the technology giants in Silicon Valley, but it is also apt for online retail entrepreneurs.You have to make mistakes, learn from them, and adapt quickly to achieve success in this global online marketplace.The next feature will look at the best way to take payments and market your online shop.
Can these beads stop 'history's biggest mass poisoning'?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A handful of these resin beads can save lives The beads of resin may not look like much but they could save hundreds of thousands of at-risk people in Bangladesh and parts of India.Human Rights Watch says up to 20 million people are at risk from arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh.Millions have already suffered from what the World Health Organisation calls "the biggest mass poisoning in human history".Millions of "tube-wells" have been dug across Bangladesh since the 1940s.The simple pumps were rolled out across the country by the government and NGOs from the 1970s onwards as a way of delivering cost-effective bacteria-free water.However during the 1980s cases of arsenic poisoning began to emerge.Arsenic can not be seen or smelt; the first signs of its impact are skin lesions which only emerge once the poisoning has taken place.The poisoning can set off a range of heart diseases and cancer and the external symptoms look a lot like leprosy, which can lead to victims and their families being shunned by the local community.A heavy price Image caption Siaton Nessa says arsenic poisoning has ruined her life and affected her family as well Siaton Nessa Meherpur has lesions on her skin from arsenic poisoning.She's in her mid-50s and she says the disease has blighted her entire family."Because of this well my whole skin is filled with black patches," she says."I am worried about my children because no one is prepared to marry them."While the government has made efforts to replace the wells, in many rural areas they are still the primary source of water especially as many families have dug their own tube wells.Human Rights Watch estimate 43,000 people die each year in Bangladesh from illnesses caused by arsenic poisoning.New solutions Image caption Minhaj Chowdhury's Drinkwell is offering an "entrepreneurial solution" to the water crisis Minhaj Chowdhury, 28, was raised in the United States but visited family in Bangladesh during school holidays."It shocked and deeply saddened me to think how we never had to worry about water being fatal in the US but here in Bangladesh one in every five deaths was associated with unsafe drinking water," Mr Chowdhury says.After his grandfather died due to a disease linked to water he decided to take action.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.In 2013 he founded Drinkwell, in partnership with Dr Arup K SenGupta who invented a particular type of resin technology and had already been active in implementing it in India.The resin removes arsenic and other harmful substances from water and once it has been used Drinkwell filters the water through a series of other tanks to take out other harmful substances.The water is sold locally by "Drinkwell" entrepreneurs and the money raised is used to maintain the system.The pricing is set depending on location but a monthly subscription costs anywhere between $0.05 (4p) and $0.12 for 20 litres (4.4 gallons) a day.Entrepreneurial opportunity According to the United Nations, 30% to 50% of all water projects fail after huge investments because of a failure to maintain the facilities.Image caption Drinkwell entrepreneur Habibur Rehman's plant in Manikganj, Bangladesh sells 150,000 litres a day Dr Khairul Islam, the country director for the charity Water Aid in Bangladesh' believes that social entrepreneurs have a role to play in tackling the arsenic poisoning.Dr Islam told the BBC that the main problem so far has been operation and maintenance.Because Drinkwell includes operational and maintenance costs at the centre of its model he says it is the kind of model "this country needs".The first Drinkwell plant began dispensing water in the Manikganj district in 2015.Today that one plant alone has 750 daily customers and dispenses 150,000 litres a day.The network has grown across the country, often by going into schools to deliver safe drinking water for students' meals, from there the word spreads across communities.There are now 30 Drinkwell filtration plants in India and Bangladesh serving more than 100,000 people.Mr Chowdhury believes this is just the start for Drinkwell.He hopes to eventually reach hundreds of millions of people across Asia.He is already talking to the Bangladesh government about rolling out the technology across the country.By involving the communities in the maintenance through their entrepreneur network Mr Chowdhury believes the system can provide clean water "forever".
The 'working class boy' who built a £1bn business:::::Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's wife recently treated him to a new Harley Davidson Paresh Davdra is thrilled about the brand new Harley Davidson waiting for him in a friend's garage.It's not a sign of a mid-life crisis, he insists, but a wedding present from his wife who he married in August.He just has one more test to pass to get his motorcycle licence, then he can hop on the bike and whizz around London for meetings.The boss and co-founder of money exchange firm Rational FX, which reported revenues of more than 1bn ($1.3bn) last year, has a life that's worlds apart from his parents and grandparents.They were forced to flee Uganda in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin gave the Asian population just 90 days to leave the country."They came to the UK with just 50 between them," says the softly-spoken Mr Davdra."My grandfather had his own tailoring shop, but they had to leave everything behind."His family pulled together and bought a house in Harrow, north London, with his dad securing a job as clerk, and later as a financial controller, at a foreign exchange broker.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Paresh Davdra co-founded RationalFX in 2005 Their fighting spirit rubbed off on the younger Davdra."We were never really given anything - if I wanted something, I had to earn it."From the age of 16, he spent the school holidays holding jobs in a mobile phone shop and in telesales, while out of term at Middlesex University, he worked at his dad's firm, taking up roles from filing to working in compliance.He studied marketing and computer science at university, but tells me that technology does not come naturally to him."If you told my team I had this degree, they wouldn't believe you.I'm always the one calling IT to connect the laptop to the printer," he laughs.As soon as Mr Davdra graduated, in 2003, he joined his dad's company as a foreign exchange dealer, helping clients to buy and sell large quantities of foreign currencies.He was in the role for just over a year, working with Indian-born Rajesh Agrawal, a friend of his father's who had arrived in the UK in 2001.But two factors would spur him to quit."I'd tried to buy a property with my dad but the bank rejected the mortgage application," Mr Davdra says."It deflated me."Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX is based in Canary Wharf, London At the same time, Mr Agrawal resigned from his IT manager role."When he decided to quit, I badgered him.I asked him to tell me what he was doing," Mr Davdra says.The two met for coffee and quickly agreed they wanted to set up a company together.The idea was to support customers buying property abroad with their currency needs."Everything we were doing at the old firm was manual, but we thought we could offer the same service online," Mr Davdra says.However, the duo faced a serious challenge: money.Mr Davdra was only a year out of university and had already taken out a personal loan to buy a BMW.When Mr Agrawal took their business plan to the bank and asked to borrow 10,000, he was swiftly rejected.But he returned a few days later and asked for 20,000 to buy a car.The bank said yes."I then sold my BMW and we were set," says 37-year-old Mr Davdra, who also moved into Mr Agrawal's home to save on rent.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's grandfather had to flee Uganda in 1972 With just 32,000 between them, the pair launched their foreign exchange brokerage, RationalFX, in 2005.Like many start-ups, the next difficult task was signing up customers."We got on the phones and started pitching to estate agents and attended every property industry event there was," recalls Mr Davdra."We'd be in the office all day from 8am, then we'd just be at it in the evenings."Their big breakthrough came when they signed a number of estate agents who were selling properties in Dubai.However, just two years after launching, the financial crisis hit.Mr Davdra reflects candidly on how it changed his young mindset.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: "I was 27 at the time and the business was doing great guns, and I was well on my way to being rich.That's all I thought about it."It wasn't really about building a business - that comes with time and maturity.But the crash brought that along.It was a good learning curve."Rational FX also felt the fall-out from the crash, with its growth slowing.But it weathered the storm and went on to diversify.Today, its clients range from high-net worth individuals, either buying property or making investments, to medium-sized businesses, such as firms exporting cars or importing textiles.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX employs 110 people It reported revenues of 1.3bn in 2016, up from 1.1bn the year before, and pre-tax profits of 2.3m - largely because the firm reinvested heavily in its business, Mr Davdra says.After enjoying success with Rational FX, the founders had an idea for an offshoot company - an online money transfer platform aimed at individuals sending lower sums to family overseas."We felt that Rational FX was driving revenues, but Xendpay [the new company] was more of a social initiative, to try and bring the costs of remittance down for people working hard to bring their families out of poverty."Xendpay has a "pay what you want" model, although it does suggest a minimum commission of 0.3-0.4% of the transaction.Mr Davdra says that more than 70% of users pay the suggested fee, 10% hand over more, and the rest pay nothing.The platform isn't profitable yet, although Mr Davdra expects it to break even next year."It was a bit of gamble but a risk we were willing to take."'Still growing' Last year Mr Agrawal stepped down from the firm after he was appointed Deputy Mayor of London for Business.He still owns 70% of the business, and is a non-executive director, while Mr Davdra holds the remaining shares.Mr Davdra says he "misses him"."Apart from business, over the last 12 years we have developed a good relationship.He's a very very close friend."For now, there are no plans to sell RationalFX, although private equity firms approach the firm "an average of twice a day"."Our brands are still growing and are quite young.It's all about the right opportunity," Mr Davdra says.Headquartered at Canary Wharf, RationalFX and Xendpay together employ 110 members of staff.Despite his penchant for expensive bikes and cars, Mr Davdra - who still lives in Harrow - has his feet firmly on the ground."I think we're pretty humble.We're working class, and we just do normal stuff.It's the way we've been brought up."
How the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible:::::Image copyright Alamy "Gentility of speech is at an end," thundered an editorial in London's City Press, in 1858."It stinks!"The stink in question was partly metaphorical: politicians were failing to tackle an obvious problem.As its population grew, London's system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate.To relieve pressure on cess pits - which were prone to leaking, overflowing, and belching explosive methane - the authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies.However, this created a different issue: the gullies were originally intended for only rainwater, and emptied directly into the River Thames.That was the literal stink - the Thames became an open sewer.Image copyright Alamy Cholera was rife.One outbreak killed 14,000 Londoners - nearly one in every 100.Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette drew up plans for new, closed sewers to pump the waste far from the city.It was this project that politicians came under pressure to approve.The sweltering-hot summer of 1858 had made London's malodorous river impossible to politely ignore, or to discuss obliquely with "gentility of speech".The heatwave became popularly known as the "Great Stink".Unlikely figure If you live in a city with modern sanitation, it's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with the suffocating stench of human excrement.For that, we have a number of people to thank - but perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure of Alexander Cumming.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.A watchmaker in London a century before the Great Stink, Cumming won renown for his mastery of intricate mechanics.King George III commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure, and he pioneered the microtome, a device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood for microscopic analysis.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Alexander Cumming's S-bend was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet But Cumming's world-changing invention owed nothing to precision engineering.It was a bit of pipe with a curve in it.In 1775, Cumming patented the S-bend.This became the missing ingredient to create the flushing toilet - and, with it, public sanitation as we know it.Simplicity Flushing toilets had previously foundered on the problem of smell: the pipe that connects the toilet to the sewer, allowing urine and faeces to be flushed away, will also also let sewer odours waft back up - unless you can create some kind of airtight seal.Cumming's solution was simplicity itself: bend the pipe.Water settles in the dip, stopping smells coming up; flushing the toilet replenishes the water.While we've moved on alphabetically from the S-bend to the U-bend, flushing toilets still deploy the same insight.Image copyright Alamy Rollout, however, came slowly: by 1851, flushing toilets remained novel enough in London to cause mass excitement when introduced at the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace.Use of the facilities cost one penny, giving the English language one of its enduring euphemisms for emptying one's bladder, "to spend a penny".Hundreds of thousands of Londoners queued for the opportunity to relieve themselves while marvelling at the miracles of modern plumbing.If the Great Exhibition gave Londoners a vision of how public sanitation could be - clean, and smell-free - no doubt that added to the weight of popular discontent as politicians dragged their heels over finding the funds for Joseph Bazalgette's planned sewers.More than 170 years later, about two-thirds of the world's people have access to what's called "improved sanitation", according to the World Health Organization, up from about a quarter in 1980.That's a big step forward.Economic cost But that still means two and a half billion people don't have access to it, and "improved sanitation" itself is a relatively low bar.It "hygienically separates human excreta from human contact", but it doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself.Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that.More from Tim Harford: What the dynamo reveals about technological revolution Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How air conditioning changed the world The economic costs of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation are many and varied, from health care for diarrhoeal diseases to foregone revenue from hygiene-conscious tourists.The World Bank's Economics of Sanitation Initiative has tried to tot up the price tag.Across various African countries, for example, it reckons inadequate sanitation lops one or two percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP), in India and Bangladesh over 6%, and in Cambodia 7%.That soon adds up.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Open sewers are a common sight in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya The challenge is that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provides.Toilets cost money, but defecating in the street is free.'Positive externality' If I install a toilet, I bear all the costs, while the benefits of the cleaner street are felt by everyone.In economic parlance, that's a "positive externality" - and goods that have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower pace than society, as a whole, would prefer.The most striking example is the "flying toilet" system of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya.The flying toilet works like this: you defecate into a plastic bag, and then in the middle of the night, whirl the bag around your head and hurl it as far away as possible.Replacing a flying toilet with a flushing toilet provides benefits to the toilet owner - but you can bet that the neighbours would appreciate it, too.Contrast, say, the mobile phone.That also costs money, but its benefits accrue largely to me.That's one reason why, although the S-bend has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone, many more people already own a mobile phone than a flushing toilet.If you want to buy a flushing toilet, it also helps if there's a system of sewers to plumb it into, and creating one is a major undertaking - financially and logistically.Image copyright Otto Herschan Image caption Joseph Bazalgette, standing top right, views the Northern Outfall sewer being built below the Abbey Mills pumping station in 1862 When Joseph Bazalgette finally got the cash to build London's sewers, they took 10 years to complete and necessitated digging up 2.5 million cubic metres (88 million cubic ft) of earth.Because of the externality problem, such a project might not appeal to private investors: it tends to require determined politicians, willing taxpayers and well-functioning municipal governments.And those, it seems, are in short supply.According to a study published in 2011, just 6% of India's towns and cities have succeeded in building even a partial network of sewers.The capacity for delay seems almost unlimited.Geographical quirk London's lawmakers likewise procrastinated- but when they finally acted, they didn't hang about.As Stephen Halliday recounts in his book The Great Stink of London, it took just 18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bazalgette's plans.What explains this sudden, impressive alacrity?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Houses of Parliament, photographed in 1858, the year of the Great Stink A quirk of geography: London's Parliament building is located right next to the River Thames.Officials tried to shield lawmakers from the Great Stink, soaking the curtains in chloride of lime in a bid to mask the stench.But it was no use.Try as they might, the politicians couldn't ignore it.The Times described, with a note of grim satisfaction, how MPs had been seen abandoning the building's library, "each gentleman with a handkerchief to his nose".If only concentrating politicians' minds was always that easy.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
What is happening with Japan Inc?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan's reputation for precision manufacturing is coming under more pressure Japan has long been held up as a shining example of integrity, assured quality and reliable products.But the deepening scandal at Kobe Steel over falsified figures could further tarnish the Made in Japan brand.Kobe's troubles started when it admitted last weekend to faking data about the quality, strength and durability of some of the materials it delivered to more than 200 companies including Boeing, Nissan and Toyota.On Friday it said the number of firms involved had risen to 500.The news has wiped out about $1.8bn (1.3bn) off Kobe Steel's market value this week.But with at least half a dozen major Japanese companies admitting to fraud and misconduct in as many years, questions are being raised over why this keeps happening and if there's a systemic problem in Japan.'Cutting corners' Experts say the long term slowdown in economic growth from the 1990s onwards has been a major contributing factor.It has forced Japanese firms to change their business models, and this appears to have taken its toll."Large corporations used to live in a stable, predictable and growing market, but things have changed and some companies may have resorted to cutting corners," says Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, in Tokyo.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel's Hiroya Kawasaki apologised for the "tremendous trouble" the firm had caused Until two decades ago, Japanese firms were focussed on growth strategies but the realisation that their economy would no longer grow as strongly anymore meant companies had to concentrate on restructuring, cost-cutting and extreme efficiency.Speaking to the BBC, Martin Schulz, senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo says these painful adjustments have seen some companies struggle "to adjust to the new rules of the game".The push to improve efficiencies made management desperate to show positive results, sometimes even testing the limits of quality control, he says.Mr Schulz adds core-employees and managers have been stretched to the limit, which in some cases, resulted in overwork and misconduct.But the need to open up new markets overseas to boost profits has created other problems for Japanese firms, especially at their subsidiaries abroad.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel is Japan's third largest steelmaker Florian Kohlbacher, director of the Economist Corporate Network for North Asia, says some companies tried to grow too quickly by expanding overseas without having enough experienced managers to supervise operations.Detecting fraud The misconduct at Kobe Steel follows scandals at carmakers Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, as well as car airbag-maker Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after a global recall sparked by 16 deaths and many injuries.Just two weeks ago, Nissan Motor recalled 1.2m vehicles that had been certified by unauthorised technicians.And the electronics giant Toshiba Corporation is still reeling from the consequences of an accounting scandal in which its profits were inflated.Despite the prevalence of such high profile cases, experts say quality and compliance remain paramount in Japan.But they still expect more scandals involving fraud and misconduct to be uncovered in future.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers of cars, trains and planes are checking if they used sub-standard Kobe Steel materials Mr Kohlbacher says this is partly because new technology such as the internet of things and sensors have made it easier to detect wrongdoing, errors and fraud, while digitisation has helped to spread information about problems and improve transparency.While it is still unclear how the data tampering at Kobe Steel was uncovered, "in a more transparent corporate environment, companies have to come clean on mistakes and misconduct much earlier," says Mr Schulz.Expect more scandals Furthermore, more fraud and misconduct scandals are also expected to be uncovered as a result of laws to protect whistleblowers that came into effect in 2006.The most explosive case came to light five years later when Michael Woodford, the British president of Olympus, became the most senior corporate figure in history to blow the whistle on his own company.His revelations uncovered a $1.4bn (880m) accounting fraud scandal in which the Japanese medical and equipment firm hid investment losses dating back to the 1990s.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quality control questions at Kobe Steel could further erode trust in Japanese firms Mr Kohlbacher says more people have reported wrongdoings since the laws were enacted but it is difficult to confirm exactly how many people have been able to use the legislation to raise the alarm about wrongdoing in their companies.And debate still rages in Japan on whether whistleblowers are adequately protected because the laws do not provide for penalties against companies that punish staff by dismissing or demoting them.Some argue there are further safeguards from wrongdoing provided by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency, which opened in 2009.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The news has wiped out about $1.8bn off Kobe Steel's market value It was created following several accidents caused by substandard products and a number of food poisoning scandals including a case involving Chinese dumplings."Any manufacturer that had a defective product would once have been dealt with by a government ministry but the Consumer Affairs Agency took over these responsibilities," says Keith Henry from the consultancy firm Asia Strategy.Mr Henry adds that the new reporting system focuses much more on the consumer rather than the manufacturer, with regulatory authorities willing to investigate and prosecute cases of misconduct.Rebuilding the brand Some people believe the unwanted spotlight on Japanese firms could actually have a positive effect."There seems to be wide agreement now that just focusing on costs and increasing profitability won't be sufficient as future strategies," says Mr Schulz.Mr Kohlbacher says he now expects "companies to have a close look at their operations and make sure they amend any problems before they turn into something major".But some warn tougher penalties are needed for companies that fail to meet government standards because self-regulation does not always appear to work.Citing the recent Dentsu case last week in which the Japanese advertising giant was only fined 500,000 yen (US$4,400; 3,321) for breaching labour regulations, Mr Okubo says "I think there's something very wrong here."But rather than highlighting a systemic problem in Japan, Mr Okubo says the prevalence of misconduct cases was evidence that "corporate governance in Japan is working" because firms are reporting internal problems so that they can be dealt with.As for companies that want to distance themselves from the fraud and misconduct, he says: "It is about time that each manufacturer stops branding itself as 'Japanese' and instead starts to build their own brand".
Formula One teams' costs rocket after rules changes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewis Hamilton during the Japan F1 Grand Prix Next weekend Britain's Lewis Hamilton could secure his fourth Formula One title at the United States Grand Prix.His Mercedes team is a staggering 145 points ahead of arch-rivals Ferrari despite the sport introducing rules this year which aimed to put the brakes on the dominance of a single outfit.They came at a hefty cost.The new regulations were designed to make for closer racing by increasing aerodynamic and mechanical grip through the introduction of wider tyres and wings.According to one of the teams it has "rewritten" the rulebook and the impact is just as noticeable off track as on it.But if some had hoped the rules might stop Mercedes from running away with the F1 championship they will have been disappointed.Ironically, they have also forced up its rivals' costs.Only the frontrunners have had the resources to foot the bill from their cashflow whilst one of the outfits lower down the grid even had to get a driver to cover the cost.Research has revealed that new regulations fuelled a 167.6m increase in the F1 teams' costs in 2016.They rose 14.5% to hit a combined 1.3bn - the highest-ever total recorded in the sport.F1 cars are designed the year before they race so the bulk of the investment in them is paid for then, too.It means that the cost of this year's campaign is reflected in the teams' 2016 accounts and the final one of them was filed last week.Eight of F1's ten teams have to file publicly-available accounts - the only exceptions are Ferrari as its outfit is run by the car manufacturer itself, and Swiss-based Sauber where firms don't have to release their finances.The costs of the teams' operating companies came to an average of 165.9m in 2016, topped by Northamptonshire-based Mercedes which spent 274.9m excluding the investment in its engines.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption F1 teams' costs rose 14.5% to hit 1.3bn last year It is the highest ever total recorded on the accounts of a British F1 team and even eclipses the turbocharged spending levels before the 2008 economic crash which drove Toyota and Honda out of the sport.At the other end of the spectrum is last year's new entrant Haas F1 which spent a third as much as the championship leaders.Haas has managed to keep its costs down by taking advantage of a new rule allowing teams to buy in more parts than before.Haas uses a Ferrari engine with a chassis created by Italian manufacturer Dallara which also makes the cars for the F2 junior series.Relying on suppliers reduces research and development expenditure which, along with staffing and engine costs, is one of their biggest costs - it rose across the board in 2016 as teams had to design cars to meet the new regulations.They were introduced by F1's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to address criticism that the outcome of races was clear before they started due to the dominance of Mercedes.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Haas has kept costs down by buying in more parts than before With Hamilton at the wheel it has won both the constructors' and the drivers' championship for the past three years running.This year is set to be no different but there has been a far higher price to pay.Writing in the introduction to its accounts Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff notes that there has been "an increase of 27.9m in operating costs mainly due to the impact of technical regulation changes and movement in foreign exchange rates".The 2016 accounts for Force India, also based in Northamptonshire, give more insight into the effort required to meet the new rules.It says that combined with the change in tyre-sizes "our traditional method of retaining 50% of the previous season's car and updating the remaining 50% is not possible for 2017".Over 90% of Force India's car this year is completely new.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Force India has helped cover its increased costs with cash from driver Nikita Mazepin The team planned to cover its increased costs with income from an unlikely source: a driver contract signed with Russian youngster, Nikita Mazepin, "secured a cash injection ahead of significant regulation changes ahead of the 2017 season", said Force India.Mazepin was just 16 when he signed up last year and he has tested for the team twice since then, most recently in July after the Hungarian Grand Prix.He has ample resources to pay as his father Dmitry became a billionaire through owning the mineral fertiliser producer Uralchem.Despite this, Force India still chalked up a net loss of 11.6m - the largest of any team in 2016.The regulation changes even dented the bottom line of British manufacturing giant McLaren.Its went from a net 3.4m profit in 2015 to an after-tax loss of 3.2m the following year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For F1 teams, victory on the track is more important than making a profit Overall the teams made a combined net loss of 2m last year.Perhaps surprisingly this is nothing new as unlike most businesses, profit is not the barometer of success in F1.Instead teams judge their performance on racing results and tend to spend all of their income on this in a bid for victory.Some even pump in more than they make, with additional funds usually coming from owners' pockets or debt.The theory is that it is better to win and make no profit than make money and finish low in the standings.Victory on track increases a team's ability to bring in more sponsorship,, as brands are prepared to pay more to be associated with a winner.The teams' revenue generally comes from three sources with two providing the lion's share.They are fuelled by F1's huge television audience (390m viewers last year).The first key revenue source is sponsorship which comprises around a third of the teams' revenue, Another third comes from prize money.F1's parent company, which is owned by American investment firm Liberty Media, pays the teams around 66% of its annual profits as prize money and it came to $985.5m (742m) in 2016.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite numerous failed attempts there are new proposals to introduce a budget cap for F1 teams Payments from owners represent around half of the teams' remaining revenue and the marketing benefit from the exposure on TV compensates for this investment.If costs increase these payments often rise to compensate and last year Red Bull poured in four times more money into its flagship team.Its investment into Red Bull Racing hit 40.6m as costs surged 9.2% to 197m.As its owner has deep pockets Red Bull Racing doesn't need to rely on drivers who pay but income from them is the remaining source of revenue for F1 teams.They are a hallmark of teams at the bottom of the grid but their days could be numbered.Despite numerous failed attempts F1 hasn't given up on introducing a budget cap and recent reports suggest that Liberty Media will shortly present plans to the teams for introduction in 2021 when their current race contracts expire.But it will be the sport's governing body, the FIA, that will ultimately decide on any changes A limit of 114m has been suggested and this would level the playing field as the smallest teams are already below this whilst the frontrunners would have to scale back.Although it may seem like a logical direction for the sport to go in it would make the recent boost in spending seem all the more pointless.
Where are all the women in economics?:::::Image caption Clara Starrsjo is a second-year economics student at Cambridge University We hear a lot about the under-representation of women in so-called STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and maths.But the proportion of women in economics is by some measures smaller.In the US, only about 13% of academic economists in permanent posts are women; in the UK the proportion is only slightly better at 15.5%.Only one woman has ever won the Nobel Prize in economics - American Elinor Ostrom in 2009.And there wasn't even a single woman on some of the lists floating about guessing who this year's prize winner would be - it went to the behavioural economist Richard Thaler.Some have argued that these figures aren't necessarily the result of bias.Maybe, they say, women are simply behaving rationally and choosing different disciplines that are perhaps more suited to their temperament and skills, or choosing to work in different but related fields.But Cambridge University economics lecturer Victoria Bateman says that can't really explain all of the gap."I think that that way of thinking about the problem is completely false," says Dr Bateman, who is a fellow at Cambridge's Gonville & Caius college."But I think [it] helps explain why economists have for too long hushed up this problem."Because if economists' models are suggesting that sexism doesn't exist, that it's all a result of people's free choices and... their personal characteristics, then you deny the fact there is a problem."'Hotties' vs 'Wharton' In fact, there is a growing body of research suggesting that there are some biases - overt and subconscious - that might be contributing to the lack of women in academic economic departments.Image caption The proportion of women choosing to study economics at the undergraduate level in the UK has declined over the last decade.A study published by University of California, Berkeley's Alice Wu made waves earlier this year.Using natural language processing, Wu analyzed over one million posts on a website called EconJobRumors.com, which is a sort of online forum where academic economists discuss job openings and candidates.Like many places on the internet, the conversations aren't particularly pretty or politically correct.Wu found that when posters on the site discussed female economists, they used starkly different terms than those that were used to discuss male economists.Many of those words are incredibly offensive.Posters tended to discuss a woman's physical appearance (hot and hottie were in the top ten) whereas those terms used with men tended to emphasise their intellectual ability (Wharton and Austrian - for the school of economic thinking - were in the top terms for men).'Women incur a penalty' The paper caused a lot of debate within the economic community - with many saying that what people say on the internet isn't necessarily an indication of how they truly think.University of Bristol professor Sarah Smith says: "I think it's an extreme view.I don't think it's a representation of everyone in the profession."But, she adds: "I don't think it's surprising when you tie it up with looking at the proportion of women at different levels."Prof Smith - who is also the chair of the Royal Economic Society's Women's Committee - cites other evidence that suggested a bias against women in the economics profession, such as a paper published by Harvard researcher Heather Sarsons.Image copyright Heather Sarsons Image caption Heather Sarsons found that women's contributions to co-authored papers tended to be undervalued That paper found that an additional co-authored paper on an economist's resume correlates to an 8% increase in the probability of a male economist getting a tenured post - but only a 2% increase for female candidates.Interestingly, the gap decreased if women co-authored papers with other women.Ms Sarsons wrote in the paper: "While solo-authored papers send a clear signal about one's ability, co-authored papers do not provide specific information about each contributor's skills.I find that women incur a penalty when they co-author that men do not experience."Her paper, she added in a footnote, was intentionally single-authored.There are more studies - ones that suggest that female economists' papers take six months longer to peer review in top journals than their male counterparts; that when women get tenured faculty jobs in economics, they get paid less; and that even if a woman makes it to the front of a lecture hall - there might be no men listening to them.Image copyright Victoria Bateman Image caption Victoria Bateman organised a Women in Economics day at Cambridge in 2015 to encourage more young women to enter the field."There was a very interesting and quick bit of number crunching that was done by the Centre for Global Development which has headquarters in both Washington and London," says Cambridge's Dr Bateman."When they looked at male attendance at the seminars that they run they found that it fell off quite dramatically whenever gender was mentioned in the seminar topic."Dr Bateman says the fact that there are so few women at the top has meant that many young women can't view themselves in those positions.She notes that in the early 2000s the proportion of women studying economics in British universities was around 30%.It's down to just 26% today.'Only half the story' That women aren't even choosing to enter the discipline really surprised me.So I went to Cambridge to speak to some of the current undergraduates in economics.Image caption Paulin Nusser says she noticed that there were very few women teaching her economics courses.I met Paulin Nusser, a final year economics, student at the University Centre on a busy Sunday.I asked her what her experience studying economics had been like."When I think back to my lectures last year for instance out of the 11 lecturers and supervisors I had throughout the year that are based in the faculty - just one was a woman," she says.This is why she says it can sometimes be hard to imagine a career in academic economics, even though she hopes to pursue it at postgraduate level."Representation is just something that does affect me because I am subconsciously looking for role models or someone where I can say you know, 'oh that could be me standing up there teaching this lecture'."Clara Starrsjo, a second-year student says she notices that her male and female classmates approach economics problems differently - which often leads to better, more comprehensive answers.This is why she's become passionate about increasing the number of women who study economics - including meeting with potential female economics students at a Women in Economics day each autumn.I ask her why she tells these women they should enter the field - even if the odds may seem stacked against them."For the moment economists have only looked at the world around them through male eyes and this only provides us with half the story," she says she tells them."And with only half the story how can we get results that will help the whole population?"
'Tell me phone, what's destroying my crops?':::::Image copyright Peat Image caption Voruganti Surendra says farmers are finding pest and disease recognition apps "very useful" India's farmers have never had it easy; drought, crop failure, low market prices and lack of modernisation have taken their toll on the nation's population, about half of whom work in agriculture.Every year thousands of farmers take their own lives.So can crop management apps help?Voruganti Surendra is a farmer who grows paddy rice on an acre of farmland in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.He and hundreds of his fellow farmers are using a new app that can recognise a growing number of crop pests and diseases and give advice on how to treat them."It is very useful," he says."Farmers need it."The app, called Plantix, was developed thousands of miles away in Berlin, Germany, by a group of graduate students and scientists who came together to help farmers combat disease, pest damage and nutrient deficiency in their crops."It was really important for us to understand what farmers wanted," says Charlotte Schumann, co-founder of Peat (Progressive Environmental & Agricultural Technologies) the company behind the app, "so we did a lot of groundwork in India".Image caption Peat boss Simone Strey (left) and co-founder Charlotte Schumann created the Plantix app After months criss-crossing this vast country by train, conducting research in rural areas, the team concluded that a diagnostics app featuring image recognition would help farmers most, especially since smartphone prices were falling to affordable levels."The smartphones gave many of them access to the internet for the first time," says Ms Schumann.There are 500 or so farmers in Mr Surendra's village of Karlapalem in Bapatla Mandal, growing rice, maize, cotton, banana, chilli and a host of other crops.While just 20 own their own smartphones, these lucky few share them so that their fellow farmers can take photos of their crops and upload the images to the app.The farmer photographs the damaged crop and the app identifies the likely pest or disease by applying machine learning to its growing database of images.Not only can Plantix recognise a range of crop diseases, such as potassium deficiency in a tomato plant, rust on wheat, or nutrient deficiency in a banana plant, but it is also able to analyse the results, draw conclusions, and offer advice.Image copyright Peat Image caption The app can recognise different types of pest damage and suggest treatments These abilities rely on deep neural networks, or DNNs, which processes information in a way similar to how biological nervous systems operate."It works a bit like the human brain," says Peat's chief executive, Simone Strey.Initially, or if the image recognition software gets confused, pathologists and other experts will provide information about what the app is looking at."Obviously, it needs some backup from human experts," says Ms Strey.The app had to be multi-lingual because "the farmers often use different names for crop diseases than those used by scientists", she says."And if the farmers don't know the scientific name, they won't be able to search for solutions online."It is currently available in Hindi, Telugu and English in India, and in five other languages for use in other countries.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About half of India's 1.3 billion people work in agriculture But Peat is not the only firm developing smartphone apps to help farmers.In Africa, for instance, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research - a body dedicated to food security - has just won a $100,000 (76,000) award to expand its research and bring a similar app to farmers across the continent.David Hughes of Penn State, who co-leads the project, describes it as "transformative" and says they "can amplify by 100 times what we have achieved so far".In fact, the number of digital helpers that can fit in farmers' pockets has grown dramatically in recent years.They include fertiliser firm Yara's ImageIT app, which uses photos to measure nitrogen uptake in a crop and offer recommendations to farmers.University of Missouri's ID Weeds app helps farmers identify unwanted plants.And John Deere's GrainTruckPlus app helps with grain harvesting storage and fleet logistics.Then there's PotashCorp's return-on-investment calculator, called eKonomics, and AgVault 2.0 Mobile's Sentera app, which controls drones that can systematically film entire fields autonomously and feed back the footage for analysis.Image copyright Yara Image caption Yara's ImageIT app aims to measure the nitrogen content in plants "Technological innovations play a very important role," says Harsimrat Kaur Badal, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries, in reducing waste, improving hygiene, creating jobs, and addressing "farmers' distress".Krishna Kumar, chief executive of CropIn Technology, a data-driven farming company, believes agricultural "start-ups [will] innovate fast and change every aspect of the industry".While such apps are practically useful to farmers now, it is the data they collect that is potentially more useful in the longer term, argues Peat's Ms Strey."Each farmer represents a data point, and it's really the data set that's valuable.Research on this scale in this field hasn't been done before by any global research organisation."This is why farmers don't usually have to pay to use such apps."If you want to collect data, you don't make the users pay," says Ms Strey.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Peat's database currently contains some 1.5 million images - up from 100,000 a year ago, with 80% of its 300,000 to 400,000 users currently in India.Geo-tagging offers insight into which plants are grown where, and whether or not they are healthy.Apps can record the weather, too, and build up a picture of the climatic conditions.Such knowledge is valuable not just to the farmers themselves but also to producers of fertilisers or pesticides, to the food industry which wants to source crops, and to governments keen to see the bigger picture in their countries.As such, the challenge, according to CropIn Technology's Mr Kumar, is not merely to gather the data, but to "make sense of it and present it as actionable insights to agri businesses".
The companies making bicycles from wood:::::Image copyright Connor Wood Image caption Connor Wood makes its bike frames from white ash or black walnut The forerunner of the bicycle - the laufmaschine or running machine - bears only a passing resemblance to the pedal-bikes we know today.Invented in 1817, it had no chain and was powered by the rider pushing his feet along the ground in a walking or running motion.Even more unusually, its frame was made from wood.Jump forward to 2017, and a crop of bike makers is turning back the clock - at least in terms of using wood as a core material.These firms make their bicycles in part, and occasionally wholly, from woods such as ash, oak and walnut.They are driven by a love of craft and design, the desire to use natural materials, and a passion for cycling itself.Image copyright Connor Wood Image caption Chris Connor decided to combine his long held passions for woodwork and cycling And they have attracted a small but growing base of enthusiastic customers, willing to pay high prices for their lovingly crafted creations."People like having something unique, something different," says Chris Connor, the founder of Connor Wood Bicycles."They also appreciate the craftsmanship.Not a lot of things are built by hand these days."The company was born in 2012, after the 48-year-old American decided to combine his long held passions for woodwork and cycling.All his bikes all have wooden frames; the other parts, such as the gears and wheels, are made from steel, carbon or rubber.Prices range from $3,500 (2,600) to $11,000.Sales have gradually been increasing, but it hasn't been easy, says Mr Connor.That's because of a perception among some cyclists that wooden bikes may break or be unsafe.Image copyright Niko Crepnjak Image caption Woodster Bikes makes its frames from beech and bog oak In fact, Mr Connor says wood is very durable, which is why it's used to make tool handles, skis, boats, even light aircraft.It also absorbs vibrations well, making cycling on bumpy roads smoother, less tiring and quieter."And of course, these bikes look great," says Mr Connor, who makes his frames made from "strong but flexible" white ash or "eye candy" black walnut.A recently published book called "The Wooden Bicycle: Around the World" features 111 companies that make bikes from wood or bamboo.Only one, Splinterbike in the UK, sells 100% wooden models with its bikes featuring wooden gears, chains and wheels.Image copyright Tjaa Matii Image caption Woodster Bikes cost from 2,500 euros to 17,000 euros However, most limit their use of wood to the frame, and occasionally parts such as the handlebars and forks.Other parts will be made from materials typically associated with bikes, such as aluminium.It is the unique design of wooden bikes, and their bespoke craftsmanship, that underpins their appeal, says Gregor Cuzak.The Slovenian co-founded Woodster Bikes after meeting woodworker Iztok Mohoric, who had recently designed a bike with a wooden frame."I wasn't interested at first, but after I saw it and took a ride, I was immediately convinced," Mr Cuzak says."People were watching me as if I was driving a wild sports car."Image copyright Thessa Lageman Image caption Piet Brandjes, right, co-founder of Bough Bikes with his son Bob Like other firms in the space, Woodster is targeting customers who appreciate the finer things in life.Its bike frames are made of woods such as beech and bog oak, and prices range from 2,500 euros (2,190) up to 17,000 euros.In addition, every customer gets a book with a story about how their individual bike was made."We even plant a new tree at the same location where we cut one for your bike," Mr Cuzak adds.Piet Brandjes, 63, who co-founded Dutch firm Bough Bikes, agrees that wooden bikes "attract attention".For that reason, firms in the Netherlands such as Novotel and Rabobank have bought Bough Bikes for their guests and employees to use.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: The bikes are also used in a shared bike scheme at Schiphol Airport business park, in Amsterdam, so workers can give them a spin.Mr Brandjes says all his models have French oak frames, handlebars and front forks.However, customers don't need to worry about them getting wet in the rain."The bikes in the shared scheme have been outside for three years and they still look good," he says."As long as wet wood dries again, it's fine.You just need to polish it once a season."Image copyright Bough Bikes Image caption Bough Bikes Everyone I spoke to reported feeling frustrated by assumptions that wooden bikes were less safe and sturdy than other bikes.Mr Connor tells me that by using the right woods and construction techniques, his bikes are perfectly durable."A strong seasoned wood, laminated to itself in strips with reversing grain directions, bonded with aerospace adhesives is incredibly tough."Add in interspersed layers of carbon fibre and Kevlar, like in my bikes, and the strength far exceeds the requirements for making a reasonably lightweight performance bicycle frame."As for how they function, Mr Brandjes points out that all of his bikes have been tested by TUV Rheinland, a renowned German organisation that certifies products.Image copyright Bough Bikes Image caption French oak However, other obstacles may hinder firms in the space.For one thing, wooden bikes tend to be heavier than many road bikes.The various models of the three companies I spoke to weigh between 9.9kg and 25kg."You can't make them as light as carbon bikes," says Mr Connor, "but I don't think a pound or two more or less matters."The people who buy them are not competitive riders, he adds.Too pricey?Another issue is that wooden bikes tend to cost a lot, which may be preventing higher volumes of sales.American firm Renovo, whose bikes start at $3,995, is probably the number one producer of wooden bikes worldwide.And yet it told the BBC it had only sold 1,000 models since it was founded in 2007."If someone manages to create a wooden bike for under 1,000 euros (914), sales might rise," Mr Cuzak says.He has only sold 10 bikes since he started in 2015, meaning that he and his partner still have to work on the company in their spare time.However, Mr Connor runs his business full time, having sold around 65 pieces to date.And Bough Bikes has shifted about 600 bikes since it was founded in 2012.Summing up what many in the wooden bike industry believe, Mr Cuzak says, "this is not a regular business, but a slow business".However, he adds: "We've planted the seed and are now waiting for the tree to grow.I believe it will, eventually."
How maps are powering the tech revolution:::::Image copyright Geovation Image caption From Hugh Grant to maps - this space now houses Ordnance Survey's start-up hub Remember Hugh Grant's bachelor pad in About a Boy?This epitome of a cool central London home has now given itself over to the British map maker Ordnance Survey.It's the site of their start-up hub, helping young companies which are using their mapping technology.It's a world away from Ordnance Survey's (OS) concertina'd, paper-based business, but location, location, location still matters here.Where we are and where we want to go is at the heart of so many of the world's most innovative businesses.Think of Uber, Deliveroo, Airbnb, the development of driverless cars, and drone deliveries.All of these companies need location data to power their software.In fact there are very few sectors which don't rely on it.Some estimates say the global market for core geographical information will exceed $13bn (9.6bn) by 2025, according to consultancy firm Navigant.Image copyright Ordnance Survey Image caption Maps are increasingly being digitised for use in new technologies Carmakers are among the companies hungry for mapping data, according to Martin Garner of tech consultants CCS Insight."Developments in mapping are mainly being led by the transportation industry in its push towards intelligent and self-driving cars and trucks," he says.In December 2015, for example, BMW, Daimler, and Volkswagen's Audi acquired the digital mapping company HERE from Nokia for $3.1bn to provide their own in-house source of data.Mr Garner says the value of location data lies in its ability to mirror every aspect of the world around us.He says technology is turning maps into living databases of places, objects and people where live information comes from a wide range of sources, and is used by lots of different people.Image copyright CNH technology/OS Image caption Ordnance Survey technology is being used in the development of driverless tractors OS, founded back in 1791, makes most of its 150m yearly revenue from the private companies who use its data - such as Garmin's sat navs - and through big public sector agreements providing data for bus routes, planning and flood prevention.But a third of its products can be used for free.It's that information - on our roads and rivers - which provides the backbone for so many other companies, including Google Maps.OS decided to open the Geovation hub in London in 2015.The company felt it was behind the curve on how its mapping data was being used and that it wasn't seeing the benefits of giving the information away for free.Image caption The company has been mapping Britain since 1791 - the official year of its foundation - including these maps from the 1920s The hub's 900 members range from industry stalwarts to A-level students, but are mainly start-up companies who rely on location data to develop their products.Taking a leaf out of the financial industry's book, they've even developed a new word for the companies they work with: Geotech.For Alex Wrottesley, who runs the hub, there are many advantages of this kind of interaction with start-ups, and he says it's often the best way of bringing things to market.One of the companies based in the hub is Openplay, which aims to create a comprehensive list of leisure activities and venues across the UK, including in church halls and community centres.Its boss, Sam Parton, uses a combination of OS maps and shoe leather to build the database."Parks and open spaces don't have postcodes so it can be very difficult to find events happening in them.We've gone out and practically listed them ourselves," he says.Image caption Sam Parton from Open Play is using OS data to build a database of leisure venues Richa Bhalla who runs Pedals, a green courier company based in the Geovation Hub, says mapping is about more than getting goods from A to B.It tries to use commuters to deliver packages in the safest and least polluted way they can.Pedals overlays OS data with other sources to do this."It is all about logistics, getting to places as fast as possible, using green cycle lanes rather than busy roads," Richa says.Apart from those companies that have won free placements on one of their accelerator schemes, the programme is funded by a small fee from the businesses who work there and sponsorship deals with private companies.However, the OS is also looking to the start-ups as future money spinners - as it starts to take stakes in the most successful.The aim, it says, is "to create new revenues for our long-term future".Image copyright Geovation Image caption Richa Bhalla from Pedals says coming up with greener routes is something she really cares about Implicit in this drive for innovation and those words "long-term future", is the axe that has hung over the future of the OS in recent years.OS was made a government-owned company in 2015 - a technical term meaning it has greater commercial freedoms such as how to pay its staff - but it remains in the control of the state alongside the likes of Companies House, Network Rail and the Royal Mint.There was speculation when this happened that the government could look to sell it.However, in a recent statement, the Department for Business said categorically "there are no plans to privatise Ordnance Survey".Image caption The Geovation hub is a world away from the traditional cartography done by the Ordnance Survey OS sees its long-term future in embracing new technologies like providing data for smart cities, the roll out of 5G and driverless cars.And it's not the only one.James Hodgson, a senior analyst in smart mobility and automotive at ABI Research, says the mapping industry is being transformed."Profitable map building isn't a matter of owning the capital for map creation," he says.Instead, it's about having the ability to ingest data from lots of devices to "build a continuously up-to-date, accurate representation of the world"."As traditional map building becomes less viable and less profitable, the traditional map builders are having to innovate."Mr Wrottesley is confident OS knows what its core customer wants: "We've been selling our services for 200 years."For OS - like others in the mapping industry - it's about how to map the next few decades as well.
Portsmouth owner Eisner's journey from Disney to Pompey:::::Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption Michael Eisner watched a lot of football in Europe and the US before buying Portsmouth Two decades at the helm of global entertainment giant Walt Disney might seem a strange apprenticeship for taking over a lower-level English football club, but Michael Eisner insists it is the latest logical move in his high-flying business career.The 75-year-old American completed his takeover of historic south coast club Portsmouth in August for 5.67m, buying it from fans who had stepped in with their own money to save the club.The club, nicknamed Pompey, had fallen on hard financial times since winning the FA Cup in 2008, and had dropped from the Premier League to the bottom tier, but did get promoted back to League One at the end of last season.After a lifetime working for some of the biggest US and international TV and film firms, including ABC and Paramount as well as Disney, the native of New York state had launched his own investment firm, and was looking for interesting projects to back.Mr Eisner, whose net worth is estimated at $1bn (760m), and his Tornante group will invest 10m in the club.'Passion is key' "What is an American guy doing getting involved with English football?," he says."Well, I am qualified for this new role.In a way I feel my whole career has led up to this."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Portsmouth FC is starting out on what Mr Eisner hopes is a march back up the league tables Indeed, during his time in the entertainment industry Mr Eisner was involved in a number of sports-related projects, including TV scheduling, film production, and the acquisition of clubs."There are differences between sport and entertainment - one must be scripted, planned, produced, and the other is more spontaneous, extemporaneous.But both have conflict, a climax and an ending," he observes."And whatever your brand, product, league, club - the idea of loyalty or passion is key."And Eisner says it was the raucous fan reaction to Portsmouth winning promotion, and the League Two title, last season that was the final factor in convincing him to buy the club.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Eisner says it was the passion of the fans that convinced him to buy Portsmouth FC "Because of this mad enthusiasm I found Pompey irresistible," he said at the Leaders sports conference in London."I had first heard about the possibility of acquiring the club when I was looking at the possibility of buying a US sports team.Investing in US sport is very expensive.The NFL has its physical problems which scare me."It [football] just seemed a great thing to me and my family.We got hooked on the game in the UK."'Excitement and history' Mr Eisner and his three sons, Breck, Eric, and Anders, make up the Portsmouth board, along with Andy Redman, president of Tornante, and Portsmouth FC chief executive Mark Catlin.Despite its recent woes the club has a strong heritage, winning the League title in 1949 and 1950, and FA Cup in 1939 as well as nine years ago.Image copyright Getty Images/Hulton Archive Image caption Mr Eisner says he was struck by Portsmouth's historic past "When I passed through the Fratton Park turnstiles I felt like I did when I stepped through the doors at Disney - a sense of excitement and of a rich history," he says."Portsmouth fans are passionate.[After] four strange owners the fans stepped in and bought the team."Pompey fans had done a remarkable job but it seemed they would need additional investment to build the brand."He says there were another reasons, apart from fan passion and history, that he and his family wanted to buy a football club.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The new owners say they have plans to upgrade Fratton Park stadium One is the fact that football has a global appeal, and also - in a currently fractured media landscape - "the only appointment-to-view [TV] is for sports events"."Today, viewers can watch the shows they want any time they want on on multiple devices.But sport fans want to watch their teams compete in real time," he says.That means that sports, and football, TV rights will always be in high demand by broadcasters looking for content.Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption Mr Eisner was introduced to the fans before the opening game of the season against Rochdale As well as the expertise and cash that Eisner is providing, he is also promising to improve the stadium and promote managerial stability."Over time we will make the match day experience the pleasure it should be," he says, adding the club will also continue to build on its strong community work, for which it has won a number of Football League awards.Michael Eisner: A Sporting Life Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Eisner at the launch of an ESPN sports-themed restaurant "At ABC TV in 1970 we made a crack in the traditional entertainment wall, by moving NFL Football to prime time on a Monday night.ABC was the smallest network and needed success," he says.It became one of the longest-running prime time shows ever on commercial network TV.At Paramount he oversaw production of sports films Players, North Dallas Forty, and the Bad News Bears trilogy.In 1984 he became Disney chairman and the company produced the film The Mighty Ducks.Disney in 1993 then created an actual ice hockey team called the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, now the Anaheim Ducks.In 2006-07 the team won the NHL's Stanley Cup.Disney also produced baseball film Angels in the Outfield in 1984.In 1997 Disney took over the California Angels team.It was renamed the Anaheim Angels and under Disney's ownership won its first World Series championship in 2002.During Mr Eisner's time at Disney it also acquired leading sports cable TV channel ESPN in 1996.His current private firm bought the Topps sports trading card firm in 2007.It is licensed to produce English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Uefa Champions League, and Indian Premier League cricket products.'Triumph of the underdog' Mr Eisner now says the club, which sits mid-table in League One, now needs stability and continuity on and off the playing field.He believes if club owners give their manager support, then the coaching team will have the confidence to lead the team to success."If you look at the great sports teams, you try to find a great manager and stick with him through thick and thin," he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Eisner says there are similarities between Portsmouth and Disney fans He says he hopes current manager Kenny Jackett will be in the post for a decade, and oversee success during that time."The Disney fans are similar to Portsmouth fans," he says."When I went there it was about to be broken up.The fans' love of Disney helped support it."All of Disney's sports films had the same theme - the triumph of the underdog.With Portsmouth we hope to get it right in fact, not fiction."We will get there - being slow, steady and smart."
Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem:::::Image copyright Getty creative Image caption Is the price of our growing addiction to takeaway hot drinks an ever higher mountain of landfill?Since last year, when we were all made aware of the UK's unrecycled cup mountain, some of us have found it hard to buy a takeaway coffee without being wracked with guilt.In the UK, we throw away an estimated 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year.In theory, they are "recyclable", but in practice, only a tiny percentage is dealt with sustainably.Yet so far, there's no agreed way forward.Parliament's environmental audit committee has been hearing the latest thoughts from campaigners and industry on how we can improve on our record in this area.A lot of the biggest names in takeaway beverages, including Caffe Nero, Costa Coffee, McDonald's, Pret A Manger and Starbucks, have signed up to a scheme to collect and recycle more of the current type of cups.Costa is also collecting cups from rival brands in its shops.But others believe a more fundamental rethink would work better.Here are four ways the coffee cup waste problem might be tackled.1.Frugalpac: 'Just change the cups' Conventional cups can be recycled, but only in special facilities, thanks to the lamination that makes them waterproof.Frugalpac, based in Ipswich in the UK, manufactures cardboard cups that can be recycled in regular recycling plants.Image copyright Frugalcup "We looked at this three years ago: everyone was blaming someone else, the cup makers, the coffee shops, councils.We thought, why don't we go out there and solve the problem?"says Frugalpac's founder, Martin Myerscough.He has a patent for his cup - made of recycled materials, with an only very lightly attached plastic lining (representing about 10% of the weight of the cup), that separates easily during recycling.It's a more pragmatic solution, he argues, than trying to set up specialist collection points for conventional cups, because we already have recycling bins.He has done trials with independent coffee shops and is working with Starbucks.Of course, consumers will still have to remember to put them in the right bin, and he is still working on replacing the plastic lid.2.CupClub: 'Like city bike rental for cups' Safia Qureshi points to chai wallahs in India as one of her initial inspirations.There, tea is poured into glasses that are washed and reused.We all used to drink milk and Coca Cola from returnable, reusable bottles.So why not coffee?Image copyright Bailey-Oscar "The current model for reusable cups is that the consumer needs to buy the cup and take it in.The ratio of consumers doing that is 2% of all the total coffee sold," she points out.Instead, she proposes that the customer joins Cup Club and picks up a reusable cup when they buy their coffee.It can be returned later to one of several collection points.Cup Club is responsible for collecting washing and redistributing the clean cups to participating retailers.Because the cups are tagged and registered to your account - using RFID, the same technology that's on an Oyster travel card - Cup Club can text you a reminder if you've forgotten to return a cup and charge you if you keep it.Image copyright Cup Club "I'm very passionate about putting an end to products that are only used one time," says Ms Quereshi "It's a selfish and arrogant stance."She's starting with company offices and universities, but is aiming ultimately for a London-wide scheme.Its success will rely on enough retailers subscribing, but she has received an Ellen MacArthur Circular Design Challenge award, which will support her in developing the idea further.3.TrioCup: the origami cup Tom Chan, an engineering student from Hong Kong studying in the US, said he saw the coffee cups piling up in the rubbish bins outside his university building and wanted to do something about it.He has now patented his TrioCup, a triangular-shaped cardboard cup, with sticking up flaps "like bunny ears".Those ears can be folded down and tucked in to close it.The entire cup is recyclable and, without the need for a separate plastic lid, potentially cheaper than normal cups.Image copyright TrioCup "I decided if I were to make a new cup, it needed to have more features than just being eco-friendly," he says.So he aimed for some other selling points too, such as spill-resistance."From my anecdotal research, a lot more people spill their coffee than you think."He says you can drop a TrioCup from waist height and most of the coffee will stay in the cup.He thinks the shape makes the cups easier to hold and gives them "a cool aesthetic".Even the origami folding technique is pretty simple, he says.Image copyright TrioCup Next month, Mr Chan, another recipient of an Ellen MacArthur award, will be making several thousand cups per week for use in the university coffee shop.4.Cupffee: the edible cup The ultimate waste-free cup, though, must be this: a coffee cup made of cereals that you can munch on like an ice cream cone, once you've downed your drink.Image copyright Cupffee Three friends from Plovdiv in Bulgaria, Miroslav Zapryanov, Mladen Dzhalazov and Simeon Gavrailov, came up with their "waffle" recipe containing no preservatives, colourings or coatings a few years ago and have been working on commercialising it ever since.Apparently slightly sweet and crisp, it will hold your coffee for up to 40 minutes.And if you decide not to snack on it, it will biodegrade within weeks.They say they were inspired by a desire to change the world.They might only be changing the diets of a limited number of Bulgarian coffee drinkers, but they are ambitious.The founders say that with a shelf life of six months the Cupffee could meet the needs of the big High Street coffee chains.But many other firms are thinking along similar lines, at least when it comes to compostable cups.Companies such as Bristol-based Planglow have successfully commercialised what they say is fully biodegradable food packaging, including coffee cups.And they boast clients from restaurants to contract caterers, sandwich shops to Parliament, so policy makers presumably are familiar with this option.
10 toughest places for girls to go to school:::::Image copyright Unicef Image caption South Sudan has been named as the worst place in the world for education for girls Debates about schools in richer countries are often about the politics of priorities, what subjects should be given most importance, who needs extra help and what needs more public spending.But for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic - is there any access to school at all?Figures from the United Nations suggest there has been "almost zero progress" in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the world's poorest countries.A further report examined the quality of education, and the UN said the findings were "staggering", with more than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In Niger, four out of five adult women remain illiterate While in affluent Western countries, girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement, in poorer parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, girls are much more likely to be missing out.And on the UN's International Day of the Girl, the development campaign, One, has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education.Conflict zones Across these 10 countries, most of those without school places are girls.These are fragile countries, where many families are at risk from poverty, ill health, poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Refugees displaced by fighting this summer in South Sudan Many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school.And many marry young, ending any chance of an education.UN figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones.Image copyright Unicef Image caption Refugees in Chad: Conflicts have disrupted the educations of tens of millions The rankings are based on: the proportion of girls without a primary school place the proportion of girls without a secondary school place the proportion of girls completing primary school the proportion of girls completing secondary school the average number of years girls attend school female illiteracy rates teacher training levels the teacher-pupil ratio public spending on education For some countries, such as Syria, there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included.Here are the top 10 toughest places for girls' education: South Sudan: the world's newest country has faced much violence and war, with the destruction of schools and families forced from their homes.Almost three-quarters of girls do not even make it to primary school Central African Republic: one teacher for every 80 pupils Niger: only 17% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate Afghanistan: wide gender gap, with boys more likely to be in school than girls Chad: many social and economic barriers to girls and women getting education Mali: only 38% of girls finish primary school Guinea: the average time in education among women over the age of 25 is less than one year Burkina Faso: only 1% of girls complete secondary school Liberia: almost two-thirds of primary-age pupils out of school Ethiopia: two in five girls are married before the age of 18 A shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries.Last year, the UN said another 69 million teachers would need to be recruited worldwide by 2030 if international promises on education were to be kept.Image caption Florence Cheptoo learned to read at 60, when her grandchild brought home a library book The report says there are great economic dividends if girls can be kept in school.And there are great gains for individuals, such as Florence Cheptoo, who lives in a remote village in Kenya and learned to read at the age of 60.Gayle Smith, president of the One campaign, called the failures in education for girls a "global crisis that perpetuates poverty"."Over 130 million girls are still out of school - that's over 130 million potential engineers, entrepreneurs, teachers and politicians whose leadership the world is missing out on."More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.
The shampoo bottle saving babies from pneumonia:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bangladeshi doctor who turned a shampoo bottle into a low-cost lifesaver "It was my first night as an intern and three children died before my eyes.I felt so helpless that I cried."In 1996, Dr Mohammod Jobayer Chisti was working in the paediatric department of the Sylhet Medical College Hospital in Bangladesh.That evening he made a promise that he would do something to stop children dying from pneumonia.About 920,000 babies and small children die from the disease each year, mostly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.After two decades of research, Dr Chisti has now come up with a low-cost device with the potential to save thousands of babies' lives.Expensive machines Pneumonia affects the lungs after infections from bacteria like streptococcus (strep throat) or a virus such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).The lungs become swollen and fill with fluid or pus, reducing their ability to take in oxygen.In developed countries hospitals use ventilators to help children with pneumonia to breathe.But each machine can cost up to $15,000 (11,000) and must be operated by specially-trained staff which can make them too expensive for hospitals in developing countries such as Bangladesh.The World Health Organisation's recommended low-cost alternative treatment for severe pneumonia - low-flow oxygen - still results in one in seven children dying.Image caption The pressure from the bubbles in Dr Chisti's device keeps the small air sacs of the lungs open Dr Christi got his inspiration from a machine he saw while working in Melbourne, Australia.This uses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to prevent the lungs from collapsing, helping the body to absorb enough oxygen.But it is expensive.When he returned to work at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, he started work on a simpler, cheaper bubble CPAP device.He and a colleague took a discarded plastic shampoo bottle from the intensive care unit, filled it with water and inserted one end of some plastic supply tubing.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."The children inhale oxygen from a tank and exhale through a tube which is inserted into a bottle of water producing bubbles in the water," Dr Chisti explains.The pressure from the bubbles keeps the small air sacs of the lungs open."We tested it on four or five patients at random.We saw a significant improvement within a few hours."Successful Trial "Doctors worked so hard; oxygen, a pipe for food, and then a white round bottle was connected with water bubbling away," says Kohinoor Begum, whose daughter Runa was treated by the device."After the treatment, when my child recovered, I felt so happy."After a two year study, Dr Chisti published the results in The Lancet magazine.It showed children treated with the bubble CPAP device had much lower death rates compared with those treated with low-flow oxygen.At a cost of just $1.25 (1), the device appeared to cut mortality rates by 75%.The device also makes much more efficient use of oxygen, slashing the hospital's annual oxygen bill from $30,000 (23,000) to just $6,000 (4,600).Dr ARM Luthful Kabir, professor of paediatrics at Ad-din Women's Medical College, says a nationwide study is still needed but the results are encouraging.Image caption Kohinoor Begum and Rezaul Karim with daughter Runa, one of 600 babies treated using the device "I think this innovation has great potential to reduce the mortality rate drastically because any hospital can afford this," Dr Kabir says.So far, about 600 children have benefited from the low-cost life saver.Dr Chisti has been promoted and is now head of clinical research at his hospital but the father-of-three still finds time to play with the children on the ward.When asked how he feels to be fulfilling that promise he made 20 years ago he replies: "I have no language to express this."He wants every hospital in developing countries to have the CPAP device available to them."On that day, we can say that pneumonia-related mortality is near zero."

From fluffy pillows to concrete: The uses of captured CO2:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Your fluffy pillows and memory foam mattress could be helping to reduce CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process?When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change.This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street.It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet.Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2.UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics.In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic.And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process."Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year," explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies."This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."Image copyright CarbonCure Image caption CarbonCure's Robert Niven thinks his firm's concrete is far more environmentally friendly The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market.Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete.CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer.The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger.Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects.Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel.While Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes.But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference?Simply put, levels of "greenhouse gases" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Should we be reducing the amount of CO2 used in making plastics, or simply using less plastic?At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions.But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark.A gigatonne is a billion tonnes.Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year.And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year.Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes."It's great to have these options coming up," says Mr Christensen, "but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."Image copyright Ashley Cooper Image caption Greenpeace's Doug Parr thinks renewable energy is a better way to reduce CO2 emissions Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy.A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes."Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels," says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK."A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed," he argues.Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon.Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood.So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue.This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed."Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down.Then carbon capture can come in," says Mr Christensen."It could have an important role to play."
Have you been nudged?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Richard Thaler has won a Nobel prize for his research into 'nudge' theory Think the Nobel prize for economics has nothing to do with you?In some years that may well be true.But this year's award has gone to Richard Thaler who, in his book Nudge, was one of the first to outline how tiny prompts can alter our behaviour.The Nobel judges are clearly keen on the discipline, since they awarded fellow behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman the Economics prize in 2002.Since when "nudge theory" has been applied to a wide range of problems.Here are a few ways you may have been nudged yourself.Fly in my bowl Image copyright Getty creative In probably the most well-known example, spillage around the toilet, an age old problem for at least half of the human race, was cut by 80% using an ingeniously simple intervention.First introduced at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam back in 1999, the idea was simple: etch the image of a fly in the urinal and men cannot help but take aim, saving on clean-up costs as well as alleviating unpleasantness.The painted porcelain was one of Prof Thaler's early favourite examples of tweaking the environment in a way that makes us change how we behave.Taxing issues When David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, one of his pet projects was the "Nudge Unit" or to give it its official title: the Behaviourial Insights Team.It set about encouraging better behaviour amongst UK citizens in a range of ways from letting you know that other people had filled in their tax returns (so you should do yours now) to offering a more personal approach at the job centre.But the most eye-catching, for those on the receiving end, was what you were sent if you failed to pay your car tax.A big heading shouted: "Pay your tax or lose your Ford Fiesta" (or whatever car you owned) accompanied by a photograph of the untaxed car.The focused approach paid off.A more positive tone was taken with the wealthy failing to pay their taxes.They received letters explaining how their taxes would help improve local services, and pointing out what would disappear without funding.These tweaks saw 210m in overdue tax paid into the Treasury.Baby face Woolwich in south-east London had a problem with anti-social behaviour.During the riots in 2011 several shop fronts were smashed in.The following year advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather, embracing the new science of behavioural economics, offered an innovative strategy.Knowing that even the toughest heart is melted by the sight of a infant, they spent a night with graffiti artists painting pictures of local babies' faces onto the shutters protecting the shop windows.The move was credited with helping to reduce anti-social behaviour by 18% in Woolwich.Ringing up sales If you've ever been on the phone to a salesperson, you may well have heard one of the following: "Most people in your position buy this" or "This deal is only available today".The first plays on our susceptibility to "social norming" - we think if others are doing it they must have a good reason.The second is based on loss aversion: we hate the idea of missing out.Thirdly, there can often be a tone of inexplicable cheeriness.Relentless positivity is catching apparently, and makes us feel good about signing up.Big brands have embraced the idea.For example, a team from Ogilvy and Mather has coached staff selling subscriptions to the Times and the Sunday Times to use these persuasive techniques.Did they work on you?Image copyright Getty creative Opting out In the past, people who want to donate their vital organs in the event of their death have usually been asked to "opt in" by putting their name on a register.Thanks in part to behavioural economics, there's a growing trend to adopt policies that presume consent and ask objectors to "opt out".Though the results are inconclusive it's clear we've embraced the concept - that we need to design the system in a way that helps us to "do the right thing" rather than rely on individuals' consciences.Likewise, we all know we need to save for our retirement, but it can be hard to summon the will-power.The "save more tomorrow" approach pioneered in the United States saw employees automatically signed up to pay into a pension, but starting with very small contributions to avoid loss-aversion that could make them baulk.Only later do payments rise.All if all this makes you feel as though the policymakers and marketers are only out to manipulate us, well at least thanks to Prof Thaler we now understand what they're up to a little better.
'I quit Google and launched a business with my mum':::::Image copyright Rahul Akerkar Image caption Munaf Kapadia and his mother Nafisa Munaf Kapadia runs a successful "pop up" restaurant at his family's home in Mumbai.His mother also works as head chef.While watching TV one Sunday afternoon back in 2014, Munaf Kapadia had an argument with his mother that would change his life.The then 25-year-old Google employee wanted to watch US cartoon the Simpsons, but as usual, his mother Nafisa preferred to see her favourite Indian soap opera and switched channels.It got Mr Kapadia thinking.His mum had lots of skills, but in his view she spent too much time watching bad TV.Image caption Diners usually eat Bohri food from the same large platter, or "thaal" Determined to get her doing something more meaningful, he struck upon an idea.Nafisa had always been good at cooking "Bohri" food, an Indian cuisine that is much feted, but hardly served anywhere in their home city of Mumbai.And so he decided to email 50 friends, inviting them for lunch at the family home."We settled on a group of eight friends of friends, and served them my mom's food," recalls Mr Kapadia, now 28."Then we started doing it every Saturday and Sunday, opening it up to the public and charging like a restaurant.That's how The Bohri Kitchen was born."Image caption Members of the public dine at the Kapadias' home every weekend Traditionally, Bohri cuisine has only been available within the Dawoodi Bohra community, a small Muslim sect that lives in parts of India and Pakistan.As Mr Kapadia says, "you literally had to beg Bohri friends or gatecrash Bohri weddings" to get a spoonful of it.It blends Gujarati, Parsi, Mughlai and Maharastrian influences, and is often enjoyed by groups of friends or families, who eat from the same large steel platter, or "thaal".For his first "pop-up" lunch, Mr Kapadia charged guests 700 rupees (8, $11) per head for a traditional seven-course banquet.By the time they had finished eating he knew the idea had potential.Image caption Mutton Khichda -

How the search for a 'death ray' led to radar:::::Image copyright Getty Images You can trace the extent of our reliance on air travel to many inventions.The jet engine, perhaps, or the aeroplane itself.But sometimes inventions need other inventions to unlock their full potential.For the aviation industry, that story starts with the invention of the death ray, or at least an attempt to design a death ray, back in 1935.Officials in the British Air Ministry were worried about falling behind Nazi Germany in the technological arms race.The death ray idea intrigued them: they had been offering a 1,000 prize for anyone who could zap a sheep at a hundred paces.So far, nobody had claimed it.But should they fund more active research?Was a death ray even possible?Image copyright Sasha Image caption Harry Grindell Matthews claimed to have invented a death ray in 1923, but couldn't persuade the British government to buy it Unofficially, they sounded out Robert Watson Watt, of the Radio Research Station.And he posed an abstract maths question to his colleague Skip Wilkins."Suppose, just suppose," said Watson Watt to Wilkins, "that you had eight pints of water, 1km [3,000ft] above the ground."And suppose that water was at 98F [37C], and you wanted to heat it to 105F."How much radio frequency power would you require, from a distance of 5km?"Opportunity Skip Wilkins was no fool.He knew that eight pints was the amount of blood in an adult human, 98F was normal body temperature and 105F was warm enough to kill you, or at least make you pass out, which - if you're behind the controls of an aeroplane - amounts to much the same thing.So Wilkins and Watson Watt understood each other, and they quickly agreed the death ray was hopeless: it would take too much power.But they also saw an opportunity.Clearly, the ministry had some cash to spend on research.Perhaps Watson Watt and Wilkins could propose some alternative way for them to spend it?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robert Watson Watt played a key role in developing radar technology Wilkins pondered.It might be possible, he suggested, to transmit radio waves and detect - from the echoes - the location of oncoming aircraft long before they could be seen.Watson Watt dashed off a memo to the Air Ministry's newly formed Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence.Would they be interested in pursuing such an idea?They would indeed.What Skip Wilkins was describing became known as radar.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.As Robert Buderi describes in his book The Invention That Changed the World, the Germans, the Japanese and the Americans all independently started work on it too.Spectacular breakthrough But by 1940, it was the British who had made a spectacular breakthrough: the resonant cavity magnetron, a radar transmitter far more powerful than its predecessors.Pounded by Nazi bombers, Britain's factories would struggle to put the device into production.But America's factories could.For months, British leaders plotted to use the magnetron as a bargaining chip for American secrets in other fields.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided Britain should share its radar research with the US Then Winston Churchill took power, and decided that desperate times called for desperate measures.Nerve-wracking journey Britain would simply tell the Americans what they had, and ask for help.So in August 1940, a Welsh physicist named Eddie Bowen endured a nerve-wracking journey with a black metal chest containing a dozen prototype magnetrons.First, he took a black cab across London: the cabbie refused to let the clunky metal chest inside, so Bowen had to hope it wouldn't fall off the roof rack.Then, he took a long train ride to Liverpool, sharing a compartment with a mysterious, sharply dressed, military-looking man who spent the entire journey ignoring the young scientist and silently reading a newspaper.Then, he took a ship across the Atlantic.What if it were hit by a German U-boat?The Nazis couldn't be allowed to recover the magnetrons; two holes were drilled in the crate to make sure it would sink if the boat did.But the boat didn't.Image copyright MIT Museum Image caption MIT's Radiation Laboratory went on to spawn 10 Nobel laureates The magnetron stunned the Americans.Their research was years off the pace.President Roosevelt approved funds for a new laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - uniquely, for the American War effort, administered not by the military but a civilian agency.Industry got involved: the very best American academics were headhunted to join Bowen and his British colleagues.Patchy rollout By any measure, MIT's Radiation Laboratory - known as the Rad Lab - was a resounding success.It spawned 10 Nobel laureates.The radar it developed, detecting planes and submarines, helped to win the War.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Radar played a crucial role in helping Britain and her allies win World War Two But urgency in times of war can quickly be lost in times of peace.It seems obvious that civilian aviation would need radar too, given how quickly it was expanding.In 1945, at the War's end, US domestic airlines carried seven million passengers.By 1955, this figure had risen to 38 million.And the busier the skies, the more useful radar would be at preventing collisions.But rollout was slow and patchy.Some airports installed it; many didn't.In most airspace, planes weren't tracked at all.Pilots submitted their flight plans in advance, which should in theory ensure that no two planes were in the same place at the same time.But avoiding collisions ultimately came down to a four-word protocol: "see and be seen".Disastrous crash On 30 June 1956, two passenger flights departed Los Angeles Airport, three minutes apart: one was bound for Kansas City, one for Chicago.Their planned flight paths intersected above the Grand Canyon, but at different heights.Then thunderclouds developed.One plane's captain radioed to ask permission to fly above the storm.The air traffic controller cleared him to go to "1,000 on top" - 1,000ft above cloud cover.See and be seen.Nobody knows for sure what happened: planes then had no "black box" flight recorders, and there were no survivors.At just before 10:31, air traffic control heard a garbled radio transmission: "Pull up!We are going in..." Image copyright Alamy Image caption The 1956 crash was a watershed moment in the history of airline safety From the pattern of the wreckage, strewn for miles across the canyon floor, the planes seem to have approached each other at a 25-degree angle, presumably through a cloud.Investigators speculated that both pilots had been distracted by trying to find gaps in the clouds, so passengers could enjoy the scenery.Accidents happen.The question is what risks we're willing to run for economic benefits.More from Tim Harford: Why did we use leaded petrol for so long?How the smartphone became so smart Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How economics killed the antibiotic dream That question is becoming pertinent again with respect to crowded skies: many people have high hopes for unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.They're already being used for everything from film-making to crop-spraying.Companies such as Amazon expect the skies of our cities soon to be buzzing with grocery deliveries.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There have been occasions of near misses between drones and other aircraft Civil aviation authorities are grappling with what to approve.Drones have "sense-and-avoid" technology, and it's pretty good, but is it good enough?The crash over the Grand Canyon certainly concentrated minds.If technology existed to prevent things like this, shouldn't we make more effort to use it?Within two years, what's now known as the Federal Aviation Administration was born in the United States.And American skies today are about 20 times busier still.The world's biggest airports now see planes taking off and landing at an average of nearly twice a minute.Collisions are absurdly rare, no matter now cloudy the conditions.That's thanks to many things, but it's largely thanks to radar.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Could a hacker hijack your connected car?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What if your self-driving car took on a mind of its own?As more carmakers adopt "over the air (OTA)" software updates for their increasingly connected and autonomous cars, is the risk of hacker hijack also increasing?Imagine jumping in your car but being taken somewhere you didn't want to go - into oncoming traffic, say, or even over a cliff.That may seem like an extreme scenario, but the danger is real.Hackers showed two years ago that they could remotely take control of a Chrysler Jeep.And earlier this year, Tesla boss Elon Musk warned about the dangers of hackers potentially taking control of thousands of driverless cars."I think one of the biggest concerns for autonomous vehicles is somebody achieving a fleet-wide hack," he said, speaking at a National Governors Association meeting."In principle, if someone was able to... hack all the autonomous Teslas, they could say - I mean just as a prank - they could say 'send them all to Rhode Island' - across the United States."And that would be the end of Tesla, and there would be a lot of angry people in Rhode Island."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla can update its cars' software wirelessly, but what are the risks?Mr Musk insists that a kill switch "that no amount of software can override" would "ensure that you gain control of the vehicle and cut the link to the servers", thus preventing the Rhode Island scenario.As cars become more sophisticated, incorporating semi-autonomous features such as lane keeping, automatic braking and self parking, and their "infotainment" systems are connected to the internet, the amount of software code needed to control these systems is ballooning.Keeping all these software programs updated has typically required drivers to visit the dealership."For automakers and their customers alike, such repair-shop visits are a huge waste of time and money, and online updates can significantly reduce this," explains Dr Markus Heyn, board member of automotive electronics and processing supplier, Bosch.So OTA updates give manufacturers the ability to respond quickly as problems arise.And fixing bugs this way is safer than sending out physical USB sticks - which is what Chrysler did to patch its Jeep.Critics pointed out that criminals could have intercepted the USB sticks and sent out their own malware-infected versions instead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Can you be sure your self-driving car is taking you where you want to go?It's hardly surprising then that there are strong moves in the industry towards OTA updates, which mean that new features can be added, and bugs patched, in just an hour or two, all without inconvenience to the owner.General Motors, for example, says it expects to be updating engine software using its OnStar network by the end of this decade, thanks to a new electrical architecture for its vehicles.Meanwhile, Bosch is planning to start offering OTA updates through control units and in-car communication infrastructure developed in-house, distributing the updates via its "internet of things" (IoT) cloud.Research consultancy IHS Markit estimates that by 2022, 160 million vehicles globally will have the capability to upgrade their onboard computer systems over the air.Electric carmaker Tesla recently demonstrated the benefits of OTA updates when Hurricane Irma was threatening Florida early in September.As people were warned they should evacuate, Tesla owners were given an unexpected and potentially life-saving freebie - an extra 45 miles of range.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Florida Tesla owners fleeing Hurricane Irma were given extra range via an over-the-air update The ability to go further without a recharge was already built into the cars, but was unavailable to drivers until the company unlocked extra battery capacity."We have a certain number of cars which we sell at a 60kW [kilowatt] price point, but for reasons of manufacturing efficiency we install a 75kW battery, which people can upgrade," a spokeswoman explains."A customer wrote to us and asked if it would be possible to increase it temporarily as they were planning their route out of Florida."Tesla unlocked the extra power by sending an OTA update to the cars via wi-fi or 4G.But there's no doubt that OTA updates present a new set of risks.For a start, we've all, at one time or another, attempted to update the software on our computer or phone, only for the process to go wrong.An unusable car could be rather more of a problem than a "bricked" - or unusable - phone.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images In 2015, 15% of car recalls in the US were related to software errors, up from 5% four years before.When an update fails it's automatically re-sent, but this doesn't always have the desired effect.On one occasion early last year, a Tesla software update designed to add an "autopilot" feature is believed to have affected the climate control of thousands of vehicles.Then there is the risk of "man-in-the-middle" attacks - hackers intercepting the updates in transit.This is why extra special care is taken over OTA updates, says Robert Moran, an expert in car connectivity and security at NXP Semiconductors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption You wouldn't want hackers taking control of your car on this road...or any other for that matter "There are checks at each stage of the update process," he says."Updated software coming over the air is going to be received in parallel."Only once it's passed a number of security checks - Does it have validation?Is it from a trusted source?- is the new software actually used."It's at a different level to what we have with laptops today."Manufacturers are also addressing the hacker threat by isolating the various systems in the car so that, for example, the radio is isolated from the steering wheel, the powertrain from the brakes - each system protected by its own encryption."Ultimately, as cars have become more connected, it does potentially create a bigger target," admits Mr Moran, "and hackers have always altered their techniques as technology changes."But, he argues: "The fact that we can provide over-the-air updates is a security feature in itself, as it gives us the ability to respond and make changes."Carmakers know that consumer trust is crucial, so security it paramount.The big question is whether they are cleverer than the hackers.

Copley Center for Costume Design at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Deborah Nadoolman-Landis is well placed to offer an opinion.She's been a costume designer for more than 40 years and her work on Coming to America, the 1988 comedy starring Eddie Murphy, secured her an Oscar nomination.Image copyright Elizabeth Hotson Image caption Deborah Nadoolman-Landis designed the outfits for Raiders of the Lost Ark In the industry, she's affectionately known as the "Mother of Indiana Jones" for designing the outfits worn in Raiders of the Lost Ark."People are supposed to fall in love with the people on screen and when you fall in love with Indiana Jones you want something from the character.Memorabilia is an extension of falling in love with the film."It doesn't stop at cinema, she adds.Ms Nadoolman-Landis also designed the costumes for Michael Jackson's 1983 Thriller music video, which "everyone was obsessed with" at the time."Michael's red jacket ended up being sold for $1.2m (900,000)," she says.But not everything in the world of memorabilia costs the earth, says Jon Baddeley, head of Bonhams auction house in the UK.Granted, Bonhams New York sold the piano from the film Casablanca for $3.4m, and Mr Baddeley hopes to sell a Robby the Robot prop, used in the 1956 classic Forbidden Planet, for seven figures at an upcoming auction.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bonhams New York sold the piano from Casablanca for $3.4m But he says it is quite possible to start a memorabilia collection for free."The film posters and lobby cards made to advertise films in cinemas often get thrown away.So why not make friends with your cinema manager and ask for posters or cut-outs when you see a film you like?"So could today's rubbish be a future collector's item?An original poster for the 1933 monster adventure film King Kong can fetch around 70,000."Who knows?"says Mr Baddeley."But remember, whatever you buy you've got to live with it.Have it framed and enjoy it.If it goes up in value you've got a double whammy, if not, you've still got something you enjoy."At the auction, Stephen Lane, the head of Prop Store, gives me a whistle-stop tour of the day's top lots.He won't be giving anything away for free but says that, in amongst the stratospherically expensive nuggets of movie gold, there are some very affordable items.Image copyright Prop Store Image caption A creature costume from Aliens was sold for 50,000 "The lots start at 40 to 60.For that you'd be buying crew items or gifts, things like call sheets which were used in the production.It might not be quite as personal but it's still something from your favourite film."That's good news for first-time auction visitor and Blade Runner fan, Chris Dagger."I don't have a big budget, the most I can spend is around 500," concedes Mr Dagger."I've got my eye on the Blade Runner crew jacket.I've always been a fan of the film and with the new one coming out, I'd love to buy it."The jacket in question is dark maroon satin with the name "Tim" stitched onto the front.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: The firms that donate as many goods as they sell How do you like your wine - with a cork or screw-cap?Are changeable heels the end to women's sore feet?Do the colours you wear at work matter?"I don't have much chance of getting it," says Mr Dagger."There are people here with a lot of money to spend, a lot more than I've got, but we'll see."In the imposing auditorium of the BFI Imax the auction gets underway.Things don't look good for Chris.A single grey T-shirt, embossed with "Peace through superior firepower", which was worn in the film Aliens, is sold for 3,000.And a full alien creature costume from the same film fetches 50,000.Image copyright Elizabeth Hotson Image caption Chris Dagger bid for a Blade Runner crew jacket Chris holds his number "26" bidding card nervously, waiting for his lot to be called.The auctioneer announces a starting bid of 250, and within seconds Mr Dagger is pushed to his maximum bid of 500 for the Blade Runner jacket.There are no further bids in the auditorium, but there's an agonising wait as the auctioneer checks whether other offers have come in by phone or email.None have, and to his delight and astonishment, Mr Dagger gets what he came for.Out in the refreshment area, he takes a couple of deep breaths and poses for photos next to a poster for Blade Runner 2049, the film's soon-to-be released sequel."It's such an iconic film and if you're a fan you know all the trials and tribulations they went through to make it."And here we are, surrounded by posters for the current film.I'm just really happy, there's not much more I can say."With the 22% buyer's premium, VAT and shipping charges, the final bill is 700, which doesn't make the jacket a cheap purchase.But Chris says it was definitely worth it.
Why big brand perfumes may be losing their allure:::::Image copyright Gallivant Image caption Nick Steward is the founder of Gallivant fragrances Corporate giants such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal and Coty have dominated the fragrance market, but could that be about to change?"Everything smells the same - people are getting bored of the big brands and want something different," says Nick Steward, the London-based founder of a new fragrance brand, Gallivant.He is convinced that there is a growing appetite for "something more personal that other people don't have".Mr Steward decided to start his own company after several years as creative director of the trendy Paris house L'Artisan Parfumeur."I wanted to do something clever and interesting, avoiding all the froth, focused on the best materials," he says.He now sells his fragrances online and via specialist retailers in the US, Italy, Germany and as far away as Australia.Image copyright Gallivant Image caption Gallivant fragrances are smaller than the standard industry size The Gallivant range of unisex fragrances are inspired by and named after cities such as Tel Aviv and London.They are packaged in air-travel-friendly 30ml bottles - smaller than the standard industry sizes.Mr Steward says that also makes them more affordable, reflecting consumers' desire to have a variety of fragrances to choose from.Reception from both consumers and retailers has been positive since the launch earlier this year, but he admits the road to profitability will be a challenge: "It's a really tough business to make money in."He is seeking a slice of the fragrance market - worth about $27bn (20bn; 22bn) a year globally - but it is dominated by corporate giants such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal and Coty.Image copyright Chanel Image caption Chanel's latest campaign stars Kristen Stewart These firms spend tens of millions of dollars a year in a bid to make their fragrances seem impossibly alluring to consumers, using celebrities such as Kristen Stewart, star of the latest Chanel campaign, or Charlize Theron, who features in ads for Dior J'Adore.Seeing glamorous ads on TV, in the cinema or in magazines means consumers are more likely to try, if not buy, one of the hundreds of perfumes on the market.Despite the daunting competition, Michael Edwards, publisher of global perfume database Fragrances of the World, says some consumers are favouring niche and artisan fragrance brands like Gallivant because they offer something special that none of their friends will have.He believes that innovation in the sector is coming from smaller brands because the big players are afraid of taking risks.The big brands want a new launch to appeal to as wide a range of consumers as possible, meaning they often produce something "bland", he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coty, behind brands including Gucci Bloom, reported a loss in August "The future lies in bespoke - younger people want something of their own.While marketing is crucial, word of mouth is even more crucial," says Mr Edwards.The fact that some of the bigger names in the industry are struggling suggests he may be right.Even Coty - the New York beauty brand behind famous names such as Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Hugo Boss and Chloe - has faced headwinds this year.In August, it reported a surprise quarterly loss that was partly blamed on "materially" higher marketing costs for the launch of new fragrances, including Gucci Bloom and Hugo Boss Tonic.L'Oreal, which sells fragrances under brands including Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren and Diesel, also reported disappointing sales and profits for its most recent quarter.Image copyright Mike Masoni Image caption Michael Edwards founded the Fragrances of the World guide But Roshida Khanom, an analyst at market research firm Mintel, says the industry giants are not taking the threat from upstart rivals lying down.Chanel, one of the world's most well known perfume makers, has revamped its range, launching No5 L'Eau in time for the Christmas rush last year.The new version of Chanel's classic fragrance - aimed squarely at younger generations - helped boost sales of the No5 range by a fifth.At the same time, the French company also launched its first new fragrance in 15 years last month, Gabrielle, with a big-budget ad campaign.Image copyright Getty Images What do people want from a perfume?The experience of wearing the fragrance - not the bottle or the packaging - is still the most important thing for consumers, says Michael Edwards, publisher of global perfume database, Fragrances of the World.Most people want a scent that is "pretty easy to like", he says.A fragrance has to entice at first sniff with a compelling "top note", and convince the buyer that it will linger sufficiently long on his or her skin.Above all else, he says: "It must make the wearer feel special."Retailers will be hoping that the launch will help return the fragrance sector to modest growth in the UK after two years of what Ms Khanom calls "disappointing sales".Mintel estimates UK sales will be worth about 1.5bn this year, making it the fifth-biggest market globally behind Brazil, the US, Russia and France.As with other retail sectors, she says one of the problems is savvy consumers who try out products in a physical store but then go online to buy it for less.Manufacturers are spending more on the bottle and packaging, as well as marketing, in a bid to get consumers to buy their fragrances.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some consumers think celebrity fragrances are "tacky" But the power of another popular trick - releasing a fragrance emblazoned with the name of a celebrity, such as Britney Spears, Beyonce or Jennifer Lopez - appears to be waning.Mintel says that a third of consumers describe this approach as tacky."Celebrity fragrances are just not aspirational in the way they used to be," says Ms Khanom.Of course, for Gallivant's Mr Steward this is good news.But while some Gallivant buyers want it to remain a tiny brand only they know about for "bragging rights", Mr Steward says that is not sustainable."I can't live just selling five bottles a year."
Modernising female voice for Qatar:::::Image caption Sheikha Hind represents a young, modern face for the blockaded Qatari ruling family If the personal is political, then Sheikha Hind, a senior member of Qatar's ruling royal family, gives a very direct answer to her views on the end of the driving ban for women in Saudi Arabia."I have two asthmatic boys and when you need to take them in an emergency at 02:00 - and your husband is on a business trip... We're talking about safety.""It's a great decision," she says, as a parent as well as a driver, distancing herself from any suggestion that women should not have equal rights in such matters.Sheikha Hind, 33, is the sister of the ruler of the wealthy state of Qatar - a country currently at the centre of a tense blockade and Middle Eastern power struggle.If Qatar's neighbours want to isolate the country, Sheikha Hind is on a mission to reach out and present a distinctly modern, young and female face to the outside world.Image copyright Adrian Haddad Image caption Almost two-thirds of students in Qatar are women "When the blockade happened we were all shocked.We didn't see it coming."And, speaking in London, she says she wants to counter perceptions of her country being an "ultra-conservative" Muslim state.Her own background is determinedly international, having been a student at Duke University in the United States and at University College London in the UK.This exposed her to some of the narrow views held by young Westerners about the Arab world."When I was in America, I got a comment that I thought you lived in tents," she says."What I'd like people to understand is that we're as normal as you are."We might have different traditions and cultures, but that doesn't make us very different.We all want highly educated citizens.We all want to have opportunities for every single person in our country."Image caption Qatar has a policy of investing in education for a future "knowledge economy" Education has been a big deal for Qatar - including pouring huge amounts into building a campus for eight international and two Qatari universities.Sheikha Hind is now chief executive of the Qatar Foundation, the vehicle created almost 20 years ago for an epic-scale investment in education.It has the hard-headed ambition of turning Qatar into a "knowledge economy" built on a well-educated workforce - ready for when the income from gas and oil runs out."In the end, we're a very small country.If we can make sure that the majority of our residents are educated so that they can be active citizens, then we'll be satisfied.We still have a long way to go, but we've started."But education is about asking difficult questions.For instance, can students discuss the merits of democracy over an autocracy?"I'm sure they have those debates," she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Gulf state of Qatar has been transformed by the income from gas and oil "That's something we teach our students.You think for yourself, you listen to every side of an argument.We support that approach.""We have academic freedom in our campus and that encourages dialogue and any topic or issue," she says.Although she adds that in defining "democracy", there is a wide "spectrum" of meanings.In terms of women's access to education, she says that 65% of students in Qatar are women - and the current challenge is to recruit more men into higher education.She is from a line of strong women - daughter of the Sheikha Moza, mother of the current ruler and often described as one of the most influential women in the Middle East.Growing up in the centre of the country's ruling family, she says "work and personal life are not really divided".She is part of the next generation of Qatar's royal family, redefining the next stage of the country's development.Image copyright Education Above All Image caption Education Above All has been supporting education for refugees in Lebanon This will mean investing even more in education - and finding better ways to motivate wealthy young people who have grown up without any hardship to spur them on.Sheikha Hind says she is looking to develop different types of school to raise standards and to tackle the problem of motivation.The blockade has so far not stopped one of Qatar's biggest below-the-radar exports - education to some of the world's poorest countries and out-of-school refugees.Although Qatar has high profile "soft power" projects, not least hosting the World Cup, its extensive funding for education, including under the Education Above All banner, has often been curiously hidden away."It's a very cultural thing.It's also rooted in Islam.If you donate money, you don't put your name on it," she said."We're not very good at taking credit.It's something that we'll have to change and we'll have to talk about it," said Sheikha Hind.As with so many parts of this question of Qatar's identity, she says "the perception is very different from the reality".More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.
US business schools 'hurt by Trump immigration policies':::::Image copyright Nottingham Business School Image caption Nottingham Business School - part of Nottingham Trent University - has seen international student applicants increase by 25% Mention Nottingham in a conversation and for many people the first thing that comes to mind is Robin Hood.I've had the Disney movie song "Robin Hood and Little John walking through the forest" stuck in my head since visiting the city.But the story being told here today is very different from the fable of old.Instead of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, it's students hoping to get rich who are flocking to this city two hours north of London.Nottingham Business School - which is part of Nottingham Trent University - has seen a 25% rise in interest from international students this year.That's believed to be partially due to an unlikely source: Donald Trump.While many Americans might have voted for the president partly because they valued his business acumen, an unlikely casualty of his immigration policies is said to be American business schools.'Exaggerated' shift "One of the things we noticed post the [presidential] election in the US last November was a change in students' expressed intent to study in the US," says Sangeet Chowfla, the president and chief executive of the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC).The GMAC is the non-profit organisation that administers the GMAT, a standardised test most students around the world take to get into business school.It published a survey of 1,000 global business schools this month, which found that international student interest in American business schools had declined by nearly two-thirds since the 2016 presidential election.Meanwhile, international student interest in programs in Canada, for example, has increased by nearly the same amount.The same goes for programs in continental Europe and the UK.Image copyright GMAC Image caption International students have said the US election result impacted their application decision While that trend has been happening for some time, Mr Chowfla says he was surprised by the steep drop."The magnitude of the change was exaggerated this year," he says.Part of the decline was due to student concerns about immigration policies - most notably, the ability to get an H1B visa after graduating.The H1B is typically given to "skilled" immigrants to the US, like computer programmers, and 85,000 visas are awarded each year via a lottery system.It is often used by companies in Silicon Valley to bring in tech talent - but it has also been used by outsourcing companies.Critics, including President Trump, have said those companies use the program to hire foreign workers instead of Americans - and he's proposed reforming it.That's scared international students, particularly those pursuing business degrees, who use the programs as stepping stones to better or more well-paid careers.A global degree While the number of foreign business students in the US may be declining, for many American students, business remains a global enterprise.Monica Kelly is one of those students.Though she hails from Seattle, Washington, she's spent most of her career in Los Angeles."I was in a position where I reached senior management level and I was looking for a way to expand my global opportunities," she says.Monica decided that in order to seize those opportunities, she had to go abroad for business school.That's how she found herself at Nottingham.And she's not alone.At Nottingham, I spoke with two other students from India, and the program boasts a class made up of people from 104 countries.Almost all of them said business was an increasingly global endeavour.Because of that, they fretted they wouldn't be able to get international experience in the US, a country they feel has increasingly turned inwards.Image copyright David Baird Image caption NBS Dean Baback Yazdani said UK business schools suffered 5 years ago after new visa restrictions were introduced That they're attracted to a business school in the UK, however, is no accident."In the UK, we have gone through a period where the MBA [the main business school qualification] suffered quite a bit," says Baback Yazdani, the dean of Nottingham Business School.That was partially due to visa restrictions that were put in place five years ago, which limited the ability for graduate students to get post-study work visas.Since then, Nottingham has worked hard to build its program around "experiential learning" - meaning that in addition to traditional classes, students travel abroad to work for companies in places like Italy and Rome.The school also focused on helping students secure internships at companies that might sponsor them for visas, or that might be able to hire them in other parts of the world.Businesses close to Nottingham include Boots, which has merged with the pharmacy chain Walgreens in the US."Overall the MBAs are a saturated market - and it's a global market," says Mr Yazdani."There are very sophisticated consumers for this market.So they know what they want and they know it's everywhere.So they are looking for differentiators and value."Speaking of value - at an annual price of 16,500, or around $22,000 at today's exchange rates - the Nottingham program is under half what most students at US business schools end up paying per year.Lessons for the US?Today, there are more than 5,000 students in its various business degree courses.Image caption Nottingham is known for Robin Hood, who hid out in nearby Sherwood forest Nottingham's administration says that their pivot could possibly help US schools."My guess is that's probably happening now in the [US], and that the universities [there] will be going through the same trajectories," says Nottingham Business School lecturer Phil Considine."We're kind of five years ahead of them."In Nottingham's atrium, banners are strung from the rafters welcoming international students, who start classes today.Looking out through the school's windows, you can see the beginning of the famed Sherwood Forest - where story has it Robin Hood hid out with his merry men.For US business schools, who might not be feeling too merry, "stealing" a lesson from Nottingham might be a good way to make it through leaner times.
Can ice structures solve a Himalayan water crisis?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Engineers in the Himalayan Desert are coming up with solutions which could help the world's water crisis.Credit: Natural History Unit It's midnight at 3,500m (11,000ft) above sea level, the coldest time of the day, in one of the coldest places on the planet.In the middle of winter, temperatures here plunge to -30C (-22F).A group of 10 volunteers are gathering; putting into place a plan to solve a water crisis in Ladakh, the northern most region of India, in the high Himalayas.They are building manmade ice structures, more than 30m tall, that they hope will melt early in the spring and give villagers and their farms the water they need.The ice structures are the brainchild of engineer Sonam Wangchuk.Born in Ladakh, he has worked for several years to find innovative solutions to everyday problems facing the local communities."We tend to get the solutions created in New York or New Delhi, but they don't work for us here in the mountains.I believe mountain people have to find solutions for themselves," he says.Image copyright Rolex/ Stefan Walker Image caption Sonam Wangchuk is the inventor of the ice structures Villagers in Ladakh face harsh living conditions.Road blockages in the winter months mean they are cut off from the rest of the country for most of winter.Mr Wangchuk says the effects of climate change are adding to the problem.He says there are signs that global warming is damaging the delicate climatic water balance in the Hindu Kush Himalayan range."We can see that the glaciers are receding, to higher altitudes.There is less water in spring, but in the summer months we have experienced dangerous flooding.The water flow in the valley has become erratic," he explains.Mr Wangchuk was inspired by a fellow engineer working in the region, Chewang Norphel.Mr Norphel had created flat artificial glaciers at heights of 4,000m (13,123ft) and above.But the villagers were reluctant to climb up to those levels.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Life in Ladakh has always depended on glacial melt-water Mr Wangchuk says he was crossing a bridge when the idea for his ice structures crystallised."I saw that there was ice under the bridge, which at 3,000m (9,842ft) was the warmest and lowest altitude in the whole area," he recalls."And this was in May.So I thought - direct sunlight makes the ice melt, but if we protect it from the sun, we can store ice right here."Ladakh Remote villages at an altitude of 2700m (8860ft) to 4000m (13,123ft) above sea level Population of almost 300,000 Winter desert temperatures as low as -30C (-22F) Meagre rainfall of on average only 100 mm annually And so, in 2013, he and his students from the Secmol Alternative School began to create prototypes of the ice structures near the village of Phyang.They call the structures "stupas" because they bear resemblance to Tibetan religious stupas - elegant hemispherical or conical structures with pointed tops that contain relics, such as the remains of Buddhist monks.The technology behind the ice structures is simple.Pipes are initially buried under the ground, below the frost line, before the final section of the pipe then rises vertically.Due to the difference in height, temperature, and the gravitational force, pressure builds up in the pipe.The stream water eventually flows up and out from the pipe's raised tip like a fountain.The sub-zero air freezes the water to gradually form a pyramid like structure.Image copyright Sonam Wangchuk Image caption In late spring, the melting ice stupa provides water for the crops "We are freezing water that goes unused in winter and, because of the geometric shape it doesn't melt till late spring," says Mr Wangchuk.In late spring the artificial glacier starts to melt and water can be used for drip-irrigation of crops.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.As the ice structures look like the familiar religious stupas, Mr Wangchuk believes that this leads to a better sense of ownership amongst the locals.After some initial success with one ice structures in 2014 the nearby Phyang Monastery got involved.The Buddhist monks asked the team to build 20 ice stupas.A successful crowd funding campaign raised $125,200 (96,500).This money funded a 2.3km (1.43 mile) pipeline which brought water down to Phyang.Mr Wangchuk claims this pipeline can support at least 50 ice stupas.Mr Wangchuk is also now helping to build ice stupas near the winter sports resort town of St Moritz in Switzerland.Image copyright Rolex/ Stefan Walker Image caption The ice stupa team are working to made many more of the structures After an initial prototype is built and tested, the Swiss want to expand the project to counter the phenomenon of fast-melting glaciers in the upper reaches of the Swiss mountains."In exchange for the ice stupa technology, the Swiss will share their expertise and experience in sustainable tourism development with the people of Phyang, to revive the dying economy of the village," says Mr Wangchuk.But he feels positive about the future."We want to train enthusiastic youth through our university, and eventually we are hoping to create a whole generation of ice or glacier entrepreneurs.''
What will stop these self-driving lorries colliding?:::::Image copyright Scania Image caption Scania believes 5G could improve communications between "platooning" lorries What impact could 5G - the new high-speed mobile technology being trialled around the world - have on the way we work and play?Swedish transport company Scania believes lorries could use far less fuel if they drove much closer together, controlled by wirelessly communicating onboard computers.But to prevent these "platooning" lorries crashing into each other, you'd better be sure your communications are fast and reliable.So Scania is working with Ericsson on trials of the new 5G (fifth generation) wireless broadband technology, due to be rolled out globally in 2020.It promises much faster data transfer speeds, greater coverage and more efficient use of the spectrum bandwidth."Platooning works very well with wi-fi, but in dense traffic situations with many vehicles communicating, 5G is designed to offer more reliable communication," says Andreas Hoglund, Scania's senior engineer for intelligent transport systems.This is because 5G direct communication is designed to handle fast moving objects and congestion more efficiently, he says."Faster communication will make it possible to reduce the distance between vehicles in the platoon, which might further reduce the air drag and give positive effects on fuel consumption," he explains.This could help create "a more efficient, greener" world.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: What is 5G?5G is designed to accommodate the growing number of devices reliant on a mobile internet connection - from fridges to cars - and is 10 times faster than the highest speed 4G can manage."It will enable a lot of applications which were unthinkable before," says Mischa Dohler, professor in wireless communications at King's College London.South Korea has plans to implement 5G for the Winter Olympics in February 2018, giving visitors access to virtual reality (VR) content on their mobiles.One of the UK's first 5G test-beds is in Brighton, where non-profit innovation hub, Digital Catapult Centre, has just completed a series of workshops for small businesses."Hypothetically, 5G is fast enough to download a 100GB 4K movie in two-and-a-half minutes," says Richard Scott, innovation manager at Digital Catapult."But it isn't just about speed - [5G] has specific features that will unlock and enable new technologies."Chiefly, these include fewer dropped connections and lower latency - the time it takes for data to be stored or retrieved.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Wi-fi is fine if you are sitting with a few people in a meeting, or moving slowly around indoors," explains Rahim Tafazolli, head of Surrey University's 5G Innovation Centre."However, once you start to move quickly and the number of people increases to more than 10 - at Waterloo Station, for example - you need to have a system that can hand over connection between radio cells without causing a drop in signal, and which can accommodate several people simultaneously."Wi-fi can't do that."This is because every wi-fi signal has a defined range, whereas 5G will be flexible, enabling mobile devices to switch automatically between the various newly available frequencies.One frequency will be for long-range connections, across rural areas for example; one will be for urban environments, providing high numbers of users with high-speed connectivity; and there will also be a high-capacity frequency for densely populated areas, such as sports stadiums and railway terminals.This flexibility will lead to "an ever-expanding array of new business services", Mr Tafazolli believes, and could be critical to the success of autonomous vehicles and the internet of things.Faster wireless connectivity should also give VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies a boost, argues Digital Catapult's Mr Scott.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Faster mobile connectivity could greatly improve virtual reality experiences "If you have a very detailed, immersive VR experience and you try to run it over a mobile headset currently, there is enough latency... that it makes you feel sick," he explains.So high-quality VR experiences rely on headsets being "tethered" to a computer, which provides the necessary computing power.5G offers the opportunity to recreate high-quality experiences on the move."It could enable you to have an experience comparable with home gaming on your mobile," says Mr Scott, "allowing you to compete or collaborate with other people in real time."Andy Cummins of Brighton-based digital agency, Cogapp, says 5G will allow his firm to create much more exciting AR and VR content for visitors to museums and galleries."Without [5G] these types of experiences... would at best seem laggy and unintuitive," he says.And Tim Fleming, founder of Future Visual, another Brighton company preparing to trial 5G, says: "We are very interested in in-store retail VR experiences, and creating a flagship VR experience that can be taken to any location."At the moment we have to use a dedicated PC, but with 5G you just need a headset and a mobile device.The heavy lifting is done in the cloud.That's very interesting."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 5G enthusiasts say it could underpin smart cities and augmented reality services Of course, 5G roll-out is not without its technical challenges.Installing all the base stations and antennae is very expensive, and many of today's devices will not be compatible with the new technology.It is not clear at the moment who is going to pay for it.But Ericsson's head of 5G commercialisation, Thomas Noren, is confident that 5G services will be cheaper to run because the network will be more energy efficient and production and operational costs will be lower.There is clearly still much detail to iron out, but research consultancy Ovum predicts that there will be 389 million 5G subscriptions globally by the end of 2022.Users still struggling with patchy 4G coverage maybe forgiven for being a little sceptical about the ambitious claims being made for 5G.But the potential to transform a number of businesses - and create many new ones - is clearly there.
Monarch's rise and fall charts British holiday trends:::::Image copyright Globus Image caption Monarch was originally part of Globus - which pioneered package holiday tours Monarch, which has just gone into bankruptcy, was part of a travel group whose origins reach back 90 years, long before the days of mass air travel.Through the heady 1970s and 80s, when foreign package holidays were the height of fashion, to the new era of relentless competition from budget airlines, Monarch still plied the skies.But by 2017 fierce competition had made the business untenable.And on 2 October it ceased operating.A history of Monarch In 1928 an enterprising young Swiss Italian, Antonio Mantegazza, spotted a gap in the market.He realised tourists visiting his idyllic corner of Europe might pay to be ferried across Lake Lugano.So he bought a gondola and launched a tourism business that would eventually become travel giant Globus.Forty years later in 1968 the Mantegazza family spotted a new way to ferry tourists their way.They decided to back a new airline being founded by British businessmen, Bill Hodgson and Don Peacock, that would bring British holidaymakers to Europe's beauty spots.Monarch was launched with just two planes operating from a hangar at Luton Airport, and a new era of package holidays took off.Bill Hodgson's daughter, Mary-Anne Hardie, remembers the airline in those days as "one big happy family".While her father was managing director, her mother designed the first uniforms for cabin crew, in canary yellow.The family tested the in-flight meals at dinner time at home.Image copyright MOnarch Image caption Monarch introduced the British public to the affordable package holiday By the 1970s package holidays had really taken off.Brits embraced the chance to take an exotic continental break instead of shivering with a thermos flask in Skegness.Monarch was aimed, not at the wealthy, but at ordinary families: "The man who came home on a Friday and put money in a jam jar to save for a summer holiday," says Ms Hardie.In those days flying felt like a luxury, with coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon and free drinks on the menu.But times were anything but easy.The oil price spike of the early seventies sent another big name in package holidays, Court Line, into administration.Monarch might have gone under too; Miss Hardie remembers her father being "very stressed".But the attitude in the industry was of mutual support says Ms Hardie, "not as cut-throat as it is now" and Monarch survived.It even took on some of Court Line's redundant staff.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Package holidays to the Med have become a summer staple for many British families In the 1980s, while package holidays remained popular, there was a growing market for independent travel, with holiday-makers opting to mix and match their own flights and hotels.Monarch responded by offering its first scheduled flights from Luton to Minorca in 1985.From then on it was competing directly with other carriers, not just as part of a tour operator.Mr Hodgson had retired by then, one of his few regrets being that he'd bought the BAC 1-11 aircraft, that were so much noisier than the Boeing 720 "whispering giants" he'd bought before, says his daughter.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Benidorm became one of Spain's most popular resorts for British visitors In 1995 newly founded low-cost airline easyJet set up its own base alongside Monarch in Luton and the budget airline industry grew rapidly, taking couples on weekend citybreaks, stag and hen parties to ever more exotic destinations, to ski resorts in winter, the beach in summer."With the low cost airlines it was easier to book direct; that's when Monarch started to struggle really," says Ms Hardie.The focus moved away from customer service towards those who offered the cheapest fare.For a while there was room for everyone.And by the time of the financial crisis in 2008 Monarch had 32 aircraft flying to over 100 destinations in India, Africa, Caribbean, United States and Europe.But it couldn't last."The competition was relentless.It was expanding.It had very deep pockets even back when I was running Monarch seven or eight years ago," recalls Tim Jeans, the firm's former managing director."There were warning signs then and I think subsequently the market has only got more difficult."Competition is all fair and normally very, very good for consumers, but ultimately competition can be unsustainable.And the demise of Monarch is a direct result of that," Mr Jeans says.Image copyright Gareth Cattermole Image caption In 2007 Monarch teamed up with record label Hed Kandi to offer less family-oriented holidays to Ibiza Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Monarch's Managing Director at the time was Tim Jeans (L) In 2011 the Arab Spring pushed up oil prices once again.Over several years the Mantegazza family poured money in to patch up Monarch's balance sheet.But finally with a gaping deficit in the company's pension plan, in 2014, the family had had enough.They put a final 50m into the company they had owned for half a century, and sold it on to turnaround specialists Greybull Capital.The company abandoned long haul routes and 700 jobs were cut.It turned out to be only a temporary reprieve.Even a hefty investment from Greybull wasn't enough to bring Monarch up to fighting weight to take on the budget carriers.Terrorist attacks in Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia, the migrant crisis in southern Europe and more recently the weakness of the pound following the EU referendum vote have all kept UK holiday-makers away from some of Monarch's most popular destinations.On 2 October 2017 the airline's accountants KPMG announced the business would close and authorities launched the biggest peacetime repatriation of Brits to bring Monarch's last 110,000 passengers home.But the airline itself has run out of runway.
100 Women: Do women on boards increase company profits?:::::"Having women on company boards leads to better financial performance" came the headlines from report after report, highlighting a business statistic guaranteed to capture the imagination and prompt debate.What better way to encourage companies to focus on equality and diversity than to make them think of their bottom line?In the UK, the 30% Club was set up in 2010 with the aim of having women make up at least 30% of the members on every board.In the US, the Thirty Percent Coalition - a group of people who are chief executives and chairs of their companies - was created to achieve the same thing.Of course, there are many other - and some say better - reasons to argue for gender equality, but we wanted to look at whether this broadly accepted claim is true - does having more women on the board really mean the company makes more money?Academics have warned against jumping to simple conclusions.A report published by Credit Suisse last year said companies with at least one woman director received a better return on their investments compared with companies with all-male boardrooms.They say companies where women made up at least 15% of senior management were 50% more profitable than those where fewer than 10% of senior managers were female.But Prof Alice Eagly, at Northwestern University in the US, says many of the studies commissioned by corporations are "naive" as they don't consider other variables.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some European countries have introduced quotas for female board members She explains that more sophisticated pieces of analysis carried out by academics have shown very small positive correlations between female board members and financial success.But this is an average - in some companies the relationship was neutral and in some it was negative.And proving causation is far harder.It is difficult to say that it is having more women on boards that makes companies do better, rather than other factors - something corporate reports acknowledge.This is because companies with more women on boards are different in other ways, too, according to Prof Eagly.For example, firm size seems to be one of the most significant factors in determining profitability.And larger companies are likely to employ more women at every level.More innovative companies were more likely to use their talent effectively, regardless of gender.And companies that were already more profitable may have been more able to focus efforts on diversity, she says.A study looking at the gender make-up of the top management of the US's biggest firms, not only their board members, found female representation in top management improves firm performance but only in companies that are "focused on innovation".'Add women and stir' And, interestingly, female board members appear to have more of a positive impact on their company's performance in countries where women have more equal rights and treatment overall.It looks like there is a relationship between more successful companies and those with more women in senior positions in general, but it's not enough to simply "add women and stir", as Prof Robin Ely at Harvard Business School puts it.Another study from a group of German, Dutch and Belgian researchers found "the mere representation of females on corporate boards is not related to firm financial performance if other factors are not considered".It relies on there being a good company culture too.If women are in the minority in a room that is hostile to them, they are unlikely to be able to have a positive effect and that applies to other kinds of diversity too, the study suggests.Focusing on numbers without also addressing structural diversity issues is not enough, according to Prof Ely.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In the biggest US companies on the stock market, around 16% of board seats are held by women Looking at how many spaces on a board are filled by women doesn't tell you how influential the board is, and it doesn't tell us whether those women are being listened to and allowed to have an impact, Prof Ely points out, as "not all spots on a board are created equal".There is some evidence that having three women on a board of 12 to 15 people is the tipping point for them to actually be heard and able to have an influence at all.So there are good arguments for the 30% rule - it just doesn't necessarily translate directly to profits.In fact Corinne Post, a professor of organisation management at Lehigh University, says that board members don't have a direct influence on the bottom line of a company, but they do have a greater influence on corporate social responsibility.She found that there was a five times stronger correlation between a company having female board members and stronger performance when it comes to ensuring they are environmentally friendly as a company, or involve themselves in philanthropy for example, than the correlation between female board members and profits.Profitability is highly complex and there's even evidence that chief executives might not have much of an influence on company profits."In companies with any women on their board at all, they tend to have between one and three - are you really saying the gender of three people on a board is going to have an impact on the bottom line?"Prof Ely asks.For Northwestern's Prof Eagly, the most pertinent question is why we would need evidence women bring in more money than men, before they are given equal status on boards."Why should you rule out 50% of the population from important jobs.It's about social justice not about profits."Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
