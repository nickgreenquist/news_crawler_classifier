Audible’s new romance audiobooks service uses machine learning to jump to the sex scenes:::::Lets admit it: you probably arent reading that romance novel for the plot.Or its literary value.Audible knows this, and is today launching a new collection of romance-themed audiobooks that come with a handy feature that lets you skip right to the action.Called Take Me To The Good Part, the feature will fast-forward you to the steamy sections of the audiobook, says Audible.The feature was built in response to romance reader and listener feedback, the company notes.And Audible has doubled down on these customers desire to do away with the pretense that theyre actually interested in reading by debuting Take Me To The Good Part in over 100 Audible Romance package titles.The company plans to bring the technology to more selections over time, it says.The feature is part of a new package of books under the Audible Romance brand, which is being sold as an add-on to an Audible membership for $6.95 per month, or as a standalone service for $14.95 per month.The package includes access to thousands of romance audiobooks, including best sellers and Audible Originals.Theres no limit on how many you can read monthly, either, as with Audibles main subscription.Participating authors include Nora Roberts, Sylvia Day, Debbie Macomber, Robyn Carr, and others.Theres technology under the hood thats powering Audibles ability to find the good parts.Audible is using machine learning to identify key words and phrases, as well as groups of words, in order to determine where things get hot and heavy.The company has even gone so far as to identify 10 type of so-called good parts, such as flirty banter, first meeting, first kiss, and one it dubs hot, hot, hot aka the sex scenes.But just like how porn often drives technological innovations that later become mainstream like adoption of the VCR back in the day, for example we can only hope that this machine learning technology is later rolled out to all digital books, audio and otherwise, to classify scenes that are also good parts, but for non-romantic reasons.Along with the Romance package and its flagship feature, Audible has also rolled out a way to classify books by level of steaminess.(You know, so you can find those with more good parts.)Its illustrated steaminess meter ranks books on a scale that goes from sweet to simmering to sizzling to hot damn and o-o-omg.Yes, really.And you can delve into your particular fetishes micro-genres more easily too, as the new Audible Romance service can identify 32 of these romance sub-genres and 122 story and character tropes that will let you find those that are a direct match with your interests.The program is live now and includes a free trial.
120K Instagram posts by Russian election attackers reached 20M Americans:::::Facebook detailed the extent of Russias election interference campaign on Instagram today during its congressional hearing.Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said that 120,000 posts by Russian election attackers reached 16 million Americans from October through the election, and the posts reached an additional 4 million Americans prior to October.Thats on top of the 126 million Americans reached by Russian election propaganda on Facebook.Its unclear if these two groups overlap, but if not that would bring the total number to 146 million Americans.Thats a big climb from the original 10 million figure Facebook originally announced as the audience of Russian election interference.For context, yesterday Twitter said that its investigation had found 2700 accounts tied to Russia election interference, which was a steep increase from the 200 in initially announced last month.And today it noted that it deleted 106 accounts that sent over 700 vote-by-text tweets, which is an example of criminal voter suppression since you cant actually vote over SMS.Perhaps the next investigation for congress will involve US mobile telecoms, and seek to find out just how many people actually tried to vote by text.Stretch admitted that Facebooks data from before October is less complete.And Stretch, Twitter general counsel Sean Edgett, and Googles director of law enforcement and information security Richard Salgado all agreed that their investigations are ongoing so they cant be sure theyve identified all active measures of disinformation implemented by the Russians.Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch
Markforged raises $30 million from industrial investors:::::When Greg Mark takes his 3D printer to VCs he gets blank stares.The Boston-based CEO of Markforged, a 3D printing company that specializes in printing carbon fiber and metals, has found that few of them could understand his technology.Thats why he turned to Microsoft Ventures, Posche, and Siemens-backed Next 47 for his next $30 million for his Series C. These industry-backed VCs understood the problems associated The company is currently delivering a system for complete metal forging.The system, which involves putting metal into a very powerful microwave, is a hit with industrial partners but is confusing to those who think 3D printing is basically teaching a robot to squirt out Yoda heads.The company has raised a total of $57 million since launch.The company is profitable and is selling printers faster than it can make them with revenue growth at 300 percent.There are a number of other metal solutions on the market including massive systems from 3D Systems designed for industrial use.Markforged makes a nearly desktop-sized 3D printer and has discovered that its customers are printing finished parts in metal and factory jigs for CNC cutting and part holding in carbon fiber.By integrating both metal and plastic into the workflow they are able to reduce the times it takes to get to a finished part.
Life is getting easier for men for two reasons — and startups, and investors, are on it:::::Its never been a better time to be a man who privately suffers erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation or hair loss.Before you roll your eyes, that is a lot of men.They are not the silver-haired septuagenarians depicted in drug advertisements, either.Approximately 25 percent of men with male pattern baldness begin shedding their locks before they reach the age of 21, says the American Hair Loss Association.Another stat that might surprise: According to the Cleveland Clinic, as many as 52 percent of men experience erectile dysfunction, with 40 percent of men age 40 affected.As for premature ejaculation, it may impact upwards of one in three men, estimates the Mayo Clinic.So why are things looking up for this large yet quietly suffering demographic?Two things: changes to telemedicine laws, and expiring patents, both of which are about to make it a whole lot easier and cheaper to obtain pills and other medications that no one seems to want to talk very publicly about.Lets take telemedicine first.Thanks to some recently updated telehealth laws, roughly 80 percent of U.S. states now enable companies and health service providers to offer and receive reimbursement for telehealth technology that does not rely on, or mandate, in-person visits.This is a big deal given that insurers resisted paying for these services for years after their introduction, arguing it wasnt clear what qualified as a telehealth visit or whether doctors should submit telehealth claims for every patient phone call, among other concerns.Many of these insurers have changed their tune owing to rising demand, including in categories where online questionnaires are essentially as effective as face-to-face visits.They also recognize the benefits of seeing their rural members access services that might be hard to reach otherwise.In fact, in the last year, every state but Connecticut and Massachusetts has made substantive legal changes to how telehealth services are delivered, including, in many cases, making it possible to receive a prescription by answering a short online survey.Its a powerful shift, especially combined with expiring patents.Why, exactly?Because drugs fall in price 60 percent, routinely when a drug that was once sold exclusively by the firm that developed it, is sold in a generic form after the patent for that branded drug expires.Thats whats about to happen to Pfizer, whose patent on Viagra doesnt expire until 2020 but which struck a deal a few years ago with generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals that allows Teva to launch a copycat version of the popular erectile dysfunction drug on December 11 less than two months from now.The opportunity creating by these two trends is not lost on startup founders or investors.Just yesterday, TechCrunch profiled one newly venture-backed company called Roman thats beginning to package and send off Viagra, Cialis, and generic versions of erectile dysfunction drugs to customers who fill out information for a doctor to review online.Another new brand, Lemonaid Health, make it easy to have prescriptions filled online for erectile dysfunction as well as birth control and a range of other issues that people would rather not have to see their doctor about, from acne to sinus infections.Now another brand, Hims, is today taking the wraps off its similar, but broader-based mission of becoming a mens wellness company, starting with hair products centered around prescription medications that its making easier, and, it says, cheaper, to acquire.Order a $40 kit from Hims, for example, and youll find finasteride, a medication in pill form thats used to treat male pattern hair loss.(Just as Pfizer has enjoyed a stranglehold on Viagra since the late 90s, finasteride was exclusively sold until three years ago by the drug giant Merck under the brand Propecia.Today, other drug companies are selling generic versions of Propecia under different names, and Hims is making it easy to access one of them.)Customers of Hims will also find in their kit minoxidil, which was formerly sold exclusively by Johnson & Johnson as Rogaine; a DHT shampoo, for keeping hair on ones head; and supplements that promise to make customers hair thicker, their nails stronger, and their skin smoother.Perhaps unsurprisingly, these kits arrive in the kind of elegant and sustainable packaging thats become a priority for millennials.Hair loss, as you might imagine, is just a starting point for the startup, which was incubated at a San Francisco-based startup studio called Atomic, and just closed on $7 million in Series A funding from Thrive Capital, Harrys (the shave kit company), Forerunner Ventures, SV Angel, Amity Supply and M.C.Ventures.As Atomic cofounder and now Hims CEO Andrew Dudum explains it, his 10-person company doesnt want people to come here, get a drug, then never talk with us again.This is a wellness brand intended to serve our customers for multiple decades, he says.Maybe you come for hair loss products initially, but you come back for sexual wellness products, then cholesterol wellness products.We want to grow with you as different challenges arise.If Hims can offer men products men were loath to ask for at less cost than they might normally pay for a doctors visit, or even just a trip to the pharmacy all the better.Its why you should expect more of the same from other startups spying the same opportunity.In fact, users may be overwhelmed soon with companies pushing the male equivalent of a Goop or Glossier.Given their choices before uncomfortable conversations, surreptitious Google searches this should be a good thing.Well see.Stay tuned.
Clutter, the on-demand storage company, will now offer in-city moving:::::Moving is one of the most stressful life events you can go through.But Clutter, the on-demand storage startup based in NYC, is looking to make that a little more pleasant.Today, Clutter is announcing its expansion into the world of moving, offering in-city moving for $65/mover/hour.The company currently employs more than 270 people, many of whom are W2 movers who handle Clutters on-demand storage service.That service allows users to go on the web or place a call to Clutter to select a storage plan, with options for item storage, or storage that would fit the contents of a garage, studio, 1BR, or entire home.After the user selects their plan, they schedule a time for Clutter movers to come by their place and pack up their stuff.Clutter handles everything, from the bubble wrap to the photos cataloging items to communicating the status of the storage process to the user.For example, Clutter lets users know during the actual packing process that their storage space is nearing 75 percent full, as the Clutter mover app measures items as theyre photographed.Given the companys expertise in handling your real-world items, it only makes sense that the company would get into the moving game.In fact, some users were purchasing a month worth of storage and labor in order to effectively hack the Clutter system to work for moving, according to founder and CEO Ari Mir.The key to five-star service is to say yes as much as possible, said Mir.When people asked us to help them move, it pained us to say no.'Today, the company no longer has to.Customers interested in moving with Clutter can simply hit up the website and answer a questionnaire, or call Clutter to talk through their inventory.Historically, taking inventory and getting a quote are the biggest pain points of using a moving company.Oftentimes, the math of the price is convoluted, with different fees based on the amount of flights that need to be climbed, the time spent using the truck, the weight of various items, and more.Beyond that, folks still have a hard time relaying the exact volume of their items no matter how specific they try to be, which usually results in the originally quoted price jumping up to more than was expected.Clutter wants to counter that with simple, upfront pricing of $65/mover/hour.After the call to take inventory, Clutter will assign the number of movers it thinks you need.From there, you are completely in charge of the situation.Clutter will do as much or as little as youd like, from packing and unpacking to simply showing up, carrying your items, and dropping them off at your new place.Clutter has raised $96.3 million, according to CrunchBase, and currently serves seven markets.
Robinhood stock trading comes to web with finance news for its 3M users:::::You know whats cool?Not just being worth over $1 billion, but saving your customers $1 billion.Today, zero-fee stock trading app Robinhood announced that its hit 3 million registered accounts, $100 billion transacted in its app, and $1 billion in saved commissions considering competitors like E*Trade cost $7 per trade.And now, Robinhood is getting a web version where beyond swapping stocks, you can research them with its financial news feed, check analyst buy-sell ratings, and compare them with its playlist-style Collections.Long-standing competitors like Scottrade might cram a ton of data onto a web page, but that doesnt necessarily teach you financial literacy.Thats something Robinhood users need as half of them are first-time traders.Co-founder Baiju Bhatt tells me If the goal is to actually make people learn about investing, get better at it, be informed, I think our approach is the best one out there.Robinhoods $110 million raise at a $1.3 billion valuation from April has clearly been put to swift use.But the web launch actually harkens back to Robinhoods original mission.Back in 2013 before it raised its seed round with the intention of letting you trade stocks for free, Robinhood wanted to be a crowdsourced investment advice platform.With the new features like the ability to see the average price Robinhood users paid for a stock and whether its popular on the app, Robinhood is starting back down the path to social fintech.The web apps design was based on a major insight from Robinhoods research.When young people are investing in the stock market, their behaviors are much closer to how people navigate products like Spotify or Amazon, rather than traditional investing products says Bhatt [Disclosure: I knew the startups co-founders from college a decade ago].That led Robinhood to build Collections that group stocks by vertical into sortable playlists so if you want to find real estate companies with Buy ratings that are popular on Robinhood, you can find ones youve never heard of.Meanwhile, Robinhoods web home page displays a personalized news feed of finance headlines about the stocks you trade.To support Amazon-style comparison shopping, Buy and Sell ratings come with breakdowns of the bull and bear cases provided by Morning Star.As an app, Robinhood was far ahead of the pack, but being on web will expose it to more competition.It might even wake up some sleeping giants who wrote the startup off as just a mobile toy.New mobile trading apps like Piggy are popping Meanwhile, opening stock trading on the web opens up new security threats.The startup will have to keep everyones money locked up tight, as a breach could ruin the trust its built.But perhaps more impressive than all the new stats and features is the fact that Robinhood has made good on its promise to use technology to make stock trading so efficient that it doesnt have to charge users.While E*Trade has 3600 employees to support its 3.3 million users, Robinhood supports 3 million traders with just 100 employees.By swapping heavy-overhead sales offices for a lean crew of engineers.Robinhood brought commissions down to zero where the dinosaurs cant compete.
Shoppable video startup Cinematique has a new CEO and $1.4M in new funding:::::Cinematique has a new CEO investor and entrepreneur Paul Dawalibi.The startup describes its product as enabling touchable video.In other words, when youre watching a Cinematique-powered video, you can tap or click on different items to save them and learn more later, and in some cases buy the featured product.Dawalibi (whose long rsum includes a stint as VC at the Canadian affiliate of Guy Kawasakis Garage Technology Ventures) said he was initially introduced to Cinematique as a potential investor.My initial reaction was, God, this is so obvious,' he said.All videos are going to be touchable and shoppable.I just think theres going to be no logical reason not to enable this on any branded video online.However, Dawalibi said the companys investors asked him to do more than write a check they wanted him to take over as chief executive.The goal, he said, is to turn this into the next billion dollar business, put the whole thing on steroids.Were going to double down on existing companies where we do well, but also pursue new markets and all kinds of new partners, he said.Were going to bring this to the masses in a bigger way.For example, Cinematique says it will explore expansion into industries like education, automotive, travel, lifestyle and home.To fuel these plans, the startup has also raised $1.4 million in additional funding led buy Pumori Group, bringing its total funding to more than $6.8 million.Im not the biggest proponent or fan of raising zillions of dollars as quickly as possible, Dawalibi said.Instead, hed like to see Cinematique hit some key targets before going out to raise a larger round in 12 to 18 months.Co-founder Kyle Heller will continue in his role as chief strategy officer.Dawalibi described his relationship with Heller as very symbiotic, as Heller leads the product team in Los Angeles while Dawalibi builds out the sales and marketing efforts in New York.Pauls commitment to our values and compelling strategic vision for the company is exactly what Cinematique needs as we enter our next chapter, Heller said in the announcement.I look forward to working alongside him and the rest of our team in my ongoing role as chief strategy officer.
Amazon adds an AR shopping feature to its iOS app:::::Amazon today is introducing a new feature called AR View that lets customers visualize online products in their own living space, using their smartphone camera.Launched today in the Amazon app for iOS devices, AR View offers the ability to view thousands of products for the home or office including furniture, electronics, toys, games, home dcor and more in augmented reality.The retailer before has dabbled with using AR technology in its app, but only in the form of AR stickers.These shoppable stickers were not that useful, as they represented a limited product set and were designed in an almost cartoonish way with big white borders that made them seem more like real stickers.But many other retailers have pressed forward with AR implementations, especially for shopping furniture something its hard to buy online, as its difficult to imagine if the item will really look right in your home.Often, people have preferred to shop furniture in retailers showrooms where they can see it placed inside finished rooms, and alongside other decorative items like lamps and rugs.Augmented reality has the potential to change that behavior, as it allows consumers to imagine items not just in a finished room, but in their own room.A number of retailers have recently added AR shopping features to their websites and apps, including Target, Wayfair, and IKEA.Like IKEAs implementation, Amazons new AR View feature takes advantage of Apples ARKit software that allows third-party developers to more easily add AR functionality to their mobile apps.For this reason, AR View in the Amazon app will only work on the iPhone 6S or higher, on devices running Apples latest mobile operating system, iOS 11.To try the feature, youll first tap on the camera icon in the Amazon app the same one you press today to scan a barcode or perform a visual search.You can then choose AR View from the menu that appears.(It seems AR View has not replaced the AR stickers, which are still available.)In the screen that appears, you can swipe through a top menu to choose from various categories, like living room, home dcor, bedroom, kitchen, electronics, and toys and games.Theres even a top picks section which currently features Echo devices, among other things.Its not clear how useful some of these product selections are after all, do you really need to visualize the yellow toy truck or Echo Dot before purchasing?But in the case of larger items, like furniture or kitchen appliances that sit on countertops, it could be more helpful.In the AR View screen, you can also move and rotate the items to see them in a full 360-degree view, notes Amazon.The addition of AR View is rolling out now to iOS devices, and was announced alongside news of Amazons Black Friday Deals Store launch.In the announcement, the retailer highlighted that it now has a number of ways to shop Amazon beyond AR, including from its curated stream at Interesting Finds, via real-world Treasure Trucks in cities, through brick-and-mortar Amazon Books stores, via its lists, guides, and handmade shop, both online and on mobile.
Expense report analysis startup AppZen raises $13M to build a smarter back office:::::Expense reports arent the most exciting thing in the universe.But when you reach the scale of say, Amazon, and have tens of thousands of employees, making sure everything comes through smoothly and the right things are being billed to the company could mean the difference in millions of dollars to your bottom line.And when Anant Kale walks into the office of a big company and asks for a batch of expense reports to do that, its when hes trying to show that company that its something that can be done with technology.Kale runs a startup called AppZen, which sells into large businesses and looks to automatically audit expense reports in order to encourage employees to ensure they are only expensing the right things to the company and not going out of bounds by a little or a lot.If you look at the back office, automation has been around for decades, AppZen CEO Kale said.SAP and everyone else is making billions selling their software.That software has solved major problems, and it has digitized things it has moved people from client-server to cloud, where we are focused on is the workflows which are human in nature.A transaction comes to you, you have to look at it, use expertise To do that, AppZen said it has raised $13 million in a series A financing round led by Redpoint Ventures with seed investor Resolute Ventures also participating.Redpoint Ventures Alex Bard this is actually his first investment at the firm will be joining the companys board.To date, AppZen has raised more than $17.5 million in financing.Each expense goes through AppZen through the variety of platforms it works with and in reality, you probably will never see it in action, or even see whether its actually working in your system.AppZen looks through historical behavior to see if someone is, say, upgrading a seat on a flight when its not entirely justified (say its a short flight instead of something intercontinental), and then flags that expense.AppZen then figures out if its worth a nudge (like an email), a slap on the wrist (like telling the employee to pay), or worth escalating higher if its a continuing issue.My biggest question was, how was Appzen (a seed stage business) able to win the trust of some of the worlds largest companies who are also notoriously difficult to win over and could we continue to scale that magic?Bard said.What I later found out, is that these wins were due to a combination of Anants hustle and, very importantly, the fact that they were able to show real value by doing pilots the product is so compelling that it has been able to immediately shows customers a significant cost savings they could be realizing and an improvement in employee experience.The whole idea here is to create this environment of continuous reporting, where each expense gets a decent glance before it gets logged permanently.And, often times, its not the end of the world if something falls out of bounds of a completely rigid model grabbing an extra pack of gum while at an airport when on a work trip is probably something that falls on the harmless side of the spectrum, for example.Each employee has a histogram which helps determine whether or not they are expensing things properly.The goal, Kale says, is to try to get employees to become more compliant over time if they are not entirely already.And, often times, it might not even be intentional on the employee end.In the end, AppZens goal is to try to proactively educate and help encourage employees to use expenses properly instead of outright judging though, of course, that only goes so far.What we are tracking is your behavior changing, Kale said.Is that [score] dropping month over month, so we know you arent gonna do this again and again.The employee knows hey Im gonna be caught, and then the expenses dont happen.Thats how we save money not by being the police [in the system].AppZen isnt alone in attempts to throw machine learning in this space even if the company is able to collect a big moat of data from all these pilots and company reports.There are plenty of smaller startups like Pleo looking to find a smarter way to do expense reports that can keep a close eye on employee behavior and make sure everything runs smoothly.And the larger organizations which have been throwing human eyeballs at this problem may eventually realize they have a wealth of data that they can start throwing resources at to build something similar.The next step, Kale says, probably moves in the direction of invoicing which uses some similar principles.A tool like AppZen could potentially help spot duplicates, fake vendors, or even deals between employees and vendors.Of course, you start where you can and build from there, but building a set of analytical tools that can fit into an array of new products is what helps turn a lot of startups into multi-billion dollar companies.When we hear of a problem, that drives everything for us, Kale said.Thats the right way, how can we solve this.Based on that we figure out, hey, this requires some kind of training, in many cases, we have to look at hundreds of documents.Its always based on what are we trying to do in terms of specific compliance arguments we can solve for the customer.We think if you can solve it for this customer, you can solve it for other companies.
Groupon adds ad exec Steve Krenzer as new COO, sold assets to Grubhub for $20M:::::Groupon, the local deals platform, reported Q3 earnings today that provided more details on how it is restructuring its business; and it also took the moment to announce that it has finally appointed a new COO, a role that has been vacant for the last two years.Steve Krenzer, who had been the CEO of direct-ad specialist Core Digital Media, is taking on the role, the first time Groupon has had a COO since Rich Williams left the role to become the companys CEO in November 2015.On the earnings front, Groupon continues to restructure its operations on its mission to right-size its business for the future, but it still partly fell short of analysts estimates for how it should be performing right now.The company reported revenues of $634 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.01.This was a miss on revenues but a beat on EPS, as analysts on average were expecting sales of $643 million and an EPS of $0.Active customers currently stand at 49.1 million, Groupon said, representing slight growth on a year ago when there were 45.7 million customers (latter figure adjusted down on previous numbers because Groupons now exited certain international markets).Gross billings, however are in decline at the moment with $119.6 compared to $127.3 a year ago, and gross profit also down to $27.35 versus $28.72 a year ago.It was, overall, a more positive picture painted by the company: gross profit was $309.4 million, with net income from continuing operations of $3.8 million (non-GAAP net income was nearly double this, $6.8 million).This is a big swing in the right direction when compared to Groupons net loss of $34.4.million in the same quarter a year ago.The numbers seem to be pleasing the market.Groupon is currently trading about 3.5 percent higher on its opening price.That process of restructuring also is gradually meting out other data about the company.Back in July, Groupon announced that it was getting out of the food delivery business a significant piece in the companys long-running divestment strategy of its restaurant and food business.Built on a string of acquisitions over several years of startups like like OrderUp, Savored and Breadcrumb, it once stretched into point-of-sale software, delivery and more in an attempt to grow the revenues that Groupon made from its merchant partners.After selling its Breadcrumb POS business last year, Groupon this summer said that it would strike a deal with Grubhub to take on its delivery business and work in partnership in the future.In its 10-Q filing today, Groupon revealed that in September it was paid $19.8 million in that transaction which consisted of customer customer lists and other intangible assets in certain food delivery markets.Groupon said that it recorded the deal as a pretax gain on the sale of assets of $17.1 million (the excess of the $19.8 million in net proceeds received, consisting of $18.5 million received in cash and $1.5 million that the acquirer paid into an escrow account that will be settled within 12 months of closing, less $0.2 million in transaction costs, over the $2.7 million net book value of the assets upon closing of the transaction.)Groupon also noted that it took $11.5 million in restructuring charges this quarter related to employee severance and other charges.The 10-Q notes that there were terminations for approximately 400 employees in the quarter, although a Groupon spokesperson said that overall the company has lost 45 employees as a net total, with 6,616 employees on Groupons books today.Looking ahead, Krenzers appointment could be a signal that Groupon is getting ready to refresh its marketing activities, which still lean heavily on email among a mix of mobile apps, social media and the rest of the usual suspects.In line with that, alongside the new COO, Groupon also announced a new board member, Deborah Wahl, who most recently was the SVP and CMO of McDonalds, USA .The opportunity to add a high-horsepower e-commerce leader like Steve doesnt come along very often, said Groupon CEO Rich Williams in a statement.His combination of industry savvy, deep operational experience and intimate understanding of digital marketing is equally rare.Steve will immediately put those skills to work as we continue to advance our vast local marketplace.Featured Image: Groupon

Quip raises $10 million for electric toothbrushes:::::There are venture-backed shoes, razors, and glasses.So why not, toothbrushes?Quip has raised a $10 million round for its dental care business.Sherpa Capital and other unnamed fashion and entertainment investors participated.The New York-based startup is a lot more than just an electric toothbrush, said Simon Enever, founder and CEO.Quip is looking to help fix or modernize the world of oral health.There are a few ways that Quip tries to differentiate itself.The toothbrushes start at just $25 and can be ordered on a subscription basis, which includes replacement heads and toothpaste.Quip also touts its brushing guides, which explain the optimal technique.(Your dentist would be happy.)The company claims its product design will somehow motivate users to brush more often.Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and managing director at Sherpa Capital, said that he invested because oral care is a huge segment and Quip is thinking beyond the toothbrush.He believes that Quip is inspiring positive behaviors around one of the most important aspects of overall health and making dental care accessible to all.The startup plans to use the capital to invest in new products.Quip previously raised at least $2 million in funding.
InVision picks up $100 million Series E:::::InVision, the design collaboration tool based out of New York, has today announced the close of a $100 million Series E funding round.The financing was led by Battery Ventures, with participation from existing investors Accel, Tiger Global Management, Firstmark and ICONIQ Capital, along with new investors Spark Capital and Geodesic.InVision launched back in 2011 as a tool that would simply let designers build out prototypes of websites or applications without having engineers write out all the code each time a small change is made.The company has since grown to service 80 percent of the Fortune 100, according to InVision, with over 3 million users at companies like Airbnb, Disney, and Nike.The screen is most important place in the word, said InVision CEO Clark Valberg.Every company is becoming a digital product company and every company has to think about people, practices and platforms that they use to adapt to digital world.InVision is emerging as an operating system for product design, from the idea phase to product development to shipment.InVision has been particularly busy of late.The company recently announced InVision Studio, which is meant to take on Photoshop and Sketch, giving designers all the tools they need to not only collaborate with their peers, but create the original designs.InVision also acquired Brand.ai, a tool that helps manage design teams at scale with cloud-based asset management.InVision says that more than 70 percent of its users arent on the design team, which is part of what has made the company so successful over the past six years.I asked Valberg about the key to the companys rapid growth and success.Everything we do is inspired by the best design teams in the world that make the things we love the most, said Valberg.The design teams at Netflix and Airbnb dont just send us emails.They tell us where they think design is going and where design tooling should go, and Ive stayed super close to those conversations to build an organization that is fairly responsive to those things.He added that this proximity, and the authentic, intimate relationship that InVision shares with these design teams is the thing that most contrasts InVision from other players like Adobe.
Essential Phone is the best deal in smartphones thanks to camera updates:::::The Essential Phone has come a long way since launch in one key area: Photography.When it first hit the market a few months ago, the camera had a nasty tendency to crash and was a bit slow to load and process photos.But Essential has stayed true to its promise of delivering frequent and effective Camera app updates, and the result is a smartphone total package that is easily the best value today at its reduced price of $499 and its good contender for best Android smartphone period, now, too, even with the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL on the market.Ive been using the Essential Phone throughout its most recent camera updates, and I paid particular attention to the most recent updates for the app which brought a lot of improved stability and improved loading and capture times.Image quality, too, is improved, particularly in low light, which makes it seem like Essential did some work under the hood to improve the sensor fusion work that combines images from its dual color/mono cameras.You can see examples of photos taken from the updated camera app below, including a selection of images taken in Japan.They definitely optimize for different qualities vs. some of the other leading flagship devices out there, including the iPhone X and the Pixel 2, but Im a fan of the decisions Essential made with regards to their results, including more muted tones and a tendency to avoid exaggerating things like sky colors.Its a terrific camera for landscapes and street shots, both day and night, and the video camera is also now fast and reliable, though lacking some of the more advanced features of the Pixel 2 like stabilization (but no other smartphone compares to the Pixel in that regard).It also lacks whiz-bang features like a portrait mode for simulating background blur at low apertures, but its mono sensor mode still produces some of my favorite images Ive ever captured with a mobile device.Camera aside, Essential has also improved general stability a lot, and with its most recent update, introduced the useful fingerprint sensor swipe gesture to bring down the notification tray thats been staple of the Pixel line from Google.Pairing all the user experience improvements with the stuff Essential got right immediately out of the gate, including its incredible industrial design (which easily tops the Android crop if not the industry, IMO) and its stellar screen (which avoids a lot of the issues inherent in that of the Pixel 2 XLs pOLED), theres no question that Essentials $499 outright offering price is a no brainer.There are other things in the pipeline for the future that could make the Essential Phone stand out even more, including a forthcoming Android Oreo update, and additional modular add-ons made possible via the magnetic accessory port on the back, but even leaving those aside, Essential is the best deal in smartphones right now, and probably the best device period for a large number of people.

Virgin creates Vox Space for its government-related launches:::::Hear what cryptocurrency has to offer with Gavin Wood and Jutta Steiner The universe can welcome yet another entrant into the space race, and yet another company into Richard Bransons portfolio.TechCrunch has learned that Bransons Virgin Orbit has quietly created VOX Space, a wholly owned subsidiary of its space freight business, that will focus on servicing government contracts from the U.S. and its political allies.For Virgin Orbit, the creation of VOX Space is an indicator of how seriously the company takes the potential revenue stream that could come from government contracts.According to people with knowledge of the companys plans, the military and defense industry will likely never be the bulk of Virgin Orbits contracts, but created the subsidiary to be able to compete in that market.Right now, the book of business including a likely contract with a government agency, will be roughly 90% commercial and 10% government, according to a person with knowledge of the firm.A spokesperson for Virgin Orbit said the company would not comment officially on any unannounced plans.At its core, its an opportunity to further loosen the iron grip that Americas two main aerospace companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, have on the space business, according to investors with knowledge of the industry.There are bureaucratic requirements that exist for this part of the market and not for the commercial market, said a person familiar with the companys plans.Voxs parent company, Virgin Orbit, itself began as a spin out from Bransons Virgin Galactic business.Launched last year, Virgin Orbit is the companys attempt to commercialize an alternative launch system, which uses a Boeing 747 retrofitted to carry a two-stage rocket as its method for getting payloads into low earth orbit.Think of it this way.If Virgin Galactic is the way that Branson envisions getting people into space, Virgin Orbit is the way that he hopes cargo will get to space.That means Vox is the way that highly sensitive, government cargo will get to space.Branson actually now has four companies focused on different aspects of the space business.Theres Virgin Galactic for people, Virgin Orbit for cargo, Vox for government missions, and The Spaceship Company, which builds spaceships.This separation of the government business from its commercial arms becomes even more important as Virgin starts taking money from outside investors like the $1 billion commitment the company received from the Saudi Arabian government just last week.Through the investment, The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia committed to invest $1 billion into Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Virgin Orbit, with an option for another $480 million spent on future space services.Virgin has lofty expectations for its small cargo business.The company is expecting to conduct 12 launches, with payload, by 2019 and would expects to be conducting 24 launches by 2020.To put that in perspective, there were 86 space launches last year worldwide, according to a Virgin Orbit spokesperson.One of Virgin Orbits key early customers is OneWeb, which is building a network of satellites to provide global internet access.The company, backed by over $1 billion in funding from Softbank, is planning to use Virgin Orbit for operations and management services on its vast array of satellites.With customers like OneWeb, Virgin Orbit actually has its full launch schedule for 2018 booked, and is mostly sold for 2019.That a company whose technology has not been proven outside of test facilities can book through 2019 shows just how much demand there is for a ticket to outer space.Prices to develop satellite technologies have dropped precipitously and there are new applications being developed nearly daily for systems that monitor the earth.Theres also a flood of interest from countries in developing markets to grab a piece of space real estate before its all claimed by the major economic powerhouses in North America, Asia, and Europe.Indeed, this land grab is perhaps one reason why the Saudi government was eager to plant such a large flag to declare its interest in investing in outer space.The great game to claim a corner of space has, in fact, created interesting political initiatives among a number of countries.China has arrayed a slew of public and quasi-private initiatives to challenge the U.S. in the space race.Meanwhile, legislators in the U.S. have called for the creation of a new branch of the military that would defend the nations interests in outer space.Meanwhile, private companies from India and Israel are among the finalists for the Google-sponsored Lunar X-Prize, and Nigeria has a multi-billion space program of its own.Taken together, its clear that the final frontier is no longer the purview of the worlds superpowers.Thats a commercial opportunity for Virgins fleet of space businesses, but one which requires the company to tread carefully.Luckily for Virgin, its government business is in seemingly capable hands.Vox Space is headed by Mandy Vaughn, who previously worked as the director of business development at Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit.Vaughn has a long career in the space and aerospace industry, getting her start in 2004 working for the US Air Force in the Los Angeles-based Space Superiority Systems Directorate after completing a masters of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology two years earlier.Featured Image: VOX Space

Sony reboots Aibo with AI and extra kawaii:::::The rumors had it right: Sony is rebooting its robot dog, Aibo, announcing a new four-legged companion AI-powered bot incoming with the same brand name but more rounded corners and visible facial features for extra kawaii, including a pair of expressive, puppy-dog eyes.Deep learning tech, fish-eye cameras and a series of other embedded sensors enable Aibo to detect and analyze sounds and images so that it can learn and respond to its environment and interact with its owner so it appears less, well, robotic.Sony claims Aibos adaptive behavior includes being able to actively seek out its owners; detect words of praise; smiles; head and back scratches; petting, and more.Thanks to the embedded cameras you can also instruct Aibo to take a photo for you should you want a dogs eye view of yourself/your home life.Aibos AI learns from interactions with its owners and develops a unique personality over time, it writes.Further, with its owners permission, aibo can collect data from these interactions, then connect to the cloud and access the knowledge accumulated from interactions between different owners and their aibo to become even more clever.So, basically, if youre comfortable installing a roaming camera, microphone and location sensing device in your home thats designed to watch your every action, listen to what youre saying and upload all this intel to the cloud to yield new programming instructions so the device changes how it acts around you in a pantomime of intelligence this could be the artificial pet for you.Alternatively, you could make like Sebastian Thrun and become the proud owner of a real life puppy.But if Aibos hairless lines and plastic smells are melting your heart, then prepare to shell out some serious yen: The Aibo robot itself is priced at 198,000 JPY (~$1,735) but you also need a subscription plan to connect to the cloud service that powers Aibos AI.A basic three-year subscription plan costs 2,980 JPY ($26) per month (or ~$790 if you pay up-front for the full three years).It also looks like Sony is limiting Aibos release to its home market at least for now.Its accepting pre-orders for Aibo from today, via its website, but wont be shipping until January according to Reuters.Owners of the pet bot can also access an Aibo store via the companion app to shell out yet more money to buy additional tricks.Add on hardware accessories are also on the slate, such as a toy bone with a tentative price of ~$26.Sony is also offering a further optional support care plan which gives Aibo owners a 50 per cent discount on repair fees in the event of malfunction or damage, and 50 per cent on checkups and inspections, for ~$15 per month.(Presumably thats if you want to pretend youre taking your pretend pet to the vet.)Aibos battery is good for two hours of activity before itll need a recharge on its charging mat (taking three hours to be fully juiced).Under its white plastic hood, the bot is powered by a 64bit Quad-Core CPU and is packing LTE and Wi-Fi:IEEE 802.11b/g/n radios for connectivity.On the moveable parts front, the robopup has 22 degrees of freedom.While its eyes are comprised of two OLED screens, hence enabling new Aibo to have a range of puppy dog looks.The full list of embedded sensors inside the bot are: 2 Cameras (Front camera, SLAM camera) 4 Microphones ToF sensor 2 PSD sensors Pressure sensitive/capacitive type touch sensor (Back sensor) Capacitive type touch sensor (Head sensor, jaw sensor) 6 axis detection system(3 axis gyro/3 axis acceleration)2 (Head, Torso) Motion sensor Light sensor 4 Paw pads The original Aibo went on sale in 1999, with Sony going on to ship around 150,000 of the robots before production was ceased in 2006.Speaking at a launch event for its rebooted Aibo robopup today, Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai said: It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics.I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop Aibo because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sonys mission.
Microsoft expands HoloLens headsets to 29 new markets, now up to 39:::::Nearly three years on from Microsoft unveiling its HoloLens augmented reality headsets, the company today announced a major expansion of its availability: 29 more markets in Europe, nearly tripling the total number of countries where you can buy the device up to 39.The news shows that while we dont have a firm number of how many units have been sold, we do know that Microsoft is banking on the device, a non-immersive experience that lets you interact with visual digital images while still being able to see a room as you would normally, as a core piece of its future hardware and software efforts in a bid to compete against the likes of Apple and Google.This is where we believe computing is going, said Lorraine Bardeen, general manager of Microsoft HoloLens and Windows experiences, who announced he expansion today at Microsofts Future Decoded event in London.We can bring all your apps and programs right into your world, but you can still see all the things in your world that matter to you.No details so far on when devices in the expanded list will ship, or what local prices will be (we are asking and will update as we learn more).Currently, Microsoft sells a Development Edition of the device for $3,000 and a Commercial Suite with added enterprise features for $5,000.The new countries Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey come one year after Microsoft first took the HoloLens outside of the U.S., when it launched it in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.It has since then also expanded it to its first Asian country, Japan.A reported launch in China earlier this year seems not to have materialised yet.There has been some debate about Microsofts strategy of being an early mover in AR specifically whether banking it primarily around hardware rather than software for readily-available devices (as Apple and Google have done respectively with ARKit and ARCore) has been the wisest move for the company.For now, it seems that its the route that Microsoft will continue to take.If the first wave of international rollouts helped Microsoft hit all Europes largest markets, todays news underscores how Microsoft is now entering a wider, scaling phase for its mixed-reality hardware, and points to the companys intention to keep it at the center of its future hardware plays, particularly as Microsoft continues to push into enterprise tools and services.At Microsoft we are on a mission to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more, said Bardeen.Mixed reality has the potential to help customers and businesses across the globe do things that, until now, have never been possible.Mixed reality experiences will help businesses and their employees complete crucial tasks faster, safer, more efficiently, and create new ways to connect to customers and partners.As of March 2017, Microsoft said that there were 150 apps built to work on HoloLens, and the expansion will potentially see that number growing.Microsoft has also been working on HoloLens hardware: a second generation of the device (which has yet to be released) is slated to feature its own AI chip , which will move some of the computing power off the cloud and localise it on the device.The HoloLens is built to run with Windows 10, which natively supports holographic interfaces at the the API level.This lets developers program actions through gaze, gesture, voice and environmental understanding (that is, making sure that an object doesnt pass through a wall, but bumps against it); and also more easily translate Windows 10 apps into apps that can work on the HoloLens.While the majority of the world has yet to sign on to using and embracing augmented and virtual reality applications, these are important steps in making mixed-reality applications and devices less awkward and part of the more seamless continuum of consumer electronics and computing.
Grab, the Uber rival in Southeast Asia, is now officially also a digital payments company:::::Grab is best known for rivaling Uber in Southeast Asia, but today the company took a major step into becoming a fintech player, too.Thats because the ride-sharing firm, which recently raised $2 billion from SoftBank and Chinas Didi Chuxing, rolled out support for its GrabPay service among third-party merchants for the first time today.Grab is present in seven markets across Southeast Asia, but the first merchants it is onboarding are street food sellers in Singapore, where the firm is headquartered.An initial 25 are on the platform now, but the plan is to grow that number to 20,000 in Singapore by the end of the year.This wont change the game overnight for the companys 60 million-plus users, but it is a sign of where Grab is headed since it announced plans to develop a payments platform last year.It takes GrabPay from being merely the system that enables you pay for a taxi using your credit (or pre-bought Grab credit) to one that could be used more widely as a digital payments app.The process is much like popular payment services like Alipay: users just scan the merchants QR code, key in the amount and hit pay.Grab is placing incentives on using GrabPay credits which will make the service more like wallet but it also works with credit cards and other payment methods Grab offers locally.The company is being rather coy on when it will expand the payments feature to new markets, other than that it will happen next year.Nonetheless it will be interesting to observe the impact it has in Singapore, the country of seven million people which exhibits more Western consumer habits than any place in Southeast Asia.This is an important part of the journey, Grab co-founder Hooi Ling Tan told TechCrunch in an interview.Weve been talking and executing on our plan but today is a significant milestone for making GrabPay truly a cash replacement.If I leave my wallet at home, I can still pay for breakfast, lunch and dinner.In time Ill be able to buy goods like hardware or groceries using GrabPay, Tan added.Theres a veritable tonne of fintech startups and solutions aimed at digitizing payments already and Singapore, the hub for venture capital and a global financial market, has tended to be a first stop for most.But Tan is adamant that GrabPay has a super power lacking in others: users.For merchants in Singapore, the moment they sign up they get access to four million customers, she said.Telcos and banks havent been able to move to mobile wallets is because it requires them to adopt new customer behavior.[But] weve already shifted a significant portion of customer behavior.Given that Grab only began accepting payments less than two years ago, its move into payments has been swift since it was announced in July 2016.The firm hired ex-Euronet exec Jason Thompson to lead the GrabPay business, opened R&D centers dedicated to fintech, made an acquisition and added credit facilities and peer-to-peer transfers recently.For us to provide better services to a larger portion of Southeast Asia, existing partners we could work with didnt meet the scale or expectation of what we had, Tan said of the payment push.Nine in ten in Southeast Asia dont have a credit card and 75 percent are unbanked its clearly a big problem and, in our minds, larger than transportation.Grabs move to enable financial inclusion is the opposite of Ubers recent announcement of an own-branded credit card to its users.Admittedly thats a move primarily aimed at first-world markets, but it certainly emphasizes Grabs focus on being local.It isnt the first to go down this route by any means, however.Go-Jek, its billion-dollar rival based in Indonesia, introduced its Go-Pay service in 2016 while Indias Ola, which shares common investors with Grab, has operated standalone service Ola Money since 2015.
Here's proof you shouldn't take selfies:::::If you were asked to list the uses of a mobile phones front facing camera, taking selfies is probably pretty high up on the list.No one can deny that using a phones front camera to snap a few pics is far easier than having to turn the phone around, make sure you have your finger on the right button and hope you are in the frame.And with the quality of smartphone cameras getting better all the time we are able to take clearer, more profile picture worthy photos with ease.But it turns out, and this may come as a shock, that the front camera was not created so we could take selfies.The first phone with a front facing camera was introduced to the world by Sony in 2003 in the form of the Ericsson Z1010.According to Quartz, the chunky flip phone and its 0.3 pixel camera that could be turned towards the user, was originally intended to be used in business calls.Little did Sony know that little camera would spark what can only be described as a selfie epidemic.People loved the idea of being able to see what they look like while taking a photo of themselves so much that platforms were created to easily allow them to share their selfies with the world.Social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat encourage people to share their selfies to their hearts content and even give them options to add filters and edits if they want to spice up their picture.Selfies have become such a phenomenon that studies have been conducted to find out just how much of our lives we spend trying to capture our perfect angle.Rawhide, a non-profit organisation helping at-risk youth, conducted research to give insight into our selfie habits, their findings included: There are 93 million selfies taken each day 74 per cent of images shared on Snapchat are selfies There are 1000 selfies posted to Instagram every 10 seconds In 2015 more people died from taking selfies than from shark attacks Every year teens spend almost seven full work days taking selfies The designers at Sony that were responsible for creating the front facing camera could never have predicted the effect their innovation would have on how we use our phones.No doubt there are people out there that do use the camera for its original purpose of video conference meetings but, for now, it looks like taking selfies will continue to come out on top.This story originally appeared in news.com.au.
Twitter homepage features crude attack against Chrissy Teigen:::::At a time when Twitter is trying to curb trolling and incendiary use of its platform, its logged-out homepage features one of its users attacking model Chrissy Teigen.First spotted by user Chris Messina (himself a former employee at both Google and Uber), the image shows a Twitter user @Amir_Hali calling Tiegen "a wh**e" in response to one of her tweets.Below is a screenshot of the logged-out homepage.Fox News has reached out to Twitter for comment for this story.Teigen's reps were looking into the matter when contacted by Fox News.TWITTER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE AD TRANSPARENCY AFTER RUSSIAN-BACKED SCANDAL Twitter has come under attack for abuse on its platform, with the company actively trying to curtail it, to mixed results.In 2016, companies such as Salesforce.com and Disney looked at acquiring the Jack Dorsey-led company, only to call off the attempts, due in part to the abuse on the platform.The abuse has been cited by experts as one of the reasons it was not purchased.Former New York Times editor Quentin Hardy said he spoke to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff about the trolling issue, and he confirmed that trolls were part of the reason Salesforce dropped its bid.In November 2016, the company wrote a blog post, detailing some of the progress it has made in curtailing online abuse.In the post, Twitter explained that it was expanding its mute function, which lets users mute accounts they dont want to see tweets from, to muting keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations.It also put a spotlight on its hateful conduct policy, which "prohibits specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease."Lastly, the company said it had retrained its support teams on its policies, "including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct, and implemented an ongoing refresher program," while improving internal tools to deal with abuse in a more effective manner.Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia
Silicon Valley history lost: Archive of documents that belonged to HP founders destroyed in wildfire:::::An archive of historic documents that belonged to Hewlett-Packard founders William Hewlett and David Packard has been destroyed in the devastating Tubbs fire in Northern California.The archive was held by electronics measurement specialist Keysight Technologies on its campus in Santa Rosa, which suffered damage in the fire.Beginning on the night of Oct. 8, wildfires burned through parts of the city of Santa Rosa and surrounding areas, explained Keysight Technologies, in a statement emailed to Fox News.The Tubbs fire entered Keysight Technologies Santa Rosa campus, damaging company buildings and destroying two structures.The archive, which reportedly consisted of more than 100 boxes of the founders writings, correspondence, speeches and other items, was housed in one of the two buildings destroyed on the Keysight campus.The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports that Keysight acquired the archive in 2014 when it split from HP spinoff Agilent Technologies.APPLE-1 COMPUTER SOLD AT AUCTION FOR $905,000 We are saddened by the loss of historical documents authored by our visionary founders Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, Keysight told Fox News.This is a tremendous loss to Hewlett-Packard, Agilent and Keysight, as well as a loss to all of Silicon Valley.More than 120 Keysight employees lost their homes in the devastating fire and hundreds were displaced, according to the company.Keysight, which has received criticism over the destroyed archive, told Fox News that the documents were victims of an unusually destructive wildfire.Keysight met and exceeded the strictest standards for archival protection, including guidelines set by the United Nations and the Library of Congress, it said.Adhering to the strictest archival standards could not protect these artifacts from the most damaging fire in state history.SUPERCOMPUTER SET TO LAUNCH ON SPACE STATION MISSION Other parts of the Keysight corporate archive survived the fire.Many items in the Keysight archives were not affected by the fire because they were situated in other parts of the Santa Rosa facility that sustained only minor damage, housed in other sites around the world, or are digitally preserved, it said.HP told Fox News that its own archive of historic items is intact.HPs sites were not impacted and archives remain intact in both physical and digital formats, it said, in a statement.HPs archives contain hundreds of items related to HPs founders including many examples of speeches, personal correspondence, writings and other materials.The company uses a facility in Atlanta, Georgia for its corporate archives.In addition, many other materials from the founders are part of public collections, such as the William Hewlett papers (1907-2010) held by Stanford University, it said.HP was founded in 1939 by Hewlett and Packard in a car garage in Palo Alto, now regarded as the birthplace of Silicon Valley.The garage is now a private museum and historical landmark.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Facebook, Google, Twitter: How tech giants are involved in the Russia investigation:::::As lawmakers continue to investigate Russias role in the 2016 presidential election, major tech companies are expected to tell Congress just how much Russian activity was found on their platforms.Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify in three different hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday as congressional probes into alleged Russian influence in the election continue.Delegates from tech giants have already met privately with lawmakers on the Hill to discuss ads purchased during the campaign season.Heres what you need to know about the tech companies involvement.How is Facebook involved in the investigation?Last month, Facebook revealed that it uncovered about $100,000 in ad purchases connected to inauthentic accounts that violated its policies.Another $50,000 was found to have been spent on potentially politically related ad spending that were in Russian.Facebooks Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos said the accounts were likely operated out of Russia.As lawmakers have called for more information about the advertisements, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to make its political advertising more transparent.Facebook plans to reveal to lawmakers this week that one Russian group posted more than 80,000 times on its platform during and after the election potentially reaching 126 million people.President Donald Trump accused Facebook of being always anti-Trump in a tweet.But Zuckerberg hit back and said both sides of the political aisle were upset by content on Facebook proving what running a platform for all ideas looks like.What about Twitter?Twitter representatives told lawmakers that it suspended approximately two dozen accounts that were potentially linked to Russia and corresponded to Facebooks troublesome accounts.Additionally, it said it found 179 related accounts that violated their rules.Twitter also revealed in a blog post that Russia Today (RT), which it said has strong links to the Russian government, spent $274,000 in ads in 2016.After representatives met with lawmakers, Rep. Mark Warner, D-Va., slammed the information shared from Twitter as being frankly inadequate on almost every level.He said Twitters explanations of its response was deeply disappointing.Twitter also announced that it has banned ads from RT and Sputnik.The social media giant said it would use the money already spent on advertisements by RT for research around civic engagement and electoral misinformation.Twitter is expected to tell congressional committees that it has shuttered nearly 3,000 accounts linked to Russias Internet Research Agency known for spreading pro-Russian government propaganda.That number is nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter.And Google?Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Google Search products and Gmail regarding the 2016 election, Fox Business reported.However, the ads do not appear to be from the same source as those purchased on Facebook.Accounts connected with the Russian government spent $4,700 on search and display ads and $53,000 was spent on ads with political material that were purchased from either a Russian territory, Russian Internet address or with Russian currency, according to the Associated Press."We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries," Google said in a statement.Why does it matter?The issue over social medias involvement in the investigation largely stems from advertisements bought from the companies, not necessarily the content shared by users, Dr. Karen North, a clinical professor of communication at the University of Southern California, told Fox News.But the issue further boils down to what is wrong versus what is illegal.Spreading so-called fake news is wrong, but it might not be illegal, the social media expert explained.We as users of social media platforms do not want the platforms to be telling us what we can or cant say or even that we cant say falsehoods because people spin the story of their lives to present a public face to our friends and colleagues, North said.We dont want Facebook or Twitter to tell us we cant do that.North predicted that social media companies will begin to strengthen their regulations or dress codes for future advertisers.There are laws [to protect speech] and then there are rules of conduct, including dress codes at offices or schools, North said.Whether or not whats being done by the Russians or fake news or people lying about adventures in their life, are those illegal or in violation of dress codes?Shareholders in the major tech companies have also demanded more transparency regarding foreign involvement that could have interfered in the election.Like Congress and the American public, shareholders in these companies have serious questions and concerns about how these platforms were used and abused during the 2016 election, Michael Connor, executive director of the nonprofit Open MIC, said in a statement.Open MIC said shareholders with assets worth more than $25 billion have filed proposals asking Facebook, Google and Twitter to divulge more information about foreign involvement as well as disinformation and hate speech.The investors, through these filings, intend to play a critically important role in holding Facebook, Google and Twitter accountable for what happens on their platforms, Connor said.What else should you know?A bipartisan group of senators introduced earlier this month legislation that would regulate advertisements purchased for online platforms.The legislation is aimed at hitting archaic laws that allow content and purchasers of advertisements to be hidden from the public, according to a Senate aide who helped draft the Honest Ads Act backed by Sens.Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; Mark Warner, D-Va.; and John McCain, R-Ariz. Online political advertising represents an enormous marketplace, and today there is almost no transparency, Warner said in a statement.The Russians realized this, and took advantage in 2016 to spread disinformation and misinformation in an organized effort to divide and distract us.In his own statement, McCain contended that current transparency laws dealing with political campaigns have not kept pace with rapid advances in technology, allowing our adversaries to take advantage of these loopholes to influence millions of American voters with impunity.The legislation would require certain digital platforms to keep a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by a person or group totaling more than $500 total on ads.It also requires online platforms to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence Americans.Ahead of Tuesdays congressional hearing, Warner said that he hopes to hear a full explanation from the tech giants about what happened in 2016.Facebook, Google and Twitter havent yet commented on the proposed legislation, according to the Associated Press.Fox News' James Rogers and Jason Donner contributed to this report.The Associated Press also contributed to this report.
NASA releases eerie playlist of spellbinding space sounds:::::We all already know that there are lots and lots of spooky places here on Earth.That weird abandoned house a few blocks over might give you chills when you drive by it, and graveyards are always a bit unsettling at night, but what about space?Over the years, NASA has recorded all kinds of sounds from outer space with its various probes and orbiters, and some of it is downright freaky.So, just in time for Halloween, NASA has whipped up an amazing playlist with some of its most unsettling real recordings.With a total of 22 tracks, the playlist has a lot to enjoy, but with some tracks that barely pass the 15 second mark, it wont take you very long to make your way through the entire collection.Some of the best, like Junos ear-splitting recordings as it danced with Jupiter, are truly unsettling, while others like the static recorded during comet flyby, sound more like distant gunshots than anything youd expect to hear in the depths of space.The tracks span a huge chunk of NASAs history, including recordings from Jupiter, Saturn, and even sounds captured in free space by Voyager.A personal favorite is track number 17, Radar Echos from Titans Surface, which sounds like a cross between an 8-bit arcade game and a dirt bike.Whatever you do, be sure to monitor your volume controls while youre listening, because many of the recordings have a habit of going from near-silence to ear-busting whistles and whines with zero warning.Space sounds are definitely spooky, but a busted speaker would be much more frightening.
Smart mosquito trap could prevent spread of deadly diseases:::::Doctors hope a mosquito trap will prevent the spread of disease.The trap is smart enough to know what type of mosquito its trapping, and if by the small chance it catches the wrong one, it will learn from its mistake.The smart trap senses the wing length and wing beats to detect what type of mosquito has entered the chamber.If its the type of mosquito the scientists are looking for the kind spreading fatal diseases the chamber will close and trap the mosquito inside.If we want the Aedes Aegypti, which is the yellow fever mosquito, or the Asian Tiger Mosquito, that carries Zika virus, we will train this trap to only catch those mosquitos, said Dr. Mustapha Debboun, director of Harris County Public Healths mosquito control division.ELON MUSK RELEASES FIRST IMAGE OF BORING COMPANY'S 'FREEWAY' UNDER LA Harris County includes Houston, Texas, which was devastated by Hurricane Harvey.After the storm, Debboun and his team worked to set traps around the county to determine whether the stagnant water left by the storm became a breeding ground for mosquitos and if the mosquitos were carrying diseases.Harris County is a test site for the high-tech device, becoming the first government agency in the country to try it out.The trap was developed by Microsoft as part of Project Premonition.Its designed to help entomologists perform their job faster.In turn, the trap should help create an early-warning system for outbreaks that allows doctors to catch diseases while theyre still in the field, instead of catching them when sick patients start filling up hospitals.This is not going to solve the Zika issue or the Dengue issue or the chikungunya issue.But hopefully, what this project will do is enhance our ability to detect them, said Douglas Norris, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a statement.GENE EDITING ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE POWERFUL Debboun said current traps can capture thousands of mosquitos but will only catch a few disease-carrying ones.The rest are what he calls nuisance mosquitos that dont do any harm.In this case, the trap will only catch or attract only the ones that we need to study in public health, said Debboun.Debboun said the trap can tell him important information about when the mosquito was trapped, like the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity.When the county uses other traps, that information is an educated guess.SCIENTISTS HAVE DESIGNED VIRTUAL HUMAN BRAIN CELLS The trap connects to an app that scientists in the field can use to view the information collected and know when all 64 cells on the trap have a mosquito inside.After the trap is filled, scientists can take the mosquitos back to the lab for testing.The mosquitos coming out of the trap are typically in very good condition and can be subject to better analysis than mosquitos that can be disfigured after coming out of other traps.The information they collect from the mosquitos and the trap will help them make decisions about how theyll use their resources to control the mosquito population.In a county with this size and scope, we dont have the resources to just cover the county and spray, spray, spray, said Les Becker, the deputy director and director of operations for Harris County Public Health, in a statement.Weve got to figure out how to do it as efficiently as possible.
Fisherman catches fish that grew around a drink wrapper:::::A Canadian fisherman hopes his astounding catch of a pike growing around a drink wrapper will teach others not to litter.Pick up your garbage.This is a Powerade wrapper which takes up no room in your pocket until you get to a garbage can.Please share!Adam Turnbull, of Sarnia, Ontario, wrote on a Facebook post.The images have gone viral with more than 12,000 shares.WASP RIPS BEE IN HALF IN VIRAL VIDEO Turnbull said he removed the wrapper and released the fish back into the waters of Alberta."I was very surprised a fish could even survive like this," Turnbull told Fox News, adding that he has never caught anything like it before."I spoke to a biologist and the blockage was just behind its stomach so it would have been able to eat normally, just longer for digestion to take place," he said.
Petition urges Facebook to reveal details of 'Russian propaganda':::::More than 81,000 people have signed a petition calling on Facebook to inform users how they were exposed to Russian propaganda.The change.org petition was started earlier this month by March for Truth.American citizens that use Facebook deserve to know how they were exposed to Russian disinformation and propaganda, says a post accompanying the petition.Facebook should provide this data to users in an application that makes it easy to understand.Users should be able to see how content and advertising messages from identified Russian sources appeared in their timeline, whether they interacted with such media, and basic metrics that quantify their exposure, it added.FACEBOOK UNCOVERS $100G IN FAKE AD SPENDING TIED TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES DURING 2016 ELECTION The petitions goal is 150,000 signatures.Fox News has reached out to Facebook with a request for comment on this story.Earlier this month, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said Congress should release the ads Russian operatives purchased to the public, while noting that Facebook owed the country an "apology.""Absolutely ... we think it's important they get the whole picture," Sandberg said during an interview with Axios' Mike Allen at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday Facebook, Twitter and Google will give evidence to a Senate Judiciary Committee investigating Russian disinformation online.FACEBOOK: 150 RUSSIA-LINKED POLITICAL ADS SHOWED UP ON INSTAGRAM Last month, Facebook announced that it uncovered $100,000 in fake ad spending tied to Russian operatives during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, associated with around 3,000 ads, which were later turned over to Congress.Facebook said a Russian group, Internet Research Agency, posted more than 80,000 times on its service during and after the election, potentially reaching as many as 126 million users.The company plans to disclose these numbers to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the testimony.The person declined to be named because the committee has not officially released the testimony.FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG ASKS FORGIVENESS FOR WAYS HIS 'WORK WAS USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE' Twitter plans to tell the same committee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the same group, Russia's Internet Research Agency, known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.That number is nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter.This person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the new findings ahead of the hearing on Tuesday.Google announced in a blog post that it found evidence of "limited" misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents.TWITTER BANS ADS FROM RUSSIAN MEDIA OUTLETS RUSSIA TODAY AND SPUTNIK Last week, Twitter banned ads from Russian media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, following the social media giants probe into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election.RT and Sputnik slammed Twitters move.Twitter also announced a plan to increase ad transparency on its platform, including political and issue-based ads.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also outlined a plan to bring greater transparency to political ads on the social network.Russia denies meddling in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.The Associated Press and Fox News' Chris Ciaccia contributed to this article.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers

iPhone X review roundup: Should you buy?:::::Apple iPhone X reviews hit the web early Tuesday morning, with most of the reviews focused on the upgrades to the iPhone's internals, including its camera.By and large, the reviews were extraordinarily positive on Apple's latest iPhone, but there were a few hiccups with the device, most notably Face ID, Apple's facial recognition technology.In many cases, the reviewers found that it didn't always work as expected and there were some hiccups.In September, when Apple announced the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and the X, it said the chances of a random person unlocking your phone via Face ID were 1 in 1 million, compared to 1 in 50,000 for TouchID.APPLE IPHONE 8 REVIEW ROUNDUP: WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY The iPhone X (prounded "ten") has wireless charging, using the Qi wireless charging standard, a complete redesign, Animoji (animated emoji) and several other new features.The device, which goes on sale officially Nov. 3, starts at $999 for the 64GB model and $1,149 for the 256GB model.Here are five of the top reviews on Apple's iPhone X. TechCrunch In his review, TechCruch editor-in-chief Matt Panzarino took the phone to Disneyland for testing to see how it would fare in the real world use and it worked great.Panzarino also found Face ID to be incredibly helpful and easy to use, writing, it works "really well" and "it worked the vast majority of times I tried it, it never once unlocked using a picture of myself or another persons face and the failure rate seemed to be about the same as Touch ID aka almost never."The Verge In his review, The Verge's editor-in-chief Nilay Patel noted that the display, which uses an OLED screen instead of the LCD screen Apple had used previously, is "excellent."Though he had some problems with Face ID, Patel still said the iPhone X "is clearly the best iPhone ever made.""If youre one of the many people who preordered this thing, I think youll be happy, although youll be going on the journey of figuring out when and how FaceID works best with everyone else," he added.Wired/Backchannel Steven Levy, one of the first reviewers of the original iPhone, reviewed the new iPhone X for Wired and was impressed by both the screen and the battery life, something Apple has worked hard to extend."I am an avid fan of increased battery life and thus appreciate the iPhone Xs alleged two extra hours of power between charges (compared to an iPhone 7)," Levy wrote."I had no time to assess this scientifically, but can verify that my unit powered through the usual late-afternoon low-battery doldrums and still seemed to have some juice when it came time for nighttime charging."WILL YOU BE ABLE TO GET AN IPHONE X AT LAUNCH?Engadget Endgadget's senior editor Chris Velazco was generally impressed by the device, even if there were a few issues, like dealing with slowness in apps."Tim Cook has made clear that the X is the future of Apple's smartphones, but the future doesn't feel foreign at all -- it feels surprisingly natural, surprisingly quickly," Velazco wrote.Tom's Guide Tom's Guide's editor-in-chief Mark Spoonauer reviewed the iPhone X and was incredibly positive on the device, saying its cameras live up to the competition and it feels more natural to hold in your hand, despite the larger screen size."You get a fairly large 5.8-inch screen in a phone thats easy to use with one hand," Spoonauer wrote."Not only did I have no problem stretching my thumb across the display, the iPhone X is also a lot easier to slip into my front jeans pocket than the iPhone 8 Plus."Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia
Bitcoin futures may help the case for a bitcoin ETF:::::CME Group's Duffy on bitcoin futures launch: People are looking for more efficient ways to do commerce 17 Hours Ago | 04:04 The SEC declined to comment and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission did not respond to a CNBC request for comment."I'm not sure bitcoin futures are going to solve all [the SEC regulators] need to see, but they are a good step forward," said Chris Burniske, author of "Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond."Even if bitcoin futures launch, the SEC has been wary of bitcoin."The SEC considers bitcoin exchanges to be largely unregulated," Burniske said.The cryptocurrency is created through a "mining" process, in which people use computers to solve logic problems.They are traded on exchanges around the world from Zimbabwe to Switzerland.In the beginning nearly a decade ago, they were the province of a small group of enthusiasts and used mainly to buy illegal goods online.But since then an entire industry has emerged with multiple businesses mining bitcoin, selling digital mining equipment and offering bitcoin trading services.Several long-time investors in traditional stocks and bonds are also moving into digital asset investing, and more than 120 "crypto-funds" exist, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next.What was once a fringe movement has become a globally-traded digital asset.Still, regulators have maintained their skepticism.In March, the SEC rejected an application for a bitcoin ETF from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the brothers who founded the Gemini Trust digital currency exchange.The product would have tracked bitcoins held by Gemini.Gemini did not return a CNBC request for comment.The SEC said in late April it would review its rejection of the ETF.Bitcoin futures would allow institutional investors to buy into the digital currency market without directly investing in bitcoin, which regulations prohibit them from doing."I don't think it increases the chance of a Winklevoss ETF, but a futures-based ETF, it definitely does," said Brian Kelly, a member of the working group for the CME bitcoin futures and a CNBC contributor.He is also head of BKCM, which invests client money in digital assets like bitcoin.Kelly said he expects the SEC could approve a bitcoin ETF in the second quarter of 2018.VanEck did not respond to a CNBC request for comment on the CME news.ProShares declined to comment."There's been basically no institutional money that's flown into bitcoin at all, except the rise of crypto funds," said Spencer Bogart, managing director and head of research at venture capital firm Blockchain Capital.The CME plan for bitcoin futures "is part of a broader theme of opening the floodgates here."However, "I don't know that this really makes a difference to people that haven't jumped in so far," said Greg King, CEO of RexShares, a company that is pursuing its own bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs.The largest ETF company, BlackRock, told CNBC in a statement that it "does not have plans to launch a bitcoin or digital currency ETF."The second-largest ETF issuer, Vanguard, said it does not comment on future product development.The third-largest ETF issuer, State Street, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.A spokeswoman for the fourth-largest ETF company, Invesco, said the company did not have any plans to launch a bitcoin ETF and still doesn't have any plans to do so.JPMorgan, which offers some global benchmark ETFs, declined to comment.
Electronic Arts shares drop after Wall Street raises concerns over 'Star Wars' game sales:::::"Star Wars Battlefront II," Electronic Arts' biggest game this holiday season, is the big question mark for the high-flying stock.The video game publisher reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday and raised guidance for the full year, but its December quarter forecast was slightly below Wall Street estimates.EA shares were down 4.8 percent shortly in early Wednesday trading, after falling as much as 4 percent after-hours on Tuesday following the earnings report."Despite raising F18 guidance, investors may focus on below-consensus F3Q EPS, reflecting some expense timing shifts and lower-margin licensed titles [such as Star Wars]," Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.Sebastian reiterated his outperform rating and $130 price target for EA shares.Jefferies' analyst said he is not totally confident about the financial success of EA's "Star Wars" game release this month, questioning whether users will behave the same way as users of EA's other popular games."If Star Wars can encourage users to spend real money on virtual goods (like FIFA) the game could drive meaningful upside to F'18 and '19 EPS, but this is not a certainty," Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea wrote in a note to clients Wednesday entitled "Star Wars Battlefront 2: A Trick Or a Treat?"One Wall Street analyst said he is worried EA's financial guidance may not be low enough.Though he thinks EA is well positioned for growth over the long-term, with a strong presence in the rapidly growing mobile gaming segment, Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a note, "We think FY18 guidance is not as conservative as usual, and that there are few interesting catalysts to drive incremental investor interest over the next 12 months."Creutz reaffirmed his market perform rating for EA shares and a price target of $106, which is 11 lower than Tuesday's closing price.EA's stock is up 52 percent year to date through Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent gain.The company did not respond to a request for comment on the Wall Street analyst research.
Alibaba’s Jack Ma on e-commerce in China, globalization and Trump:::::And eBay's reaction was to put out a press release saying: Free is not a business model.But in fact, we knew that because we were getting so many people onto Taobao because we were free in the early days.Ultimately, we could make money, Erisman said.There was talk of a partnership with eBay, but then Ma shocked the business world by doing a deal with Yahoo in 2005, where the American company invested $1 billion in Alibaba.But ultimately, it didnt work, Erisman said.The underlying politics of the two countries were sort of destined to rip the companies apart.You can't have a U.S. company like Yahoo that reports up to a sort of a Western set of ideals, really partnering on an equal basis with a Chinese company that has to conform to the Chinese political regulations.There was also a dispute with Yahoo in 2011 when it accused Ma of transferring ownership of Alipay to his own entity, without telling shareholders.After Verizons acquisition of Yahoo completed in June 2017, Yahoo renamed its remaining assets including its stake in Alibaba Altaba.Alibaba also has an advantage because of huge U.S. tech companies including Google and Facebook being blocked in China (although both are said to be hoping to enter the country next year), but the Chinese government is also a threat to its own business people.Anbang Insurance Chairman Wu Xiaohui was said to be detained, in June, possibly due to his links with the U.S. Is that something Ma is concerned about?Well, I think, as businesspeople, me, I do everything to make sure that I'm (keeping) my customers happy, employees happy, the society is good.It's healthy.Social responsibility is the key.Whatever we do, we try to make sure that the society is good.So I don't know what's going on with the others, he told The Brave Ones.Ma talks about three things you should not touch: money, power and glory.If you keep the power in your office, you will be in trouble.If you keep the money in your own pocket, you will be in trouble.If you put the glory in your hand, you will be in trouble.So when you have the money, spend the money supporting more people.When you are in power, empower the others.When the glory, (make sure) the other people have that.Then you will be happy.
Watch: Facebook, Twitter, Google testify before Senate Intelligence Committee:::::[The stream is slated to start at 9:30 a.m., ET.Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]Facebook, Twitter and Google are back before Congress Wednesday, this time testifying in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Executives for the companies testified before congressional judiciary committees Tuesday, during which Facebook announced it would double its security staff and Twitter released some of the Russia-backed tweets sent out around the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The week's hearings could represent a turning point for the internet giants as discussions of foreign influence and regulation come to the fore.Twitter and Facebook have each moved to increase transparency around advertising, after public comments by CEOs Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.The hearings could signal whether Congress intends to more strictly oversee these companies in the future, but according to Bob Peck, head of internet investment banking at Credit Suisse, investors shouldn't worry much for now about the possibility of more regulation on tech.
There's something about the Facebook chart that makes me want to buy, trader says:::::Facebook is at record highs, and TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says there's something in the charts that leads him to believe that the stock has more room to run.The tech giant is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, and Gordon is expecting Facebook to rally based on the company's previous reports.What's more, the trader also says Facebook's charts are signaling that the stock has recently broken out of "consolidation" that began in August."That consolidation appears to be over and it looks like we are beginning to move higher," he said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation.""If we continue to follow this path post-earnings, we should be able to break up through and reach possibly $185, maybe even $190, on a strong earnings beat."That's another 3 to 5 percent higher than where Facebook closed on Tuesday around $180.Since the market is expecting an $8 move in either direction on earnings for Facebook, Gordon wants to set up a "call butterfly spread" to not only go long Facebook, but to also make sure to protect himself against any big swings in the stock post-earnings.A call butterfly spread involves selling two calls at the same strike, and then buying one higher strike call and one lower strike call.In this case, Gordon wants to sell two of the Nov. 3 weekly 185-strike calls, buy one of the Nov. 3 weekly 190-strike calls, and buy one of the Nov. 3 weekly 180-strike calls for a total of about 88 cents, or $88 for the whole spread.With this trade, Gordon would make a maximum profit of about $414, which would occur if Facebook closed right at $185, the middle strike, on Nov. 3 expiration.Profits would trail off, however, the further Facebook closes away from $185 on Nov. 3 expiration, meaning that Gordon would see a maximum loss of $88 if Facebook were to close below $180 or above $190 on Friday."So basically, you're betting that the stock will move up, but in an expected range," he said."Whether the earnings are terrible or absolutely amazing, you have a fixed manageable loss."Facebook is up 56 percent year to date.
Drone delivers fried chicken to a Japanese town hit by a nuclear disaster:::::Drones have started delivering food such as fried chicken to an area of Japan hit by a tsunami and nuclear disaster.Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten used its drones to deliver items from convenience store chain Lawson to Fukushima's Minamisoma City.The area was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and a nuclear accident that followed as a result.The government of Japan began lifting some evacuation orders from the surrounding areas last year, but there remains widespread damage.Since 2013, Lawson has been operating a mobile store whereby it takes a truck stocked with 300 different products to areas that are affected.But it was not able to carry hot food.Now Rakuten is using its drones to deliver hot food, including fried chicken.Residents can place orders at Lawson's mobile outlets.Then an employee will call a larger nearby Lawson store to have the items packed and shipped over by drones.Rakuten launched its drone delivery service in 2016.The drone that delivered the fried chicken flew 2.7 kilometers.It can carry up to 2 kilograms of goods.Rakuten is trialing the service for six months.
Bitcoin smashes through $6,600 to new record high after CME announces plans for futures contracts:::::CME Group's Duffy on bitcoin futures launch: People are looking for more efficient ways to do commerce 17 Hours Ago | 04:04 Bitcoin surpassed $6,500 and $6,600 on Wednesday to hit a new record high after the CME announced plans to launch bitcoin futures later this year.The price of the cryptocurrency hit a high of $6,600.84 just hours after breaking through the $6,400 barrier, and minute after moving past the $6,500 mark, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.Its market capitalization, or the total value of bitcoin in circulation, hit $110 billion.On Tuesday, U.S.-based exchange CME said it would introduce bitcoin futures contracts this quarter, subject to regulatory approval."We've been working with the regulator.They understand our application.And they understand our model very, very well," Terry Duffy, CME Group chairman and CEO, told CNBC.The introduction of such a product could bring more institutional investors into the market.It's believed that this is helping to boost the price.
Microsoft says demand for Xbox One X is 'exactly where we anticipated, even more':::::Demand for Microsoft's Xbox One X console is "super high" ahead of its release next week, the company's head of devices told CNBC on Tuesday.The One X is the high-end version of Microsoft's Xbox games console with souped-up specs aimed at the next generation of gaming.Microsoft is releasing the device on November 7 and it appears demand has matched expectation."I won't talk about the exact numbers but the demand is super high, we are very, very excited about Xbox One X right now," Panos Panay, corporate vice president of devices at Microsoft, told CNBC in a TV interview Tuesday."I won't compare it to other consoles.What I'll say is the demand for Xbox One X right now is exactly where we anticipated, even more so when you see that excitement for the product... this is something that resonates with gamers."But the high demand has also prompted warnings of shortages in some regions.The U.K.'s Xbox head Harvey Eagle said in a recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz that he "can't guarantee that stock will be available in launch week for people to just walk into a store and pick up."One of the major features highlighted when the Xbox One X was announced was its ability to support virtual reality (VR).Sony's PlayStation has a virtual reality offering.So far, however, there has been no VR headset released by Microsoft.
Tech giants rule, and it's not all bad:::::The tech giants are too big.But what if thats not so bad?For a year and a half and more urgently for much of the last month I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.Because these companies control the worlds most important tech platforms, from smartphones to app stores to the map of our social relationships, their power is growing closer to that of governments than of mere corporations.That was on stark display this week, when executives from two of the five, Facebook and Google, along with a struggling second-tier company, Twitter, testified before Congress about how their technology may have been used to influence the 2016 election.More from The New York Times: What to Watch for as Facebook, Twitter and Google Executives Testify on Capitol Hill Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone Sony's Fortunes Improve, From Rising Profit to a Return for Aibo Yet ever since I started writing about what I call the Frightful Five, some have said my very premise is off base.I have argued that the companies size and influence poses a danger.But another argument suggests the opposite that its better to be ruled by a handful of responsive companies capable of bowing to political and legal pressure.In other words, wouldnt you rather deal with five horse-sized Zucks than 100 duck-sized technoforces?The insatiable appetite of digital technology to alter everything in its path is among the most powerful forces shaping the world today.Given all the ways that tech can go wrong as we are seeing in the Russia influence scandal isnt it better that we can blame, and demand fixes from, a handful of American executives when things do go haywire?Thats not ridiculous.Over the past few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords.Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.
Uber rival Grab says you can now pay restaurant bills using its mobile wallet:::::Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab on Wednesday said users can now pay for goods and services in shops and restaurants using GrabPay, the company's mobile wallet.The option is currently available in Singapore, but the company's co-founder, Tan Hooi Ling, told CNBC it will be rolled out simultaneously across Southeast Asia by 2018 if the company gets regulatory approvals.At the moment, Grab has 25 restaurants and food stalls in Singapore that signed up to accept cashless payments using GrabPay and the long-term focus for the company is to target the 20,000 odd merchants in Singapore, as well as businesses across Southeast Asia, who still prefer to use cash.There's no dearth of digital-payment options in Asia due to a pickup in smartphone ownership and the widespread penetration of the internet.But in August, a PayPal study found that cash is still king in many major markets, including those in Southeast Asia.For example, more than 70 percent of the respondents to the PayPal study in the Philippines and Indonesia said they used cash most often.Cash can be hard to keep track of, can be easily misplaced and is inefficient, according to Tan.Still, merchants have not yet moved to cashless payment options "because it's difficult and it's expensive," she said.She pointed to the various points of sales that are accepted in large supermarkets as an example: Setting up those payment options take time and it's also expensive because there is a need to put in the right hardware and to train people."What we're providing is the complete opposite of that: something that is super easy to install, easy to use and something that's going to be affordable for the merchants, as well as the customers," Tan said.Moreover, Tan said, many businesses face high merchant discount rates (MDRs) the transaction fee that is deducted by the payments processor from the total amount received for accepting cashless payments.That, she added, is likely due to costly hardware and sales processes that make the technology inefficient and "more expensive than it needs to be."MDRs are a common way for many digital payments platforms to make money.
Microsoft is working on AI chips across its different devices, top exec says:::::Microsoft is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) chip for its next generation HoloLens headset.And the U.S. technology giant could take it to other products in its hardware range, Panos Panay, corporate vice president of devices at Microsoft, told CNBC on Tuesday.In July, Microsoft disclosed it was working on a processor for the second generation of HoloLens, a headset that allows users to interact and touch digital images overlaid on the real world.Microsoft calls this "mixed reality."The AI chip will allow HoloLens to do things like recognize objects in the line of sight.It marks Microsoft's first foray into AI chips, as it looks to take on rivals such as Apple and Google.The software giant is also looking to expand its offering.When asked by CNBC if Microsoft will introduce AI chips across the device range, Panay said "yes"."We have to continue to find those pieces of silicon, those chipsets that have to be developed to bring sensors to life, to connect people with each other and with their products," Panay told CNBC in a TV interview.Microsoft now has an array of devices.It has expanded its Surface line of tablets, which was launched in 2012, to include a laptop and desktop.It also has the Xbox gaming console and HoloLens headset.There's an arms race in AI chips at the moment.Huawei introduced its own AI chip called the Kirin 970 that it put in the Mate 10 smartphone released earlier this year.Apple's new iPhones also have the company's own A11 bionic chip inside.
HP completes purchase of Samsung printer business:::::HP Inc., maker of printers and personal computers, on Wednesday said it completed its purchase of Samsung Electronics' printer business in a deal valued at $1.05 billion.The acquisition will expand HP's portfolio and help to disrupt the $55 billion A3 copier market with multi-function printers that are simple to use but have the same high performance level as that of copiers, the company said."As we ignite a renaissance in printing, we're thrilled to bring together the industry's best and brightest talent," Dion Weisler, president and CEO at HP, said in a statement."Together, we will build more than 30 years of print leadership to accelerate our strategy, disrupt new market opportunities, and provide our customers and partners with unique and highly innovative print solutions."The acquisition was first announced in September last year.As part of the deal, HP will also have access to more than 6,500 print patents from Samsung and a workforce of nearly 1,300 researchers and engineers that are experts in laser technology, imaging electronics and supplies and accessories.Samsung, as part of the agreement, will make a $100 million to $300 million equity investment in HP through open market purchases.Meanwhile, the PC and printer maker is also looking at 3-D printing as a potential growth area.Weisler told CNBC's Jim Cramer last month that HP got into 3-D printing to get ahead of the inevitable manufacturing disruption.HP said Wednesday it will provide financial guidance on its fourth-quarter earnings call.Previously, executives at the company said they are cautiously optimistic heading into next year.
Sony is bringing back its pet AI project — a robotic dog:::::AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings.The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dog's personality.Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999.It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals."It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics," Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing."I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony's mission (to inspire)."The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog.With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner.Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame.It also said it is considering overseas sales.The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook, Apple and Alphabet's Google.It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world.It also established a venture capital fund to build partnerships with researchers and start-up companies in AI and robotics.Earlier this year, Sony Education launched its first product, Koov, which aims to teach children coding through building and programming robots using plastic blocks.
It's looking like China's getting really excited about the iPhone X:::::Here are the top 5 features of the new Apple iPhone X 6:02 AM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 | 01:33 Chinese consumers are getting very excited about the iPhone X.But for Apple, which has struggled to keep up with the onslaught of competition in China's smartphone market, an upturn in fortunes may not yet be on the cards.Already, Chinese buyers are rushing to get their pre-orders before the official product launch on Friday.JD.com, the country's second-largest e-commerce site after Alibaba's Tmall, received over 2.5 million pre-orders.Other sellers have tallied about another 3 million of such orders.For perspective, Apple sold 44.9 million iPhone units in China in 2016, according to research by intelligence firm IDC.Social media platforms in China are also seeing lively activity about Apple's latest offering, with the term #iPhoneX being read 400 million times thus far.
Sony stock jumps 11% after electronics giant reports 'blow-out set of results':::::Shares of Sony popped on Wednesday morning, touching a nine-year high after rising more than 11 percent early in the session.The move in share price came after the Japanese consumer electronics giant revised upward its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending Mar.31, 2018, and announced expectation-topping quarterly results on Tuesday.The company said it expected full-year profit to come in at 630 billion yen ($5.5 billion) a 26 percent increase from the 500 billion yen it had forecast in August.The revised profit figure was substantially higher than Sony's record 525.7 billion yen profit in 1998 and the 585.5 billion yen the company had been forecast to make this year, according to a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate survey.Reasons for the upward revision included strength in the semiconductor and home entertainment segments, as well as amendments to the assumed foreign exchange rates, the company said.Meanwhile, Sony's operating profit for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2017, rose 346 percent to 204 billion yen ($1.79 billion), beating the 140.5 billion yen estimated in a Reuters survey."This is not your granddad's Sony," Michael Robinson, chief technology strategist at Moneymorning.com, told CNBC's "Squawk Box," indicating that restructuring efforts at the company that began in 2014 under CEO Kazuo Hirai had paid off.
Messaging app Slack is back online after suffering a worldwide service outage:::::Popular workplace messaging service Slack suffered a massive outage late Tuesday evening, leaving users around the world unable to send or receive messages and files.The service failed around 7 p.m.ET and partially resumed by 9:13 p.m.ET.At that time, the company said some users were able to successfully connect to the messaging app, but cautioned the issue is not yet fully fixed.At about 9:35 p.m.ET, the company updated its status page, saying all users should be able to use the messaging app again.The company also apologized for the disruption and thanked users for their patience.Slack has about 9 million weekly active users and is a popular mode of communication among many Silicon Valley firms, Fortune 100 companies and media organizations.On its website, Slack says it has more than 50,000 paying companies that use the service.The messaging app raised $250 million in a funding round led by Japanese tech giant SoftBank in September.That put the company's overall valuation at $5.1 billion.Users took to social media to complain about the service disruption.In true internet fashion, the memes and the jokes soon followed:
This UK fintech is taking on big banks with business loans — and one key EU law is driving it:::::A digital invoice finance platform in the U.K. will provide business loans to its customers for the first time, it was announced Wednesday.Financial technology company MarketInvoice enables businesses to sell their unpaid invoices to provide working capital.The firm said it would expand into the business lending market, pitting it against established players such as U.S. listed peer-to-peer lender LendingClub and Britain's Funding Circle.The latter raised 82 million ($100 million) in funding from venture capital investors earlier this year.Peer-to-peer lenders connect lenders to borrowers through an online platform.Businesses apply for a loan and are matched with an investor.They then repay the loan to the peer-to-peer platform, which is then distributed to the investors.CEO and co-founder Anil Stocker told CNBC that MarketInvoice will take advantage of an incoming European Union regulation called the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which forces banks to open up data about their customers to third party companies."PSD2 is a regulatory change that is going to be a real catalyst for us because we're able to get access to SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) customer information," Stocker said in a phone interview Tuesday."We can use things like machine learning and artificial intelligence to build better credit scores with this data.I think the banks are starting to realize that this world they've had guarded around customer data for so long, now it's starting to open up."
Facebook pledges to double its 10,000-person safety and security staff by end of 2018:::::Facebook, under intensifying pressure from legislators and consumers to clean up its site, is pledging to double the number of people it has working on issues related to safety and security.Colin Stretch, a vice president and general counsel at Facebook, testified before senators on Tuesday alongside executives from Twitter and Google.He told them that Facebook's staff focused on sensitive security and community issues will grow to 20,000 by the end of next year."Today, across our safety, security, and product and community operation teams, we have about 10,000 people who are working on safety and security generally," Stretch said during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing related to Russian interference in the 2016 election."We're committed to investing more and doubling that number by the end of 2018."That's an enormous personnel commitment for Facebook.As of June 30, the company had a total of 20,658 employees.The groups that specifically focus on terrorist content include thousands of workers broadly and 150 who spend all their time removing terrorism-related content, Stretch said.In 2016, Facebook's total headcount grew from 12,691 employees to 17,048.Facebook has already said that it would hire 3,000 content moderators to review and take down videos of violence and suicide attempts.The company also previously said it would hire 1,000 more people to review and take down ads.This additional 10,000 is inclusive of the 4,000 already planned.The company said some of the new hires will be contractors.The testimony comes just ahead of Facebook's quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, and amid a series of congressional hearings on the role of advertising companies in the election.Facebook has told investors for some time that it would continue to invest in staffing, despite slowing revenue growth.In its last annual report, Facebook said rising costs were largely the result of increased hiring in research and development and sales and marketing.Facebook shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $180.06 on Tuesday.With reporting by CNBC's Julia Boorstin
Cramer's charts show that red-hot software stocks like Adobe have more room to run:::::Technology is a favorite sector on Wall Street, so CNBC's Jim Cramer felt it was his duty to see if investors were too late to buy into one of its top groups: the software stocks."It's good to be a software company right now," the "Mad Money" host said."Whenever you see this kind of move, the natural impulse is to ask yourself: have you missed it?"So Cramer recruited the help of technician Bob Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three brains behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks Newsletter."Long story short, [Lang] thinks many of the high-quality, cloud-based software stocks have more room to run, from long-time Cramer-faves like Autodesk and Adobe, to smaller players that I've never talked about, ever: Ansys and PTC," Cramer said.Cramer started by looking at the daily chart of Autodesk, the top producer of computer-aided design software that helps architects, investors and other professionals create digital blueprints.Recently, Autodesk transitioned from selling its products for high licensing fees to a software-as-a-service model, and it's started to pay off, driving Autodesk's stock higher in October.Lang said that the chart's Chaikin Money Flow Oscillator, which measures buying and selling pressure, showed a high volume of money flowing into the stock, likely from institutional investors."Lang thinks that Autodesk could easily head from [its current price of $124] up to $140, and that's in the not too distant future.He's right.It's not too late.I think the stock's terrific," Cramer said.Shares of Adobe have also skyrocketed, especially after the digital media giant's recentearnings beat.Like Autodesk, Lang said Adobe's daily chart suggested strong institutional buying.In addition, Adobe's Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator, which helps technicians track changes in a stock's path before they happen, recently made a bullish crossover, which is typically a glaring buy signal, Cramer said."Put it all together and Lang thinks Adobe could be headed from $175 to the high $180s real soon," the "Mad Money" host said."Ideally, you'd want to buy Adobe into weakness.That means if you can get any."Finally, Cramer turned to two smaller cloud plays, Ansys and PTC.The daily chart of Ansys has been tracking good volume in the stock, and its MACD indicator made a bullish crossover about a month ago.Since then, Ansys shares have gained 10 percent.But Lang expected a pullback in Ansys to $132, at which point he recommended investors pull the trigger on the stock.As for PTC, which makes engineering and computer-aided design software, Lang got many of the same bullish signals from the volume and trajectory indicators on its daily chart, which heated up after the company's quarterly earnings report last week.Lang predicted that PTC's $66 stock could run up to $80 a share in the near future, and recommended that investors buy up shares on any pullback, however rare."The bottom line?When a group that's very much in vogue with the Wall Street fashion show gives you a series of excellent quarters, like we've seen with these cloud based software plays, the stocks just keep climbing.That's classic bull market behavior," Cramer said."And the charts, as interpreted by Bob Lang?Well, they suggest that Autodesk, Adobe, Ansys and PTC have a lot more room to run."
Unauthorized drones are buzzing a Washington, D.C. military base twice a day, study finds:::::Unauthorized drones are flying an average of twice a day above critical military infrastructure just 4 miles from the White House, according to new study from drone-detection start-up Dedrone and the Department of Defense."This is a concerning rate," Dedrone CEO Jorg Lamprecht told CNBC, "especially in light of international incidents where drones have crashed into other aircraft, and been used by terrorists, and used in other illicit activities."In one recent example, the Islamic State used a small drone to bomb an ammunition dump at a stadium in Syria, setting off a chain of explosions.And this September, a civilian drone crashed into a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter.
Cancer-detecting start-up Grail is seeking more funding, mere months after raising $900 million:::::Grail, the cancer detection start-up backed by tech giants Alphabet and Amazon, is already seeking new funding, mere months after it closed a $900 million round in March.The company had previously raised $100 million in 2016.Grail is primarily pitching sovereign funds, with mixed success, according to two sources familiar.It has approached Softbank and Mubadala, Abu Dhabi's $125 billion sovereign fund, according to one of the people.The start-up is primarily planning to use the funds for its massive breast cancer trial that it announced in April of this year.That study involves analyzing the blood of 120,000 women in many different locations.But the company has also had some other expenses that may be pushing it back to the fund-raising market.Grail announced in March that some of the proceeds from its financing would be used to buy a large portion of its shares from parent company Illumina, reducing Illumina's ownership to a minority stake.The aggregate purchase price was $278 million, according to a public filing.It also shelled out more than $100 million to merge with a Chinese company called Cirina, according to one of the sources.Cirina is developing an early-stage commercial test for a type of cancer called nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Additional funds were earmarked for another expensive clinical study, its Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas Study (CCGA), which involves enrolling 10,000 participants.This study is meant to give Grail a more detailed map of cancer genetics.The company declined to comment on its financing plans, but said "we are always in touch with the capital markets."Meanwhile, the company has seen multiple senior leaders depart in recent months, including former CEO Jeff Huber, formerly of Google; data scientist Franz Och; and former head of clinical development Mark Lee.These departures were previously reported by Buzzfeed.Business development lead Elaine Cheung also departed recently, according to her LinkedIn profile.When Grail burst onto the scene in 2016, it announced an ambitious objective to have its first test on the market within three years.The idea behind such early-detection tests, which are in development by Grail and its chief competitors Guardant Health and Freenome, is to catch cancer early by picking up signals of free-floating tumor DNA in the bloodstream.The hope is that at that point, it would be easier and cheaper to treat.The biggest challenges to get these tests to market include price -- the tests might be too expensive to get covered by insurers -- and high rates of both false positives and negatives.For that reasons, these companies need to invest heavily on clinical studies.
Electronic Arts shares slip 3 percent after earnings release:::::Electronic Arts dips on after revenue in line with expectations 15 Hours Ago | 01:11 Electronic Arts reported quarterly revenue that met analysts' expectations on Tuesday.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Revenue: $1.18 billion vs. $1.18 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.For the full year, EA said it expects net bookings of $5.15 billion, as compared with Wall Street estimates of $5.20 billion.Shares slipped 3 percent in after-hours trading.Net bookings came in at $1.18 billion, up from $1.10 billion a year ago.Analysts expected a strong quarter with sustained momentum into fiscal year 2019, as EA expands into live and mobile game offerings.CFO Blake Jorgensen said the company saw a marked shift to digital in the company's sports titles."Our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance," Jorgensen said in a statement.As one of the most established names in the gaming industry, EA stands poised to monopolize the growth in the industry if it can successfully move into new formats.As of its Tuesday close, the stock had gained more than 50 percent on the year.Analysts looked to the release of a second "Star Wars" action-adventure game, "Star Wars: Battlefront II," to drive growth for fiscal year 2018.Earlier this month, EA announced it would delay a separate Star Wars title because it would shutter the studio producing the game.This is breaking news.Please check back for updates.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that EA delayed the release of a separate "Star Wars" game.An earlier version of this story misstated which title would be delayed.
If you buy the iPhone X, you might want to take the AppleCare+ offer seriously:::::It's becoming more and more worthwhile to sign up for Apple's repair and protection services.The latest iPhone, the iPhone X, opened for preorder on Oct. 27 and hits stores Nov. 3.The pricey phone starts at $999, and every iPhone comes with a standard 90 days of support and one year of repairs.But to get AppleCare+, it will cost you an additional $199.An Apple Care+ plan extends coverage to 2 years of support and repairs, with a $29 fee for screen damage and a $99 fee for other damage, including accidents.And if you decide to opt out of purchasing that plan, it's going to cost you more than ever before to repair your iPhone X.A screen repair costs $279 on the iPhone X without AppleCare+, while "other damage" costs $549.That's the same price as a new iPhone 7.Those repair costs are a big leap from previous models which makes sense, given that the iPhone X is made with more cutting-edge materials, such as a glass-covered chassis and OLED display.On the plus side, Apple told Reuters it expects to expand screen repair capabilities by the end of this year to about 400 authorized third parties in 25 countries.Apple also covers shipping if you send your phone in for repairs and gives you a loaner, and can do a lot of services through the Apple Support app.Here are all the fees for repairs on phones outside of AppleCare+ and out of warranty:
Why Apple earnings could be a ‘sell the news’ event:::::Apple is set to report its quarterly earnings after the bell on Thursday, and while the market is largely expecting the company to beat its earnings expectations, some have a more bearish outlook.Even amid the company's recent iPhone X launch and generally positive reviews out on Tuesday, Apple has lost some of its edge, said Boris Schlossberg, foreign exchange strategist at BK Asset Management."I think it's very much 'sell the news' at this point.I think everyone is focused on a number.But it may be worthwhile to think about feelings at this point.Apple is a luxury company, and the worst thing a luxury company can do is lose its cool, and I say this very much as an Apple fanboy.Apple has really lost a lot of its cool over the last two years because its products just have not been up to spec in many ways," Schlossberg said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."He pointed specifically to apparent issues surrounding the new operating system."I think it's going to be very interesting to see if the X really rescues them ... if it becomes that cool object, or it becomes an object of derision as we go forward.So to me, the jury is very much still out.There's an enormous amount of enthusiasm," he said, adding, "I remain highly skeptical that they're going to get the kind of demand the market is looking for."After past iPhone release dates, Apple shares have reacted differently.In September 2012, in the month following the iPhone 5, the stock fell nearly 13 percent.In 2014, in the month after the iPhone 6 release date, Apple shares fell 2 percent.Last year, in the month following the iPhone 7 release, shares rose 6 percent.This year, since the iPhone 8 release on Sept. 22, the stock is up a little more than 10 percent.From a momentum perspective, some are cautious on the stock, which has gained nearly $81 billion in market cap since its Sept. 25 low."I'd be pretty cautious about running into the stock, but I wouldn't run away from it.My expectation is that the earnings are good and the holiday season is once again kind to Apple," said Max Wolff, chief economist at Disruptive Technology Advisers.The stock has rallied more than 45 percent this year."That being said, there are real and serious problems with iOS 11....The problem is that's on all the phones, so people have tended to associate that with the [iPhone] 8 and the [iPhone] 8 plus only, but it's also obviously on the 10.We think the 10 is going to be a big hit.The question is more, if the 8 and 8 plus are a little bit of a fizzle," Wolff added.Gene Munster, partner at Loup Ventures and a widely followed Apple watcher, wrote in a recent note that the iPhone X will be a "make or break" story for the tech giant's shares over the next year.The stock hit an all-time in Tuesday trading.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Lamborghini's Huracan successor will be a hybrid:::::Lamborghini's next version of its Huracan will be a plug-in hybrid, according to Autocar.The car is scheduled for release in 2022.It is the second hybrid vehicle Lamborghini plans to make.The Italian carmaker plans to debut its hybrid Urus SUV in December.The vehicle will offer an electric-only mode, Autocar said.Lamborghini was not immediately available for comment to CNBC.Some of Lamborghini's fellow high-end automakers, such as Ferrari, have moved toward developing hybrid models.However, executives from both Lamborghini and Ferrari have said neither company has plans to develop fully electric models yet.But if governments push carmakers toward ever lower emissions targets, these automakers may be shut out of entire markets if they don't meet standards, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a recent note.Moreover, Tesla has garnered praise for its quick, fast electric cars, such as the Model S P100DL.Competition could also push legacy performance manufacturers toward making all-electric vehicles.However, Jonas said some fans of high-end performance cars liken driving an electric Ferrari to eating a 3-D printed soy doughnut just not the same.Read the full story at Autocar.
Julie Larson-Green leaves Microsoft:::::Microsoft on Tuesday confirmed that a longtime executive, Julie Larson-Green, is leaving the company.The news comes a few months after Larson-Green stepped back from her role as chief experience officer for Office productivity as she was recovering from surgery.Larson-Green joined Microsoft in 1993, a year after the arrival of the company's current CEO, Satya Nadella.She was once seen as a potential candidate to replace former CEO Steve Ballmer, but Nadella was ultimately chosen for that task.Larson-Green has held top roles in Microsoft's Windows and hardware groups, but most recently she was focused on Office in the age of the cloud.She was one of Microsoft's most prominent female executives.Tuesday is her last day there."We thank Julie for the numerous contributions she's made to Microsoft over the last 25 years, and we wish her the very best in her new endeavors," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.ZDNet previously reported the news.Larson-Green's role was leading "engineering and design of the Office productivity experiences that make it easy for people to access information, connect with others and accomplish tasks across all their devices," she wrote on her LinkedIn profile.Larson-Green previously worked under another Microsoft veteran, Steven Sinofsky, until Sinofsky left his position as head of Windows in 2012.At that point she took over Windows software and hardware engineering.Last year Larson-Green told Business Insider that she was the one who removed the Clippy virtual assistant from Office apps like Microsoft Word in 2007."We were just ahead of our time with the technology," she said.In May, The Information said that most of the people who had been reporting to Larson-Green will now report to company veteran Jeff Teper, corporate vice president of Office, OneDrive and SharePoint.
The space industry will be worth nearly $3 trillion in 30 years, Bank of America predicts:::::Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees the size of the space industry octupling over the next three decades, to at least $2.7 trillion."We are entering an exciting era in space where we expect more advances in the next few decades than throughout human history," the firm wrote in a report on Monday.As the cost of space access plummets, BofAML joined Morgan Stanley among Wall Street investment banks bullish on the extraterrestrial industry.Both put the space market today at around $350 billion, but BofAML's outlook is nearly triple Morgan Stanley's expectation of a $1.1 trillion market by 2040."A raft of new drivers," BofAML said, is pushing the "Space Age 2.0": reusable launch by SpaceX, the growth of private ownership in the market, investment by more than 80 countries and the falling launch costs from vehicles by the likes of Rocket Lab and Vector.The firm cautioned that this is a market where companies traditionally have had trouble turning profits."However, for investors with a truly long-term time horizon, we see it as one of the final frontiers of investing," BofAML said.There are only five "pure play" companies defined as having 100 percent of sales in the space business in the firm's report.All five work with satellites, with ViaSat and Intelsat SA based in the U.S., while Inmarsat, SES and Eutelsat are based in Europe.The companies are also fairly small, with values ranging from $500 million to $9.6 billion.While the report highlights more than 70 global stocks, the remainder have medium-to-low exposure to the space industry's growth.Other opportunities range from incumbent aerospace and defense companies Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman to technology giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft.Space is "a hotbed for disruptive technologies," the firm said.Today's benefit from satellites is nearly immeasurable, and massive projects such as the International Space Station or the Stratolaunch aircraft are possible only through the industry's growth.
Billionaire Alibaba founder Jack Ma is going to be a movie star next. Literally:::::Alibaba founder Jack Ma may be sitting at the helm of an e-commerce giant racing towards a $500 billion market capitalization and competing against Amazon, but the 53-year-old former English teacher, who is now worth almost $40 billion, is clearly taking time to enjoy life.The tech exec will star in a short movie promoting the benefits of tai chi called "Gong Shou Dao" to be released November 11, according to a statement published in Alizila, a site where Alibaba publishes news about the company and its leadership.Ma will star alongside Natasha Liu Bordizzo, the star of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," retired sumo Grand Champion Asashoryu Akinori and actor and stuntman, Tony Jaa, to name a few.None of the people appearing in the movie will be paid, according to the statement.
Netflix suspends 'House of Cards' as company looks into Kevin Spacey sexual assault allegation:::::Netflix suspended production on "House of Cards" as it investigates a sexual assault allegation against the show's lead star Kevin Spacey."MRC [Media Rights Capital] and Netflix have decided to suspend production on 'House of Cards' season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew," Netflix and production company Media Rights Capital said in a joint statement.Executives are on set this week to discuss the situation with the cast and crew, the company added on Twitter.The news comes a few days after actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed actor Kevin Spacey had made a sexual advance toward him at a party when he was 14 in 1986.Spacey said on Twitter he did not remember the incident, but apologized at "what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior."The critically-acclaimed "House of Cards" was Netflix's first original series.The company announced on Monday the upcoming sixth season would be the final season.Sources close to the situation said the decision to end the series was made before the reports about Spacey's inappropriate conduct surfaced.Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in BuzzFeed.
The backbone of all this technology we are using is breaking out:::::Chip stocks are surging, and it bodes well for the broader technology sector.Samsung Electronics posted a record third-quarter profit Tuesday and gave a bullish outlook for 2018 due to strong demand for its memory chips, driving the semiconductor industry shares higher.Memory maker Micron's stock rose 6 percent following the report.The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is now up more than 8 percent this month, hitting a 17-year high and on pace for its best monthly performance since July 2016.The chip sector ETF is up 42 percent this year through midday Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 15 percent return.PC industry stalwart Intel is up more than 19 percent this month, on pace for its best month since October 2003.The company's shares surged after it reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings last week."Chips stocks are the probably the most influential group in technology and tech is the largest component of the S&P 500," LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick wrote in an email."We've seen chips continue to soar and as long as this group leads, it is a positive overall sign for the bull market."Using Kensho, a quantitative tool used by hedge funds, CNBC searched for the performance of tech sector ETFs after the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF rose by at least 5 percent over a month.Since chips are an essential building block for almost all technology products, the relationship between chip stocks and technology shares returns is not a surprise.The findings show the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF rose roughly 1.4 percent on average the following month in the last decade after strong chip sector returns, according to Kensho.Jefferies strategist Sean Darby also believes technology stocks are headed higher.He reiterated his "modestly bullish" rating on the sector Monday."One sector in the S&P 500 that tends to benefit the most from a 'Goldilocks' environment of a weak dollar, buoyant overseas demand, consumer and corporate spending is the technology sector," he wrote in a note to clients."In turn, this is being reflected with some of the best forward sales and earnings revisions."Disclosure: NBCUniversal, parent of CNBC, is a minority investor in Kensho.
Senate Intel Chairman: Russians on Social Media Did Not Elect Trump:::::Mr. Burr noted that five times more ads were targeted to Maryland, a safely Democratic state, than Wisconsin, a swing state that Mr. Trump narrowly carried.He said that more ads were targeted to Washington, D.C., an overwhelmingly Democratic area, than Pennsylvania.And he said that of the $1,979 spent ads in Wisconsin, all but $54 was spent before the primary.He went on, but the message was clear.This isnt about relitigating the 2016 presidential election.This isnt about who one and who lost, Mr. Burr said.This is about national security.This is about corporate responsibility.And this is about the deliberate and multifaceted manipulation of the American people by agents of a hostile foreign power.Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, picked up the line of questioning, as he pressed social media executives on the content of Russian advertising.My view of this is this is a whole lot broader than simply the 2016 election, he said.The executives agreed that Russian efforts were geared more toward sowing social discord that advocating directly for Mr. Trump or against Hillary Clinton.But as Democrats noted, discord helped Mr. Trumps grievance-based campaign.The Russian effort was to sow conflict and discontent all over this country, said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.Facebook defends reasons for taking down ads.As senators pressed Facebooks general counsel, Colin Stretch, on Facebooks role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebooks explanation has been the issue of authentic accounts.Since Facebook went public with its findings, the companys reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That distinction is key for Facebook.Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.We dont take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share, Mr.Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they werent fake.Does it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?Mr. Burr asked Facebooks general counsel.Mr.Stretch didnt directly answer.The authenticity issue is the key, Mr.Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.Ads were only one way Russia influenced the election Political ads are just part of the problem, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said at Wednesdays first hearing.Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race.On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.For Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans.However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg, Mr. Warner said.The real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twitter is still lowballing Russian intrusion.Earlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported.But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 bots that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election.The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.The new numbers still seem low, according to Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.Video Im concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation.Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts or potentially 48 million accounts are fake or automated, Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.With Facebooks acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, tells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem, Mr. Burr said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Your actions need to catch up to your responsibilities, he added.The executives left a judiciary subcommittee wanting.Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better.The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases would protect the United States from outside influence.Im trying to get us down from La-La Land here, said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month.Every minute.Probably every second.You dont have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online.In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.The House committee will release copies of the Russian ads.The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.The top Republican and Democrat leading the investigation, Representatives Mike Conaway of Texas and Adam Schiff of California, pledged to do so this month after a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks chief operating officer.A few of the ads have leaked out, and others have been described by people who have viewed them, but the release should help cast new light on the Russian efforts.Facebooks bullish posture to Wall Street.Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the days second hearing.The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With its stock trading at a record high and the companys market capitalization over $500 billion more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan Facebooks business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments.But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting.Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.The problem is worse than originally thought.Facebook, Twitter and Google said on Monday, before their testimony, that the problems on the platforms were much worse than initially disclosed, illustrating the breadth and complexity of Russian efforts.According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Googles YouTube service.The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, has been sharply critical of Twitter, in particular, telling reporters in September that the companys initial efforts showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and organic posts harnessed by foreign powers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Transparency in advertising alone, however, is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages, Mr. Schiff said recently.
Tech Executives Are Contrite About Election Meddling, but Make Few Promises on Capitol Hill:::::Since then, the company has scrambled to appease lawmakers by promising to hire more than 1,000 people to manually review political ad purchases and to make public the funding behind those ads.Video The foreign interference we saw was reprehensible, Colin Stretch, Facebooks general counsel, told senators.The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us and one that we are determined to meet, said Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.At the heart of the companies problems are business models that reward viral content which can include misinformation and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday.In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr.Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.Im trying to get us down from La-La Land here, Mr. Kennedy said.The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month.Every minute.Probably every second.You dont have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?Photo Mr.Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries.Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow, Mr. Graham said.What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.Facebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television.In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.Our midterms are 370 days away, and we dont have time to mess around with dialogue anymore, Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing.Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlins agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last years election.Photo Russia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States, said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Their goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.That assertion was at odds with the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump, going beyond just posting disruptive content on social media.Russian operatives also hacked Democratic email accounts and released messages embarrassing to Hillary Clintons campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Graham asked Mr.Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trumps candidacy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.During the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton, Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr.Stretch.After the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trumps legitimacy.Is that what you saw on Facebook?Mr.Stretch agreed.But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr.Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.Photo In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?Mr. Franken said.But Mr.Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.The reason Im hesitating on foreign currency is its relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies, Mr.Stretch said.So its a signal, but not enough.That response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better, Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged.In addition to Facebooks admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform.Twitter said the agency published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter.On Wednesday, the top lawyers for all three companies will appear before the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Russian election meddling.Tuesdays hearing exposed a much deeper struggle for Facebook, which is trying to tread a delicate line as a technology platform while also fighting against hate speech, violence and misinformation on its site.I like that they are contrite, but these issues are existential and they arent taking any structural changes, said Tim Wu, a professor of law at Columbia University.These are Band-Aids.
The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants:::::The Five Can Be Governed Tech is inherently messy.The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them.This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow.The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of todays tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda.People have worried about the internets capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation.But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs it was never conceivable to limit that eras equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is.Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression.But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.This is new stuff everybody is dealing with its not easy, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of Big Is Beautiful, a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies.(The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.)So when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier.Youve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.The Five Hate Each Others Guts Over the past few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome so why was I including their company in that group?Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was an odd line.As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed to control the fortunes of innovative start-ups.But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff.This dynamic where each company competes mightily against the others suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote Big Is Beautiful with Mr. Atkinson.As long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then whats to complain about?You can see this in their product road maps.None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies.And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.So, why preemptively say that maybe well be harmed in the future that in 2030 theyll jack up their prices or something?Mr. Lind asked.Well, deal with that as it comes.The Five Are American-Grown The Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale.Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects where a product like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.But it wasnt inevitable that these companies would be based in and controlled from the United States.And its not obvious that will remain the case the top tech companies of tomorrow might easily be Chinese, or Indian or Russian or European.But for now, that means we are dealing with companies that feel constrained by American laws and values.Yes, this is jingoistic; the idea of a handful of American tech giants controlling much of society has helped push regulators internationally to try to limit their power.But we would almost certainly do the same if a bunch of foreign companies attempted to take over our economy.At least its our own giants that we have to fear.I dont mean this list to get the Five off the hook.How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America.But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As I said, tech is messy.
The iPhone X Arrives Friday. Here’s What You Need to Know.:::::Paying for It Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.There are various ways to pay that hefty price.The simplest route is to pay for the device outright.This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier whenever you want.You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan.For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month.This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually.Its essentially leasing a new phone every year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Internetting With Amanda Hess Our critic discusses everything thats wrong, weird and totally sad about the internet in five videos.Sign-up for email notifications.There are various early upgrade plans on the market.With Apples early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once youve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate.(Im not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8 Before you splurge, consider your options.Apples iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799.The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.So whats the difference?Mainly, the screen.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels the border surrounding the display whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ.The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner.The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a persons head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments.The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.Photo How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner.The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.Face ID is brand new there hasnt been anything like it on a smartphone before.It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots.The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.Because the shape of a persons head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone elses face is one in a million, according to Apple.Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device.All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera which some people already did with Samsungs facial-recognition feature.The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces.If youre skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.
A Stylus That Works for Tablet and Wallet:::::Q.What is the difference between a $100 tablet stylus compared with a $10 model?A.Those pricier styluses are often designed to work with a specific tablet line as is the case of the Apple Pencil, the Google Pixelbook Pen and the Microsoft Surface Pen and can include customized features for those devices.For example, Googles Pixelbook Pen integrates with the Google Assistant software and will search the web for words or images you circle on the Pixelbook screen.Photo If you are just looking for a stylus to take handwritten notes or do some basic drawing, the less expensive models are probably fine.The $10 Adonit Mark, the $20 Hand Stylus and the thick-barreled $25 Studio Neat Cosmonaut are all general purpose models that work on most capacitive touch screen devices.Unlike the more expensive stylus models, which sometimes require their own battery power or Bluetooth pairing with a designated tablet, most economy models do not need to be powered and work right out of the package.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.For those with artistic inclinations or who want a stylus that was designed to work smoothly with certain tablet hardware and software, the more expensive models have perks.Most include a wider degree of tilt and pressure sensitivity, which lets you vary the weight and shading of the lines drawn on the tablet screen, much like a pen on paper.The higher-end tablet pens are often more responsive, with less lag time between when you put the tip to the glass and when you see your handwriting or sketches appear.Forking over a hundred dollars for a digital writing stick may be too much of an extravagance for many people.In the middle ground, you can also find accessories that offer more features than the basic models but cost less than a high-end stylus.The $40 Sensu Artist Brush & Stylus includes two artists tools (including a digital paintbrush) in one device that works with most touch screens, while the $75 Adonit Pixel promises smooth response, pressure sensitivity and shortcut buttons, all while working on a wider variety of iOS devices than the Apple Pencil.
Spoiler Alert: ‘Great British Bake Off’ Winner Is Named (on Twitter):::::(This season has not aired in the United States, where the series is broadcast as The Great British Baking Show because of copyright issues.If youd like to avoid all spoilers, look away now.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sophie Faldo, a 33-year-old former army officer, triumphed over the other finalists, Kate Lyon and Steven Carter-Bailey, by dazzling the judges in the final showstopper round with a seven-layer cake known as an entremet.Called Ode to the Honey Bee, it featured lavender mousse, honey custard, blackberry jelly and lemon curd.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I just disbelieve it, Ms. Faldo said after the results were announced.The idea of winning was such a minute possibility.I dont think Ill forget this for as long as I live.The current season, the eighth broadcast in Britain, has been rocked by drama, even before the first episode aired.Producers said last September that the show would leave the BBC for a rival network, Channel 4.Despite some initial grumbles about the introduction of commercials, which are not shown on the publicly funded BBC, the show has averaged 8.9 million viewers a week.(The BBC version of the series had about 13.5 million viewers each week, although the national broadcaster generally has bigger audiences.)The move also meant major alterations to the cast: Three of the four hosts the celebrity chef Mary Berry and the comedians Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc said they would not follow the show to Channel 4.Only the baker Paul Hollywood stayed on as a judge.Ms. Leith signed on as a judge, and the comedians Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding became hosts.Beyond the casting changes, the format stayed true to the original formula.Channel 4 said that Bake Off would return for another season with the same cast.Applications for contestants are already open.
Sony’s Fortunes Improve, From Rising Profit to a Return for Aibo:::::It remains a bit player in smartphones, the product that made Apples fortune, but sustained demand for the devices has enriched Sony regardless.It is a major supplier of image-sensing circuits used in smartphone cameras, including the iPhones, which means it has shared, to some degree, in its competitors success.Sony has also closed or sold off costly factories.It still sells televisions under its brand name, but like Apple its focus now is on design and marketing rather than production, which is increasingly left to contractors.Other businesses, like the PlayStation video gaming line and an insurance company that Sony part-owns in Japan, have been steadily profitable.Its entertainment arm is more financially volatile, but it has lately profited from hits like Spider-Man: Homecoming.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.All of that added up to what Atul Goyal, an analyst at the securities firm Jefferies, called blowout results for Sonys latest quarter.The company said on Tuesday it had earned an operating profit before taxes and other reductions of 204 billion yen, or about $1.79 billion, in the three months through September.That was more than four times what it made in the same period last year.Sony also upgraded its profit forecast for the full financial year, which ends in March, from 500 billion to 630 billion, which would be an all-time high if realized.Investors piled into Sonys shares on Wednesday in response.The stock closed up 11 percent at 4,918, the highest level since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008.Japanese share prices have been buoyant across the board lately, and the countrys benchmark Nikkei 225 index has reached multidecade highs while Wall Street and other markets have also surged.Still, Sony was Japans most sought-after stock on Wednesday.Lovers of the Aibo might be tempted to see karma at work.Sony first introduced the dog in 1999, saying it hoped robotic animal companions would become as ubiquitous as the real thing.That never happened, and Sony stopped making the Aibo in 2006, as it struggled to rein in losses.The mechanical dogs small but devoted fan base was crushed.Sony hopes that the world is now ready for artificially intelligent consumer robots, and that it can be a leader in the quickly advancing technology.The new Aibo uses Sonys image sensors to interact with the world around it, and the company says it will be capable of learning, to a limited degree for instance by repeating behaviors that owners praise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dog goes on sale in Japan in January for 198,000, or about $1,750.Combining robotics and A.I.is a way for Sony to play on its strengths, Sonys chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, who has driven the companys restructuring since taking over in 2012, said at a news conference.We have multiple projects in development, and one of them is Aibo.
Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren’t):::::There is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences, said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoors chief economist.At LinkedIn, researchers identified the skills most in demand.The top 10 last year were all computer skills, including expertise in cloud computing, data mining and statistical analysis, and writing smartphone applications.In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories.In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy.But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.When it gets generalized to all of STEM, its misleading, said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.Were misleading a lot of young people.Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey.Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.IF physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Insight Data Science Fellows Program, which has offices in New York, Boston, Seattle and Palo Alto, Calif., began its first training program five years ago and now has 900 alumni working at companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Amazon and Microsoft.Jake Klamka, a physicist who founded the program, kept hearing from Silicon Valley executives that they had considered hiring traditional scientists, but converting them to technologists seemed time-consuming and risky.So Mr. Klamka decided he would start a company to provide scientists a smoother pathway into the tech industry.Carlos Faham made that passage.He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships.His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics.After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life.By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research.His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country.For the pricey Bay Area, he wasnt making enough.A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research.He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower.He couldnt get an in-person interview.He was told his background was too academic.He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.It was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling, he recalled.Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015.There was no formal course work.Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video and training for interviews.That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking.Interviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again, he said.After the program, he received six job offers.He accepted the offer from LinkedIn.(Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is extremely rich and it moves so much faster than my previous world.He makes a pretty good six-figure salary, about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training.After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist.She works on a team that creates software tools for the centers doctors, nurses and researchers.One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain.Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline.So technology and the other STEM fields merge.That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July.The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology.Berkeleys Foundations of Data Science course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.The choice of the term division rather than institute, explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach.We want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them, he said.This is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.
Not the Bots We Were Looking For:::::This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums.But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation.Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale.While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them.(Their provenance remains murky even today.)Photo Anonymous social bots are obviously distinct from carefully designed software programmed in good faith.Technologically speaking, the efforts of Facebook and Google and Amazon represent the forefront of A.I.research, while crudely scripted social bots must merely clear the low bar of passing for an angry stranger.They were, in the memorable words of one researcher, yelling fools, promoting partisan messages and disinformation or merely registering their simulated agreement or anger, appearing maniacally focused, but not conclusively inhuman.A personal-assistant bot interacts with its users, whereas this breed of social-media bot stages performances for audiences and algorithms alike.But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping.Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil.Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this years German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army.In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts including the bots as just out of control.The phrase not a bot now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots).At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitters uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Somewhere between the automated yelling fools of online political discourse and commercial techs dream of increasingly sophisticated helpers is a third sort of social bot, which is both foolish and sophisticated in its own way.My longest and most fruitful relationship with a bot like this began through a private chat group I have with a handful of friends.We installed, as a member of the group, a free piece of software called Hubot officially designed as a coding assistant for workplace chat apps, but which we customized mainly for work avoidance.Most often, Hubot performed menial tasks calling up photos or animations, performing various sorts of searches but it soon came to function as a sort of group storytelling sidekick, developing something like a personality.Hubot lurked, responded and interjected, accumulating an intimate set of routinized in-jokes.Eventually, it learned to (obliviously and dutifully) summon fresh pictures of a famous actor in the service of a joke the origins of which, after a few years, none of us could even remember.It was, like all bots, a tool.What made all the difference was that we were the ones using it, and not as is the case with the bots that have inserted themselves into our national discourse and our living rooms the other way around.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A 2016 essay by the New York-based think tank Data & Society a so-called botifesto identified this playful sort of bot as an evolutionary precursor to the various expressions of bothood today.The essay described how mindfully created bots, not unlike our version of Hubot, had been functioning in the wild, on public social media.Some were jokes and larks, whose very botness is funny, surreal or poetic: bots that used a social-media personalitys corpus to create a (usually funny, always revealing) surrogate account, or bots that automated the dispersal of information in controlled, open and even journalistic ways.But the botifestos intention was to sound an alarm.Less transparent social bots primarily on Twitter and other social platforms posed a risk to media and discourse.Platforms, governments and citizens must step in and consider the purpose and future of bot technology before manipulative anonymity becomes a hallmark of the social bot, the authors cautioned.This warning wasnt just a prediction; it was based in observation.Anonymous bots masquerading as citizen and political actors had been a creeping feature in foreign elections for years.The 2012 election of President Enrique Pea Nieto of Mexico was supported by armies of automated social-media accounts, which flooded Twitter with supportive messages.Peabots became a feature of online Mexican political discourse through at least 2015.But bots hadnt yet run rampant on American tech companies home turf.Manipulation by A.I.was typically seen as something that was happening somewhere else, M.C.Elish, a researcher at Data & Society who contributed to the report, told me.We only notice something when its arrived on our doorstep.This arrival is likely to result in action.Twitter, for example, insists that it has been working hard on the problem.One of the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of manipulative anonymity among researchers in the field is some form of bot disclosure a requirement, enforced by social platforms, that an account operated by third-party software disclose that fact.(Wikipedia, for example, already does this.)Bot disclosure could plausibly stem the tide of bots intended to exert crude influence or to harass people.Humans would, in theory, be able to interact with bots electively, and to better judge some sources of information or expressions of sentiment.A grand sorting could begin to restore order, but Twitters discourse nightmare didnt start with bots and wont end with them.Social automation is both disruptive and revealing.Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there and of course theyd closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves.Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the worlds most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces.Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down.What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, its necessary that we build spaces for ourselves.
Google Docs Glitch That Locked Out Users Underscores Privacy Concerns:::::Some of these people sought answers, and notified others, on Twitter.Obviously this is raising questions in a lot of peoples minds about the level of surveillance in internet tools, like cloud-based tools, Rachael Bale, whose tweets gained traction, said on Tuesday.Ms. Bale, a reporter for National Geographics Wildlife Watch, said that while what happened was problematic, she was not too taken aback.We know Google has access to all kinds of information about us, she said, adding that professionally, she avoids using Google Docs for anything sensitive.A Google spokesman said in a statement that a code push caused a small percentage of Google Docs to be incorrectly flagged as abusive, which caused them to be automatically blocked.A fix is in place and all users should have full access to their docs, the statement said.Protecting users from viruses, malware and other abusive content is central to user safety.We apologize for the disruption and will put processes in place to prevent this from happening again.Mr. Gardner said the complexity of the technology and its widespread use carried considerable risks.A small tweak to the rules on what to flag or not can produce false positives like we saw today, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Its clear that Google wants to be able to exert conditions on what content can be shared, he added.It needs to automate that via machines due to scale.And it shows that mistakes in what to reject can be made, with highly impactful consequences.Googles automated systems periodically scan certain file types in Google Drive that are shared with other users to detect abuse and protect users, a Google spokesman said on Tuesday.Some examples include antivirus scanning, malware and phishing detection.Google Docs is part of the Google Drive suite.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Leighton Pritchard, a computational biologist who also tweeted about the error he experienced, said that even though what happened on Tuesday was a glitch, it did shed light on how many users do not take the time to read terms of service agreements.The default state is we ignore them, he said.We click yes because we want to use the thing thats useful to us.Lots of things can slip by us that way.I asked them directly if this was a result of an automated sweep for content, Mr. Pritchard said of Google.They said they couldnt say at the moment and would update us on the Google Groups page.One user on the Google Groups page, a help forum for those affected, said: I hope Google realises the seriousness of this issue.If they want this thing to function as a professional tool that people can trust, and not a toy, this has to stop right now.Someone else posted a message from the Google Docs support team that read: It appears our automated scan flagged your Google Form as potentially suspicious due to the types of information it requests from others.Generally, using a Google Form to collect confidential information such as IDs, passwords, bank account numbers, and passport numbers violates our Terms of Service.The user said the message made no sense.We did none of these things.While Googles privacy policy does not explicitly say that it scans files in Google Docs, it does say that it collects information from Gmail messages, G+ profile, photos, videos, browsing history, map searches, docs, or other Google-hosted content.Our automated systems analyze this information as it is sent and received and when it is stored, the policy states.Mr. Gardner emphasized the importance of being mindful that your cloud activities are most likely being assessed, and that the process is far from perfected.We should all be keenly aware that any and all content we create, handle or amend inside of these cloud services is being evaluated and scrubbed, and its not being done by people, its by machines, he said.And neither the machines nor their programmers are infallible.Whats more, this is still an immature set of technologies, so teething pain is to be expected.

U.S. Investor Tries to Shake Up Sina, a Pillar of China’s Internet:::::In turn, Aristeia, which manages $3 billion in investor money, has accused Sina of failing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.Foreign investors seem less than worried about any lack of control or lapses in corporate governance if the market is any indication.Shares in those companies have been on a tear in markets around the world as Chinese consumers reliably use their smartphones to buy electronics, shop for groceries, make investments, play games and look for dates.With more than 700 million users, China is the worlds largest single internet market.Weibo has 313 million monthly average users.Still, some investors are quietly complaining about corporate governance practices.Chinese companies that list shares in the United States are not necessarily subject to American rules.Most are incorporated in light regulatory jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands.As a result, Chinese companies often behave differently.While Sina holds a regular annual meeting, some of its peers do not, a standard for the United States.Baidu, the search engine giant, has not held an annual shareholder meeting since 2008.JD.com, the online retailer, has never held one.Investors have been getting a bit fed up with companies like Baidu and JD.com not having general meetings, said Jamie Allen, the secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.A spokesman for JD.com said: Investors appreciate our candor both on earnings calls and in engagement throughout the year.This issue has rarely, if ever, been raised to us.Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Foreign investors also typically have fewer shareholder protections.To get around Chinese restrictions on outside investments in sensitive industries, many companies use a complicated legal structure, called a variable interest entity, or V.I.E.Under those arrangements, shareholders have rights to the profits of a company, but they do not control key assets potentially leaving them exposed if the company runs into trouble or the Chinese government declares the structure illegal.Sina was a key player in the Chinese internets emergence as a social and economic force.Its Weibo service, once derided by critics as a knockoff of Twitter, has grown in size and functionality to the point where it is now a must-read for many people.Even after the Chinese government curbed political or controversial discussion on Weibo, it remains a well-read resource.Weibo now has its own stock listing, while Sina owns a 46 percent stake.Sinas other operations include online news and entertainment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That separate listing helped set off the fight with Aristeia.Sinas shares have risen nearly 75 percent so far this year.But Weibos performance has been better, with the stock more than doubling.Based on their stock market values, Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina a gap that Aristeia says points to lackluster management and poor corporate governance.Sina uses a V.I.E.structure.Only one of the five director seats is available each year.The chairman and chief executive, Charles Chao, has a permanent position; the other members serve four-year terms.Aristeia is pushing for representation on the board so that directors will consider measures that would result in more money for shareholders.These include a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo or a buyback of shares by management.Sina says that any deal proposed by Aristeia would not clear because of Chinas complicated telecom and media rules.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, also owns a stake in Weibo, further complicating its options, Sina said.The time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of Sina shareholders, Sina said in a statement.Some outsiders disagree.I think Sina has built in Weibo a very valuable asset that is not being reflected in its share price, said Randy Gelber, a managing director at UBS, the Swiss bank.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It would seem like there should be some common ground from both sides on how to realize that value, he said.Two proxy advisers Glass Lewis & Company and International Shareholder Services have given some weight to Aristeias arguments.Glass Lewis recommended that Sina expand its board to allow Aristeias nominees, and I.S.S.recommended that Sina shareholders support one of the two nominees.An examination of the arguments reveals compelling reasons for shareholders to seek change at the company, I.S.S.said.The fight is being watched closely at a time when American activists are bringing their bare-knuckled approach to Asia.Daniel S. Loeb, one of the most vocal activists, scored a victory in a campaign for change at the Japanese conglomerate that owns the 7-Eleven convenience store chain last year.In South Korea, the activist Paul Singer and his hedge fund firm, Elliott Management, picked fights with Samsung Electronics and the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong.It is also unfolding as the Chinese government looks to take a more active role in how its corporate giants are managed.Even if Aristeia emerges victorious, the real test could be whether its candidates will be able to push for change internally.The question is whether that board member would be able to do anything other than jump up and down at meetings, said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking Universitys Guanghua School of Management.
Samsung Unveils New Management to Quell Leadership Crisis:::::Photo HONG KONG Samsung Electronics, the South Korean tech giant, announced a new slate of executives on Tuesday in an effort to bring stability to its top ranks.The company, a global name in smartphones and microchips, has been suffering from a leadership vacuum.The crown prince of its controlling family was sent to prison this year on bribery charges.The familys patriarch has been in a coma since 2014.Three weeks ago, a senior executive responsible for one of its most successful businesses abruptly resigned.The troubles at Samsungs management have not diminished its status as an innovative and highly profitable powerhouse in the technology world.That point was underscored on Tuesday, when the company reported a record-high profit for the second quarter in a row.But the newly appointed executives, who have been drawn from Samsungs deep ranks of professional managers, could help ensure the company can run while the fate of the powerful family that built the Samsung empire remains under a cloud.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The three executives appointed on Tuesday to run Samsungs major business units are Kim Kinam, who will lead its lucrative components business; H.S.Kim, its new consumer-electronics chief; and D.

How to Fix Facebook? We Asked 9 Experts:::::The single most important step Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram, which I view as equally important in terms of countering misinformation, hate speech and propaganda can

emoji?Or respect-based emojis?If a palette of six emoji-faced angry-love-sad-haha emotional buttons continues to be the way we engage with one another and how we respond to the news then its going to

Photo Chief executive of Upworthy and author of The Filter Bubble.Facebook should open itself up for independent research.Right now, Facebook is a black box: Its very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform.While opening private data to research creates risks, theres a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale.Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists.It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better whats happening on the worlds most important social platform.And itd be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.The company should also optimize for time well spent.Facebooks greatest superpower is figuring out how to eat as much of our attention as possible.But as Tristan Harris and others have pointed out, that attention often doesnt yield much leaving us poorly informed and feeling worse about ourselves.Instead of measuring clicks and likes, what if Facebook optimized for how much value an article or video or game gave us weeks or months afterward?The company could survey the kinds of content weve spent the most time on, and ask us which gave us the most and least value, as a way to balance our impulsive present selves with our greater aspirations.Kate Losse Photo Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.It would be interesting if

In Self-Driving Race, Waymo Sets Its Own Terms:::::Its hard to know where this all ends.Will the winner be the company that develops a vehicle capable of driving along a preprogrammed route, in ideal weather conditions, in certain cities?Or will it be the vehicle that can drive itself anywhere, rain or snow?Is it enough to build a vehicle that drives itself most of the time, or is a truly driverless car one in which the passenger can safely take a nap?Does it count if a company produces just a handful of expensive prototype vehicles, rather than something that can be mass-produced and sold by the tens of thousands?Photo Waymo has set a narrow target.It is aiming for Level 4 autonomy, an official classification for a vehicle that is capable of driving itself, with no human behind the wheel, in most environments and road conditions.It believes that nothing short of Level 4 counts as autonomous, and that bypassing Level 3 (a lower classification, in which some human attention is still required) is necessary to keep people safe on the roads.Humans, the company says, can easily lose concentration while driving with Level 3 autonomy, even though they often need to take over at a moments notice.That is also a self-serving goal.By most estimations, Waymo is closer than any other company to Level 4 autonomy.Its test vehicles, which have been on the road for eight years, have completed more than 3.5 million autonomous miles, far more than any of its competitors.It has driven another 2.5 billion miles in Carcraft, a simulated, virtual-reality environment that allows the company to run and rerun various situations millions of times a day, and incorporate the results into its real-world vehicles.And its access to Googles top-tier engineering talent and cutting-edge technical infrastructure has made it a formidable competitor.Waymos advantage was apparent on Monday, during my test ride in the companys self-driving minivan.Unlike other driverless demos Ive encountered, there was no human keeping watch at the wheel.To start the trip, a colleague in the back seat pressed a large blue button marked start ride, and the van took off on its own.In a 10-minute drive around Castle, it easily handled a series of different on-road situations and obstacles.It encircled a roundabout, waited patiently for pedestrians to cross the street, and dodged traffic cones and bicyclists with ease.It felt slick and polished, and gave the sense that it might be ready for public consumption very soon.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Granted, this was a carefully planned test loop in a controlled environment.Autonomous driving on public roads is a much harder challenge, and Waymo is still figuring out how best to deploy its technology to a wider market.The company declined to put a date on when it might release self-driving cars to the general public, and Mr. Krafcik spoke only in generalities about its plans, saying that it would focus on ride-hailing and autonomous trucking as possible early business models.Were really close, he said.But Waymos road to autonomy has not been entirely smooth.It has lost some engineering talent to well-funded competitors.Its executives have been distracted by a prominent lawsuit against Uber, in which Waymo accused Uber of stealing trade secrets worth more than $2 billion.And in an early-access test program in Phoenix, its vehicles reportedly struggled to make left turns, one of many real-world obstacles that have to be overcome.And the competition is heating up.Lyft and Drive.ai, a self-driving car start-up, are teaming up to offer a pilot program for driverless ride-hailing in San Francisco.Uber has been developing its own driverless fleet, and it is testing vehicles on public roads in Arizona, Pittsburgh and Toronto.Detroit is getting up to speed, too General Motors, which spent $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation last year, recently announced that it has a production-ready autonomous vehicle, once the software and regulatory kinks are worked out, and Ford, which has partnered with Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company based in Pittsburgh, plans to put Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.Waymos victory against this army of well-funded competitors is not guaranteed.But it wont be easy to beat, especially if it gets to define what winning means.
Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone:::::The Russia-linked posts were an insidious attempt to drive people apart, Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks.He called the posts deeply disturbing, and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues.Facebook, Mr.Stretch said, was determined to prevent it from happening again.The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform.Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users News Feeds everyday.Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016.Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period.The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the companys remarks.Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period.Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Google said it had found 18 channels that were likely associated with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube.All told, those accounts now suspended uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017.Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016.Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said.Photo The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it.Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election.Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin.While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable, wrote Richard Salgado, Googles director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Googles general counsel.The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.For Facebook, Google and Twitter, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening.The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends.Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used but for malevolent purposes.That has led to thorny debates inside the companies.For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content.Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future.So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such as a reason for taking down the accounts.Many of these ads did not violate our content policies, Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month.That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies platforms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill.Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures.Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate.The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads.The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Googles AdWords for example, web search ads and YouTube.Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.But Google said it did not intend to take any further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube.The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlins principal international propaganda outlet, but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service.Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.
As Apple and Facebook Chiefs Visit, Xi Jinping Vows Deeper Reform:::::Photo SHANGHAI Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States.Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and Chinas relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive.The reception was one of Mr. Xis first public appearances with foreign visitors since a key Chinese Communist Party congress elevated him to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong, the countrys founding father, and Deng Xiaoping, who led the country from 1978 until 1989.The event just a week before Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China was most likely arranged to signal Chinas status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chinese diplomats have used past business summits to promote their countrys economic clout and influence with American companies before testier meetings with United States leaders and diplomats.On a 2015 trip to the United States, for example, Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle to visit American technology executives before going to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama.
Power Up Your Phone by Hand or by Sun:::::Q.As recent storms and power outages have shown, we are now deeply reliant on cellphones for communication, especially since many people have gotten rid of their landlines.If theres no electricity, what options do you have for charging a phone battery?A.Backup batteries only last for so long, but hand-cranked chargers and miniature solar panels are two options for restoring a little power to your mobile phone.Adding an alternative charging device to your household emergency kit (along with the flashlights and candles) is one way to stay in contact with others, but keep in mind that for large-scale outages, network cellular service and Wi-Fi routers will most likely be down as well.Several companies make hand-cranked chargers, including Etn and K-TOR.Prices start at about $17 for a simple crank and go up from there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.To use one, connect the phone to the device with its USB charging cable and then turn the crank continuously until you see the phones battery level move up a notch or two.Depending on the devices involved, this can take several minutes of cranking, but you should be able to get enough power to make an emergency call which can be helpful if, say, your house is having power problems of its own and you need to call an electrician.Photo If hand-cranking does not appeal to you, Etn also offers solar-powered solutions and K-TOR has a pedal-powered charger for about $200.Portable solar-powered chargers can supply energy to devices in emergency and nonemergency situations (like camping) without physical effort.Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, tested 70 solar battery chargers and found the $51 Anker PowerPort Solar Lite to be the best model for juicing up mobile devices.Smartphone cases with built-in solar chargers are another option, even for everyday use.SnowLizard makes cases for current iPhone models and the Portable Solar Shop site sells cases for several Android phones.
Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Tech’s Critic in Congress:::::This week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers.Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest.He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.Mr. Warners position is a sharp reversal.Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive.His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs.He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.Photo Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.Mark didnt come to this point with the social media companies lightly, said Saxby Chambliss, a retired Republican senator from Georgia who regularly meets with Mr. Warner and the Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, to discuss the Russia investigation.The reluctance of the technology companies to take seriously the investigation into Russian election meddling pushed Mr. Warner over the edge, Mr. Chambliss said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is a poor attitude for American companies, Mr. Chambliss added.Mark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.Ahead of the hearings, Twitter and Facebook have scrambled to disarm lawmakers with announcements of voluntary changes to their advertising businesses.Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, for example, spent a couple days in Washington promising more disclosures.Twitter announced it would disclose who buys political ads on its site, and it blocked two Russia-based media organizations from purchasing advertisements.Twitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers questions are a top priority.In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.We look forward to answering lawmakers questions, said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement.We take this issue very seriously and think its important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.But lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers.The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday.Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news.In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues.And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill, Ms. Klobuchar said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies.The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses.Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.Photo Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies.But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry.Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.The top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, said in an interview last week that his agency would watch to see whether the size of technology companies hurts competition, but that size alone was not justification for action against them.There are people who think big is just bad, Mr. Delrahim said.He invoked the name of Robert Jackson, the top antitrust enforcer for the agency about 80 years ago, who said he was reluctant to try to break up big companies just for the sake of doing so.That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies as unexpected as it may be.Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion.Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va.He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state.After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warners vacation home on Marthas Vineyard.For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.But during this years trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committees Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.His thinking has evolved, Mr. Case said.Even though Im sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because hed rather be focused on issues like the future of work.And Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.Look, Im pro-tech.Im pro-innovation, he said, standing and shuffling side to side like a basketball player on defense.On the bookshelf near him was a textbook, Science and Engineering, and a small business self-help book called Grow Regardless: Of Your Businesss Size, Your Industry or the Economy ... and Despite the Government!He went on: What I fear is 2018.If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I., he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.There is too much at stake, he said.
What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car:::::This is why we think we can move fast, said Luc Vincent, who recently started an autonomous vehicle project at Lyft, Ubers main rival.This stuff didnt exist 10 years ago when Google started.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are still questions hanging over this research.Most notably, because these algorithms learn by analyzing more information than any human ever could, it is sometimes difficult to audit their behavior and understand why they make particular decisions.But in the years to come, machine learning will be essential to the continued progress of autonomous vehicles.Todays vehicles are not nearly as autonomous as they may seem.After 10 years of research, development and testing, Googles cars are poised to offer public rides on the streets of Arizona.Waymo, which operates under Googles parent company, is preparing to start a taxi service near Phoenix, according to a recent report, and unlike other services, it will not put a human behind the wheel as a backup.But its cars will still be on a tight leash.For now, if it doesnt carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians.And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign if it doesnt avoid these situations altogether.At the leading companies, the belief is that these cars can eventually handle more difficult situations with help from continued development and testing, new sensors that can provide a more detailed view of the surrounding world and machine learning.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Internetting With Amanda Hess Our critic discusses everything thats wrong, weird and totally sad about the internet in five videos.Sign-up for email notifications.Waymo and many of its rivals have already embraced deep neural networks, complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing data.By analyzing photos of pedestrians, for example, a neural network can learn to identify a pedestrian.These kinds of algorithms are also helping to identify street signs and lane markers, predict what will happen next on the road, and plan routes forward.The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations.And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like.Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility.Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by.This is where simulations can help.Recently, Waymo unveiled a roadway simulator it calls Carcraft.Today, the company said, this simulator provides a way of testing its cars at a scale that is not possible in the real world.Its cars can spend far more time on virtual roads than the real thing.Presumably, like other companies, Waymo is also exploring ways that its algorithms can actually learn new behavior from this kind of simulator.Photo Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results.In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it.They need not spend time and money labeling images and potentially making mistakes with these labels.You have ground truth, Mr. Pratt explained.You know where every car is.You know where every pedestrian is.You know where every bicycler is.You know the weather.Others are exploring a more complex method called reinforcement learning.This a major area of research inside many of the worlds top artificial intelligence labs, including DeepMind (the London-based lab owned by Google), the Berkeley AI Research Lab, and OpenAI (the San Francisco-based lab founded by Teslas chief executive Elon Musk and others).These labs are building algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks inside virtual worlds through intensive trial and error.DeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human.In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didnt.And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.That may seem frivolous.But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.Inside Ubers autonomous car operation, for example, researchers have trained systems to play the popular game Grand Theft Auto, with an eye toward applying these methods, eventually, to real world cars.Training systems in simulations of physical locations is the next step.Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said.And companies must also ensure that algorithms dont learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own.That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning.They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior.Waymo cars dont learn to stop at stop lights, for example.There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less.It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymos vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov.But it becomes even more important, he explained, when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it.Robotics and machine learning go hand in hand, he said.
Virtual Reality Gets Naughty:::::You can pretend like you are in the bedroom with me, and it is someone you have a crush on, she said.You are in the experience.Photo While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence.According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016.Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm.Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.Were getting more and more of it every day, said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry.We are leading the technology in this area.Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it, some by offering it for free to increase clicks.Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology.Now its time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: Im pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.Headsets Are Just the Beginning Ms.Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry.Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star.Before long, Ms.Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.Photo She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes.She then started a company named VRTube.xxx to make the technology, now licensed to Cam4.com, which employs over 40 performers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues.For example, can you use someones likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West, said Bryony Cole, the host of Future of Sex, a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.At this years AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth.They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action.Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls, said Mr. Kernes, who was there.Its sweet and musty.They know what they like.Photo There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part.They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person, Mr. Kernes said.Im sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material.As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot.The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix.In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.How do you feel about sex?an unknown presenter asks her in one video.Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world, she responds in a raspy voice.I dont see anything wrong with it.Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.Its a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi, said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O.and creative director of Realbotix.The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality.Based on our experiences with thousands of clients, Mr. McMullen said, people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists.We focus on companionship.Photo Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action.Its neurological, said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. You arent just watching and thinking about it.You are feeling it, and its not just your genitals.There is literally a mind-body connection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Ms.Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen.The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off, she said.They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos.Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex.She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts.As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex.The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDoinkVR.com in 2016 an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?she said.Or they can be in a room with someone who said, I contacted herpes and this is my experience.That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.Photo Indeed.Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emorys Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place.The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality.They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers.We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them, Ms. Cole said.As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McMullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize.His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire.What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?she said.What does consent mean in virtual reality?Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldnt do in real life?If you are using someones likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission?And what about revenge porn?That will be even harsher in virtual reality.She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating.It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.But Mr. McMullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it.There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone.They work all day and come home to an empty house, he said.This is just offering an alternative to those types of people.They dont have anyone else.
Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse:::::So, too, may more information about our choices, according to a 2008 study, The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre versus PostAction Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising From Precise and Vague Information, published in The Journal of Consumer Research.Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward.This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesnt typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase.But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out.That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described.The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumers presence in the store.Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after.In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged.(On its own, smell was the most important sense.)The tactile experience doesnt end in the checkout line.After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home.This act of carrying it into ones domestic space can bolster ones proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world.That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at ones doorstep or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside is impersonal and not enervating.Its the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself.And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Youre coming back to hunters and gatherers, Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases.Dopamine kicks in when were buying stuff theres a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens.The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after.When its delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too.Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it.Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazons 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card.But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash.The remorse still exists with online shopping; its just deferred, with extra pain later.Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse.Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends and strangers superior products (or better use of the same product).The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (SHODDILY MADE, THEY RUINED IT) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store.I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain.There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet.But je ne regrette rien.
Hearing Amazon’s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders:::::An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on rumors or speculation about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork.Wholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states, she said.There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business.Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole, he said.While Mr. Ladd said he isnt privy to the companys current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried.My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care, he said.If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront.To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business, said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers.Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A large part of the infrastructure is already there, said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers.We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator, he said.If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.This would be far more complex.It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one.Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use.The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way.The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right.It is just a sensitive topic, she said.We dont have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.
At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content:::::On one side are employees who idealize Facebooks lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say.On the other side are workers who worry that the companys hands-off approach has already caused problems ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control whats shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads, said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology.The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.Next week, Facebooks general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last years election.Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising.Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election.It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds.And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook.That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them.But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Aided by Facebooks finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users.The ad product, called a promoted post, was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians.If they did, it meant that nonpaid, organic posts would begin to appear in the users News Feeds.From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the users network of friends.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The tactic was effective.Some of the pages, like Blacktivists, which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who liked the page even more than the main Black Lives Matter page.Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue.But at Mr. Zuckerbergs company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network.Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence.But misleading users even outright lying arent necessarily against the rules.And thats hard to police.So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform.Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial, Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement.Thats O.K.But its important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States.In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been whitelisting, in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the companys internal deliberations.They have also discussed blacklisting, in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in closed-door meetings at Facebooks Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves.They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction.But todays A.I.technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerbergs solution is to double down on his community concept.He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.Every day, I say to myself, I dont have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?Some nights I go to bed and Im not sure I made the right choices that day, Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference.I can tell you, those doubts dont go away, no matter who you are.But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.
A War of Words Puts Facebook at the Center of Myanmar’s Rohingya Crisis:::::In Myanmar, Facebook is so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself.And the stakes of what appears on the site are exceptionally high because misinformation, as well as explicitly hostile language, is widening longstanding ethnic divides and stoking the violence against the Rohingya ethnic group.Photo For example, since the government crackdown against the Rohingya began, Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the countrys de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has shared dozens of posts on his Facebook page and Twitter account that include images said to show Rohingya burning their own homes.Many of these images have been debunked, yet they still stand.First-person accounts from Rakhine State establish a coordinated crackdown against the Rohingya minority by the military and by ultranationalist groups, driving more than 600,000 refugees across the border into Bangladesh.Facebook does not police the billions of posts and status updates that flow through the site worldwide each day, relying instead on an oftentimes confusing set of community standards and reports by users of direct threats that are then manually assessed and, in some cases, removed.After the 2016 United States elections, Facebook rolled out a set of guidelines to help users identify fake news and misinformation.The company does not regularly remove misinformation itself.Facebook has no office in Myanmar, but the company has worked with local partners to introduce a Burmese-language illustrated copy of its platform standards and will continue to refine its practices, said a spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, in an emailed statement.Human rights groups say the companys approach has allowed opinion, facts and misinformation to mingle on Facebook, clouding perceptions of truth and propaganda in a country where mobile technology has been widely adopted only in the past three years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under the rule of the military junta, strict censorship regulations deliberately made SIM cards for cellphones unaffordable to control the free flow of information.In 2014, restrictions loosened and the use of mobile technology exploded as SIM cards became affordable.Facebook users ballooned from about two million in 2014 to more than 30 million today.But most users do not know how to navigate the wider internet.Photo Facebook has become sort of the de facto internet for Myanmar, said Jes Kaliebe Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, Myanmars leading technology hub that helped Facebook create its Burmese-language community standards page.When people buy their first smartphone, it just comes preinstalled.Mr. Petersen said local media and news outlets should help combat misinformation in a technology sector still in its infancy.There are still some challenges here, and there are of course very big differences between big cities and rural communities, he said.I think its really important that people focus on educating this new generation of digital users.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the meantime, Facebook has become a breeding ground for hate speech and virulent posts about the Rohingya.And because of Facebooks design, posts that are shared and liked more frequently get more prominent placement in feeds, favoring highly partisan content in timelines.Ashin Wirathu, the monk, has hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook accounts in Burmese and English.His posts include graphic photos and videos of decaying bodies that Ashin Wirathu says are Buddhist victims of Rohingya attacks, or posts denouncing the minority ethnic group or updates that identify them falsely as Bengali foreigners.Facebook has removed some of his posts and restricted his page for stretches, but it is currently active.In an interview, Ashin Wirathu said that if Facebook did remove his account, he would simply create a new one.He added that if anyone did not like his Facebook posts, they can sue me.Posts from verified government and military Facebook accounts also carry misinformation.Some, for example, refuse to acknowledge the Rohingya as an ethnic group deserving of citizenship rights, despite the fact many have lived in Rakhine State for generations.Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmars armed forces who has carried out the crackdown on the Rohingya, has more than 1.3 million users on his verified account.A post from Sept. 15 describes the operation as a response to an attempt of extremist Bengalis in Rakhine State to build a stronghold, after an Aug. 25 attack on remote border posts by a Rohingya militant group.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rohingya activists also use Facebook, documenting human rights abuses, often with graphic images and videos as evidence.Sometimes the company has taken these down.Ms. Wareing, the Facebook spokeswoman, said the company removed graphic content when it is shared to celebrate the violence.She said the company would allow graphic content if it was newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if it might otherwise go against the platforms standards.Richard Weir, an Asia analyst with Human Rights Watch, said the situation was complicated.Its a really delicate balance here between things that are violent and posted by people who would seek to inflame tensions and those that are trying to disseminate information, Mr. Weir said.Its difficult to know where exactly to draw the line.Some of the social media conversation is happening privately.For instance, chain messages on Facebook Messenger before Sept. 11 this year falsely warned of a planned Rohingya attack against Buddhists.Written like a chain letter, the message called for people to share it, and many people were put on edge as it spread.I was nervous about it, said U Tin Win, a teacher from Mandalay, the countrys second-largest city, who received the letter.I dont know who started the message, but I ordered my family not to go outside that day.Mr. Weir said that people in Myanmar relied on social media for their news.The government can sort of trot out its own views and spread them very rapidly, in addition to a bunch of other nonstate entities, he said.Views about people in Rakhine State, about the origins of population and about things that may or may not have happened fly around Facebook extremely quickly and can create unstable situations.
Britain Says North Korea Was Behind Cyberattack on Health Service:::::They encrypted the information on them and then demanded payment of $300 or more in Bitcoin to unlock the devices.In Britain, the attack resulted in the abrupt cancellation of patients operations and delays in medical appointments at dozens of hospitals that struggled to retrieve essential medical information and patient histories.Britains National Audit Office said on Friday that at least 6,900 appointments had been canceled during the attack, which affected more than one-third of Englands 236 N.H.S.trusts.Up to 19,000 appointments may have been affected, it said.Hospital authorities have said that no patient data was compromised or stolen during the attack.But it had particular resonance in Britain where the N.H.S., though chronically underfunded, is a vaunted part of the nations identity.Mr. Wallace warned that it was difficult to respond to a cyberattack committed by a hostile state.North Korea, which has ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon and has been repeatedly testing missiles despite international sanctions, has also proved adept at sowing havoc through cyberattacks.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.North Korea has been potentially linked to other attacks about raising foreign currency, he said, in an apparent reference to an attack last year in which North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve, and almost succeeded before being stopped by a spelling error.The North has an army of 6,000 hackers, and experts in Britain and the United States say their ability to wage effective cyberattacks has improved.In 2014, the country unleashed a cyberattack against Sony Pictures aimed at blocking the release of a satirical film deemed disrespectful of its leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Wallace said it was imperative for Britain to reinforce its efforts to defend against future attacks.Its a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Audit Office said on Friday that the WannaCry attack had been relatively unsophisticated and could have been prevented had the N.H.S.followed rudimentary procedures to protect its systems.It said that N.H.S.management had recklessly ignored security recommendations.Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, on Friday criticized the preparedness of the N.H.S.The WannaCry cyberattack had potentially serious implications for the N.H.S.and its ability to provide care to patients, he said in a statement.He added that the N.H.S.needed to get its act together.In the immediate aftermath, Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, acknowledged that, despite several warnings of a possible attack, the N.H.S.had been ill prepared to defend itself and was vulnerable because its computers had outmoded software.While the ransom demanded in the attack in Britain was modest, the National Audit Office said evidence indicated that no N.H.S.organization had paid, which experts say could have encouraged further attacks.

Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting:::::Advertisement Critics Notebook Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting Image Credit Tracy Ma These days, it seems that everybodys got a podcast, even members of Congress.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin debuted their own podcasts this month, joining audio series begun earlier this year from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.The concept is a no-brainer: satisfy Americans seemingly insatiable thirst for political analysis from ready-made political stars with inside perspectives.And from the elected officials perspective, the appeal is obvious.They can sidestep media gatekeepers and beam their personalities and priorities straight to their constituents ears, all while heightening their national brands, perhaps in anticipation of seeking higher office.Its less clear what the constituents get out of the deal.On their podcasts, our representatives are doing something almost journalistic: Theyre moderating discussions with other political figures, interviewing experts on North Korea or monopoly power and staging interactions with the public.Except there are no actual journalists around to ask any pesky questions.At least on TV interview shows or at news conferences, reporters challenge the politicians narrative.Even on Twitter, we can tweet back.But the podcast offers a hermetically sealed branding platform.Mr. Browns new show, Canarycast , seeks to reinforce his image as a blue-collar champion: Its named for the canary in the coal mine, and it finds Mr. Brown moderating discussions on how to restore the value of work in America.Mr. Duffys show, Plaidcast , references his rugged status as a lumberjack games champion and sets out to humanize his colleagues by interviewing neat, cool members of Congress.There is plenty of like-minded confabbing Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress that makes everybody look right and good.And in Chicago Stories, with Mr. Emanuel, this combative mayor recasts himself as a kinder, gentler interlocutor of anodyne local figures, like brewery owners and spoken-word poets.Its working.The Chicago Tribune has praised the podcast for showing what can happen when a control-the-narrative mayor loosens the reins just a little.You know, on the podcast he controls completely.Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal.Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners.And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities.( Off the Sidelines from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Off the Cuff from Representative Jared Huffman of California popped up last year; We the Podcast from Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, begun in 2015, was ahead of its time.)All of these Democrats have taken a page from Mr. Trump himself.The president doesnt have his own podcast (yet), but no other lawmaker has so successfully leveraged the internet to push out his own version of the news, whether through his Twitter account or through his weekly self-branded Facebook video news report, the Real News Update hosted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.Traditional news media might be politically polarized watch Fox News or MSNBC for different versions of the days events but the internet has allowed for platforms focused on even more granular political preferences.Now, you dont have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through The Bernie Sanders Show , in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven.But thats not the only thing wrong with it.The podcasts are also boring.Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them.Mr. Emanuels podcast would probably be more captivating if he werent so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill.And Im sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what its like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but hes instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless youre a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict.Mr. Duffy has expressed interest in having the liberal California Representative Maxine Waters on as a guest in the future, telling the conservative website The Daily Caller: Maxine and I dont agree on much of anything, but I think Maxine is a nice person, I think Maxine is a good person.Hopefully, theyll get into those disagreements instead of just talking about how nice the other person is.Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig.In the first episode of Canarycast, Mr. Brown tells his guests a trio of Whirlpool workers that he has to end the interview to cast a vote.Ms. Gillibrands podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes.I guess shes been busy.The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office.These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain.They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.Hillary Clintons campaign podcast, With Her , became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue.Freed from being vice president, Joe Biden is now lending his brand to an experimental audio news curation project, Bidens Briefing , which is billed as a skillcast for devices like Alexa and Google Home but is also available to download as a regular podcast.The highlight of the category is Stay Tuned With Preet , starring Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney fired by President Trump.Some speculated that Mr. Bharara might seek elected office, but instead hes teamed up with his brother, an internet entrepreneur , and created a podcast that takes the contours of a thrilling and urgent civics lesson.If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs.For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach.These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us.But that doesnt mean that we should listen to them.Follow Amanda Hess on Twitter: @amandahess.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Lets Not Talk Politics Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich:::::Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centras founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world.They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last years total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings.Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O.boom.The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens Centra, Stox and Hubiits has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology.But Im not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects.Coins of the Digital Wild West The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token with no physical backing that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world.The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum.People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems.The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market.Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks like the next generation of the internet.But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani.The companys chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well.Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built.Mr. Trapanis old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!he wrote in one post.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centras founders.In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the worlds first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets, the announcement said.Photo Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up.The photo on Centras website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra and none of the details on Mr. Edwardss LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the companys marketing material.The LinkedIn profile was deleted.The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president.The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z, Mr. Sharma said in an interview.Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card.The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken.The companys site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.There was one problem with this plan.The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website.Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution.He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved, Mr. Gendron said.Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the companys credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities.A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.Photo Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour.Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didnt own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came, Mr. Fern said.It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was a kid.He said the landlords statements were not accurate.Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati Photo For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati.According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharmas trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite, the indictment said.Mr. Sharma said that he couldnt speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.Im obviously not comfortable with that situation, he said.But its not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami.Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centras technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.Hell do anything we ask, Mr. Trapani said.Hell go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The boxing champ understood their deal differently.A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra.She did not say how much he had been paid.After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweathers spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens.We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy, Mr. Sharma said.It was a very direct, individual deal.Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.Photo In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings.But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.Assuming regulators dont step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they dont build anything.But they say that wont happen.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November.They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.I see us taking over as being the No.1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets, Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies.Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharmas enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms.But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.Whats important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product, a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment.Thats what matters to investors!
An Explanation of Initial Coin Offerings:::::What does this have to do with existing virtual currencies?These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network).Whats more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.(For a more complete explanation of Bitcoin, click here, and for an Ethereum explainer, click here.)Is there a relation to initial public offerings of shares in a company?The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors.But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors dont get an ownership stake in the start-ups.If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law.A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.Why would anyone pay for these coins?In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used.So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up.When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny.In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O.The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.Why arent these start-ups raising money through venture capitalists?The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists.The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded.The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesnt even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings dont have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital wont fund.Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum.Filecoins cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.How do you create your own virtual currency?It is easier than it seems.The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics.There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept.Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.Who can invest in coin offerings?Anyone who has Bitcoin or Ether and is willing to send their money to the creators of a coin offering.Is this illegal?China and South Korea have said it is illegal.In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds.If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted.Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down.Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded.What happens if the programmers never build what they promise?Investors dont have much recourse.The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue.What do real investors think of this?A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support.Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook.Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has argued that by enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation.But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors and probably should not happen in the first place.Right now, with all of the enthusiasm for crypto assets out there, I am very concerned that nobody is being careful about anything, Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog.
Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Twitter and Reddit Take a Stand:::::Farhad: Im not going to dignify that with an answer.Anyway, in the run-up to that testimony, Twitter which has been criticized by lawmakers for its response so far announced that it would ban two Russian news organizations from buying Twitter ads.The two news sites are Russia Today and Sputnik, both of which are backed by the Kremlin and are accused of furthering Russian propaganda worldwide.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Mike: I was a bit stumped by this.You could praise Twitter for taking some action against groups that have clearly acted against the interests of the American people.That said, I find it difficult for a tech company to position itself as a stateless platform while also largely adhering to Western value structures.Does Twitter block CNN from Russia if Russia lodges a similar election interference complaint?Farhad: Im not sure how effective this change will be in limiting Russian propaganda, since these outlets will still be allowed to have a presence on Twitter they just cant buy ads.This also puts Twitter in a spot I thought it didnt want to be in; its unclear what policies and guidelines it will use to determine whether a news service is actually a propaganda outfit.Is it government funding?Well, then what about the BBC?Is it aggressively pushing a nationalistic point of view?What about Fox News?This is opening a can of worms.Mike: Yep, fully agree.Twitter is trying to push back a bit on that through the lens of transparency.That is, the company promised to give details to individual users on where the ads are coming from and whos spending money to target them specifically.The company hasnt really dug into the details on that yet, but well see if it actually makes a difference.Reddit Bans Nazis, and Honolulu Bans Distracted Walking Farhad: Russia Today wasnt the only thing that was banned this week.It was a big week in bans!Reddit shut several sections of its site that catered to Nazis and white supremacists.This comes after a policy change that now prohibits content that calls for violence.Its a big change for Reddit, which has long had an anything-goes policy.Mike: We cant really emphasize enough how big of a shift this is for Reddit.As youve said, the site has essentially taken a stance similar to Twitter since its inception: Free speech, no matter how odious you may find it, above all else.That has led Reddit down some dark paths, like refusing to ban outright racist groups and topic pages, not to mention dealing with an entire community devoted to creepshots of underage women.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont know what changed in their thinking.Perhaps Reddit, which has raised significant venture financing over the past two years, is trying to present a more polished view of itself in hopes of one day being acquired or going public.Photo Farhad: Meanwhile the city of Honolulu banned looking at your phone while walking.If you look at your phone while crossing the street, police officers can fine you $35 for the infraction.Mike, if they had this ban in San Francisco or New York, Id be very very poor.Mike: I do this thing where if a stranger is looking down at their phone and coming at me on the sidewalk, I refuse to move out of the way.Either they look up at the last minute and apologize, or they run right into me.I dont take a stand on many things, but this is one of them.Anyway, go Honolulu!Snaps Spectacles Flopped Farhad: Finally, there was news about Snap.Remember them?They make a popular messaging app that teenagers love.But apparently they dont love it enough to make them O.K.with goofy glasses.According to The Information, Snap badly overestimated demand for Spectacles, the camera-enabled glasses it released last year.I loved these glasses!I thought they were one of the most innovative gadgets Ive used in a while.Apparently kids dont think like dads.Snap sold only 150,000 pairs of specs, and the company has hundreds of thousands of unsold units in its warehouse.And even those it did sell werent used very much; according to Business Insider, most of the people who bought Specs stopped using them after a few weeks.Mike, are you still wearing your specs?Mike: Sadly, no.But not really for any philosophical or fashion reasons.Basically, its because theyre not prescription and I dont want to start running into walls without my regular glasses on.Does the company insurance plan cover Snap prescriptions?Farhad: Um, somehow I doubt that.O.K., see you next week!
Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future:::::Mr. Hacketts predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers.It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.We are committed to transforming our business, Mr. Hackett said of his companys efforts to bring new driverless technology to market.Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.It was just eight years ago that both G.M.and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies.The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.The results drew praise from one analyst because of the companys aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value.Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldnt make money, the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Fords shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years.An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V.lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nations largest automaker.The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe.Moreover, G.M.slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group.But G.M.reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story G.M.s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated the resilience of our core business in the face of declining consumer demand.This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes, he said.But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models.The market is more challenging than expected, Mr. Stevens said.Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars.G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruises work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment.And G.M.is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.Mary T. Barra, G.M.s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States.Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally, she said.And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.Were not laggards here, the companys chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call.Weve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.
Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content:::::Even mild violence can be difficult for someone to explain to others if they open it unexpectedly, the statement said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it added sometimes there were reasons to post violent content such as with educational, newsworthy, artistic and satirical items in which case context should be provided to show it was not gratuitous.On Thursday, as news of the policy surged through the site, moderators began to question how it would be applied in Reddits micro-communities, or subreddits, where interests can range from hunting to Bible study, as well as in its dark corners, where people are urged to kill themselves or others.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.What does glorify mean?one wrote.Will subs like watchpeopledie be categorized as such?(That forum would remain for now, a moderator said.)Among the first to be banned were the subreddits r/NationalSocialism, r/Nazi and r/Far_Right.In a statement on Thursday, Anna Soellner, a spokeswoman for Reddit, said the company was constantly assessing its content policy.We strive to be a welcoming, open platform for all by trusting our users to maintain an environment that cultivates genuine conversation, she said.Reddit, which was founded in 2005 and proclaims itself the front page of the internet with 330 million monthly active users, had been resistant to outright bans on content.In 2014, Yishan Wong, who was then the companys chief executive, wrote a blog post defending the companys hands-off approach to the sometimes toxic content that appeared on the site.You choose what to post, he wrote to the sites users.You choose what to read.You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce.We will try not to interfere.A year later, under a new chief executive, Ellen Pao, the company announced that it would explicitly prohibit harassment against users.It said then that the move would promote free expression of its millions of users without fear of retribution from a vocal minority of them.The crackdown comes as Reddit expands after receiving millions of dollars in financing in 2014 and again in 2017.It grew from 65 employees in 2015 to 260 employees this year, making it easier to execute new policies to enforce bans on toxic content.The effectiveness of Reddits 2015 policy was analyzed in a study released last month of two subreddits that were banned the racist r/CoonTown subreddit and r/fatpeoplehate, which mocked and abused overweight people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The study suggested that the most effective tactic to fight hateful rhetoric might be to identify and shut down the spaces where hateful speech occurs, rather than targeting bad actors individually or in groups.
Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback:::::Perhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media.Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information.Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning.They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election?No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened.Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy.But for Twitter influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful the situation is more vexing.Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.Many of Twitters users have long been frustrated with the sites scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment.Twitters critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitters most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN.Twitters guidelines forbid threats of violence and targeted abuse prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trumps account.In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the companys evolving views on hosting the president.That includes allowing tweets under the newsworthy label it might otherwise ban.But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting We need to do better.Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump.Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the presidents Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring.Its too early to say were all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are already signs that Twitters bottom line is feeling the effects.An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019.Since other parts of social media most notably Facebook are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users, said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities.If you think about why are people alcoholics, its because they dont acknowledge theyre alcoholics.He added about Twitter, It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year.But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected.Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week.When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad.Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it inadequate at every level.He added that Twitter had failed to understand how serious this issue is.On Tuesday, Twitter said it would dramatically increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like.Political ads will be specially marked.Mr. Warner called Twitters plan a good first step.On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc.The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state.It billed itself as the Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird, said Mr. Leatherwood.Thats not how you abbreviate Tennessee.Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed.It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments, Mr. Leatherwood said.It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation.He said others had as well.He never heard back.After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trumps firing of F.B.I.director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, I love my whiteness.And yours.@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.I cant tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account, said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself.But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress.After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background.One of them presented the companys long-held philosophy: We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.

Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising:::::Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election.Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human trolls and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government.But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.Now the Silicon Valley companies long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance.Twitters general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform.Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads sponsors.But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitters lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising.Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities use of the platform to influence American politics praised the companys decision on Thursday but cautioned that it would not be enough.I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitters most vocal critics on Capitol Hill.What I hope is well see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twitters announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets RT and Sputnik from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability.In September, the companys vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RTs three principal Twitter accounts.In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011.The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitters decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform.Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human trolls on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.I think its only a drop in the bucket, said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Whats far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputniks ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesnt need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.Moreover, Twitters decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter and rival social media companies treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms.Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda.China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.A Twitter spokeswoman said the companys decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets.This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization, the spokeswoman said in a statement.Its about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.
Scanning, Converting and Editing Text on the Go:::::Q.Are there any inexpensive Android apps that let you take a picture of a document and convert the photo to a Microsoft Word-compatible file that can be edited and printed?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.A. Optical character recognition (O.C.R.)apps are designed to convert images of letters in documents or other printed sources into text files you can edit in Microsoft Word or another word-processing program.O.C.R.apps for Android are available in the Google Play store, just as similar programs for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile and desktop systems can be found in the respective app stores.Some apps can even translate photographed text into different languages.If you use the Microsoft Office suite for writing and editing documents, however, a combination of Microsoft Word for Android and the separate Office Lens app is one way to snap, scan and edit when you are on the go.When you have both apps on your Android device, open Office Lens and take a picture of the page or printed material you want to convert into a Word file; the app can also convert a photograph of notes scrawled on a white board into text files.Photo When you are asked to save and store the photo, choose Microsoft Word from the list of apps and services.The Android version of Word then takes over to open the file, covert the text into type you can edit and then open the content in a word-processing document on your phone or tablet.You can edit it there, email it to yourself for use elsewhere or park it in a linked online storage site like OneDrive.The process works about the same way with the apps on an iOS or Windows-based device.
Twitter Says It Overstated Monthly-User Figures for 3 Years:::::Photo Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting.The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent.The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitters reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russias efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide.Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures.Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program.Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Googles parent company, this year.
F.C.C. to Loosen Rules on Local Media Ownership:::::Photo WASHINGTON The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.The commissions chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market.The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated.They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975, Mr. Pai said.It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry.Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the spring, soon after he lifted a cap on how many stations a single company can own, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion.The merger, which the F.C.C.and the Department of Justice are reviewing, would give Sinclair access to more than 70 percent of all television viewers in the United States.This week, the commissions Republican majority lifted rules that required television stations owners to operate a main studio in each locality, which Mr. Pai said was unnecessary and costly for TV station owners.
Amazon’s Latest Way Into Your Life Is Through the Front Door:::::Photo SEATTLE For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain.Now, if customers give it permission, Amazons couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home.What could possibly go wrong?The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home.There are risks for couriers too whether its an attacking dog or an escaping cat.To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera.Amazon isnt the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping.This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier.The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them.E-commerce companies have experimented with ways of making deliveries more secure for years.Amazon installs self-service lockers in office buildings and outside supermarkets where customers can fetch their orders, and Daimler and other carmakers have tested the delivery of goods from Amazon and other retailers to customers car trunks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The costs of package theft arent known Amazon, for example, will not say but are probably substantial.Most people who have spent any time on a neighborhood blog, social network or email list have a sense of how prevalent such crime is.And packages sitting on front porches can also signal to anyone who walks by that the homeowners are away.
How Google’s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password:::::The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.After the attack, Googles security team came up with a motto: Never again.The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers Gmail accounts.It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked.Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.The idea of Googles Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message.Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group?Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Googles Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys.But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.Setting Up Advanced Protection Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Googles Advanced Protection webpage.To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each.Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you.To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it.(The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.)This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins.That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But there are trade-offs.Googles Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.For the time being, that means only Googles Gmail mail app, Googles Backup and Sync app, and Googles Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Googles Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser.So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, youre out of luck.Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Testing the Security Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A.hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons.On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or dont have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account.Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account.In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle.She said Googles requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account.That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Googles program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.Its something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys, Ms. Sandvik said.I dont see a reason you shouldnt turn this on.The Bottom Line While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Googles apps from Apples and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Googles mail, messaging and cloud storage services.But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature Apples V.I.P.alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you.Googles iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature.For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P.alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which wont work with the keys.If using Googles security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online.Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Googles lead.If you decide to wait, dont procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Googles keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: No comment.

Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don’t Bet on It:::::Now, that attitude is beginning to change.I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants power through government and, if so, how.There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech.The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last years presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five Amazon, Facebook and Google.Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right.Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest well see drastic action anytime soon.Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants vast powers might be harmful.The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague.The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.Individuals, lawmakers, were all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies, said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power.For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting.In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder.(Google and New America have denied that claim.)Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies, Mr. Lynn said.Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and Id bet a lot of money a year from now well see real huge shifts in feelings around here.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power.Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what weve ever expected from corporations.In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships.Theyre being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Theyre creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons.And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power.Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.Apples iPhone is the worlds most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines.But only in the last year did Amazons annual revenue surpass that of Costco.It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmarts sun.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants.We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street.The Fives power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices.We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them.For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.Weve all become a bit cyborg, writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in World Without Mind, one of several new books examining the giants.What we need to always remember is that were not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.The complicated nature of the Fives power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them.In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon.Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazons growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy.Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because its politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices.Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didnt need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking.Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review.During last years presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasnt done much in office to carry that out.Amazons purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive, said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the governments antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the companys culture which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing todays tech giants.But thats a big if.The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?Mr. Reback said.Had we been more diligent, we wouldnt have nearly the problems we have today.
Big Tech’s Rivals Pounce at Chances to Win in Washington:::::The action is nascent, but gaining momentum fast.Lawmakers are pushing for regulations for technology companies for the first time in years, encouraged along by big techs broad assortment of rivals.For several weeks, a group of companies including smaller tech companies and entertainment and retail businesses has informally begun regular meetings and conference calls to compare notes about Google, Facebook and Amazon and to find a way to join in a stronger opposition force.Before, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school, said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times.But now the halo is a bit off these companies.In recent years, lawmakers have held up technology companies as the epitome of American ingenuity and felt that voters did not want the government to slow them down.That attitude was hardened in 2012, after lawmakers suffered a bruising defeat in a bill to strengthen antipiracy rules for internet companies.The proposals set off huge online protests, aided by the big technology companies, that helped stop the legislation.Over the years, Ive watched as the major tech companies not only sought to protect the unlevel playing field they already had, but have used their political influence to expand it to disadvantage businesses with which they compete, said Jim Cicconi, who recently retired after years overseeing lobbying at AT&T.Now I think policymakers are seeing the consequences.But even as they sense an opportunity today, the rivals say that challenging the internet companies remains a daunting task.They doubt they can put a dent into the online ad duopoly of Facebook and Google.It will also be difficult, they say, to restrain Amazons fast movement into new markets, given the companys willingness to lose money to gain a foothold.Internet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill.House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier.Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.Photo The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers.They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points, said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.The tech giants are also lodging a strong defense against the newly proposed regulations.Facebook and Google hired high-profile political operatives to thwart changes in election disclosures at the Federal Election Commission and have deployed lobbyists to water down a bipartisan bill introduced last week that would require social media platforms to disclose the financing behind political ads.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The clearest opening has been in an unpopular battle that Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have waged against a bill aimed to curb sex trafficking.The bill would take away some legal protections for sites that knowingly host content that promotes sex trafficking, a move that the internet companies warn could stifle free speech, even though it would largely exempt the big tech companies from liability.Disney, Oracle and 21 Century Fox have endorsed the legislation.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill.In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.Its past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business, Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, and that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.The tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well.In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission.In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, recently wrote the commission to ask it disclose information about why it closed its case on Google in 2013.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has asked the agency to reopen its investigation in light of new evidence that surfaced in the case led by European regulators.In July, the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, began advocating for antitrust exemptions that would allow the companies to collectively bargain with Facebook and Google for ad revenue.On Tuesday, David Chavern, president of the group, argued at a House hearing that digital platforms like Google and Facebook should follow the same rules that broadcast and print news organizations do.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business, Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation.John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Googles collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles.He has struggled to get attention in the past, but that is not much of a problem now.Im getting more calls these days, Mr. Simpson said.
Trump to Open Skies to More Drone Testing:::::Photo WASHINGTON President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet.Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages activities limited by federal restrictions.The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said.For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year.The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming.Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes.Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Many questions remain about the program announced on Wednesday, including how many drones could be part of pilot programs.The Federal Aviation Administration is still deliberating potential rules for commercial drones, which are expected to have far more impact on the industry than Wednesdays executive memorandum.
How Australia’s Technology Stands Out:::::What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?Were still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter Ive always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis.The song was So What, and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.We also went analog with our brainstorming equipment.Instead of white boards, we bought two studio rollers with craft paper.What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.Are Australians excited?Reaction is pretty mixed.Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.I was stunned.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity.Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter.And I love them.I cant believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesnt work well with a bit of wind.I dont know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.And as long as were talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?Gumtree is my favorite.Ive used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things.The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.Its great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.

Power Up Your Phone by Hand or by Sun:::::Q.As recent storms and power outages have shown, we are now deeply reliant on cellphones for communication, especially since many people have gotten rid of their landlines.If theres no electricity, what options do you have for charging a phone battery?A.Backup batteries only last for so long, but hand-cranked chargers and miniature solar panels are two options for restoring a little power to your mobile phone.Adding an alternative charging device to your household emergency kit (along with the flashlights and candles) is one way to stay in contact with others, but keep in mind that for large-scale outages, network cellular service and Wi-Fi routers will most likely be down as well.Several companies make hand-cranked chargers, including Etn and K-TOR.Prices start at about $17 for a simple crank and go up from there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.To use one, connect the phone to the device with its USB charging cable and then turn the crank continuously until you see the phones battery level move up a notch or two.Depending on the devices involved, this can take several minutes of cranking, but you should be able to get enough power to make an emergency call which can be helpful if, say, your house is having power problems of its own and you need to call an electrician.Photo If hand-cranking does not appeal to you, Etn also offers solar-powered solutions and K-TOR has a pedal-powered charger for about $200.Portable solar-powered chargers can supply energy to devices in emergency and nonemergency situations (like camping) without physical effort.Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, tested 70 solar battery chargers and found the $51 Anker PowerPort Solar Lite to be the best model for juicing up mobile devices.Smartphone cases with built-in solar chargers are another option, even for everyday use.SnowLizard makes cases for current iPhone models and the Portable Solar Shop site sells cases for several Android phones.
The iPhone X Arrives Friday. Here’s What You Need to Know.:::::Paying for It Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.There are various ways to pay that hefty price.The simplest route is to pay for the device outright.This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier whenever you want.You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan.For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month.This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually.Its essentially leasing a new phone every year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Internetting With Amanda Hess Our critic discusses everything thats wrong, weird and totally sad about the internet in five videos.Sign-up for email notifications.There are various early upgrade plans on the market.With Apples early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once youve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate.(Im not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8 Before you splurge, consider your options.Apples iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799.The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.So whats the difference?Mainly, the screen.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels the border surrounding the display whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ.The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner.The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a persons head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments.The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.Photo How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner.The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.Face ID is brand new there hasnt been anything like it on a smartphone before.It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots.The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.Because the shape of a persons head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone elses face is one in a million, according to Apple.Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device.All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera which some people already did with Samsungs facial-recognition feature.The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces.If youre skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.
How to Stop Waking Up the iPhone:::::Q. I just got a new iPhone and have noticed that every time I pick it up or move it, the screen pops on by itself instead of me turning it on with the switch.Is this a problem with the phone?A.The iPhone 6s and later models include a feature called Raise to Wake that senses when you pick up the device and then automatically flips on the display screen so you do not have to fumble around with the Home or power buttons when you want to check something.If you have just purchased a new iPhone or had not upgraded your hardware in a few years, the sudden activity can seem a little unsettling.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.When you lift the phone and the display wakes up, you land on the iPhones lock screen.You can see your alerts without having to unlock the phone if you have notifications set to show up there.(Some people prefer not to, out of privacy concerns.)Raise to Wake also saves you a step if you need to snap a photo in a hurry because as you lift the phone, you can swipe the screen to the left to quickly jump to the iPhones Camera app.Swiping up from the bottom of the screen summons the iOS Control Center, where you can change the music volume, use the iPhones flashlight, switch on Airplane Mode and adjust other settings without having to unlock the phone and fiddle around in the main Settings app.Photo If you do not want your notifications visible to people nearby or worry your phones battery is taking too much of a hit when the screen pops on each time you move the device, you can turn off Raise to Wake.To do that, unlock your iPhone, tap the Settings app on the Home screen, select Display & Brightness and tap the button near Raise to Wake to disable the feature.
Scanning, Converting and Editing Text on the Go:::::Q.Are there any inexpensive Android apps that let you take a picture of a document and convert the photo to a Microsoft Word-compatible file that can be edited and printed?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.A. Optical character recognition (O.C.R.)apps are designed to convert images of letters in documents or other printed sources into text files you can edit in Microsoft Word or another word-processing program.O.C.R.apps for Android are available in the Google Play store, just as similar programs for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile and desktop systems can be found in the respective app stores.Some apps can even translate photographed text into different languages.If you use the Microsoft Office suite for writing and editing documents, however, a combination of Microsoft Word for Android and the separate Office Lens app is one way to snap, scan and edit when you are on the go.When you have both apps on your Android device, open Office Lens and take a picture of the page or printed material you want to convert into a Word file; the app can also convert a photograph of notes scrawled on a white board into text files.Photo When you are asked to save and store the photo, choose Microsoft Word from the list of apps and services.The Android version of Word then takes over to open the file, covert the text into type you can edit and then open the content in a word-processing document on your phone or tablet.You can edit it there, email it to yourself for use elsewhere or park it in a linked online storage site like OneDrive.The process works about the same way with the apps on an iOS or Windows-based device.
How Google’s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password:::::The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.After the attack, Googles security team came up with a motto: Never again.The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers Gmail accounts.It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked.Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.The idea of Googles Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message.Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group?Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Googles Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys.But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.Setting Up Advanced Protection Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Googles Advanced Protection webpage.To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each.Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you.To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it.(The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.)This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins.That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But there are trade-offs.Googles Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.For the time being, that means only Googles Gmail mail app, Googles Backup and Sync app, and Googles Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Googles Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser.So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, youre out of luck.Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Testing the Security Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A.hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons.On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or dont have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account.Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account.In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle.She said Googles requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account.That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Googles program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.Its something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys, Ms. Sandvik said.I dont see a reason you shouldnt turn this on.The Bottom Line While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Googles apps from Apples and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Googles mail, messaging and cloud storage services.But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature Apples V.I.P.alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you.Googles iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature.For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P.alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which wont work with the keys.If using Googles security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online.Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Googles lead.If you decide to wait, dont procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Googles keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: No comment.
How to Free Space on Your Mac, One Way or Another:::::Q. I am trying to conserve space on my Mac, and I read about the storage-optimization tools on the Storage tab in the About This Mac box.However, when I open the box and click the Storage tab, I dont have a Manage button to click and start the cleanup process.Why?A. Apple added the Optimized Storage feature to its macOS Sierra (10.12) update.If your operating system is older than last years release, you will not see the Manage button on the Storage tab that leads you to the new space-saving utilities.Photo You can see what version of the system you are using by going to the Apple menu, selecting About This Mac and clicking the Overview tab.If your Mac is running OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or earlier, you need to update your operating system to use the storage-optimization feature.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.If you cannot (or do not want to) update your Macs operating system, you can manually free up space by deleting unneeded files, old mail attachments and other clutter.You can also find programs to automatically sweep your computer and collect unnecessary files.Clean My Mac 3 ($40, with a free trial period available), Cocktail (on sale for $19, also with a free trial period) and the free AVG Cleaner for Mac are three possibilities.For those who upgrade (or who have already), Apples support site has a guide to using the storage-optimizing tools in macOS Sierra and the new macOS High Sierra.Among other things, you can use the feature to seek out and delete files you no longer need, store documents and photos in iCloud and automatically empty the Macs trash can.
How Australia’s Technology Stands Out:::::What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?Were still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter Ive always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis.The song was So What, and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.We also went analog with our brainstorming equipment.Instead of white boards, we bought two studio rollers with craft paper.What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.Are Australians excited?Reaction is pretty mixed.Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.I was stunned.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity.Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter.And I love them.I cant believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesnt work well with a bit of wind.I dont know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.And as long as were talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?Gumtree is my favorite.Ive used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things.The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.Its great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.
A Stylus That Works for Tablet and Wallet:::::Q.What is the difference between a $100 tablet stylus compared with a $10 model?A.Those pricier styluses are often designed to work with a specific tablet line as is the case of the Apple Pencil, the Google Pixelbook Pen and the Microsoft Surface Pen and can include customized features for those devices.For example, Googles Pixelbook Pen integrates with the Google Assistant software and will search the web for words or images you circle on the Pixelbook screen.Photo If you are just looking for a stylus to take handwritten notes or do some basic drawing, the less expensive models are probably fine.The $10 Adonit Mark, the $20 Hand Stylus and the thick-barreled $25 Studio Neat Cosmonaut are all general purpose models that work on most capacitive touch screen devices.Unlike the more expensive stylus models, which sometimes require their own battery power or Bluetooth pairing with a designated tablet, most economy models do not need to be powered and work right out of the package.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.For those with artistic inclinations or who want a stylus that was designed to work smoothly with certain tablet hardware and software, the more expensive models have perks.Most include a wider degree of tilt and pressure sensitivity, which lets you vary the weight and shading of the lines drawn on the tablet screen, much like a pen on paper.The higher-end tablet pens are often more responsive, with less lag time between when you put the tip to the glass and when you see your handwriting or sketches appear.Forking over a hundred dollars for a digital writing stick may be too much of an extravagance for many people.In the middle ground, you can also find accessories that offer more features than the basic models but cost less than a high-end stylus.The $40 Sensu Artist Brush & Stylus includes two artists tools (including a digital paintbrush) in one device that works with most touch screens, while the $75 Adonit Pixel promises smooth response, pressure sensitivity and shortcut buttons, all while working on a wider variety of iOS devices than the Apple Pencil.

Google unveils new Hangouts Meet videoconferencing kit and it’s not cheap:::::Google has unleashed a new hardware kit for Hangouts Meet which promises to deliver everything you need on the hardware front when it comes to holding high-quality video meetings via Googles videoconferencing software but it isnt cheap at $1,999 (around 1,500).For that outlay, you get a hardware kit comprising of four main components: an Asus Chromebox, touchscreen controller, speakermic and a 4K camera.The Asus Chromebox mini desktop computer provides the engine here, running alongside the touchscreen controller, with Google promising an intuitive interface with the latter.All the controls you need to easily manage meetings are present, like pinning and muting team members, or controlling the camera.Speaking of which, the 4K camera has a 120-degree field of view to allow it to take in more folks who are sat around the meeting table, and it automatically detects meeting participants (using machine learning routines), also cropping and zooming people to frame them correctly.Crisp audio As for the speakermic unit, this is designed to be able to shrug off background noise, and also get rid of any pesky echo, so theoretically, the end result is a clean audio feed for your meetings.Meet has also been boosted with new features, and now G Suite Enterprise users can record a meeting straight to Google Drive if they so wish.You can also hold meetings with up to 50 members.The Hangouts Meet hardware kit is available from today and as mentioned it will set you back $1,999 (around 1,500).

Age of Empires 4: release date, trailers and features:::::After more than 12 years in hibernation, the Age of Empires series is back for its fourth outing.In August, publisher Microsoft Studios announced that Age of Empires 4 was alive and kicking, and that it was being developed by Relic Entertainment, the team behind Homeworld and Company of Heroes (which is a hell of a lot of pedigree).This article will tell you everything you need to know about the game, and well update it when new information comes to light, so make sure you check back regularly.Cut to the chase What is it?The latest installment to the historical real-time strategy series Age of Empires.The latest installment to the historical real-time strategy series Age of Empires.When can I play it?There's no release window just yet but it'll be late 2018 at the earliest There's no release window just yet but it'll be late 2018 at the earliest What can I play it on?Windows 10 PC is the only confirmed platform What is Age of Empires 4?Age of Empires 4 is the latest installment to the historical real-time strategy series Age of Empires, which began life way back in 1997.Follow-ups to the original were released in 1999 and 2005, and theres been a couple of spin-offs during that period, including two Nintendo DS titles and the popular Age of Mythology, which took inspiration from myths and legends rather than history.Aside from those DS games, the series is only on PC.Age of Empires 4 is the first game in the series developed by Relic Entertainment all the other Age of Empires games have been made by Ensemble Studios, which folded in 2009.Relic says it wants to fuse historical context with deep strategic gameplay, and to bring this franchise back to the forefront of gaming and into the hands of its beloved community.Unfortunately, no release date has been announced for Age of Empires 4 not even a rough one.It could be a way off though, because all weve seen of the game is a trailer filled with concept art, which suggests development is in its early stages.If we were betting on it, wed say it wont be until late next year at the earliest.What platforms will Age of Empires 4 release on?So far, all we know is that its coming to Windows 10 PC so bad luck if youre running an older version (although this could be a good excuse to upgrade).However, with Microsoft Studios as the publisher the door is open for a release on Xbox One, too, although theres been no word on that front.For the same reason, its unlikely to come to other consoles, such as the PS4 or the Nintendo Switch.Age of Empires 4: trailers The announcement of the game was marked with a trailer and its still the only one weve seen to date.Its exclusively concept art for the game, depicting large scale battles between various groups.Check it out below: Age of Empire 4: gameplay features Previous Age of Empires games have focused on one period of history: Age of Empires 3 chronicled the European colonization of the Americas, for example.However, judging by the trailer above, Age of Empires 4 could paint with a broader historical picture, with lots of empires from across time returning from previous games in the series.In the trailer, you can glimpse Native Americans, British Redcoats, Romans and Japanese samurai.Its possible that this could just be demonstrative of the art style and themes, but wed be surprised if they didnt end up featuring in the final game in some capacity.That said, its unlikely to break history by pitting armies from two eras against each other in the campaign, so expect a story that plays out over an extended timeline.And then perhaps the Romans could clash with the Redcoats in online multiplayer.In terms of actual gameplay, we wouldnt expect it to deviate too far from the formula that fans of the series know and love it would be odd for the developer not to mine that ore of support.So, there will be the usual 4X fare (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate).However, the last Age of Empires game was more than 10 years ago, so were expecting some changes in terms of UI and mechanics.Age of Empires 4: what wed like to see A sleeker UI The Age of Empires games have always had decent UIs most of the stuff you need is two or at most three clicks away and, generally, if you hover over a button you can find out what it does.But going back to it now, it looks a bit old fashioned, with a large box covering most of the bottom section of the screen, and can be overwhelming at first glance.If the series is going to attract new players (and the more the merrier) then the UI needs to be sleek and inviting.Age of Empires Online, another spin-off, might perhaps be a good guide: that game had much less on screen at any one time, allowing you to see more of the battlefield.Smaller, contextual menus that only appear when you click on certain elements would work well.Revamped unit tactics The Age of Empires games do boast military tactics, and the positioning and stances of your units can turn a battle.But largely, fights are won by the biggest army, and they are over quickly.Wed like to see tactics play a bigger role in battles, and for it to be easier to make small adjustments to groups of units so they do exactly what you want.Theres hope here: Relic has a lot of pedigree in this field.Imagine Age of Empires with Company of Heroes-style unit movement when you got close to an enemys base.Thats not what Relic will be shooting for (this is about clashes of large armies rather than small strike forces, after all), but were confident it will be more finessed than anything else weve seen from the series so far.Multiple cities Age of Empires revels in its smaller scale.You start with a town hall and build out from there, never really expanding beyond a single settlement.Rise of Nations, also published by Microsoft, could be a good yard stick for how the game should expand; in that game you could build multiple cities and combine them into large territories.If you apply that to Age of Empires then you get multiple hubs of production: one town could focus on food production, and transport the finished product to another nearby town, which is itself churning out military units.Planning out the structure of your empire, rather than just a single city, would add another layer to the game.
Russia cracks down on VPNs with new law to maintain censorship:::::As previously promised, Russia is cracking down on VPN services, with a new law that comes into force today giving the government fresh powers to ensure that websites that it wants blocked, stay blocked.As you may be aware, VPNs can be used to access sites which are banned in a particular country, by giving the user an IP address that makes it appear that theyre based in another country.But the new legislation combats the circumvention of such content restrictions, by requiring VPN providers to put a hard block on websites which Roskomnadzor (the Russian government communications watchdog) has deemed should be censored.In short, a VPN will no longer be an effective way to get around such government censorship providing that VPN services enact the law as required.Refusing isnt an option If the VPN provider refuses to register with Roskomnadzor and implement the watchdogs blacklist of sites within a month, those services will be blocked, as The Moscow Times reports.Last month, search engines were also banned from displaying results for government blacklisted sites.Over in China weve also seen tighter anti-VPN measures come into play throughout the course of this year, with the government starting to implement measures that only allow approved VPNs to operate, and pushing Apple to remove certain VPN apps from its App Store.
Download our free Future of VPN ebook for the chance to win a top smartphone:::::There was a time where only hardcore geeks and security enthusiasts would know what a VPN is, let alone how to use one and whether you need to buy one (check out our best VPN guide) or latch on free VPNs.But the exponential rise of seamless connectivity coupled with the ongoing onslaught on individual privacy have propelled this technology into the limelight.The last year has also seen a number of events that have caused concern among privacy advocates and prompted us to approach the people that matter in the VPN industry, asking them one simple question What do you think the future of VPN looks like?The ebook that came out of these conversations talks about about what lies ahead in terms of challenges, opportunities and generally speaking, what the future looks like for the VPN industry.Fill this short survey below, answer a trick question, download this free copy of the exclusive "Future of VPN" e-book and you could win a top-of-the-range smartphone, the Doogee Mix, worth 140.The Doogee Mix Terms and Conditions: - The competition is open to UK entrants only.Under 18s must obtain parental consent to enter this competition and be able to demonstrate this to Techradar Pro's reasonable satisfaction.- Answers must be received by 30/11/2017.The winners will be selected at random from all correct entries received and will be sent the prize free of charge.For full terms and conditions, please visit http://www.futureplc.com/competition-rules/.- Note that the items given away have been used for reviews so they may have light scratches and/or missing accessories and may come in a plain envelope.
HTC U11 Plus gets shown off early in detailed video:::::Were likely just a day away from the announcement of the HTC U11 Plus, but it seems someones jumped the gun, as a video has shown off the unannounced handset and revealed specs and pricing.The video, spotted by Reddit users, isnt in English and we're not certain what language it is but commenters who can speak it claim that it states the HTC U11 Plus will have a 6-inch screen, a battery thats almost 4,000mAh, water resistance, wireless charging and 128GB of storage.That's all going to come with a price tag of 849 Swiss Francs, which equates to around $850/640/AU$1105.You can also see from the video that the phone has a software rotary dial, which acts as a shortcut to apps, and that it inherits Edge Sense from the standard HTC U11.Thats the name for the squeezable sides which act as a shortcut to apps and functions, and apparently Edge Sense here will be context-sensitive.The video shows the HTC U11 Plus from all angles, and, well, it looks a lot like the other leaks weve seen, and a lot like the standard HTC U11, as its got a glossy glass back and larger bezels above and below the screen than many recent flagships.Another phone on the way Alongside the U11 Plus, the video also shows off the more mid-range HTC U11 Life, which will apparently have a 5.2-inch screen, a polycarbonate back, water resistance, Edge Sense, expandable storage and a 16MP front-facing camera.This one will apparently cost 349 Swiss Francs (around $350/260/AU$455) and the specs of both phones match up with what weve heard before, so theres a good chance theyre accurate.We should find out for sure on November 2.The OnePlus 5T could soon arrive too Via PocketNow

New iPad 9.7 deals The brand new iPad 9.7-inch model is the successor to the iPad Air 2.It's a fraction thicker but contains an improved A9 chip with an M9 coprocessor for enhanced performance.Surprisingly, this new model is actually cheaper than the iPad Air 2, making it the choice for anyone wanting a larger pad without the high costs of the Pro model.In the US, prices for the 32GB model launched at $329, compared to 339 in the UK and $469 in Australia.The 128GB model's price at launch was US$429/429/AU$599.Opt for the cellular/SIM card 32GB model prices are around US$469/469/AU$669, with the 128GB model priced at US$559/559/AU$799.Ready to order a new iPad now?Then you better take a look at the new iPad deals below.iPad Pro (2017) deals Hey, wasn't there supposed to be an iPad Pro 2 this year?Well, yes, but Apple instead decided to name their new iPad Pro, the iPad Pro.Thanks, Apple.We can help make sure you're able to spot the differences between the two though to make sure you don't buy the old ones by mistake if you want the latest and best iPad Pro deals.First up, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is actually a brand new size in the iPad Pro range, as the previous smallest model was 9.7-inches.There is a new 12.9-inch model though.But how do you tell the difference between the old and new iPad Pro versions?Our go-to tactic is to check the internal spec and look for the one key difference.The newest iPad Pros use an A10X processor, and the older ones have the A9X chip.So if you want to be sure you're getting the latest version, look out for that A10X processor chip.Some retailers may have '2017' in the listing title too, but many, including Apple, don't.So let's look at reasons to buy the new iPad Pro over the older ones.The A10X is a faster processor to give it the edge over the older iPad Pro although the performance boost isn't huge to be honest.The rear camera gets a modest megapixel boost.The front camera gets a bigger boost though for a much clearer FaceTime experience.Both of the new models are available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB hard drive sizes.You'll also need to decide if you want a standard iPad Pro with only Wi-Fi or mobile tethering options available for online activities, or to opt for the considerably more expensive cellular models and a data-only SIM only deal too.The new iPad Pro screens screens now benefit from smaller bezels and an improved display, for arguably the best iPad screen yet.All things considered though, the list of changes for the new iPad Pro aren't exactly revolutionary.If the minor improvements don't float your boat, you should take a look further down this page as we've listed the best deals available for the older iPad Pro models.There's a strong chance you'll be able to save money by opting for an older model for a while.If not, the latest prices for the new iPad Pro deals are directly below.iPad Pro 9.7-inch deals The older 9.7 model is much cheaper than the new 10.5-incher The iPad Pro 9.7 used to be the gold standard in iPad design, but it's been dethroned by its slightly larger, yet younger sibling.This model originally arrived in March 2016 instead of an iPad Air 3 and packs many of the outstanding features of the iPad Pro 12.9-inch model.That's great news for anyone who wanted pro features in a smaller design.This is the cheapest of all the iPad Pro models today too.iPad Pro 12.9-inch deals The older iPad Pro is much cheaper than the new version The iPad Pro isn't a laptop replacement in the way power users will hope.But it is, by some distance, one of the most brilliant tablets ever released.Using its enormous 12.9-inch screen is simply gorgeous and the power inside is unrivalled in the tablet world.So to anyone that wants an iPad with more power, a better media and reading experience and more abilities than ever before, there's no question here.Go for the iPad Pro and you'll love it.With the new 2017 version on shelves now, we're seeing the price drop on this still excellent iPad.iPad Air 2 deals One of the best 'normal' iPads available Apple improved on perfection with the iPad Air 2.There's a newer iPad 9.7 that acts as a spiritual successor to the iPad Air 2, but you can often find this one for less, especially if you're happy with refurbished models.The combination of power, better screen, improved design and upgraded OS make this a very, very compelling device - and that's before getting into the fact the app ecosystem is so much stronger than on Android.It's even better now iOS 10 is capable of scaling apps so seamlessly - the days of low-res iPhone apps are gone.Here are the best cheap iPad Air 2 deals currently available... iPad Air deals It's a year older but this iPad is still a fantastic tablet It's a joy to hold the iPad Air - even though it's now the thicker option compare to the iPad above.From the clever construction to the fast processor to the improved user interface, this iPad may be a bit older but it's still excellent.Choose a cheap iPad Air deal from these options we've found: iPad mini 4 deals The best 7-inch tablet ever made?One of the major changes with the iPad mini 4 over last year's mini 3 is its design.It may look the same, but it's been slimmed down from 7.5mm to a wafer thin 6.1mm.It's also now more powerful, has a stunning screen and the battery is still a 10-hour beast.The A8 processor is a good step up from the A7 inside the mini 3 so if you're going to play 3D games or throw around some of the more hefty iPad apps from the App Store, this is certainly your best option.iPad mini 3 deals A great iPad, but we prefer the mini 4 now If you want an iPad mini - this is another great option because it's almost as good as the iPad mini 4 above, but prices aren't always cheaper on this one now.The 7.9-inch screen is the perfect size in our opinion - you can hold it in one hand but it's still big enough to be satisfying when you watch videos or browse the web.Here's every cheap iPad mini 3 deal you could ever want, and then some... iPad mini 2 deals The first iPad mini with Retina display is a deal-tastic marvel If you're looking for the best iPad deal you might well find it on this iPad right here.Deals on this iPad fluctuate regularly -

The best Apple TV deals pre-Black Friday 2017:::::The Apple TV is a neat device that turns any TV into a Smart TV and you've come to the right place if you're looking for Apple TV deals, including all the latest information on how to buy the new Apple TV 4K.You'll be able to stream online content from major apps like Netflix and iPlayer, and there's a huge wealth of App store and iTunes content to enjoy on the big screen too.For the older Apple TV units, there is no native app for Amazon Instant Video though.Thankfully, Apple and Amazon have called a truce for the upcoming Apple TV 4K, which will finally see the Netflix rival join Apple TV.The new Apple TV 4K is available now from $179/179.The fourth generation Apple TV (aka the 2015 model) usually costs around $149/139 for the 32GB version, so you shouldn't pay any more.We'll run through the best deals for the 3rd and 4th generation models too.The outdated older-gen models have been discontinued, so we haven't included them in the roundup.Apple is remarkably slow to the 4K streaming race and hasn't done itself any favours by coming in with the most expensive price compared to the Amazon Fire TV, or the best Roku deals and Chromecast Ultra deals.Fingers crossed the extra competition means we could have a proper sales rumble come Black Friday 2017.Apple TV 4K deals Talk about being late to the party!Fans of all things Apple have been waiting for a Ultra HD Apple TV 4K for a few years now while the likes of Amazon, Roku and Google have all beaten the Cupertino firm to the punch.Apple TV 4K is finally available to buy though.The Apple TV 4K has some catching up to do, but will come with 4K and HDR (High Dynamic Range) support.The inclusion of Amazon Instant Video support means this could become your new all-in-one device if you're already settled into the Apple ecosystem.It can go one better than the competition too thanks to Dolby Vision support, not that there's a huge amount of DV content yet.Apple TV 4K prices start at $179, 179, AU$249 for the 32GB version, then $199, 199, AU$279 for the 64GB model.Apple TV 4th gen (2015) deals The 2015 version of Apple TV is on sale now and was seen as the best yet in the series before the Apple TV 4K came along.An updated remote control with a touchpad and a Siri-friendly microphone will make iPhone users feel right at home.There are 32GB and 64GB models available.The 32GB Apple TV should be enough for most users, especially if you're mainly going to stream media.Apple TV 3rd gen deals You can save a lot of money if you're willing to opt for the older third generation Apple TV.This was the first Apple TV to feature 1080p, so you're still set for full HD loveliness.The remote control is a bit dated compared to the new Siri-friendly one on the 4th gen machine, but you still have the option of using the AirPlay app on an iPad/iPhone instead.There's no on-board storage, so this model is strictly for streaming only.This version has an optional optical out audio connection - a feature cut from the 2015 model for some reason.
Microsoft boldly claims 99.999% reliability record for its newer Surface devices:::::Following criticism from Consumer Reports that you may recall from back in the summer, Microsoft has revealed a fresh statistic in defense of the reliability of its Surface devices, and its a bold claim indeed.Ryan Gavin, who is General Manager, Microsoft Surface, told ZDNet that Surface machines were getting more and more reliable as time goes on, and that reliability issues among the newer Surface devices were very rare indeed.Gavin asserted: "We're talking about incidents per device of less than 0.001%."In other words, fewer than one in 100,000 of these devices prove to be faulty.The findings of Consumer Reports a few months back were at the other end of the scale, citing two-year breakage rates of 25% across all (newer and older) Surface devices, although Microsoft was quick to defend itself at the time, and assert that incidents per unit as tracked by the company itself were under 1%.This latest claim is obviously going even further than that, and its certainly a startling figure, but theres a caveat when Gavin says newer Surface devices, he specifically cites the Surface Laptop and Surface Studio as examples, but theres no mention of the Surface Pro (which also got a new model this year).So a sprinkle or two from the salt shaker may be needed in this respect, and we cant make too much judgment from the 0.001% figure, as exactly what it pertains to isnt made clear.And indeed no timeframe is mentioned as to when faults might crop up, although presumably the statistic covers a short observed period considering that the Surface Laptop was only launched in June.Reliability rules However, the overall message from Microsoft is clear enough: its working hard to make sure that Surface devices are increasingly reliable.For some overall perspective drawn from older products, after the Consumer Reports figures had emerged in August, leaked figures from Microsoft running up to April of this year showed return rates of around 3% and 5% for the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book respectively.Microsoft took serious issue with the methodology of the Consumer Reports study at the time, and Gavin still does, drawing a comparison with the evaluation of home appliances, and telling ZDNet that it was like asking: Has your dishwasher behaved unexpectedly in the past two years?and if the answer was yes, you'd be deemed unreliable.And as we observed at the time, in fairness to Microsoft, it seemed that the Consumer Reports stats could also have been skewed by the initial high return rates on Surface Book and Pro 4 devices when they were first launched.
The Grand Tour Season 2 starts December 8, trailer out now:::::Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May can't stay idle for too long."The Grand Tour's" first season started last November, and its second season is due to start in about a month's time."The Grand Tour's" second season kicks off on Dec. 8 and like last year you can catch the whole thing on Amazon Prime Video.A new trailer came out with the announcement and, also like last year, it's packed with cars, antics and old men making childish jokes.The former "Top Gear" trio's adventures take them to snowy mountaintops and mud pits, with a variety of supercars, off-roaders and just about every other type of car in between.There even appears to be a tank in there, because every good car show needs a tank.If you don't have Amazon Prime, this is as good a reason as any to sign up for the free trial.Whatever you do, don't join the millions who pirated the previous season -- that's not very nice.
Amazon's mobile app gets new AR shopping feature:::::Just in time for the holidays, Amazon has boosted its augmented-reality shopping game.The online retailer on Wednesday unveiled "AR view" on its Amazon shopping app.The new feature, which is only available for now for customers using iOS 11 installed on their iPhone 6S or later, lets shoppers check what new products might look like in their homes before buying them.People can select from thousands of items -- including furniture, vases, toasters and Amazon Echo devices -- and overlay 3D images of them at home using their phone's camera to get a better feel for their dimensions and look.Amazon joins a handful of retailers who've already added AR features to their shopping apps through iOS 11's ARKit, including furniture sellers Ikea and Wayfair.Google's new ARCore software should also help bring many more AR games and shopping concepts in the future.Using these features, customers could get more comfortable buying bigger ticket items online, like sofas, and would be less likely to return them -- which would be a benefit for e-commerce companies.
Singapore leads the world in mobile download speeds:::::Enlarge Image OpenSignal If you want to spend time in a country with insane mobile download speeds, Singapore and South Korea will be at the top of your list.Norway, Hungary and the Netherlands are good choices too, according to wireless-coverage mapping company OpenSignal's report released Wednesday.Singapore led 77 nations with a 46.6Mbps average download speed for 4G LTE, with South Korea not far behind with an average of 45.9Mbps.Rounding out the top five were three European countries: Norway at 42.03Mbps, Hungary at 42Mbps and the Netherlands at 38.91Mbps.By contrast, the US was toward the bottom of the list at 13.98Mbps.To get its numbers, OpenSignal took 50 billion measurements from 3.8 million devices between July 1 and October 1.It found that LTE speeds average 16.6Mbps worldwide, with a "huge influx of new 4G users in developing countries" such as India boosting speeds in the lower half of its rankings.The report also noted that while growth in LTE speeds have slowed since its last report in June, access has increased, with carriers in developing country aimed at converting current 3G users to 4G.
PlayerUnknown talks PUBG ahead of December Xbox One release:::::"We don't really worry about numbers, just making a good game."That's something studio executives and game developers say a lot, but people rarely believe.It's also what Brendan Greene, better known as PlayerUnknown, says about his incredibly popular game, PlayerUnknown's Battleground.And I believe him.PUBG has you and 99 players parachute out of planes onto the weapon-littered land below.You then pick up said weaponry and fight to the death.There's a blue electric field you need to stay within, and it shrinks as the game goes on, meaning you're more likely to encounter someone hoping to kill you.You win by being the last player standing.The game congratulates you with a simple message: "WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!"The premise has piqued the interest of millions of players.The $30 game (AU$40, 22) has only been available on PCs through Steam since March, and has racked around 18 million players since.That's an astonishing feat, especially for a new game franchise.PUBG Corp.The even more bewildering thing?PUBG is still in beta.It's currently the most-played Steam game right now, and all of those folks are playing a buggy, unfinished product.It's evolving in front of their eyes -- soon new abilities to vault and climb will hit the game's test servers, for instance.PUBG is at the cross-section of two very lucrative industries.It's currently sold exclusively through Steam, and digital video game sales are this year expected to hit $100 billion, up from $61 billion in 2015.Separately, it's a big hit on streaming services like Twitch, at a time when the video game streaming business is predicted to grow 6 percent each year until 2021.The game, it was announced on Tuesday, will hit the Xbox One on Dec. 12.Talking to me at the PAX gaming festival, which just wrapped up in Melbourne, Australia, Greene seemed more curious about how a new, more casual player base would like the game, and less interested in how many people constituted that new player base."There's a large community out there that will not play early-access games.I'm looking forward to seeing if we'll get another rush of people," he said, sounding more analytical than excited."But really it's not about numbers for us."Part of that is because PUBG has already surpassed Greene's wildest expectations.The game's server architecture was designed for a million players to play concurrently, a number which itself was initially a pipe dream."No way are we reaching that," Greene remembers thinking.Now PUBG hovers around 2 million concurrent users.That's awesome, but keeping up with that demand is also a challenge for Greene's team.It's like a constant game of catch-up, he said.About 120 people work on PUBG, most of them in South Korea.Greene, a self-taught programmer and video game modder, founded the PUBG project at the South Korean Bluehole Studios last year.Now, though, he's no longer involved in the day-to-day development.He's calls himself face of PUBG, and the developers the heart and soul."[The team] have the vision," he said."Every now and again I'll have to go 'no, we're doing it this way,' but in general I just let them run with it."He cites the game's blue-circle development as one such time he intervened in the process."They're a little bit weary about tweaking things now because we have such a big player base," he explains, "but I know that we have to improve the way the blue circle works.We're gonna be testing new mechanics over the coming months to see if the community likes these things."The team is now focused on polishing the game, getting it out of beta and into version 1.0.While they do that, Greene travels the world, spreading the good word.I spoke with him days ago in Melbourne.As I write this, he's in France for Paris Games Week.Brendan Greene - @PLAYERUNKNOWN, creator of #PUBG has surprised us at #PAXAus2017!He's on stage at the Galah Theatre!!!pic.twitter.com/DzOBWTVPch PAX Australia (@PAXAus) October 27, 2017 Apart from the promotional duties, being behind 2017's biggest game hasn't been altogether life-changing."I maybe buy a bottle of wine that I like every now and then, but really my life hasn't changed all that much," he said."I'm not an extravagant chap."PUBG becoming a phenomenon has been a strange experience for Greene.He's previously said he's not as hardcore a gamer as most of the people who play the game, and now deflects some of the praise that comes his way."People are comparing me to [Minecraft creator] Notch, it's like what the fuck!I see myself as being very lucky in the industry not like guys like [Metal Gear Solid director] Hideo Kojima, who have slogged and worked hard to get their masterpieces out there."That said, Greene and his team are certainly in the midst of their own hard slog.The December Xbox One release of PUBG is near, but it's unlikely to be finished."Various Xbox One features and functionality will change and come online over time just like they have on PC," PUBG Corp. CEO Chang Han Kim said upon Tuesday's announcement.Greene sounds confident that a completed PUBG isn't far off, though."It's all about getting the game to 1.0 and beyond," he said."We're nearly there."Focus has shifted from adding new elements to the game to perfecting existing elements.No PlayStation release is planned as of yet, though he does hope at some point there can be some crossplay between PC and Xbox One players.But cross-platform play is far from the only post-1.0 idea Greene has considered.He liked DOTA 2's VR Hub, which made spectating a much more immersive and social experience for esports fans, and has considered that for PUBG, for instance.But if that comes to fruition, it won't be soon.Greene and his team aren't interested in rushing, and with their player numbers it's they really don't need to.He says they're thinking five and 10 years into the game's lifespan, about ways to continuously improve it.In other words, there are many chicken dinners yet to be served.Rebooting the Reef: CNET dives deep into how tech can help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you -- and the world around you -- smarter.
Sony brings back Aibo, teaches old dog new tricks:::::Sony is letting Aibo off the leash once again.The cutesy toy robot dog first appeared in 1999 before being, ahem, "sent to a farm" in 2006.Now a new model will launch in 2018 that reacts to voice commands and to being petted.It will also perform doggy tricks like barking, sitting, wagging its tail and playing with special toys.It'll connect to an app and has OLED eyes in its ravamped design.The connected canine will only be available in Japan and will cost around 198,000 yen ($1700, 1,300, AU$2250).
Ikea smart bulbs now light up with Apple HomeKit:::::Enlarge Image Tyler Lizenby/CNET Ikea's smart home system just got a bit smarter, adding support for Apple HomeKit.The Tradfri line of smart bulbs launched this summer without support for third-party standards, making it a bit basic in the opinion of our reviewer, compared to rivals such Philips Hue.But in a new update to the Tradfi app, it now integrates with HomeKit so you can control the bulbs using Apple's Home app.Ikea has yet to give a date for when the promised Google Home integration will happen.
DoorSense now works on August's Alexa skill:::::August Home announced today that DoorSense technology is now part of the August Smart Lock skill for Amazon's Alexa voice assistant.DoorSense tells users if their door is open or closed, in addition to whether it's locked or unlocked.We got to know DoorSense via the August app with the September release of the August Smart Lock and August Smart Lock Pro.It works much like a traditional door/window sensor with the lock itself acting as one of the two sensors.DoorSense proves especially useful as a safeguard against a door being left ajar with a deadbolt that hasn't engaged properly.Chris Monroe/CNET Now, DoorSense has been added to the August Alexa skill.Users will be able to ask Alexa if the door is locked and receive confirmation if the door is open or closed.You'll also be able to ask Alexa to ask August to lock or unlock a door, and Alexa will let you know if your DoorSense-calibrated door is open or closed.The unlock skill does require users to set a four- to 12-digit security code during the account linking process for heightened security.To use the August Smart Lock or August Smart Lock Pro with Alexa requires the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge or an August Doorbell Cam to connect the Bluetooth lock to Wi-Fi.For more information about August products and services, visit August's website.For a complete list of Alexa skills, see our list here.

Thor: Ragnarok and the Avengers: What comes next?:::::These days, the universe revolves around the Russo brothers.The Marvel Cinematic Universe, that is.By the end of 2019, Joe and Anthony Russo, brothers and self-described comic book fanboys, will have directed four Marvel movies: "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," "Captain America: Civil War," "Avengers: Infinity War," due out next year, and a second, still-untitled Avengers movie slated for 2019."Our day job is spoken for in the foreseeable future," Anthony says on a muggy July day at Pinewood Studios, just outside of Atlanta.If you have an aversion to blockbuster movies or major pop cultural events Marvel movies grossed more than $12 billion worldwide between 2008 and summer 2017 you might have caught the pair's work on the small screen with shows like "Arrested Development" and "Community."Now the Russo brothers are working on delivering what fans expect to be a culminating event that will change the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it and make way for what else more Marvel movies."Infinity War" will tie together elements from the entire MCU, including "Thor: Ragnorak," opening this week in US theaters.I went to Pinewood Atlanta Studios to talk to Joe and Anthony about what it's like to helm a full-fledged Avengers movie, explore virtual reality storytelling and get inspiration from '90s heist films.The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.Tyler Lizenby/CNET As filmmakers, what technology interests you?Joe: We're really obsessed with virtual reality right now.I think part of the reason why TV is in such a golden age is that, collectively, we've perfected story-telling in a half-hour format.Moving forward, storytelling and narrative needs to expand and it needs to be pulled in different ways.I've had emotional experiences in VR that I haven't been able to have in two-dimensional experiences.I think that's really the future of storytelling.I've got kids.I see the way they consume media now is very different from the way I did.What excites them is very different from what excited me.The more immersive the experience, the more hooked they are, and that's what they're looking for.So we're really digging into VR and trying to figure out how you tell stories in that format, what those kinds of stories can be and what the future of the technology looks like.What's the biggest difference between directing a Captain America movie and a full-blown Avengers movie?Anthony: On one level, it's the scope of the ensemble.While the Captain America movies we did were ensemble films, and Civil War had a lot of characters in it, they both fail in comparison to these two.Joe and I have always been drawn to ensemble storytelling.We like the idea of telling stories from multiple characters' points of view and thinking about the story from multiple characters' points of view.It's a way to develop very layered, thick storytelling.It's the kind of storytelling that, hopefully, you can keep revisiting because there are a lot of dimensions to discover on multiple viewings.We also look into the comics themselves for ideas.We may end up doing a different iteration, but a lot of the ideas are sourced from the comics.Anthony Russo Joe: You have all these characters coming from successful franchises where they have their own history, their own emotional history, and you put them all together in one film and with all the different tones and different styles.It's fascinating.We're like mad scientists in the writers' room, with [screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely], figuring out how to marry all those tones and all those characters together.It's a hell of an exercise.After working nearly a decade in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, how do you create a fight scene that feels fresh and compelling?Joe: [You] use your imagination to put yourself inside the characters and allow the scene to go forward in a way that seems very surprising to you.A lot of times we'll use locations to help us motivate ideas.We're constantly striving to bring something new and different to the table, either in the way that we're using the cameras, or the storytelling we're using in the scene, or the way that the characters are being motivated by the action.Anthony: That's really the best way to arrive at something original in an action sequence.You have to drive very hard at the character, figure out what's going on with the character, where and how the character is vulnerable and then start to build a scenario around that.Film Frame.. Marvel 2016 You've talked before about your love of subverting genre.Can we expect that in "Infinity War"?Anthony: With "Infinity War," the biggest new element to the movie is Thanos and the fact that he's entering the storytelling in a very bold, strong way, to the degree that he's almost one of the leads.We've shaped an interesting narrative around him that in some ways leans heavily on a heist film in the fact that he's going after the infinity stones in a much bolder, successful way than he has in the past.The entire movie has that energy of the bad guy being one step ahead of the heroes.We looked at a lot of movies that had that heist-style energy to them, [and] that brought some inspiration.I'm obsessed with VR, but AR is really interesting.Anything that ends with R has got our attention.Joe Russo Will there be any unexpected characters, and can you give us a hint?Joe: There's going to be a lot of unexpected characters.There are more surprises packed into this film than any of the others.Part of that is character interactions, new interesting characters, characters that have made small appearances that are really getting fleshed out in this film.A lot of people enjoy the experience, so I don't want to give anything away, but certainly you can expect lots of surprises.Your movies often show tech that hasn't been invented yet.Who's creating/imagining that tech?Joe: We have an amazing effects team led by Dan DeLeeuw, who's done the last three movies with us "Winter Soldier," "Civil War," "Infinity War" and also the next Avengers one.He is dialed into everything that's going on around the world in terms of cutting-edge tech, cutting-edge visual effects.On the camera side, we're always looking for the most advanced equipment we can use to tell our story in a way that's satisfying to audiences and satisfying to us creatively.Anthony: We also look into the comics themselves for ideas.We may end up doing a different iteration, but a lot of the ideas are sourced from the comics.You say you're obsessed with VR.Is there a VR project in the near future?Anthony: It's something we're certainly looking into and thinking about.Our day job is spoken for in the foreseeable future.But like Joe mentioned, we've always been motivated by technology in our processes as filmmakers.[We were] very early adopters of digital video "Arrested Development" was the first prime-time network show shot in digital video.We're always looking for ways to use technologies to open up new creative expressions for us artistically.So we're constantly thinking about where something like VR may lead us in storytelling, or what kind of tool that gives us as storytellers.Joe: I'm obsessed with VR, but AR [augmented reality] is really interesting.Anything that ends with R has got our attention.So, big question: iPhone or Android?Joe and Anthony: [cross talk] iPhone.How to watch every Marvel film in the perfect order: Start here to catch up on the MCU (there's still time) with *every* movie and show in the perfect viewing order.What Marvel needs to stay on top at the box office: We sat down with Marvel President Kevin Feige to discuss "Spider-Man: Homecoming," Phase Four and why diversity is top of mind for Marvel.
This website helps victims report hate crimes:::::Bilgin S. Sasmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Civil rights groups noticed a troubling spike in hate crimes in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.Among the worst: 61 headstones were pushed over at a Jewish cemetery in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in September of that year; a black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire in October; that same month, three men were arrested for plotting to bomb an apartment complex, home to Somali immigrants, in Garden City, Kansas.The frequency of hate-motivated attacks didn't end with the election of Donald Trump, whose campaign attracted support from the "alt right," a loose collection of white nationalists and white supremacists.Since the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center and ProPublica tallied 1,372 hate and bias incidents in the US.Those numbers caught the attention of CuroLegal, a Portland, Maine, business that builds legal software.The company held a design event at Boston's Suffolk University Law School, and the CuroLegal team created Hate Crime Help, an online tool to assist people who have experienced a hate-motivated incident.Hate Crime Help is simple to use.It asks you to answer four questions, three of which can be chosen from a prepopulated list.The fill-in-the-blank form prompts you to specify whether you've experienced verbal hate, harassment, property damage or violence.It asks where the incident occurred -- at work, home, online or wherever -- and it asks for a ZIP code, along with the reason you think the incident happened, such as because of your sexual orientation or religion.Enlarge Image Hate Crime Help CuroLegal's emphasis on ease of use is deliberate.Targets of hate incidents are often scared and anxious.A complex form would only compound a situation complicated by the fact that hate crimes and bias incidents are defined differently under the law.The distinction between them might escape many people."We wanted to give people the basics about what a hate crime is, how that differs from bias incidents and have them understand what their state law says about hate crimes," said Nicole Bradick, CuroLegal's owner and chief strategy officer.Before CuroLegal, Bradick was a litigator who had done civil rights work.After the form is filled out, Hate Crime Help directs users toward resources like a local police station or relevant organization, along with context about what to expect from those organizations.There's also a section called "Know Your Rights," which explains the difference between a hate crime and a bias incident, as well as federal and state laws.Hate crimes involve actual criminal activity like the destruction of property, assault and murder.Bias incidents don't.If someone yells a racial slur at you on the street, it's unpleasant and scary, but legal under the First Amendment.If that person spray-paints that slur on your house, it's a crime.Hate Crime Help might address another problem with hate incident data.Authorities say no full numbers for hate incidents exist in the US because they're underreported.Victims avoid authorities out of distrust, fear of retribution or, in some cases, concerns about their legal status.The difficulty collecting data is evident in official statistics.The FBI estimates roughly 6,000 hate crimes are reported in the US every year, while a different Department of Justice report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, derived from the National Crime Victimization Survey, puts that number at around 250,000 each year.The discrepancy stems from the fact that the FBI gets its number from local law enforcement agencies, while the survey bypasses the challenges of hate crimes getting reported to local police, accurately categorized as hate crimes, and then reported to the FBI.The information gap creates another problem.If authorities can't agree on the number and severity of hate incidents, it's hard for them to make a case those incidents should be taken as seriously as things like robbery or aggravated assault."We are frankly doing a horrific job of just getting basic data about the level of hate crime in the United States," said Heidi Beirich, who heads the SPLC's Intelligence Project."The lack of statistics directly undermines the ability to contend with the very serious problem in our society."Beirich also said that efforts like Hate Crime Help could help underscore the reporting problem and put pressure on federal authorities to fix the situation.To complicate things, laws differ from state to state.Some states like Georgia, South Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana and Wyoming don't have hate crime laws.There are also federal hate crime laws.Bradick said it can be daunting to figure out where you might fit into all of that.With those post-election hate crime numbers ticking up, CuroLegal spent about three months working on Hate Crime Help.While it built everything in-house, it held that Boston event to consult with groups like the Anti-Defamation League, GLAD, the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations (CAIR) and the Massachusetts Attorney General's office.While CuroLegal worked on this pro bono, networking hardware company Cisco paid the costs."We're all about how to use technology to create opportunities for people to better their lives," said Cisco senior vice president and general counsel Mark Chandler in a statement."We saw there was difficulty in people figuring out what hate crimes are, whether they've been victimized and where to get help."CuroLegal's team, plus two law students recommended by the American Bar Association Center for Innovation, had to bring together a variety of data sources, including a Google API for local law enforcement data -- and also create protections in case trolls wanted to target the site, Bradick said."We're working under the assumption here that if people know more what's going to happen, they're more likely to take that action and advocate for themselves," Bradick said, and perhaps they won't get bounced around from agency to agency and eventually quit in frustration.CuroLegal sees Hate Crime Help as a first iteration and is looking for funding to improve the site."We see this as just the beginning of this project," Bradick said.iHate: CNET looks at how intolerance is taking over the internet.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things

People would rather shop with friends than Alexa, for now:::::Tyler Lizenby/CNET When asked in a new survey whether people would rather go to the mall with friends or just shop at home with a voice assistant like Amazon's Alexa, a third of people actually opted for the robot.Maybe that's a sign of a drab future when we all become shut-ins and stores cease to exist, but that situation doesn't seem to be coming just yet.All those Alexa boosters notwithstanding, the survey on US consumer shopping behavior, published Wednesday by the software company IFTTT, found that most people don't use many new retail technologies and, in some cases, don't even know what they are.Which of the below have you utilized while shopping online or in-store?(multi-answer) One-touch checkout online - 39.76% Product recommendations from a website - 39.12% Buy buttons on product images via social media - 9.78% Mobile wallet (i.e.Apple Pay) - 13.80% Voice assistant shopping lists (Alexa or Siri) - 4.75% Self-service kiosks that dispense purchases (i.e.vending machines) - 17.09% Self-checkout at stores - 79.25% So, at least for this holiday shopping season, it seems people will be far more likely to browse and buy using mainstream channels -- like malls, desktop and mobile -- and avoid some of the newer shopping tech, like voice assistants, mobile wallets and buy buttons on social networks.Even though 36 percent of respondents said they'd rather shop with Alexa or Apple's Siri than a human, only 5 percent of the 1,033 people surveyed actually have.Just 14 percent said they used mobile wallets like Apple Pay, and 10 percent said they used buy buttons.A survey from consultancy Deloitte from last week also found weak interest for mobile wallet.Folks were also asked: "Have you ever used a retail chatbot?"Those are automated bots that respond to people's questions online, such as Domino's helping folks order a pizza on Facebook Messenger.Sixty-eight percent said they don't use these bots and 23 percent said they didn't know what a chatbot even was.This survey could offer a message for tech-heavy retailers that they still need to educate consumers on why they should use these newer technologies.Amazon, for instance, has been working on building up voice shopping, but so far it seems few are onboard.The company has continually added new features to improve voice shopping, such as a "tell me more" feature to get Alexa to provide more details about a product, and new AmazonFresh groceries ordering.For traditional retailers, who've struggled to adapt to the growth in e-commerce, the survey shows that they still need to figure out what tech is compelling to shoppers to entice them to visit their stores."There is no one big thing," Anne Mercogliano, IFTTT's vice president of business operations and marketing, said."It's not going to be chatbots or voice that are going to solve everything.People are going to want a variety of things."That may mean people in the future will be shopping in virtual reality and using chatbots and voice shopping, depending on what they are looking for.But for now, consumers don't seem interested in the more futuristic stuff.For instance, when asked if they'd trust a robot to do their shopping for them, 82 percent of people said no.Would you trust a robot to do your shopping for you?Yes - 17.09% No - 82.91% The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.'Alexa, be more human': Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.
How VR and 360 video helps Doctors Without Borders tell the story of refugees:::::Doctors Without Borders/Julia Vandenoever When you first enter Doctors Without Borders' "Forced From Home" interactive exhibit, you're assigned a country of origin and a status.I was an internally displaced person from Burundi.But I could've been a refugee or migrant from South Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan or Honduras.The idea of the exhibit is to put onlookers in the shoes of displaced people who've been forced to flee violence.It's designed to simulate the travels of a refugee and comes with virtual reality films, a 360-degree movie dome and interactive tour.Doctors Without Borders, an organization that provides medical care and humanitarian aid in more than 70 countries, put together the traveling exhibit to show the 65.6 million people worldwide who are now displaced.When these people leave home, they often face death, sickness, abandonment, persecution and loss of family.Doctors Without Borders/Elias Williams "Our medical staff treat people uprooted by conflict and extreme violence all over the world," said Jason Cone, executive director of Doctors Without Borders USA."'Forced From Home' is an opportunity to bring our patients' stories to US audiences, to humanize the refugee crisis."After I received my identity card telling me I was from Burundi, I was shown into a garage-size white dome.Inside, a 360-degree video was projected onto the walls.It started with footage of lifeboats out to sea near Greece and told the stories of Syrian refugees looking for a place to land.The short movie went on to show the lives of refugees living in Tanzania, Lebanon and Mexico.It ended in a refugee camp in South Sudan populated with tents as far as the eye could see.Here, some people have lived without adequate food or housing for years.Doctors Without Borders/Julia Vandenoever My tour guide was Donna Canali, who has been a field nurse and medical team leader on 12 assignments around the world with Doctors Without Borders.She's seen firsthand what displaced people's lives are like."What I would most like people to get out of this is empathy," she said."They're not so different from us."Canali guided my group through several booths, each one designed to focus on certain themes.For example, one booth gives us 30 seconds to gather placards that show what we'd bring if we were forced to flee.We could bring money, a passport, water, a wheelchair, pets or medicine.But at the end, we're told to get rid of something because we won't be able to carry it all.Another booth shows the basic needs people have in refugee camps.Along with food, water, latrines and clothes, there are also solar panels used for charging cell phones.Canali explains that phones help displaced people correspond with their families back home."One of the most important things is communication," Canali said.The tour ends in a virtual reality booth set up with a dozen stools.I'm given a headset and earphones and can choose what refugee location to visit: Mexico, South Sudan, Lebanon, Iraq or Tanzania.Now I can see what it's actually like to be from Burundi and live in a Tanzanian camp that's forested, muddy and dotted with beige canvas tents."Once you're in that world, there's no distraction," said Melissa Pracht, who produced the videos for Doctors Without Borders."It's as close as you can get to putting people in a real refugee camp," "Forced from Home" is free and currently in Oakland, California, through November 5.It will then be in Santa Monica, California, from November 13 to 19.Road Trip 2016: Reporters' dispatches from the field on tech's role in the global refugee crisis.Road Trip 2015: CNET hunts for innovation outside the Silicon Valley bubble.

Microsoft presenter downloads Chrome after Edge fails:::::Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET At what point does corporate loyalty break and honesty take over?I'm moved to finding the answer after viewing (a small portion of) a Microsoft presentation called "Datacenter Transformation.Migrating Apps, Workloads and Data to Azure."It was given last month by Michael Leworthy, a member of the Azure migration team.On Tuesday, however, a magical part of it came to light, courtesy of Softpedia.The exciting part, you see -- for many, at least -- is that 36 minutes and 40 seconds into the presentation, Leworthy suffered a painful mishap.There he was offering an insight into virtual machines, with the help of Microsoft's latest Windows 10 browser, Edge.He was skating along and suddenly caught an Edge.The company browser froze.What do you do?Try and reboot, reload and relay the message that this had never happened before?Or curse the Edge team for producing a substandard browser?Rather poetically, Leworthy -- whose presentation was 73 minutes long -- didn't bother to wait for Edge to right itself.Instead, he almost immediately offered these slightly caustic words: "I love it when demos break."He paused but a few seconds before uttering this heresy: "I'm going to install Chrome."It was as if this was a familiar occurrence in his world.Yes, he giggled.Yes, a number of his audience giggled with him (and applauded).It surely wasn't, though, the browser's finest hour.Indeed, when Chrome began to download, it offered this painfully appropriate message: "Browse fast."As it loaded, Leworthy declared: "And we're not going to make Google better," as he refused to check the box that sends statistics and crash reports back to Google.Neither Microsoft nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.Though some might Leworthy's dilemma chuckleworthy, he surely has to be admired for not mindlessly towing the corporate barge.The browser didn't work.He knew something that would.So he downloaded the something that would.And that did.It's a reflection, perhaps, of the new attitude instilled by CEO Satya Nadella.He's shown himself to be far more open to accepting the existence of rival companies than was his predecessor, Steve Ballmer.He's even been seen with an iPhone in his hands and handling it with aplomb.You can either decide you'll only use Microsoft products -- which, for example, Bill Gates and Melinda Gates insisted their family did -- or you can accept that your product might still need work and move right along.Who cannot admire Leworthy when he added: "The Edge on these machines is locked down a little bit, there are some things that just don't work"?My colleague Tom McNamara offered Edge a very good rating in his review.Still, one wonders whether Leworthy had perhaps practiced his presentation before his snafu.Even if it's your own company's product -- especially if it's your own company's product -- make sure it works.Otherwise, there might be laughter.
Chevrolet goes for off-road glory with the Colorado ZR2 Race Development truck:::::So you bought yourself a new Chevrolet Colorado ZR2, and now you want to make it your own.Never fear, fellow off-roaders, Chevy will soon have the parts for you.The company is currently testing a whole slew of goodies on a special ZR2 Race Development truck, and even if only half of them make it to market, we'll have a pretty awesome ZR2, indeed.5:04 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF When it comes to desert running, the most important modifications you can make are to the suspension.This Race Development truck sports a specially tuned version of Chevy's Multimatic DSSV shocks and a long-travel rear leaf suspension.Jounce shocks, a kind of secondary absorber that adds damping and makes for an even more controlled rebound, are featured in the front and rear along with high-angle upper ball joints and tie rods.While the overall improvement in travel isn't yet set in stone, a Chevrolet engineer told me that a 20 percent increase is not out of the question.But wait, there's more!A 1.5-inch body lift makes room for larger and more aggressive Goodyear Wrangler tires, and there are more skid plates than you can shake a stick at.The front plate from the stock ZR2 is lengthened and is joined by skid plates on the rear differential and the rear shock mounting points.This last bit is especially important, as those babies sit a bit low on the stock ZR2.And if all that weren't enough, an off-road air intake and performance exhaust add just a touch more horsepower to the 3.6-liter V6 engine.Chevrolet had me ride shotgun in a stock ZR2 and Chad Hall's race ZR2, which is currently wearing all this awesomeness as it competes in the Best in the Desert racing series.While the stock truck handled the loose and slightly bumpy power line road at 40 miles per hour or so, the race ZR2 was able to eke out a bit more speed, all while feeling more controlled and much, much smoother.No word on when these parts will come to market or what they will cost.Truck folks are notorious for personalizing their rigs with aftermarket parts and accessories, so it would benefit Chevrolet to hustle this development program to fruition.
Portraits shot with the iPhone X:::::Up Next 24 things you should never, ever go...
iPhone X: You have questions, we have answers:::::I was fortunate enough to receive a review sample of the iPhone X on Monday, and I've been putting it through its paces ever since.Just minutes after posting my initial impressions, I asked what you wanted to know: So now: Id love questions from you.Anything youre curious about on the #iphonex, ask away.Ill be working to answer questions over time Scott Stein (@jetscott) October 31, 2017 And not surprisingly, I got plenty of questions.Here are some of the notable ones, along with my responses.How durable is the glass?Better than iPhone 8?Or similar?Ming Mu (@Rich_Cub) October 31, 2017 We haven't done drop tests yet -- we're hoping to do that as soon as Friday.But Apple is making similar claims, as far as we can tell, about the iPhone X glass versus the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.We tried dropping those at CNET: the front glass shattered at about 5 feet.TL;DR: Buy a case, as always.As someone coming from samsung world looking for a change, is this a better buy than iphone 8 or pixel 2 xl?Kizito Katawonga (@katawonga) October 31, 2017 The iPhone 8 has greater value as a pure performance-and-camera-quality phone, in my opinion.But it'll feel a step behind the premium design of the iPhone X.In my opinion, the X beats the Pixel 2 XL -- the iPhone X OLED display is just far and away better than the P-OLED one on the 2 XL.But I would note the best iPhone X competitor is really the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.Nice review.I do theatre.If I have latex, monster makeup, etc, can I unlock without face ID or out of luck backstage?#iPhoneX William Le Sante (@WillyLeSante) October 31, 2017 Good question!I didn't have luck with Face ID and costumes.But yes, regular passcodes are always a backup option instead of Face ID.Or, you could try retraining Face ID to work with your costume and see what happens -- but then it might not work when you're prosthetic-free.how is the keyboard?does it start at the bottom or is it moved up a little?Eric Leino (@ericleino) October 31, 2017 The positioning is similar: The keys are similar in size to the iPhone 8's, but the keyboard is moved up off the bottom to match the level of the 8 and 8 Plus.Two changes: The emoji and dictation buttons now live below the keyboard on the left and right.Is there a options in the setting so that when the phone unlocks it automatically opens instead of waiting for the swipe up?Scott Wilding (@wildingcrusader) October 31, 2017 No.You need to swipe up after face unlocking, which is annoying if you're dreaming of a fully hands-free iPhone X.@jetscott can set more than one face in Face ID?The same way you can set more than one finger with Touch ID.cc @johnhmeyer Juan B (@MaxP82) October 31, 2017 Nope.That trick some people use of scanning in their partner's thumb as "finger No.2" won't work.Just one face per phone, at least for now.I'll be adding more questions and answers in the days ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the iPhone X.Check back here soon, and follow my live tweets as I continue to document my experience with the phone.iPhone X review: Face ID, the big OLED screen and life with no home button.We're collecting all we learn about the iPhone X its first week right here.iPhone X selfie camera makes it all about you: We spent 10 hours testing the front-facing camera in Apple's $1,000 phone.The selfie will never be the same.
Facebook, Twitter, Google commit to fighting Russian meddling:::::Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Facebook, Google and Twitter are on the hot seat.Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch; Sean Edgett, Twitter's top lawyer; and Richard Salgado, Google's director of law enforcement and information security, appeared at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Tuesday to discuss how Russia used these companies to influence the 2016 presidential election through disinformation and fake news.The two-and-a-half hour session, which at times grew animated with senators appearing frustrated with some of the answers, was the first of three hearings.On Wednesday, the three executives will testify before the House and the Senate Intelligence committees in separate sessions.(Follow CBS News' live blog of the testimony here.)Congress is looking to hold Silicon Valley accountable for influence Russia was able to wield using their respective platforms.Facebook said in its opening statement that 126 million people -- a third of the nation -- viewed Russian-backed content.Twitter, meanwhile, confirmed there were more than 2,700 Twitter accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, a Russian-backed troll farm.Altogether, those trolls have spread propaganda and fake news that's garnered more than 414 million impressions on Facebook and Twitter."We had a foreign government apparently buying thousands of dollars of advertising to create discontent and discord," Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said as he opened the subcommittee hearing Tuesday.The hearings are the latest twist in the high-profile investigation into Russia's influence over the US election.At issue is how much the Russian government may have attempted to influence the electorate and whether President Donald Trump or anyone working for him was knowingly involved.Trump has repeatedly denied involvement.Disinformation has long been a part of Russia's foreign policy strategy, and social media has allowed the trolling effort to expand on a viral scale.US intelligence has warned Congress that these campaigns will continue in future elections.Concern over fake news on social media was also heightened in Europe, as the UK, France and Germany all had national elections this year.The Russian trolling campaigns aimed at the US involved people posing as advocates on hot-button issues, like Black Lives Matter protesters, gun rights groups and LGBT issues.The most popular Russian-backed account was @TEN_GOP, which amassed more than 100,000 followers while claiming to represent the Tennessee Republican party.Google said Russian trolls "uploaded over a thousand videos to YouTube on 18 different channels."It's worse than we thought Facebook previously acknowledged that Russians spent more than $100,000 on 3,000 ads that reached 10 million users.But in written testimony submitted to the committee, Stretch acknowledged that paid advertisements represented only a small fraction of the posts instigated by Russian operatives.He said that between 2015 and 2017, a single Russian operation in St. Petersburg generated about 80,000 posts that were seen by roughly 29 million people.Because those posts were liked, shared and commented on by Facebook users, the company estimates that roughly 126 million people could have seen the posts, which were disguised as American political commentary.Similarly, Twitter's Edgett said the company identified 36,746 accounts that between Sept. 1 and Nov. 15, 2016, generated approximately 1.4 million automated, election-related tweets, which collectively received approximately 288 million impressions or views.But Stretch and Edgett tried to downplay the impact of this activity on their platforms.Stretch said the content shared through Facebook was a tiny fraction of what users see every day in their Facebook news feeds.Edgett made the same argument."We determined that the number of accounts we could link to Russia and that were tweeting election-related content was small in comparison to the total number of accounts on our platform during the relevant time period," he said in his testimony."Similarly, the volume of automated, election-related tweets that originated from those accounts was small in comparison to the overall volume of election-related activity on our platform, with significantly fewer impressions as compared to a typical election-related tweet."In the fight Still, the companies, which initially dismissed the importance of fake news spreading unchecked, said they're committed to ensuring this type of activity is stopped."When it comes to the 2016 election, I want to be clear: The foreign interference we saw is reprehensible and outrageous and opened a new battleground for our company, our industry and our society," Stretch said."That foreign actors, hiding behind fake accounts, abused our platform and other internet services to try to sow division and discord -- and to try to undermine our election process -- is an assault on democracy, and it violates all of our values."Twitter said that in 2016 following the election, it launched the Information Quality initiative to improve its system for detecting bad automation.It also improves machine learning to spot spam, and increases the precision of tools designed to prevent such content from spreading on its platform, it said.The company said that since the 2016 election, it has made significant improvements to reduce external attempts to manipulate content visibility.But lawmakers have said the companies need to do more.Earlier this month, Sens.Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, and Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would require social networks to meet the same standards that political ads on TV and radio must meet.Now Playing: Watch this: Social media giants testify before Senate Judiciary Fearing unwanted regulation, Facebook and Twitter pre-emptively adopted new policies days before the hearings this week.Facebook promised more transparency for its political ads.Twitter announced it's blocking ads from Russia-sponsored news sites Russia Today and Sputnik.Whether the companies can stave off regulation will depend in large part on their performance this week before lawmakers.Earlier this month at a press conference at the US Capitol, senators slammed the three companies for not taking the threats seriously."Frankly, their initial reaction to Russian involvement has been a bit embarrassing," Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a Q&A with CNET on Friday."They underestimated how serious the problem was."During the hearing Klobuchar asked the executives if they'd support the Honest Ads legislation she and Warner have introduced.Facebook's Stretch said the company is "not waiting for legislation" and is already taking action.Google's Salgado said the company supports the goals of the legislation and the company is willing to work with lawmakers to work through the nuances to get out the kinks of the legislation.But when pressed by Klobuchar, Twitter's Edgett admitted that without regulation there would be no enforcer to make sure they are complying with their policies and promises.Franken pounces Sen. Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, pounded Facebook's Stretch, who took much of the brunt of the grilling from lawmakers during the hearing, on why the company didn't make the connection earlier that some of the ads were being paid for in Russian rubles."You can't put together rubles with a political ad and say, 'Hmm, those two data points spell something bad?'"he asked."In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens," Stretch responded."There were signals we missed."Franken admonished Stretch and told him his goal was to help the company think through "this stuff a little better."In a second round of questioning, Edgett said it would commit to not taking foreign money for political ads (something Stretch didn't confirm).Salgado said Google would consider it if it made sense.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, questioned the companies' ability to distinguish foreign-sponsored political propaganda from free speech from American citizens.Cruz said that while some of his colleagues praised the companies for the actions they are now taking to curb Russian interference online, he noted he had "troublesome concerns" that these companies would use this power to censor content to fit their employees' political beliefs."This is troubling to anyone who cares about a robust First Amendment," he said.First published Oct. 31, 12:25 p.m. PT.Update, 2 p.m. PT: This story has been updated with additional comments from senators and executives at the US Senate subcommittee hearing.iHate: CNET looks at how intolerance is taking over the internet.Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.
Razer Phone for gamers possibly leaked online:::::Razer is rumored to be working on its own phone, and now we may have an idea of what it'll bring to the table.Rumors of the phone started after a report claimed that the gaming hardware company went public to help fund the device.Razer also acquired Nextbit, makers of the Nextbit Robin phone, which adds more evidence to the Razer phone case.As the company's most known for gaming laptops, folks assumed that Razer's phone would be built for gamers, but what does that mean?A now-deleted listing for the Razer phone on online retailer 3G UK may give us a clue.The image in the listing is pretty low-quality -- it sort of resembles the Nextbit Robin -- but the alleged specs are nothing to scoff at.They include: 5.72-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate Dual front-facing Dolby speakers 12-megapixel and 13-megapixel dual-cameras 4,000mAh battery with quick charge 8GB of RAM 64GB of storage If these specs are in fact true, the Razer phone could have a sharp display with a superfast refresh rate, tons of RAM to support mobile games, solid battery life and specialized speakers.This could also help the phone run AR and VR games if supported.There's no official word yet on Razer's phone, but the company has plans to unveil something big on Nov. 1.If you look closely at the event poster, you see the faint outline of what could be a phone.Does the idea of a phone for gamers rev you up?It would be interesting to see Razer's approach in a landscape where serious gamers have had to make do with mass-market phones.Razer did not respond to a request for comment.[Via Android Police]
A closer look at the first 'alien' asteroid to pay us a visit:::::NASA/JPL-CalTech It's really rare that we get any visitors from outside the solar system.In fact, astronomers believe they only spotted one for the first time earlier this month when an object that's probably an asteroid whipped by us.The previously unknown space rock, currently designated A/2017 U1, dropped into our solar system from above the flattish ecliptic plane where most planets, asteroids and comets native to our system rotate around the sun.It then slingshotted around our star and back out to deep space, but not before scientists got a better look at the visitor.A/2017 U1 is an unidentified interstellar object passing through the Solar System.It was discovered on October 19, 2017. pic.twitter.com/FTTJpfruTo Antonio Paris (@AntonioParis) October 30, 2017 By looking at the asteroid's trajectory, scientists have determined that A/2017 U1 likely came from the direction of the star Vega and the constellation Lyra.It began a close approach to the sun in September, then swung around the star and passed within 15 million miles of Earth on Oct. 14.Problem is, it wasn't spotted until Oct. 18, when it was already heading away from us.Still, telescopes and astronomers swung into action to observe the retreating visitor.The Liverpool Telescope in the Canary Islands managed to capture this cool sequence last week of the vagabond minor planet: Liverpool John Moores University The alien asteroid is interesting not just because of its potentially interstellar origin, but also because of its speed -- it was seen rocketing by us at 15.8 miles (25.5 kilometers) per second.It also turns out to be a little more colorful than the drab gray rocks we tend to picture when we think of asteroids.In fact, NASA astronomer Joseph Masiero says A/2017 U1 is actually red.The data that scientists were able to grab isn't great and the margin for error is significant, but Masiero wrote up his findings in a brief paper (PDF) showing that the asteroid looks to be largely featureless and red like many objects from the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune.It may be hard to get much more data on the itinerant asteroid that paid us such a brief but significant visit.Still, it seems worthy of a better name than just A/2017 U1.I suggest "Red Rama" after its apparent hue and the series of Arthur C. Clarke "Rama" novels that pretty accurately described its journey.(Disclosure: This is not a completely original suggestion.See below.)Perhaps @IAU_org should name A/2017 U1 "Rama" - Sir Arthur C.

How to install and use Tripwire to detect modified files on Ubuntu Server:::::Data security is of the utmost importance in your data center.To that end, you may have deployed Linux servers.It makes sense.Linux offers an unrivaled combination of security and flexibility.It is that flexibility which makes Linux so ideal for your data center.However, as with any platform, the out-of-the-box experience might not be up to your standards.Fortunately, there are plenty of tools available that can beef up the security of your server.One such tool is Tripwire, a security and data integrity tool that is used for the monitoring and alerting of specific file changes.Tripwire is available as an enterprise and an open source solution.The biggest difference between the two is that the enterprise solution is available for Linux, Solaris, AIX, and Windows (whereas the open source solution is only available for Linux).There is, of course, also commercial support available for the enterprise edition.I'm going to demonstrate how to install and configure the open source version of Tripwire on the Ubuntu Server 16.04 platform, such that it will monitor for modified files and alert you of any changes.SEE: Securing Linux policy (Tech Pro Research) Installation Tripwire can be found within the standard repositories, so installation is as simple as issuing the command: sudo apt install tripwire During the installation, you will be presented with a number of ncurses-based windows (Figure A), that require you to: Configure Postfix for SMTP configuration (you can choose between No configuration, Internet Site, Internet with smarthost, Satellite system, Local only).Configure the mail system name (leave the default) Create both site and local authentication keys Rebuild the Tripwire Configuration and Policy (choose Yes for both) Enter both the site- and local-key passphrases Figure A Configuration Next we begin the configuration process.To start this, initialize the database with the command sudo tripwire init.You will immediately be prompted for your sudo password and then the local passphrase (created during installation).The initialization process will proceed, only to error out with "No such file or directory" (Figure B).Figure B To get around this error, the Tripwire configuration file must be edited.However, before we do this, we need to first find out what directories are missing.To do that, issue the command: sudo sh -c "tripwire --check | grep Filename > missing-directory.txt" There will now be a text file, called missing-directory.txt, that you can refer to.Open the Tripwire configuration file (in your text editor of choice) and prepare to make a number of changes.The configuration file in question is /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt.The first section to edit is found under rulename = "Boot Scripts".Comment out the line /etc/rc.boot by placing an # character at the beginning of the line (Figure C).Figure C Next scroll down to rulename = "System boot changes" and comment out the following lines: /var/lock /var/run Scroll down to rulename = "Root config files" and comment out everything but: /root /root/.bashrc Scroll down to rulename = "Device & Kernel information" and comment out: /proc Save and close the file.Regenerate the encrypted policy file with the command: sudo twadmin -m P /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt You will be prompted for your site-key passphrase.Once you authenticate that passphrase, the policy file will regenerate.You then must reinitialize the Tripwire database with the command: sudo tripwire --init You will be prompted for your local-site passphrase.Once you've authenticated that passphrase, the database will be initialized, without error.SEE: Defending against cyberwar: How the cybersecurity elite are working to prevent a digital apocalypse (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Testing integrity Let's run a test with our newly installed Tripwire system.Issue the command sudo tripwire check.Once the command completes, you should see No Errors reported (Figure D).Figure D Let's test this further.Add a sample file with the command sudo touch /bin/test.sh and then rerun the check with the command sudo tripwire check.You should now see two violations (our added file and a modification to the /bin directoryFigure E).Figure E Create a new rule Let's say you use this server for web hosting and you want to create a tripwire rule to monitor the /var/www/ directory for any violations.To do this, open up the /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt file for editing and add the following: # Rules for web hosting ( rulename = "Web Hosting Ruleset", severity = $(SIG_HI) ) { /var/www -> $(SEC_CRIT); } Save and close the file.Regenerate the Tripwire config file with the command: sudo twadmin -m P /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt Reinitialize the Tripwire database with the command: sudo tripwire --init Let's test the new rule by adding a test file in /var/www with the command sudo touch /var/www/test.Rerun the check and your test file should be flagged.Email notifications Naturally, you don't want to have to manually run Tripwire.That's where cron and notifications come into play.What we want to do is first test to make sure email can be sent from the system.Issue the command: tripwire --test --email EMAIL@ADDRESS Where EMAIL@ADDRESS is an email address you have access to.Once you receive the email, open up the Tripwire configuration file in your editor of choice and add the following line to any rule you want to monitor via email: emailto = EMAIL@ADDRESS Where EMAIL@ADDRESS is the actual email address.So, for example, our Web Hosting rule would look like: # Rules for web hosting ( rulename = "Web Hosting Ruleset", severity = $(SIG_HI), emailto = EMAIL@ADDRESS ) { /var/www -> $(SEC_CRIT); } Of course, since we've altered the configuration file, we have to regenerate the configuration and reinitialize the database with the commands: sudo twadmin -m P /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt sudo tripwire --init At this point, you can now manually run a Tripwire check and have the results mailed to you, with the command: sudo tripwire --check --email-report Cron It's time to automate the system, with the help of cron.Open up your root user crontab for editing with the command sudo crontab -e -u root.At the bottom of the file, add the following: 0 0 * * * tripwire --check --email-report Save and close the file.Restart cron with the command sudo systemctl restart cron.That's it.Tripwire will now perform a daily check on your system and email you the results.Rest assured With Tripwire monitoring your Linux server, you can rest assured you will be notified should a change be made to the system.If an alert was a planned change, you can ignore it.If, however, you did nothing to the system and still receive an alert, it's time to start plowing through log files to see what happened.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Data Center Trends for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
Android Fast Pair streamlines process for pairing Bluetooth devices to your smartphone:::::A new feature called Fast Pair speeds up the Bluetooth pairing process for Android devices, Google announced in a Tuesday Android Developers blog post.For starters, Fast Pair will work with the Google Pixel Buds and Libratone's Q Adapt On-Ear, but it will eventually come to other products.Fast Pair uses a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and standard Bluetooth to accomplish its accelerated pairing, the post said.BLE handles the advertising and discovery side of things, while traditional Bluetooth performs the pairing.It will work with Android devices running Google Play services 11.7 and later, and will be backwards compatible with Android 6.0 Marshmallow.When two compatible Fast Pair-enabled devices are turned on and in pairing mode, Android will begin scanning for BLE broadcasts near the phone.It is at this point that it should discover a Fast Pair packet, as long as Bluetooth is enabled and location services are turned on.That packet is sent back to Google's servers to provide an image of the product, its name, and any potential companion apps that are available, the post said.SEE: Mobile device computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) A notification will then pop up on the user's device with the product name and an image of it, asking the user to pair it to the device.Once the user taps on the "Tap to pair" icon, classic Bluetooth will begin establishing a connection.Once the connection is established, a success notification will pop up for the user.This notification will also provide a link to download a companion app if one is available, the post said."Users get a seamless and secure pairing experience and confidence that they're connecting to the right product.Manufacturers get their brand, device name and companion app in front of the users," the post said.Fast Pair seems to echo what Apple is trying to accomplish with its AirPods wireless earbuds.While Apple relies on proprietary protocols to establish a connection, the end goal of both features is the same: Simplify the process for connecting wireless accessories to the smartphone.As smartphones continue to take the place of our desktops and TVs, enabling the use of quality wireless accessories will be paramount for top manufacturers.If Apple and Google want their phones to be the go-to device for their customer, they must provide quick and easy connections to complementary products that enhance the user experience.For Bluetooth device manufacturers, Android's Fast Pair offers better brand recognition and an easier tie-in to proprietary apps as well.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Android Fast Pair uses Bluetooth Low Energy and standard Bluetooth to make device pairing faster, and provide more information about Bluetooth accessories.Fast Pair will work with Google Play services 11.7 and later, and will be backwards compatible with Android 6.0 Marshmallow.Android Fast Pair and Apple's AirPods both streamline the pairing process, which will be critical as smartphones become a more central device for users.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Google Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How to use Android Oreo's new Storage Manager feature to free up space:::::Image: Google Android Oreo arrived with much, well-deserved, ballyhoo.It is, after all, one of the the most polished and efficient iterations of the platform.However, of all the new features to come along with the latest release, there's one that hasn't received nearly the attention it deserves.That feature has a name: Storage Manager.However, most have discussed the automated aspect of the new addition to Android, foregoing the manual option.That manual option comes by way of a single button.Said button happily proclaims "Free up Space".What does the feature do?Exactly as it says.With the help of this new feature, users can quickly (and easily) free up much-needed space on Android devices.Of course, the feature doesn't just randomly delete anything and everything.What the Free Up Space button does is give you the means to easily delete files from Downloads and calculates what installed apps you most infrequently use, and then presents them for uninstall.This one-two punch can go a long way to help ensure your Android device has enough storage to function.Naturally, to make use of this feature, you have to be willing to actually delete things.With that said, let's see how easy this feature is to use.SEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research) Installation As you probably have figured out, there is no installation to be had for the Free Up Space feature.Your device, however, must be running Android 8 (Oreo).Any lesser release and you won't find the feature.If you do happen to have a smartphone or tablet running Oreo, you may proceed.Usage Open up the Settings app on your device and then tap Storage & memory.In that new window, you will see the FREE UP SPACE button (Figure A).Figure A Tap that button and wait for the app to calculate the available files and apps that can be deleted.When the calculation is complete, you will be presented with everything that can be deleted.By default, all files will be selected for deletion (Figure B), whereas infrequently used apps must be selected.Go through that list and uncheck anything you do not want to delete.Figure B Depending on how much you have in the Downloads section, going through this could be a chore.There is a way to uncheck all downloads in one fell swoop.What you have to do is tap the Downloads category such that the individual files are no longer listed (and you only see the categoryFigure C).Figure C Once the individual files are neatly tucked into the category, tap the checkbox to de-select all.You can then re-expand the listing and go through to check only those you want to delete.After you've combed through both categories, tap the FREE UP XXX button (where XXX is the amount of space you'll free up) at the bottom right corner of the screen and then, when prompted, tap REMOVE.In my example, I am able to free up a quick 1.04 GB, without losing any particular downloaded files or infrequently used apps that I'd prefer to keep (Figure D).Figure D Do note, when you use this app for the first time, it will ask if you want to manage storage automatically.What this will do is enable the Android Storage manager, a feature that will automatically remove backed up content from your device.If you are certain your data is being backed up to Google Drive, and are okay with having Android automatically remove it from your device, tap TURN ON; otherwise, tap NO THANKS and you can then use FREE UP SPACE manually.Use this manual method on a regular basis and your device will always have enough space to function properly (given you are willing to delete files and apps).Everything you need, built in For the longest time, freeing up space on Android often required the help of a third-party app.That time is no more.Keeping your Android device free from unwanted downloads and infrequently used apps has never been so easy.Make use of this feature to keep your device running smoothly.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more news and tips.Subscribe Also see
Microsoft folds LinkedIn contact info into Outlook to boost business communications:::::Commercial Office 365 users can now see the LinkedIn profiles of their contacts within the email provider, according to a Microsoft blog post published on Tuesday.Initially previewed at Microsoft Ignite in September, the feature lets business users see LinkedIn profile information, including connections and work history, within Outlook.com, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business.The feature has today rolled out to Outlook.com, and will come to Outlook for Windows and iOS in the coming months, according to TechCrunch.To find a contact's profile, you can click on their name at the top of an email.A panel with various information will pop up, including a spot that says LinkedIn profile with an arrow.Click on that to show a mobile-sized version of the person's LinkedIn profile, including mutual connections and work experience.Much like a profile accessed through LinkedIn's website or mobile app, users will have the option to connect with the contact.SEE: Internet and Email usage policy (Tech Pro Research) Through this integration, connecting with business contacts is easier, as users don't have to go to a separate site to learn more about someone.It will also be easier to see who you contact frequently but haven't connected with on LinkedIn, allowing users to bolster preexisting relationships.Pre-meeting research also becomes simpler, reducing the time it takes to find and access someone's profile.Mutual experiences and connections are quickly and easily available, making for easier background research.Microsoft's $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn is beginning to pay off for business users.After the deal's December 2016 close, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella outlined plans to integrate the business networking site in a blog post.Past the Outlook integration, Nadella mentioned plans to allow users who draft a resume in Word to directly update their LinkedIn with it, and expanding LinkedIn Learning to Office 365 and Windows.The acquisition, the largest in Microsoft's history, helps combine business users' data to make business analytics easier.One example of this is July's integration of Dynamics 365 for Sales and LinkedIn's Sales Navigator, giving users contextualized information allowing for tailored content and smarter decisions.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Commercial Outlook users can now see contact's LinkedIn profiles, including mutual experience and the option to connect, within the email service.Available in Outlook.com, users can click a contact's name to access a pop-up card with an arrow guiding them to the mini version of a LinkedIn profile.This is one of the first integrations outlined by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella after the company bought LinkedIn in December 2016.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Microsoft Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Git: Everything the pros need to know:::::Git is the most widely-used, modern version control system (VCS) in the world.This tool enables users and developers to collaborate on local machines/networks or via public servers.Developers should think of Git as their go-to collaboration tool.Also, Git works seamlessly with GitHub (the world's leading code hosting platform), though it doesn't require the use of a public-facing service; in fact, Git can be easily used on a single machine or via a Git server on your own private network.Either way, collaboration on code or every kind of file is made exponentially easier.This Git smart person's guide is a quick way to get up to speed on the VCS.We'll update this resource periodically when there is new information about Git.SEE: All of TechRepublic's smart person's guides Executive summary What is Git?Git is a VCS that enables individuals or teams to collaborate and work with the same files.Git isn't just for programmersusers can check out files, modify them, and check them back in.Any document can be collaborated on in this VCS.Git can be used from within a text-based terminal window or one of the many GUI Git clients.Git is also a handy way to install applications from source on Linux.Git is a VCS that enables individuals or teams to collaborate and work with the same files.Git isn't just for programmersusers can check out files, modify them, and check them back in.Any document can be collaborated on in this VCS.Git can be used from within a text-based terminal window or one of the many GUI Git clients.Git is also a handy way to install applications from source on Linux.Why does Git matter?There are only a few other tools that make collaboration as easy.Git has become the de facto standard for developers around the world.With this tool, collaborators can avoid the confusion that often accompanies users editing the same files.Git makes all of this seamless and easy.There are only a few other tools that make collaboration as easy.Git has become the de facto standard for developers around the world.With this tool, collaborators can avoid the confusion that often accompanies users editing the same files.Git makes all of this seamless and easy.Who does Git affect?Git affects collaborators of all kinds, as well as anyone looking to install applications on Linux.Git affects collaborators of all kinds, as well as anyone looking to install applications on Linux.When was Git released?Git was developed by Linus Torvalds and was initially released on April 7, 2005.The current stable release, 2.14.2, was released September 22, 2017.Git was developed by Linus Torvalds and was initially released on April 7, 2005.The current stable release, 2.14.2, was released September 22, 2017.How do I install and use Git?Git can be installed from the standard Linux repositories or on Windows/macOS using their respective installers.SEE: Job description: DevOps engineer (Tech Pro Research) What is Git?Git is a version control system that enables users to track changes in files and collaborate on those files with numerous people.Git was written by Linus Torvalds to help maintain the development of the Linux kernel; it was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone.The initial release was April 7, 2005, and Git has been in steady development ever since.Although Git is primarily used by developers for the management of computer source code, it can be used to track changes with any file type.Git also allows Linux users to easily pull down source code from hosting websites, so it can be installed on a local machine.SEE: The truth about MooCs and bootcamps: Their biggest benefit isn't creating more coders (TechRepublic) Git is what is known as a distributed revision control system (DRCS) and uses snapshots as opposed to differences, which are used in standard VCS systems.Instead of storing its data as a list of file-based changes, Git stores data as a set of snapshots within a miniature file system.As soon as a commit is made to a file within Git, it takes a snapshot and stores a reference to the snapshotthis makes the system more lightweight and the process of merging files and code much easier.Every Git directory on every computer is a complete repository with a full history and version tracking ability that is independent of network access or a centralized server; this means a single machine can be used as a complete Git repository.Git works seamlessly with GitHub to create an efficient means of global collaboration within user repositories.From a Git repository, a user can pull down a file, commit changes to the file, push the file back to the repository, and even merge two more file histories together.Git can be used from within a terminal window or from within one of the many GUI tools; some of the popular GUIs are GitKraken, SmartGit, Git Extensions, Sourcetree, Tower, Git Cola, GitUp, TortoiseGit, and GitHub Desktop.Additional resources Why does Git matter?When Larry McVoy withdrew free usage of the BitKeeper product, many of the Linux kernel developers gave up using the tool.Because of this, Linus Torvalds (the creator of the Linux kernel) decided he needed a distributed system that would meet his demand for higher performance.Out of this was born the open source Git, one of the most efficient version control systems available.SEE: Linus Torvalds on Linux, life, and bathrobes (ZDNet) A VCS is essential for the development process.With such a system, you can return to any version of your code (or file) with ease, rendering it unnecessary to constantly save under different file names to ensure you can return to a previous state.With Git, a developer can easily give collaborators access to their code without worrying those developers might overwrite their work.Without Git, open source developers around the globe would have a much harder time collaborating.Git redefined how developers work together.When you add the seamless integration with GitHub, Git becomes a must-have for collaborators.Additional resources Who does Git affect?Developersfrom individuals to staff at small companies or enterpriseswork with Git.According to Google Trends, Git is currently demolishing the competition when it comes to Google searches.When you look at the companies that use Gitwhich include Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Quara, Twitter, eBay, Intel, and GE Aviationyou get an idea of the system's dominance.Git is especially popular within the realm of open source.Without Git, the development of the Linux kernel wouldn't progress as quickly or efficiently.All of this, in turn, affects consumers, as they are the recipient of vastly improved development cycles.Additional resources When was Git released?Linus Torvalds began developing the Git project on or around April 3, 2005 and made the first announcement of the project on April 6, 2005.Git became self-hosting as of April 7, 2005.Ever since its initial release, Git has seen steady development.The current version is 2.14, but versions all the way back to 2.4 (released April 30, 2015) are still supported.Additional resources What are the main competitors to Git?Git does have competitors, though not many of them are nearly as popular.How can I install and use Git?Git can be installed on any Linux distribution from the standard repositories.For example, with Ubuntu, the installation of Git can be handled via a single command: sudo apt install git On the macOS and Windows platforms, you must download and install using the dedicated installation files (macOS, Windows).Once installed, create your first repository and start adding files.A local Git repository can be connected to a GitHub repository for public collaboration.Additional resources Keep up with the latest open source news, analysis, feature stories, and tipssubscribe to our Open Source Weekly newsletter.Subscribe
Microsoft: Here's how Mixed Reality will aid information workers and boost digital transformation:::::On Wednesday at the Microsoft Future Decoded conference in London, executives from the tech giant laid out a vision for integrating Microsoft 365, Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality, and 3D capabilities into modern workplaces to aid digital transformation.In particular, mixed reality has the potential to allow workers and enterprises to be more productive, according to a blog post from Lorraine Bardeen, general manager of Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Experiences."Mixed reality has the potential to help customers and businesses across the globe do things that until now, have never been possible," Bardeen wrote in the post."Mixed reality experiences will help businesses and their employees complete crucial tasks faster, safer, more efficiently, and create new ways to connect to customers and partners."As the nature of work changes in the digital era, it is increasingly defined through creative problem solving and collaboration, rather than menial tasks, Bardeen wrotecreating demand for technology to support these new ways of working.SEE: Virtual and augmented reality policy template (Tech Pro Research) Firstline workers and information workers will likely be the first to benefit from mixed reality in the workplace, according to Bardeen.Firstline workersincluding sales associates, medical staff, customer service professionals, and factory workersmake up 2 billion members of the workforce globally.They often serve as the first point of contact between a business and its customers, or are directly involved in making products and delivering services.However, they have largely been underserved by technology, Bardeen noted."Without them, the ambitions of many organizations could not be brought to life," she wrote."Mixed reality is poised to help them work together, problem solve, and communicate in more immersive ways."At Microsoft Ignite in September, CEO Satya Nadella announced that Microsoft 365 was coming to firstline workers worldwide, along with less expensive Windows 10 S devices.Mixed reality will also help information workers collaborate more easily, as well as work remotely both synchronously and asynchronously."With mixed reality workers can change the content, the people, or even the location of a meeting, in a matter of seconds," Bardeen wrote."Mixed reality delivers interfaces that help workers act upon data generated from instrumented/intelligence devices, and connect seamlessly with others across physical space."Firstline and information workers are already using mixed reality to get work done, tapping Remote Assist to work with a remote expert to accomplish tasks in real-time, creating customized first-person perspective training manuals, designing spaces virtually, and creating mixed reality meetings that allow team members to join in real-time or asynchronously, bring in 2D and 3D content, with flexibility to change the location at any time.This plan marks another move for Microsoft further into the augmented reality (AR) space.The tech giant also announced on Wednesday that the HoloLens would expand into 29 new European markets, bringing the total number of HoloLens markets to 39.And in October, Microsoft announced the launch of Microsoft Reactor in San Franciscothe flagship hub for the tech giant's efforts in AR.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.At the Microsoft Future Decoded conference in London, executives from the tech giant offered a vision for integrating Microsoft 365, Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality, and 3D capabilities into modern workplaces to aid digital transformation.2.Firstline workers and information workers will likely be the first to benefit from mixed reality in the workplace, using the technology for collaboration, training, and more.3.Microsoft has made a number of moves into the mixed reality space recently, including expanding its HoloLens headset into new European markets.Image: Microsoft Keep up to date on all of the newest Microsoft trends.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Microsoft Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see

IBM platform will bring cloud-native capabilities to on-premises infrastructure:::::On Wednesday, IBM announced a new IBM Cloud Private software platform to help businesses extend cloud-native tools across both public and private clouds.IBM Cloud Private softwarebuilt on an open source Kubernetes-based container architecturesupports both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry, to allow for easier integration and portability of workflows between any cloud environment.It aims to give companies the ability to create on-premises cloud capabilities that are similar to public clouds, to accelerate app development, according to a press release.The company also announced a new container-optimized version of its core enterprise software, including IBM WebSphere Liberty, Db2, and MQ.This will make it easier for businesses to share data and grow applications consistently across public and private clouds.For example, an airline could use IBM Cloud Private to create an application that tracks frequent flyer miles in a private cloud, and connect it to a new mobile app in the public cloud, the release noted.And a financial services firm could use the platform to keep customer data in-house to meet security and regulatory requirements, while still tapping analytic tools and machine learning found in the public cloud to better find investment trends.SEE: Hybrid cloud 2017: Deployment, drivers, strategies, and value (Tech Pro Research) Public cloud adoption continues to grow rapidly across enterprises.However, in regulated industries like finance and healthcare, private cloud remains a large part of the cloud journey.Companies will spend an estimated $50 billion annually for the next three years to create private cloudsmarking a growth of 15-20% each year, IBM estimates.IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Private feature multi-cloud management automation, a security vulnerability advisor, data encryption, and privileged access to simplify cloud management and enhance security across multi-cloud environments.IBM Cloud Private is compatible with manufacturers including Cisco, Dell EMC, Intel, Lenovo, and NetApp.The platform is also optimized for IBM's secure transaction platform IBM Z, IBMPower Systems designed for AI and cognitive workloads, IBM Hyperconverged Systems, and IBM Spectrum Access data management and infrastructure from IBMStorage.It can also deploy with VMWare, Canonical, and other OpenStack distributions, the release noted."As enterprises seek to deliver applications faster than ever before, ICP with Canonical OpenStack gives them a set of proven applications with the leading OpenStack cloud platform," Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical, said in the release."The combination of feature rich containerised applications with open, fully supported cloud infrastructure drives costs down and delivers value faster."The software also features a core cloud platform tapping common PaaS technologies and developer runtimes, as well as data and analytics developer services such as IBM DB2, IBM DB2 Warehouse, PostgreSQL and MongoDB, allowing businesses to better gain insights from their data.Developers will also be able to access a number of management and DevOps tools, including APM, Netcool, UrbanCode, and Cloud Brokerage to better manage the lifecycle of workloads across any cloud environment.Open source management tools such as Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, and ElasticSearch are also included.The announcement of IBM Cloud Private is another step towards IBM's multi-cloud strategy.In October, the company worked with Google to launch Grafeas, an open source project that collects and aggregates metadata that developers can use to secure their software.And in September, IBM revealed the Open Liberty project, open sourcing its WebSphere Liberty code on GitHub to support Java microservices and cloud-native apps.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.The new IBM Cloud Private software platform will help businesses extend cloud-native tools across both public and private clouds.2.IBM Cloud Private is built on an open source Kubernetes-based container architecture, and supports both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry, to allow for easier integration and portability of workflows between any cloud environment.3.The platform marks another move toward IBM's multi-cloud enterprise strategy, along with Grafeas and the Open Liberty project.Image: iStockphoto/ipopba Stay up to date on all the latest cybersecurity threats.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cloud Insights newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Yes, you can use Linux without knowing the command line:::::If there's one thing surrounding Linux usage that bothers me more than anything else, it's when the detractors say you cannot work with Linux without knowing the command line.This is a bit of FUD fear, uncertainty, and doubt that keeps new users from giving the open source platform a try.I'm here, right now, to dispel that myth.When I first started using Linux back in the late 90s, there was no way to avoid the command line.In fact, most everything I did was typing commands.Over the years, that's changed to the point you can go your entire Linux desktop existence without ever having to touch a terminal.As a new user, you don't want to have to type commands.You want everything handled by a pretty GUI.As you should.Linux can do just that.Many of the modern desktop interfaces have done a great job of covering everything that once required a commandat least on the new-user level.Need to configure networking?GUI.Need to extract a zip file?GUI.Need to manage file permissions?GUI.Install, update, or configure applications?You guessed it: GUI.This, of course, applies mostly to the desktop.If you're looking at working with Linux on a server, you better be prepared to work with the command line.But as far as everyday, desktop usage, you don't ever have to touch the command line.Unless you want to.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
How data scientists can improve their LinkedIn profiles: 3 tips:::::The job market for data scientists is wide open, with an estimated 700,000 job openings in the field by 2020, according to an IBM report.And these professionals are in great demand: Nearly 90% of data scientists said they are contacted at least once a month for new job opportunities, while more than 50% said they are contacted on a weekly basis, according to a report from CrowdFlower."The demand for data scientists has continued to grow over the past few years years as companies across all industries continue to integrate new technology into core business operations to meet evolving customer expectations," said Sarah Stoddard, community expert at job search site Glassdoor.It's typical for companies outside of the tech industry to have a strong digital presence and gather large amounts of online data, presenting the need for employees with the ability to collect, organize and analyze this information to help educate business decisions, Stoddard said.In October, Glassdoor's Local Pay Reports found pay for data scientists had increased year-over-year by 0.9%, to $96,441an indicator of increasing demand and a way for employers to attract top talent, Stoddard said.SEE: Job description: Data scientist (Tech Pro Research) When job seeking, "the most important thing is letting employers know you're out there," said Felix Fermin, a recruiting manager at Mondo.LinkedIn has a feature wherein you can alert recruiters that you are open to opportunities without letting your current employer know that you are looking elsewhere, he said.Are you looking for a job in data science?Here are three tips for how to improve your LinkedIn profile and attract the most desirable employers.1.What languages you work in The top three most in-demand skills for data scientists are Python, R, and SQL, according to recent Glassdoor research."If you are familiar with these languages, highlighting these abilities in your resume and online career profiles could potentially attract a wider range of employers looking for data science talent, even if you aren't necessarily in the market for a new job," Stoddard said.Nine out of every 10 data science job postings on Glassdoor require at least Python, R, and/or SQL skills, Glassdoor found.On Indeed Prime, candidates with specific skills or experience in machine learning, Hadoop, Python, and Java get the most interest from employers, according to Shu Wu, director of Indeed Prime."Explaining how you're analyzing the data and what tools you're using on your resume goes a long way," Fermin added.2.What you're actually doing in your current role "A lot of people say 'I'm a data scientist at this company,' and that's it," Fermin said."It doesn't have to read like a resume, but a few sentences about what they're working on, and the why and how of what they're doing greatly improves the ability for employers and recruiters to see what they're doing."SEE: Here are the 3 top careers in data science, and how much they pay (TechRepublic) 3.Clear examples of how you have mastered data skills While formal education is important and encouraged, your related data science experience and how you quantify success will be most attractive to employers because they want to understand what expertise you will bring to the table, and how you have helped inform business decisions in the past, Stoddard said."Data science roles are constantly evolving with new technologies, so by including clear, quantifiable examples of how you have mastered core related skills and have learned new languages, this will help you stand out among the crowd," she added.In general, all data scientists should have SQL, statistics, and data/business analysis experience, Wu said.They should also be able to highlight how their skills have impacted overall business.Job seekers across industries should determine what factors are most important to their happiness and success at a new job.The three top factors that impact long-term employee satisfaction at a workplace include culture and values, career opportunities, and trust in senior leadership."While these may not be as intriguing as a higher salary during initial negotiations, high marks in these categories could mean the difference between you finding a job that fits your life, and not," Stoddard said.Image: iStockphoto/YakobchukOlena Keep up to date on all of the latest data science news.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Big Data Essentials newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How a robot baby is transforming the healthcare industry:::::Healthcare is experiencing rapid digital transformation thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, the cloud, and now, robotic simulators.TechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Jim Archetto, vice president of Gaumard Scientific, to discuss the company's robotic neonatal simulator Super Tory, and how it's being used to advance healthcare.Super Tory is an 8-pound training baby that is battery operated, and controlled by a Surface Pro.She is used in hospitals by EMTs, first responders, and other healthcare professionals as a training tool.The robotic baby can simulate crying, blinking and breathing, but can also simulate more serious conditions like asthma, pneumonia and choking.For example, just as a real baby's skin starts to turn red as they get agitated, Super Tory's exterior turns red as well."It's all designed to create that realistic learning environment so learners can really begin to understand," Archetto said.SEE: Enterprise IoT Research 2017: Benefits, Trends, and Security Concerns (Tech Pro Research) Every action that is performed on the baby is recorded through sensors, so users can measure metrics like how long it took for first responders to get to the room, how many attempts it took to perform the correct procedure, and the amount of time it took to treat Super Tory.The developers behind the robotic simulator also created a user interface on the Surface Pro that allows doctors or first responders to change any of the physical components of the baby, or add any other conditions a physician would experience in a normal clinic."It takes not just the coding, but understanding anatomically and physiologically what a patient would be doing at that time and incorporating all that together," Archetto said.A few years ago, this simulator couldn't have existed, as the technology was not adequate, Archetto added.Today, the technology that powers Super Tory is more reliable, smaller in size, and can control all of the tiny components that make up the baby."[Nursing students] can learn exactly what they need to do without worrying about injuring a live patient.These babies are fragile, but you'd rather have someone practice on an 8-pound simulator," he said.Find out The Next Big Thing and subscribe to TechRepublic's newsletter.Subscribe Also see:

He's dead wrong.:::::Oracle has got features.So many features.It has so many features, rival databases would be crazy to try to compete.Because, after all, features always win, right?That seems to be the view of Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd, who believes that Oracle and Microsoft have "got too many features" for an upstart competitor like MongoDB to match.He's right that MongoDB can't (or won't) reach feature parity with Oracle anytime soon.He's also correct that MongoDB's $100 million in revenue is "a long way to becoming meaningful" relative to Oracle's billions.But Hurd is absolutely wrong in his belief that "features" provide an indomitable barrier to would-be database competitors like MongoDB or AWS.Dead wrong, and the hubris could cost him.What could possibly go wrong?Let's not get ahead of ourselves.For all the bluster of a MongoDB or AWS, neither is yet making a dent in Oracle's database dominance.A few hundred million in revenue here or there is the sort of pocket change Oracle founder Larry Ellison leaves between the sofa cushions on his yacht.Hurd's primary complaint about supposed rivals like MongoDB and AWS isn't so much about financial performance, however, but ultimately about features.This is where he demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of market dynamics (and a lack of familiarity with The Innovator's Dilemma).In Clayton Christensen's view, it's precisely those vendors that serve their best, most demanding customers with feature-packed, sustaining innovations that lose sight of emerging market needs and over-serve that market with expensive, out-of-touch products.Which is a pretty good description of Oracle right about now.SEE: Oracle, NetSuite and the future of SaaS ERP (Tech Pro Research) The market no longer needs or wants a gargantuan, scale-up approach to data management.Instead, as one JAXenter survey indicated, a world awash in big data is interested in databases that offer the flexible schema and serious scale-out performance of a MongoDB or Amazon Aurora: JAXenter See Oracle on the list?It barely squeaks by Microsoft SQL Server.Both manage to dominate the "Not interesting at all" space.Building the future Not that Oracle is going to be snuffed out anytime soon.Far too much enterprise data resides within Oracle databases for that to happen next year, or even next decade.It's going to be a slow rot, one that Oracle's almost complete non-existence in public cloud isn't helping.That rot will be fed by developers.Databases are incredibly sticky, yes, but developers are the new kingmakers and they're not handing out crowns to Oracle.As AWS chief Andy Jassy recently stated, AWS has "hit 40,000 database migrations for AWS Database Migration Service."That's significant, but even more so, he continued, the "Pace [is] quickening."Partly this is because, as Jassy said in a separate interview, "Customers are sick of [Oracle]."It's not hard to find enterprises to corroborate this claim.Companies buy Oracle because they have to keep feeding the beast upon which they built the last two decades of data infrastructure.SEE: How to build a successful data scientist career (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Developers, however, have plans for their future data infrastructure, and those basically never include Oracle.This shows up in new software license revenue, which Redmonk analyst Stephen O'Grady picked apart back in 2013.(Since that time, the picture for Oracle's license revenue has only worsened.)Stephen O'Grady (Redmonk) The punchline?"Oracle's ability to generate new licenses is in decline, and has been for over a decade....Oracle's software revenue growth is increasingly coming not from new customers but from existing customers," O'Grady wrote.Oracle's revenue has soared over this same period of time, not because of net new demand for its software, but simply because it has become expert at squeezing existing customers for more cash, selling them new applications that it acquires.This strategy has worked well for giving hidebound CIOs a bit more mileage out of their existing Oracle database investments.However, it does absolutely nothing to address the needs of modern applications, which demand new data infrastructure to handle the high velocity, high volume, and high diversity of data.For such "big data," AWS has a great story, as do MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and other new school databases.Oracle doesn't, and it's much-vaunted "features" actually prove to be a harmful shackle to Oracle's legacy rather than a springboard into its future.Hurd must get this.He's a smart guy, albeit one who made his reputation at HP for cutting his way to profitability, rather than growing it through innovation.He is, in short, a great shepherd for Oracle's demise, rather than a prophet for its rebirth.I wouldn't call that a feature.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Big Data Essentials newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Help me AI, you're my only hope: Tech giants to Senate on Russian election meddling:::::On Tuesday, October 31, representatives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google testified before a US Senate subcommittee about how their firms tackle extremist content online and the roles their platforms played in alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.While each representative shared their company's plan for tackling this content, all three companies are relying on one secret weapon to help them accomplish their goals: Artificial intelligence (AI).While the potential for consumer applications of AI and machine learning is huge, it is still far from being fully realized.In the enterprise, however, these tools serve a much more practical application in that they enable the type of scale needed to sift through and sort massive amounts of dataexactly the type of data these companies need to look through in order to wipe out the content in question.SEE: Social media policy template (Tech Pro Research) When questioned about his firm's physical efforts in combatting this content, Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch explained that Facebook has more than five million advertisers.And while they have thousands of employees working on the issue, it simply isn't enough manpower to tackle the problem.Instead, Stretch said in his written testimony that Facebook is using a combination of human experts and AI tools to combat terrorist content on its platform, an initiative it first announced in June.In his testimony, he also noted that the company is using machine learning to identify ads more readily and to find the advertisers behind those ads and "require them to verify their identity," if they haven't already.Twitter, similarly, is dealing with massive scale issues when it comes to working on these problems.Sean Edgett, acting general counsel for Twitter, said in the subcommittee hearing that Twitter had been pulling employees from other departments to work on these projects as well, but it can only go so far.In his written testimony, Edgett said that Twitter is using machine learning technologies for three key purposes: To spot spam, to figure out how fake accounts affect users, and to more accurately understand the impact of election-related advertisements.Google has been investing in machine learning and AI for years.Much like Facebook, the search giant has been using AI and human employees to fight terrorist content online.Richard Salgado, director of law enforcement and information security for Google, wrote in his written testimony that Google had been adding new classifiers to improve this service.While the results of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism will likely have a major impact on advertising, marketing, and communications, the tools that these firms are using will set the stage for what AI can help businesses accomplish in the future.As massive enterprises seek to scale their business processes to new heights, it will be AI and machine learning that help them get there.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Representatives from Google, Facebook, and Twitter recently testified before US Senators about how their firms are combatting Russian misinformation and extremist content on their platforms.AI and machine learning are playing a critical role in all three companies, as they use the technologies to scale their efforts in dealing with problematic content.These technologies will continue to impact the business world, opening up new levels of productivity and efficiency.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
The 10 programming languages developers hate the most:::::Perl, Delphi, and VBA top the list of most disliked programming languages among developers, according to new data from Stack Overflow.In a Tuesday blog post, Stack Overflow data scientist David Robinson examined the site's Developer Stories, in which developers can add tags for languages, operating systems, platforms, and libraries they would or would not like to work withoffering a way to examine the opinions of hundreds of thousands developers on the platform."There are many ways to measure the popularity of a language; for example, we've often used Stack Overflow visits or question views to measure such trends," Robinson wrote."But this dataset is a rare way to find out what technologies people tend to dislike, when given the opportunity to say so on their CV."SEE: Hiring kit: Python developer (Tech Pro Research) Here are the top 10 most disliked programming languages, according to developers on Stack Overflow: 1.Perl 2.Delphi 3.VBA 4.PHP 5.Objective-C 6.Coffeescript 7.Ruby 8.C# 9.Java 10.C++ Many of the most disliked languagesincluding Perl, Objective-C, and Rubyare among the fastest-shrinking in terms of Stack Overflow activity.Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum in the least disliked languagesincluding R, Python, Typescript, Go, and Rustare among the fastest-growing on the site, and the least polarizing, Robinson noted.SEE: Here are the 3 top careers in data science, and how much they pay However, "we're not necessarily suggesting a causal relationship, where tags being disliked by a component of programmers leads to them being abandoned," Robinson wrote."Another possibility is that people feel comfortable expressing their dislike publicly if they sense that the language is already shrinking in popularity."Stack Overflow also examined the most disliked technologies overall.The top five were Internet Explorer, Visual Basic, COBOL, Flash, and ASP Classic.In terms of most universally liked technologies, machine learning, git, Python-3.X, HTML5, and CSS3 topped the list.Another recent Stack Overflow report found that Python is the fastest-growing programming language, and by 2019 will surpass all other languages in terms of active developers.Image: iStockphoto/SIphotography Keep up to date on all of the newest tech trends.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Ford, Qualcomm, AT&T, and Nokia launching autonomous vehicle trials in San Diego region:::::Image: Ford Motor Co. AT&T, Ford, Nokia, and Qualcomm Technologies, a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc., are launching Cellular-V2X autonomous vehicle trials at the San Diego Regional Proving Ground later this year in order to demonstrate the potential of C-V2X technologies, including improved automotive safety, automotive driving, and traffic efficiency.The trials are also intended to demonstrate cost-efficient benefits with embedded cellular technology in vehicles in conjunction with cellular base stations and roadside infrastructure.The San Diego Association of Governments, the California Department of Transportation, the city of Chula Vista, Calif., and intelligent transportation solutions provider McCain Inc. are supporting the trials."Leveraging the evolution of embedded cellular technologies for V2X communications holds great potential to advance safety benefits to all road users," said Cameron Coursey, vice president, AT&T Internet of Things Solutions."Working with industry leaders, such as Ford, Nokia, Qualcomm Technologies, and state and local government agencies, we will together lead the way to safer, more secure, cost-effective, and efficient next-generation solutions."SEE: Qualcomm, with AT&T, Ford, and Nokia, to test connected car tech in San Diego (ZDNet) C-V2X is defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as an extension of the global cellular standard and is considered a factor in next-generation wireless technology for automated driving solutions.It uses the 5.9 GHz band without involving a cellular network.C-V2X improves road safety by allowing vehicles to directly communicate with other vehicles, pedestrian devices, and roadside infrastructure such as traffic signs and construction zones.It complements other Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) sensors, such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR.C-V2X technology is designed to support 360-degree non-line-of-sight (NLOS) awareness and can extend a vehicle's ability to see, hear, and understand the environment down the road, at blind intersections, or in bad weather conditions."The advancement of cellular technology for C-V2X applications is very encouraging," said Don Butler, executive director of connected vehicle and services at Ford Motor Company."This technology promises to meet, and in some cases, exceed the performance requirements of vehicle communication being proposed by relevant government agencies while leveraging existing in-vehicle connectivity frameworks.C-V2X provides a reassuring path to technology advancements necessary to support emerging developments in autonomy, automated driving, and mobility.We are keen to investigate all aspects of this opportunity and support cross industry efforts that make that possible."SEE: IT leader's guide to the future of autonomous vehicles (Tech Pro Research) C-V2X platforms will be installed in Ford vehicles using Qualcomm's 9150 C-V2X solution to facilitate direct communications and also using AT&T's 4G LTE network communications and the ITS platform to communicate with Nokia wireless base stations.For the new communication technologies being deployed, McCain will help facilitate the effective integration with existing and emerging traffic signal control infrastructure.The San Diego region was designated by the US Department of Transportation as one of 10 automated vehicle proving grounds in the US earlier this year.Find out The Next Big Thing in TechRepublic's newsletter.Subscribe Also see:
Russians used Facebook the way other advertisers do: By tapping into its data-mining machine:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Facebook, Twitter and Google are set to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing to help find solutions to Russian disinformation.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Russians used Facebook exactly the way it was intended: To spread information farther and faster than a cold virus in a kindergarten classroom.(Photo: LOIC VENANCE, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Facebook's top lawyer Colin Stretch says it was unacceptable that a Russian organization linked to the Kremlin targeted Americans with Facebook posts and ads to sow discord in the tense political climate surrounding the 2016 presidential election.Yet Russian operatives used Facebook exactly the way it was intended: Spreading information farther and faster than a cold virus in a kindergarten classroom, reaching as many as 126 million Americans, a third of the U.S. population.And that's a wake-up call to Facebook's 2 billion-plus users, who for years have allowed the quiet culling of their personal data in exchange for the free service without much thought to what happens to that data, let alone whether a foreign power could exploit it to stoke outrage over polarizing issues from gay rights to gun rights.In a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Sen. Chris Coons (D, Del.)displayed two ads run by Facebook pages created by Russia's Internet Research Agency.One was an ad from a Facebook page called "Heart of Texas," which claimed Hillary Clinton was despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans.The second ad came from a Facebook page called Being Patriotic and promoted an Oct. 2, 2016 event called Miners for Trump.Lawmakers pressed Facebook on just how easy it was for Russians to target American users.The answer: Facebook created a multibillion-dollar digital advertising business by allowing marketers to pinpoint exactly whom they want to reach by selecting criteria such as location, demographics, behavior and interests all information that Facebook collects each time someone logs in."Facebook is designed to amplify messages that are extreme and emotional and that's exactly what's happened.Facebook is designed to allow people to send messages to a lot of people for very little money and that's exactly what's happened," says Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of Antisocial Media, an upcoming book on Facebook."Combine the two and it's a perfect propaganda machine for anyone who wants to distract or disrupt a democratic republic."A Facebook post by the popular Blactivist account later discovered to be a fake account created by Russians.(Photo: Facebook) Political pressure mounted this week as executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google answer questions on Capitol Hill about election interference by Russians on their platforms.Testimony continues Wednesday in separate hearings before the House and Senate intelligence committees, where executives are expected to parry calls by some lawmakers for a bill that would increase regulation of ads on their platforms.Russia has denied any meddling in the election.Facebook knows you better The current political storm has its roots in Facebook's data-obsessed success.The giant social network is constantly hoovering information from what you post there: your age, gender, education and income level, job title, relationship status, hobbies, political leanings, what TV shows and movies you like, what kind of car you drive.It also tracks which pages you like and the ads you click on, the phone you use and your Internet connection as well as the sites you browse on the Web.It buys information from data brokers that gather detailed information from public records and previous purchases and purchasing behavior, among other things, ranging from the value of your home to whether you carry a balance on your credit card.When you combine that information with what Facebook already knows about you, it's arguably the most complete consumer snapshot on earth."Facebook is collecting more data than anyone except the U.S. government," said Logan Young, a vice president of strategy at BlitzMetrics, a digital marketing company that focuses on Facebook ads.Just as Facebook tries to show people what they want to see in their news feed, Facebook uses the data it collects to try to show people the kinds of ads that are most relevant to them.For example, a baseball clothing line can target people interested in baseball, not just people who like sports.Or a make-up line for African-American women can target African-American women, instead of all women.But ad targeting can be abused.The media has uncovered potential misuses of advertising tools including the ability to target people who expressed interest in anti-Semitic topics such as "jew hater" and the ability to exclude specific racial and ethnic groups when placing housing ads.Facebook first disclosed in September that Russian actors bought ads to meddle in the U.S. election.Among the content created by the Russian propaganda agency was a popular "Blacktivist" account that posted videos of police brutality, publicized rallies and urged black people to "wake up."Another fake account, "Being Patriotic," argued that Black Lives Matter activists who disrespected the American flag should be "immediately shot."More: Russian fake accounts showed posts to 126 million Facebook users More: Facebook: 10 million people saw Russia-backed election ads More: Facebook makes political ads more transparent ahead of Russia hearings More: Facebook political ads are coming out of the shadows why you should care The campaigns that fooled some activists demonstrated just how effective Facebook advertising can be, even on a relatively small budget.Facebook estimates that 470 Russian-backed accounts from the Internet Research Agency, produced 80,000 posts and bought 3,000 ads on Facebook between January 2015 and August 2017.In all, the Russians spent about $100,000, according to Facebook.About 75% of the ads were targeted broadly at Americans and 25% of the ads were targeted specifically to certain parts of the country.By targeting key demographic groups in swing states, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, two states that were critical to Trump's election win, the Russians could have swayed public sentiment with a relatively small advertising budget, Young says.The possibility that a foreign power used Facebook to influence voters has made Americans uneasy.Just 18% of Americans say the amount of data possessed by companies like Facebook is a good thing and 78% see it as a bad thing because of the potential for misuse, an Axios survey found this week.User ranks keep growing Yet it's not clear that greater public understanding of how much Facebook knows and how that information can be used for ill will turn off users.Over the years, people have grown accustomed to ads hounding them on Facebook.Victoria Heckstall, a 26-year-old lifestyle blogger from Newport News, Virginia, says about half the time it's as if Facebook ads read her mind.Through one ad, she bought a facial mask that she's still using, through another she discovered a nearby kickboxing gym where she now has a membership."That ad was right on point.I was thinking about trying a new fitness program," Heckstall says."I still have the membership.It's one of the best investments ever.I am really glad I came across the ad when I did."Facebook's General Counsel Colin Stretch speaks before a Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, on more signs from tech companies of Russian election activity.(Photo: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) That consumer acceptance has helped Facebook build a service that's used by 1.3 billion people every day and a digital advertising business that is second only to Google.On Wednesday Facebook is expected to post third-quarter revenue of $9.88 billion, up 41% from the year-ago quarter, another in a series of double-digit gains.The only alternative for consumers would be to delete their accounts.But very few have.For many, having a Facebook account isn't just a convenience, it's a necessity, like having a social security number or a phone number .Facebook may not charge a fee for its service, says Andrew Keen, but "we pay with our data, with our digital blood."The author of an upcoming book How to Fix the Future: Staying Human in the Digital Age, Keen says he doesn't have a Facebook account because he's not willing to pay that price.Follow USA TODAY senior technology

TripAdvisor removed warnings about rapes and injuries at Mexico resorts, tourists say:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Kristie Love fought to warn travelers about how she was raped at an Iberostar resort in Riviera Maya, Mexico, in 2010.The Dallas woman posted her story on TripAdvisor, which refused to publish it.Until now.Mike De Sisti Kristie Love talks near her home in Dallas, Texas about how she was raped at a Iberostar resort in Riviera Maya.She fought to warn travelers on TripAdvisor about what happened to her at the upscale, all-inclusive resort in Mexico in 2010.(Photo: Mike De Sisti/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) MILWAUKEE In late July, a woman from Indianapolis posed a question on TripAdvisor: Should she and her husband travel to Riviera Maya for a Mexican vacation?They had read about problems with alcohol at the resorts vacationers who blacked out and were assaulted, robbed, raped, even died.Her husband wanted to cancel; she did not.Replies began popping up in the forum within minutes.After 10 days, there were 55 in all.Twenty-four of the comments encouraged the couple not to worry.Just got back on Saturday and never felt safer, wrote BeachDog77 from New York.I live close to St. Louis and feel much safer in Riviera Maya then I do going to a Cardinals baseball game, concurred BeachQueen51.Four included irrelevant comments, such as Thank you, or The pools are 4.3 feet deep.More: As dozens more report blackouts at Mexico resorts, country says it will act on tainted alcohol More: A Mexican vacation, a mysterious death, and now endless questions for Wisconsin family What about the other 27 posts?Did anyone express worry, describe problems or share experiences that might serve as warnings?The public had no way to know.The posts had all been removed from the forum.In their place was a message from TripAdvisor that cited various reasons for the deletions: They were determined to be inappropriate by the TripAdvisor community, or removed by staff because they were off-topic or contained language or subject matter that was not family friendly.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel asked TripAdvisor to see the posts that were removed.The company refused.Since July, when the Journal Sentinel began investigating the mysterious death of a Wisconsin college student in Mexico and found widespread problems with tainted alcohol, derelict law enforcement and price gouging from hospitals more than a dozen travelers from across the country have said TripAdvisor muzzled their first-hand stories of blackouts, rapes and other ways they were injured while vacationing in Mexico.To me its like censoring, said Wendy Avery-Swanson of Phoenix, whose recent review of a Mexican resort describing how she blacked out from a small amount of alcohol served at the swim-up bar was removed from the website.It wasnt hearsay, as TripAdvisor claimed, said Avery-Swanson, 52.It actually happened to me.TripAdvisor declined to publish Avery-Swanson's review.(Photo: TripAdvisor) Massachusetts-based TripAdvisor touts its more than 535 million user reviews of hotels, restaurants and attractions around the globe.And company officials say it uses finely tuned software to detect fake reviews and has hundreds of employees dedicated to policing posts and ensuring content integrity.A Journal Sentinel investigation into the workings of the $1.5 billion company has found that it is what TripAdvisor does not publish that poses real problems for travelers.The companys policies and practices obscure the publics ability to fully evaluate the information on its site.Secret algorithms determine which hotels and resorts appear when consumers search.Some hotels pay TripAdvisor when travelers click on their links; some pay commissions when tourists book or travel.This post from TripAdvisor shows a woman asking about safety at Mexican resorts and the replies she received.27 posts were deleted by TripAdvisor; the majority of those remaining all encouraged the couple not to worry.(Photo: TripAdvisor) An untold number of TripAdvisor users have been granted special privileges, including the ability to delete forum posts.But the company wont disclose how those users are selected.Theres no way to know how many negative reviews are withheld by TripAdvisor; how many true, terrifying experiences never get told; or for site users to know that much of what they see has been specifically selected and crafted to encourage them to spend.This is a major problem with online reviews, theyre heavily skewed, said Bart De Langhe, an associate professor of marketing at ESADE business school in Barcelona, Spain, who specializes in consumer behavior and user reviews.We live in this illusion of perfect information ... but we dont ask the hard questions and dont realize the information is imperfect and biased.The average rating for all hotels on TripAdvisor is a favorable 4 out of 5.An analysis by the Journal Sentinel of listings for one tourist region in Mexico found 74% of the hotels rated with 4s or 5s.When looking at the largest 100 hotels in the same area, that number jumps to 96%.Positive reviews on travel sites translate into higher prices hotels can charge.A 2012 study by the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration of a different travel site found that if a hotels review scores climb by one point, on a five point scale, the hotel can increase its price by 11% and still maintain the same occupancy rate.User ratings of all kinds carry an overblown amount of credibility, De Langhe said.Its very clear that these reviews have a major influence on sales, he said.And they shouldnt.In the case of the 17-year-old TripAdvisor which built its reputation as a free bulletin board for traveler advice it may not be at all obvious to consumers that its business model depends on travelers doing more than writing and reading reviews; its contingent upon travelers booking trips.In an August filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, TripAdvisors chief financial and accounting officers stressed the importance that the company convert these visitors into engaged users and bookers.Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in such advertising does not generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit, they wrote.* * * Seven years ago, TripAdvisor repeatedly removed a post written by Kristie Love, a 35-year-old mother of two from Dallas.Love told how she had been raped by a security guard at a highly rated all-inclusive Mexican resort owned by the global chain, Iberostar, based in Spain.She wrote how, after an evening with friends, she had returned to her room to find the electronic key card no longer opened her door at the Iberostar Paraiso near Playa del Carmen.She headed to the lobby of the sprawling resort to get her card reactivated and stopped to ask a uniformed guard whether she was walking in the right direction.He motioned her to follow him, then overpowered her, dragged her into some bushes and raped her.When she reached the lobby in tears, hotel staff refused to call police.Kristie Love's original post on TripAdvisor.(Photo: TripAdvisor) A TripAdvisor moderator spotted the post soon after it had published and deemed it in violation of the companys family friendly guidelines.The following year, another young woman, 19 and on vacation with her family, reported to hotel officials in the same resort complex that a security guard had raped her in the bathroom.And in 2015, still another woman, Jamie Valeri, 34, a mother of six from Wisconsin, was sexually assaulted at the same resort after she and her husband simultaneously blacked out in the middle of the day, barely into their third drink.Those are just the rapes at one resort reported directly to the Journal Sentinel by travelers who read earlier stories.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Jamie Valeri talks about being drugged and assaulted while on vacation with her husband in Mexico in 2015.Mark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Like Love, Valeri tried to warn others on TripAdvisor.The company labeled her comments hearsay and removed her posts.After a few unsuccessful attempts at re-wording her review, she gave up.Had TripAdvisor not deleted Loves post seven years ago, and any others like it, Maybe we wouldnt have gone or maybe that wouldnt have happened to me, said Valeri, who lives in Neenah.Gary Davidson, a Miami attorney who specializes in travel law, said TripAdvisor has an ethical obligation to warn tourists about dangerous situations, though not necessarily a legal one.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Rick Valeri talks about how he believes he and his wife were drugged on vacation in Mexico.Mark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The company isnt the same as a travel agency with experts personally advising and selling trips, he said.Travel agents have a legal duty to disclose information about travel destinations or resorts when they know about specific risks.If they dont and travelers get injured, the travel agent can be held liable for failure to warn.TripAdvisor also might not be in quite the same legal category as Expedia or Priceline, which are considered transactional firms, where people shop for deals and book reservations.The courts view the two differently and hold the transactional firms less accountable, Davis said.If youre purporting to be objective and youre actually not, consciously not, and what youre really doing is promoting travel to all locations regardless of how dangerous it might be ... Its an inherent conflict of interest, said Davis.Davis represents the family of a man who was killed at a resort in Mexico several years ago.His case does not involve TripAdvisor.If its a dangerous place, if its a place where people have been killed as a result of drinking bad alcohol, that information needs to be posted, he said.This is a very important issue peoples lives are at stake.In July, when the Journal Sentinel first began asking TripAdvisor about posts that were deleted and what the company does to inform travelers of dangerous situations, a spokeswoman responded: Its important that anyone who suspects foul play or illegal activity contact the local authorities rather than use a review platform as their primary way to share their experience.Last week, the company told the Journal Sentinel it is designing a new badge system, similar to other reward and reprimand badges it uses, that it says will alert travelers to major media stories that expose health and safety concerns and other serious problems at hotels, restaurants or attractions.And on Oct. 19, seven years to the day after Love was raped, TripAdvisor re-published her original report.TripAdvisor republished Kristie Love's original post telling how she was raped at a resort in Mexico.The page number in red shows it landed on page 2,608, behind thousands of newer comments.(Photo: TripAdvisor) Its the kind of information we absolutely want published, Brian Hoyt, spokesman for TripAdvisor, told the Journal Sentinel.The forum post landed in its original chronological spot, more than 2,600 pages deep, behind thousands of more recent threads.The thread is closed, so no one can add a new comment.* * * Like most sites that allow reader comments, TripAdvisors guidelines for posting on its forums and for writing reviews are aimed at keeping out profanity, spam and fake or irrelevant content.First-hand information shared by travelers is central to the companys success.The popularity of what consumers perceive as trustworthy user reviews from fellow travelers propelled the website from its inception as a tiny, online travel guide in 2000 to its prominence today as an indispensable tool used by hundreds of millions of travelers worldwide with sites in 28 languages.The company receives more than 290 new contributions every minute.TripAdvisor says it maintains a firewall between its customer-generated content and the money-generating deals it makes with hotels and chains, such as Iberostar, and online booking partners, such as Expedia and Priceline.The company has faced criticism from the business community for allowing unverified posts containing seriously damaging accusations, such as a resort manager being a pedophile.In a growing number of cases, businesses have threatened to sue reviewers for their negative comments, a trend that has prompted TripAdvisor to push for stronger laws to prevent such suits.TripAdvisor uses dozens of filters to help detect fake reviews positive and negative and has about 300 employees dedicated to preserving content integrity, according to Hoyt.Were not an arbiter of fact, but were trying to provide the most accurate picture, he said, noting there are negative reviews on the site, including some that contain allegations of rape.A Journal Sentinel examination of TripAdvisor identified a host of issues that inhibit users from getting a full picture of the companys operation.Consider: Some non-employees termed trusted community members have the ability to remove forum posts.But TripAdvisor wont disclose who they are or how they are selected, or what, if any, safeguards exist against conflicts of interest.Its an internal metric that we look at that helps us determine if someone is trustworthy, theyve given good advice that others have viewed that to be helpful," Hoyt said.Those designated by TripAdvisor as destination experts people the company uses to respond to safety concerns or suggest restaurants or activities can include local tour guides, resort managers, real estate brokers, property owners and others with a financial stake in attracting tourists to the area.Those conflicts are are not disclosed to site visitors.If TripAdvisor detects that destination experts are overly promoting their businesses, the company will warn them or take away their designation, Hoyt said.TripAdvisor doesnt verify that reviews are written by people who actually stayed at hotels, went to attractions or ate at restaurants.The company says a confirmation process would end up excluding input from people who shared the experiences but didnt pay the bill.The placement TripAdvisors hotel booking partners receive on the site is based in part on the commission the partners pay or the price they pay TripAdvisor each time a visitor clicks on their link, according to interviews and company reports to shareholders.That price is determined through an automated auction.Primary factors used to determine the placement of partner links on our site include, but are not limited to the size of the bid relative to other bids, room night price, and other variables, the company told investors in its August SEC filing.Hoyt said the bidding does not allow hotels to buy their way to the top.TripAdvisor launched an instant booking feature in 2014 that allows travelers to initiate the booking process directly on TripAdvisor.The company has contracts with some hotels and online travel agencies that earn TripAdvisor a 12% to 15% commission when travelers book or complete their stays.-- The companys policy against posts that include hearsay is inconsistently enforced.Some posts that remain include such statements as My husband went crazy for the red curry, or My wife went and said it was really nice a bit more walking than she wanted.But she liked the boat ride and the views on the island.Other posts, with serious information about dangers, such as Jamie Valeris, get deleted.Valeri described in a post what happened to her and her husband in 2015 when they blacked out after a few drinks and awoke to learn she had been assaulted and he had a broken hand.The Journal Sentinel confirmed the details of the Valeris Mexico experience, and those of others, through receipts, email records, phone records, hotel documents, medical reports and interviews.Valeri wrote on TripAdvisor that when the couple sought medical help after returning to the United States, the doctor said the way the break (on her husbands hand) was he had to have hit someone or something very hard making a fist.Hoyt said her reference to a third party medical diagnosis violated TripAdvisors hearsay guidelines.Parents of those who died at Mexican resorts told the Journal Sentinel they, too, were blocked from alerting travelers to the tragedies.If they hadnt seen what happened themselves, TripAdvisor told them, it was considered hearsay.*** Shelly Khan showed up at the front desk at Iberostar Grand Paraiso in the middle of August, excited for a short getaway from the demands of college and her work as a paramedic in New York City.She said she chose Iberostar, an all-inclusive resort in Riviera Maya, because she had seen all the positive reviews on TripAdvisor: About how the staff was great, the food was good and the drinks were delicious.With her sister by her side and documents in hand confirming the room they had booked for a three-night stay, she approached the counter to check in.The receptionist plugged her information into the computer and then informed them that one of the reservations had been canceled.They had only paid for one person, she said.They would have to pay $1,200 more if they both wanted to stay at the resort.The Khan sisters showed the receipt for the $2,600 they had already paid.After much arguing, the hotel reduced the amount owed to $700.Pay it now with cash or credit card, or be put on the street.Those were the options.Khan called her parents and they provided a credit card number.The rest of their stay was terrible, said Khan, 27.The hotel manager followed them around glaring at them most everywhere they went.Feeling threatened, they ended up spending a majority of their time locked in their room.We were terrified, she said.Ive never felt so unsafe.We handle some really tough neighborhoods in New York (as a paramedic) and Im never afraid for my life ...It was all about money at the end of the day.Back in New York, Khan wanted to let others know what happened.She wrote up a review describing the experience and submitted it to TripAdvisor.The company declined to publish it.In an Aug. 22 email to Khan, TripAdvisor suggested her post contained hearsay and explained in the companys boilerplate response: Here's a tip phrases similar to the following are frequently associated with content that violates this guideline: The owner is known for ...; In speaking with another guest we met, they mentioned ; The police officer told us this kind of thing happens all the time My post had nothing like that, Khan said.It wasnt third party.Khan did not have the full text of what she wrote because users who fill out a form on TripAdvisors site cant see or retrieve their sent submissions that arent published.However, the email TripAdvisor sent her rejecting the review included a large portion of her original post.There was no hearsay in that excerpt.*** Mary Engle, associate director for advertising practices with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, said user-review websites arent regulated the way, say, the Food and Drug Administration regulates food products.Yet companies do have to adhere to truth-in-advertising laws, and the FTC is partially responsible for enforcement.Engle says her agency looks at what companies say they offer and what consumers expect from companies.It depends on what the websites say about what they do, Engle said.If they say they post all the good, the bad and the ugly, then thats what they have to live up to.The basic rule for us is that its truthful and not misleading If theyre taking down negative reviews, that would be misleading.Engle said the agency published a letter regarding search engines and consumer expectations in 2013.It reminded search companies, such as Google and others, what constitutes advertising.Including or ranking a search result in whole or in part based on payment is a form of advertising, the letter states.To avoid the potential for deception, consumers should be able to easily distinguish a natural search result from advertising that a search engine delivers.TripAdvisors top listing on hotel search results is a sponsored spot and is marked as such.Theres no indication on the booking links that placement may be based in part on the bidding process the company describes in its SEC filings.The FTC has not taken any enforcement action against TripAdvisor.In late 2014, Italian regulators fined the company $600,000 for failing to adequately weed out fraudulent reviews.And in 2011, the Advertising Standards Authority in the United Kingdom launched an investigation into TripAdvisors use of the slogan Reviews you can trust.The following year, it held the company should not have implied that all the reviews that appeared on its website were from real travellers, or were honest, real or trusted.TripAdvisor changed its slogan to Reviews from our community.*** Travelers increasingly rely on user-generated content to make decisions, and when searching for hotels one might assume that user reviews posted on independent sites might be similar and draw comparable conclusions.Not so.When the Journal Sentinel compared the first 10 hotel listings in Playa del Carmen on TripAdvisor with those on Googles Hotel Finder, which also features user reviews of hotels, just 30% of the hotels overlapped.That means what Google determines are the first 10 hotels travelers should see on their screens is quite different from the results the same search produces on TripAdvisor.While the average user ratings for all the hotels are similar on both between 4.5 and 4.6 bubbles or stars the companies only agree on three of the 10 that each presents as top choices.Even a search for the first 100 hotels produced similarly confusing results for consumers; just 48% appear on the lists from both websites.TripAdvisor said its results are tailored to individuals based on previous search history, prior purchases and assumptions it makes from the search, among other factors.The Journal Sentinels analyses, however, were based on searches from private browsers with no search histories.Adding to the confusion, consider the rankings of the Carmen Hotel in Playa del Carmen.Over the first nine months of 2017, the Carmen Hotel was rated between 4 and 5 in 95% of the reviews posted on TripAdvisor.For the same time period, just 79% of the reviews posted on Google were that high.The opposite is true for another hotel, The Hotel Hacienda del Caribe.In comparing reviews that date from 2013 through mid-October 2017, only 66% of reviews on TripAdvisor rated Hotel Hacienda del Caribe as a 4 or 5, while on Google that number was 84%.Consumer reviews typically skew highly positive due to a couple of factors, said De Langhe, the tourism marketing professor from Barcelona.The "brag and moan factors, as De Langhe calls them, result in people who are really pleased or extremely angry posting reviews more frequently than those who dont have strong opinions.The brag factor is stronger, skewing the data in a positive direction.It is derived, in part, because people already spent their money expecting to like the purchase and enjoy themselves, and are therefore inclined to validate their expense.Experiences that rate a 2 or 3 are greatly underrepresented, he said even if the website isn't biased against them.In addition, a spot check of seven recent forum threads pertaining to alcohol safety problems found 17% of comments had been deleted.That compares to about 2% in a sample of nearly 1,000 more general threads.TripAdvisor would not allow the Journal Sentinel to see any posts or reviews that had been removed.Once we determine that content should be removed and violated our guidelines for publishing, that information is no longer publishable or promotable by TripAdvisor, Hoyt wrote in an email.Hoyt later said he personally reviewed some of the rejected answers to the question from the Indianapolis woman asking whether she and her husband should take their trip.Without providing any examples, he said a few contained allegations that the news stories about the dangers at Mexican resorts were fake news.He didnt say why such comments would be considered off-topic by TripAdvisor when other approved comments include links to stories from Mexican newspapers that focused on assurances from the local health ministry that the alcohol at resorts is safe.Last week, Hoyt acknowledged that about a dozen of the deleted posts should not have been removed.He said they would be republished.*** After being raped in 2010, Love just wanted to get home to Dallas as fast as she could.She knew the odds of a successful criminal conviction were slim, since the resort would not even contact police.She realized the justice system in Mexico was vastly different from that in the U.S. She just wanted to ignore what happened and try to move on.Kristie Love was raped at a Iberostar resort in Riviera Maya in Mexico.She fought to warn travelers about what happened to her in 2010.She went to the travel site TripAdvisor she used most when scouting out a vacation.The online travel website - which claims to post reviews you can trust refused to publish her post.(Photo: Mike De Sisti/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) But just before leaving, she had a conversation with a family that had come to the resort with their teenage daughters.They were talking about how the girls were free to wander the resort by themselves.As much as I wanted to leave what occurred to me in Mexico, all I could think was ... Ive got two daughters one is about to be a teenager, and if this ever happened to her and I didnt come forth, that makes it my responsibility, Love said.Thats when I got the courage and I thought, OK I can do this.She told hotel officials she could identify the attacker and asked to see photos of the staff.A manager promised she would email her the pictures and that the hotel would investigate.She flew back to Dallas feeling confident something would be done.It wasnt.Not only did the hotel never send the promised pictures, when she called to follow up, Iberostar representatives said they had no report of her complaint.Soon they stopped taking her calls.Then they threatened to sue her.In a statement to the Journal Sentinel, Iberostar Hotels & Resorts said the company has zero tolerance for any type of illegal or inappropriate conduct.The company said it investigated Loves case and the others, but said none of the women chose to pursue their cases.Love was determined.She traveled back to Mexico within a few weeks to file the needed police reports, set on doing everything she could to hold the resort accountable and to prevent another woman from being raped.Still, nothing came of it.The police chief, who seemed sincere in his efforts to help, couldnt get Iberostar to cooperate with the investigation.He was shot dead in his squad car a couple months later.Local news reports said it was likely a killing meant to intimidate law enforcement.Attorneys in the U.S. told her to drop it.I chased it in any direction I possibly could, she said At that point, the only thing left I could do was go to TripAdvisor.Using the name informwomen, she described what happened and how the hotel refused to do anything.The post was quickly removed.She tried to publish it again.And again it got rejected.For years, Love fought to warn others any way she could.She posted her story on mexicovacationawareness.com, a website dedicated to alerting tourists to the dangers of Mexico, as well as other blogs and travel sites.It consumed me, it consumed me entirely, she said.Eventually she had to let it drop.I just needed to be able to lay my head at night and know I did the best I could and I felt like I did the best I could in getting the word out, she said.When she learned last week her post would be republished, she said she felt a sense of peace.At the same time, she is still distraught that people werent alerted sooner.I am very thankful the light has finally been shed, she said.Asked about the deletions of her warnings, Hoyt told the Journal Sentinel that TripAdvisor had changed its interpretation of the family friendly guidelines in the years since 2010.Its an ever-evolving process, he said.We continue to strive to become better.Are we perfect?No.TripAdvisor did not apologize for the deletion and Love is skeptical the company will truly reform its ways.So is Jamie Valeri, whose own sexual assault complaint about the same resort has not been reposted.Josh Resmini, too, is doubtful.As recently as Oct. 16, Resmini tried to post a review on TripAdvisor of the Grand Velas Riviera Maya, a world-renowned Mexican spa he visited in May.Resmini described how instead of receiving a relaxing and rejuvenating massage at the resort, he was drugged and then sexually assaulted by the massage therapist.Josh Resminis review of the Grand Velas Resort spa describing how he was sexually assaulted during a massage in May, was deleted by TripAdvisor.(Photo: Todd Mazer) The Journal Sentinel first wrote about Resminis experience in August.He was uncomfortable having his name published at the time.He has since changed his mind and wants others to know of the anguish hes suffered in the months since the assault, as the resort, travel agencies, hotel trade groups and others have refused to hold anyone accountable.Hotel management dodged my calls after I stayed an additional six days in Mexico to formalize my complaint, he wrote in his TripAdvisor review.The hotel has denied any responsibility.One day later, on Oct. 17, he received an email from TripAdvisor.We are unable to publish your review, it said.The reason?Hearsay.Follow Raquel Rutledge and Andrew Mollica on Twitter: @RaquelRutledge and @armollica Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hvQMLH

Hot read: Audible Romance takes you to the steamy parts:::::You can choose romance books that fit different categories.(Photo: Audible) You devour romance novels to get took, admit itthe steamiest parts.If the above describes you, youre the type of person Audible is trying to seduce into subscribing to a new service launching Wednesday called Audible Romance.It promises romance fans unlimited access to more than 10,000 audiobooks that fit the romance spectrum, from Jane Austen to erotica.Amazon-owned Audible is the largest seller of narrated books and spoken-content, with more than 400,000 titles overall, and romance is not an easily and singularly defined term, says Audible chief content officer Andy Gaies.Audible Romance costs $14.95 a month as a standalone offering, or $6.95 a month as an add-on for folks who already pay $14.95 month for Audibles core service.A regular Audible subscription gives listeners one credit towards an Audible title each month, plus a discount on purchased audiobooks.If you tend to buy a lot of romance-oriented bestsellers under the core plan, you may come out ahead with the new offering.Romance fans are voracious consumers of content, Gaies says, and on the cutting edge of digital.More: Smart pet?Audible wants Fido to listen to Jane Austen.The company says 103 of the top 153 bestselling romance authors, such names as Nora Roberts, Robyn Carr, Sylvia Day, and Debbie Macombe, will have works included in the service.Choosing the `good parts' (Photo: Audible) There seems little doubt that Audible thinks sex sells, judging by one of the main features behind the new service.It's called Take Me to the Good Part, and it promises to, um, do just that.Audible says the feature was driven by machine learning and data-science.Another new feature, also driven by data science, is a Steaminess Score that is supposed to help clue you in on the level of passion you can expect from a given audiobook.The scale: Sweet, Simmering, Sizzling, Hot Damn, and O-O-OMG.Audible says its team developed these categorizations through an algorithm that scans each title to look for key words that trigger steamy markers.Blair Underwood, Dermot Mulroney, Jesse Metcalf are among those voicing the material.Meanwhile, lest you think the designated good parts are all about the hottest encounters, they also cover flirty banter and first meetings."We don't want to define what good parts to one person would mean to another," says Audible chief financial officer Cynthia Chu, who leads the data science team.Overall, Audible Romance includes 41 micro-categories and 131 story and character tropes selected by Audibles own editors.A subscriber might search for books around fire fighters, football players or other character types.Or look for material that delves into rescuing a character from Mr. Wrong or raising the question,will they, or wont they?Youll be able to listen to a sample from each title before choosing to plunge in.Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zWZV6s
This is the tunnel Elon Musk is building to solve L.A. traffic woes:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Elon Musk has shared a picture of his futuristic tunnel for high-speed travel and it looks awesome.Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) has the story.Buzz60 When Elon Musk isn't creating electric cars or scheming to send humans to Mars, the entrepreneur is attempting to cure Los Angeles of its traffic problems.On Twitter, Musk recently shared an image of a tunnel in L.A. from The Boring Company, part of a plan to create an underground transportation system.Picture of The Boring Company LA tunnel taken yesterday pic.twitter.com/TfdVKyXFsJ Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2017 Musk said the tunnel is 500 feet so far, reaching two miles long in about 3 to 4 months.The goal is to stretch along Interstate 405 from Los Angeles International Airport to U.S. Route 101 in a year.According to its website, the goal of The Boring Company is to alleviate "soul-destroying traffic" by building a high-speed transportation system."A large network of tunnels many levels deep would fix congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew," read a statement from The Boring Company.In May, Musk revealed the company began boring a passage underneath Los Angeles.The Boring Company website notes another benefit to the tunnels is faster adoption of Hyperloop, a transportation system designers once promised could move travelers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes.While Musk created the idea of Hyperloop, he tasked other entrepreneurs to design and test the concept.Earlier this month, Virgin Group, led by billionaire Richard Branson, said it was investing in startup Hyperloop One.Along with Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company, Musk also runs SolarCity, which recently helped restore power to The Children's Hospital in Puerto Rico.A tunnel created by The Boring Company.(Photo: The Boring Company) Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.Skip in

iPhone X first look: Face ID passes our quick tests and 'animojis' are addictive:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE We take a look at the iPhone X and break down the new features.USA TODAY The iPhone X lacks a home button.(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) As the first iPhone to ditch the home button, go all-in on facial recognition and, oh yeah, crack $1,000, the iPhone X has generated more palpable interest than any iPhone since the original a decade ago.What's it like?The basics: It has a beautiful edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display, a glass front and back, and a camera system that's very similar to the iPhone 8 Plus camera I favorably reviewed a few weeks ago, with the clever Portrait Lighting effects on those phones now also available for selfies on the X.Supplies are tight, but if you're able to get one, it will cost $999 with 64GB or $1,149 with 256GB.More: iPhone X first look: Intriguing, fancy and pricey More: The iPhone X is now available to pre-order, but be ready to wait More: iPhone 8 review: An excellent phone forced to the shadows by iPhone X Does Face ID actually work?Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE See how Apple's new facial recognition system works in real life.USA TODAY This is probably the number one question on peoples mindsit certainly was mineand so far Apple has passed the test with flying colors.The goal is to use Face ID to unlock the phone in lieu of a passcode.And without a home button on the X theres also no Touch ID, the method of unlocking other iPhones with a fingerprint.Apple supplied my own test unit of the X less than 24 hours ago, well short of the time that Im typically given to review an iPhone.So over time, new issues may crop up.What I found out in the first day was that setting up Apples facial recognition system is remarkably fastless than 15 seconds in my tests.You accomplish this by positioning your face in a camera frame and moving your head around in a circular fashion to show off all the angles of your face.Only one persons face can be set up to work with the phone at any one time.If you want to let someone else share your phone, you would either have to remove your face and set up theirs, or, if you trust them, let them log in with your passcode.Training the iPhone to recognize your mug in Face ID (Photo: Edward C. Baig) Inside the phones settings you can flip on a setting that requires the person trying to verify that the person whose face is being used to unlock the phone is actually paying attention to the screen.That prevents your kids, say, from attempting to unlock the phone by pointing it at your mug as you sleep.In any case, you're meant to look at the display from a distance of between 10 to 20 inches.Face ID properly recognized my face when I wore a funky hat, sunglasses or both simultaneously.It also worked in the darkApple uses infrared technology to map your face.I also tried Face ID it on a number of officemates, both men and women of various ages.It also worked with my 10-year old sons face.Samuel Baig sets up Face ID (Photo: Edward C. Baig) The most impressive test came when a fully-bearded colleague set up Face ID to recognize his face.After volunteering to shave his beard off, Face ID still properly IDd him on his next attempt to unlock the phone.Even so, Face ID is set up to detect modest changes in your face over time, so if you suddenly alter your appearance in some dramatic fashioin, you may have to enter a passcode.Face ID also lets you authenticate Apple Pay purchasesyou double-press a side button to initiate the payment feature, which I was able to successfully complete in a Dunkin Donuts.I had no way to independently verify Apples assertion that Face ID is so secure that the chance that any other person could unlock your device is 1 in 1 million, compared to one in 50,000 for the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.But one thing I was unable to do after several tries was trick the system by placing a picture or video of my face in front of the screen.No home button: mostly no problem The iPhone X lacks a home button.(Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The absence of the home button means you have to learn a few new navigational gestures, and while by no means hard, well-worn habits are tough to break.You get to your home screen on the X by swiping up, which is a breeze.Sign of progress: When I went back to my iPhone 7 Plus, I tried swiping up instead of pressing the Home button on that phone.You get to the multitasking or app switcher on the X by swiping up and pausing for a second, slightly less intuitive than before.To remove a running app, you must press down for a moment on a card representing an app until a circled red dash appears.You deep-six the app by swiping the card up.Again, not difficult, but a bit less friendly.You swipe down from the upper right for Control Center, and swipe down from the upper center or left of the screen to pull down notifications.At some point youll retrain your muscle memory so you dont have to think twice about such actions.The look and feel of the phone The glass iPhone X feels like a fancy phone the moment you pick it up, though whether it is fancy enough to justify spending a grand will be up to the beholderand your budget.The display, the largest screen ever on an iPhone despite the fact that the overall size of the X is only marginally taller than the iPhone 8, is beautiful.Except for this one thing.Though Apple has dramatically cut down on the bezels, a notch on the front of phone sticks out like a tab in a file folder.It covers the camera array at the top of the screen.Though I reckon Ill get used to it, I found the notch a bit distracting, especially when viewing a web page in widescreen mode.It is a small blemish on an otherwise stylish device.Animojis are addictive Software chief Craig Federighi demonstrating Animoji at the September iPhone event.(Photo: Apple) The very idea of creating animated emoji strikes you as kind of silly at first.Only I predict that every one of you who buys the iPhone X will quickly fool around with them and send off such Animojis to your friends.You do so inside the Messages app.Your pals need not own an iPhone to receive Animojis.(They click a video file to open it.)How do Animojis work?The camera system on the phone analyzes and mirrors more than 50 different muscle movements of your face.When you smile, your Animoji smiles.When you make an angry face, so does your Animoji.Blink and the Animoji blinks.And when you speak, your Animojis mouth moves in kind.I was able to view an Animoji I sent to a Google Pixel 2 XL, though it seemed to play worse on Android.I also noticed a few audio hiccups.Sending Animoji through the Messages app.(Photo: Edward C. Baig) Apple includes a collection of a dozen Animojis at launch, characters such as a panda, unicorn, or, yep, a pile of poo.The operative word here is fun.Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus that seem like an afterthought with the impending arrival of this flashy new handset, the X supports wireless charging through an optional third party wireless charger that supports a standard known as Qi (pronounced chee.)Only I havent had the phone long enough to evaluate battery life, or even get a sense of how quickly I could juice up the handset.Apple claims youll get two hours more battery life than the iPhone 7.I look forward to further testing the phone.So far, Apples sharp iPhone X leaves a strong first impression.Email: ebaig@usatoday.com Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter Baig is co-author of iPhone For Dummies, an independent work published by Wiley Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hpDEYp
iPhone X Face ID is not 100% reliable, critics say:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE See how Apple's new facial recognition system works in real life.USA TODAY LOS ANGELES Face ID is awesome, quick and easy.But its not as seamless as Apple promises.Initial reviews are in for the new Apple iPhone X, the first of its kind to offer facial ID unlock of the phone, and the first round of critics are finding that it usually works but not always.CNET: Face ID did recognize me most of the time but sometimes, every once in a while, it didnt, said CNETs Scott Stein.Washington Post: Face ID worked nine times out of ten, said the Washington Posts Geoffrey Fowler.It recognized me in the dark, and when I put on sunglasses but not when, in the interest of science, I put on a fake beard.Business Insider tested Face ID with a set of twins--successfully.One of the twins got through, while the other was locked out.The two siblings told me that even some of their family members can't tell them apart, yet Face ID was able to map a face accurately enough to tell the difference, wrote Business Insiders Steve Kovach.The Verge: For the Verges Nilay Patel, the issue was holding the phone too far away.Apple recommends 10 to 20 inches away, he says.Thats closer than I usually hold my phone when I pull it out of my pocket to check something, which means I have to actively think about holding the iPhone X closer to my face than every other phone Ive ever used.Toms Guide.I had no problem unlocking the iPhone X with my face in a very dim bar and even at night in bed in total darkness, but for some reason, Face ID got tripped up on an elevator, wrote Mark Spoonauer.I needed to enter my passcode to activate Face ID, even though I hadnt deactivated it.The Independent, David Phelan, Is it 100 per cent reliable?No, but its pretty close.The only times it didnt recognize me were when it was lying flat on the table and I was leaning in too close.It needs to see your eyes, nose and mouth to work.Digital Trends: It works well most of the time, but its still not as fast and reliable as Touch ID which lets you unlock your phone as you draw it out of your pocket," wrote Julian Chokkattu."In a few instances, it just wouldnt recognize our face, forcing us to use the PIN code or try again.Its also annoying that even after the iPhone X recognizes your face, you still need to swipe up from the bottom to get to the home screen it should already take you there.USA TODAY's Edward C. Baig tested FaceID in a variety of situations, wearing hats, sunglasses and in the dark."But one thing I was unable to do after several tries was trick the system by placing a picture or video of my face in front of the screen."The iPhone goes on sale in stores Friday.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zVeDLl
Waymo's self-driving cars ditch the safety driver. Here's what that's like:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE See how self-driving cars prepare for the real world inside a private testing facility owned by Google's autonomous car company, Waymo.USA TODAY A Waymo minivan outfitted with self-driving sensors brakes suddenly for a black car that has backed out of a driveway without looking.The test was conducted at Waymo's testing facility in central California.(Photo: Waymo) ATWATER, Calif.If it's possible to be blas about being driven around in a self-driving car, I'm guilty as charged.As someone covering this emerging transportation revolution, I've had a number of opportunities over the years to sit in autonomous cars as they ply either closed courses or real roads.But in every instance, a so-called safety driver has been behind the wheel.Just in case.But not this time.Waymo, the name of Google's nine-year-old self-driving car company, popped me and another reporter into a Chrysler Pacifica laden with sensors and closed the door.No one in the front two seats.And off we went.Admittedly, we were not on an open road and at risk of contending with texting teens or distracted parents.We were at Waymo's 91-acre facility called Castle, which is where a fake city doubles for the real world as engineers put software through its paces.More: We visit Google's private testing facility for self-driving cars More: Cities vie to become hubs of self-driving technology More: GM challenges Tesla, buys self-driving tech company The loop I was on took about five minutes, and included a number of planned distractions to our ride such as a broken-down vehicle, cyclists and pedestrians.In every instance, the car, not surprisingly, managed the situation with aplomb.That left me contemplating something far simpler: the future of transportation.In a sense, I was on board a preview of (presumably) things to come, one that required me to feel inherently comfortable with a large automobile driving itself while I tried to relax in back.In this controlled setting at least, that was easy to do.Whether it was the car's smooth and measured reactions to outside stimuli or the screen in front of me that showed in real time what and who was around me, the overall experience seemed disconcertingly routine.Waymo engineers are hoping to make riders feel more comfortable with using self driving cars with the addition of an array of buttons that can call for live help, ask the car to pull over and start the ride.(Photo: Waymo) Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo's vice president of engineering, said riders who may initially be fearful "flip a switch after just a few seconds in the car."You'd expect him to say that, but I'd have to second that notion.Our ride resembled an amusement park trip, in that nothing untoward happened and I was tempted to check my phone out of boredom.In Arizona, Waymo is running nearly 100 self driving minivans, which were built by Fiat Chrysler for Waymo, around Phoenix in order to test how real users interact with these machines.But in this program, there is still a safety driver behind the wheel.More: Google's self-driving cars are offering free rides More: Lyft, Waymo strike self-driving car deal as Uber rivalry intensifies That might seen reassuring, but it's not where Waymo and other tech and auto companies are heading: full autonomy.No safety driver.And likely no steering wheel or even pedals.That world will blossom if consumers trust the tech.The demo at Castle seems to suggest that Waymo software and hardware could prove to be at least as safe as a vigilant driver, and perhaps more so than a distracted one.Accidents surely will happen.Despite millions of miles of real world testing and billions of miles of simulation testing, Waymo engineers likely can't anticipate every situation.But every year more than a million people die around the world in traffic accidents, the vast majority of which are caused by human error.The machines won't always get it right, but if they can cut into those statistics they're likely worth trying.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hpL65R
Wi-Fi connection problems are the worst. Here are three ways to solve them.:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE A recently discovered vulnerability could allow attackers to intercept sensitive data being transmitted between a Wi-Fi access point and a computer or mobile device, even if that data is encrypted.Time Some new and old tricks that can help get a phone, tablet or laptop on a Wi-Fi network or at least make it less of a pain to establish that connection.(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Corrections & Clarifications: The password-free login option, Wi-Fi Protected Setup, is built into the Android operating system.Wi-Fi is great when it works but it never seems to work often enough to let any of us take it for granted.And when you cant even get a device to connect to a wireless network, its not hard to miss the days of laptops that all had Ethernet ports for wired connections that didnt require entering a password or clicking an I agree button on a Web page.But some new and old tricks can help get a phone, tablet or laptop on a Wi-Fi network or at least make it less of a pain to establish that connection.Password sharing A neat but apparently undocumented feature in Apples iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra leads that list: If you hold one Apple device running either operating system thats already on a WiFi network next to another thats not connected, the first will offer to share the wireless password with the second.Its kind of magical to see in action, and it can also spare you or a friend from having to type in lengthy passwords that iOS unhelpfully hides from view as you type.This password-sharing option can also overcome an iOS devices mysterious refusal to connect to a working network.I saw that firsthand when I used this trick to zap my home Wi-Fi password from my wifes iPhone to my suddenly uncooperative iPad that kept saying the correctly entered password was incorrect.Password free If you have a Windows computer, certain Android devices, or many wireless printers that you need to get a home Wi-Fi network, you may be able to employ a password-free login option called Wi-Fi Protected Setup.Push the WPS button on the router, then tap or push the same button on the device in question, and it should connect automatically.There are two catches to this option.One is that standard Android hides it under an Advanced heading in its Wi-Fi settings, while such third-party versions as Samsungs make it easier to find.(Google's Nexus and Pixel phones get a different wireless bonus: a Wi-Fi assistant that automatically connects to trusted networks, then encrypts the connection against potential snooping.)The other is that WPS isnt very secure, so you should turn it off on your router when you dont need it.Show password Sometimes, the problem is simply that you cant recall or dont know a password for a Wi-Fi network.In those cases, a nearby device can help: While Android and iOS wont show the password for the current network, a Mac or Windows computer can.On a Mac, open the Keychain Access app, select All items in the lefthand column, then type the networks name at the top right.(This will also work to show the password for any saved Wi-Fi network.)In Windows 10, open the Settings app, select Network & Internet, click or tap Change adapter options, select the Wi-Fi icon, click or tap View status of this connection, and, in the dialog box that will open, select the Security tab.More: 6 ways to speed up slow Wi-Fi More: One mistake people make using public Wi-Fi More: Slow Internet downloads?Look to Wi-Fi first, then blame your ISP Rob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

New artificial intelligence can detect colorectal cancer in less than a second, researchers say:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Its known that your risk of colon cancer increases as you age, but what can you do to protect yourself besides getting a colonoscopy?Luckily, the same steps that can help you prevent the disease can also help you maintain heart health.Time Japanese researchers demonstrated an artificial intelligence capable of identifying and analyzing polyps found during a colonoscopy in less than a second.The computer-assisted diagnostic system was revealed during the United European Gastroenterology Week, running through Wednesday in Barcelona.The endoscopic system uses a magnified view of a colorectal polyp to study its features and compare it with 30,000 endocytoscopic images used for machine learning.Researchers said they were able to predict the pathology of the polyp in less than a second, with 86% accuracy, based on a study assessing more than 300 polyps."The most remarkable breakthrough with this system is that artificial intelligence enables real-time optical biopsy of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy, regardless of the endoscopists skill," said Dr. Yuichi Mori, a researcher from Showa University in Yokohama, Japan, and study lead, in a statement.Mori said researchers now want to work on a broader study aimed at creating a system that can automatically detect polyps.Its value to the medical world is a key reason why supporters such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are excited about the future of artificial intelligence.During a Facebook Live chat in July, Zuckerberg discussed how AI can create safer cars and diagnose diseases earlier."Im just much more optimistic in general on this," he said.Critics of AI, most notably Tesla CEO Elon Musk, said governments should regulate how artificial intelligence is built and used to prevent potential global disasters.Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hpwW4J

Jeep Wrangler redesigned: Fiat Chrysler teases new version of SUV:::::The 2018 Jeep Wrangler Sahara.(Photo: FCA US LLC) Fiat Chrysler Automobiles teased the much-anticipated redesigned version of the Jeep Wrangler sport-utility vehicle.The 2018 model-year of the rugged SUV with an iconic place in American military lore bears a significant resemblance to the previous model.Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler released three new images of the next-generation Wrangler at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) Show late Tuesday in Las Vegas.The company released few details about the new Wrangler, saying that it would reveal comprehensive information and officially introduce the vehicle at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Nov. 29."The all-new Wranglers unique design includes an instantly recognizable keystone-shaped grille, iconic round headlamps and square tail lamps, improved aerodynamics, a convenient fold-down windshield for off-road purists, even more open-air freedom, and dozens of different door, top and windshield combinations," Fiat Chrysler said in a statement.More: Jeep tops Cars.com list of American-made vehicles, ousting Toyota More: Jeep toughens up Wrangler with Rubicon Recon More: Jeep Wrangler production could top 450,000 annually Among the changes: Fiat Chrysler is expected to offer more open-air options of the Wrangler.The vehicle will be made at the company's plant in Toledo, Ohio, a decision that came after months of uncertainty.But that move could help the vehicle retain its title on Cars.com's 2017 list of most made-in-America vehicles.The automaker is expected to build about 350,000 Wranglers annually as it shoots for a big boost in international sales.The company is also expected to make about 100,000 pickup truck versions of the Wrangler, but that model has not yet been revealed.Fiat Chrysler executive Mike Manley said in 2016 that the next-generation Wrangler would be more aerodynamic and more fuel-efficient.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY's Chris Woodyard reports from a red carpet premiere of the Independence Day sequel.Video by Kimiya Manoochehri Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hu9V0i

Time change: Goodbye daylight saving, hello standard:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Researchers found setting the clock back for winter led to a spike in depression for some people.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Daylight saving time ends on Sunday, meaning it's time to fall back.(Photo: Leslie Smith, USA TODAY) Sick of dark mornings on your way to school or work?It's your time to rise and shine.Just like pumpkin spice, falling leaves and football, another rite of autumn is upon us: The end of daylight saving time, which will occur at 2 a.m. Sunday Nov. 5.At that moment (or the night before), the few analog clocks still around need to "fall back" an hour, turning 1:59:59 a.m. into 1 a.m.Since most of our computers, phones and DVRs do it automatically, it's not as much of a chore as it used to be.Starting Sunday, that one hour of daylight is switched from evening to morning as standard time begins.Credit or blame for the biannual shift goes back to Benjamin Franklin, who published An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost of Light in a 1784 journal after he noticed that people burned candles at night but slept past dawn.But he never saw his plan put into action.The U.S. first implemented daylight saving during World War I as a way to conserve fuel with the Standard Time Act of 1918, also known as the Calder Act.In World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented a year-round daylight saving time that was commonly known as "War Time."In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Uniform Time Act into law.Under the act, states and territories can opt out of daylight saving.It isn't observed in Arizona (except the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, according to the Congressional Research Service.Daylight saving is observed in approximately 70 countries, including most of those in North America and Europe.We don't go back to daylight saving until Sunday, March 11, 2018, about a week before spring begins.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zVi2ty
Russian fake accounts showed posts to 126 million Facebook users:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Lawyers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google started two days of hearings on how Russia allegedly used their services to try to sway the 2016 U.S. elections.Fred Katayama reports.Video provided by Reuters Newslook Facebook is trying to crack down on fake news.North Andover, Mass., June 19, 2017.(Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) SAN FRANCISCO As many as 126 million people or one-third the U.S. population may have seen material posted by a Russian troll farm under fake Facebook identities between 2015 and 2017, according to testimony presented by Facebook's general counsel at a hearing before the Senate on Tuesday.The figure is the largest yet of the possible reach Russian operatives had on the giant social platformin the run-up to last year's presidential election and afterwards and reflects Facebook's new disclosures that a Kremlin-linked misinformation agency used original content in users' feeds, as well as paid ads.Previously Facebook said 10 million people saw Russia-linked advertising that sought to sway U.S. voters.More: Facebook: 10 million people saw Russia-backed election ads The figures come as Capitol Hill readies itself for two more hearings on the ways Russia used social media to influence the U.S. 2016 election, scheduled to take place on Wednesday.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Facebook, Twitter and Google are set to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing to help find solutions to Russian disinformation.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Social media companies are under pressure to respond to demands by lawmakers that they follow the same regulations on political ads as advertisers in newspapers and on radio and television currently do, including disclosures about who paid for the ads and bans on foreign entities running election-related ads.Facebook, Google and Twitter have all said they would begin doing so, though lawmakers have pushed for additional concessions.More: Facebook makes political ads more transparent ahead of Russia hearings Twitter, which originally said it found 201 accounts linked to Russia that were sending out automated, election-related content, also increased its estimates of the reach these operatives had on its platform.It has now found 36,746 such accounts, according to testimony to be presented by the companys acting general counsel Sean Edgett.In a blog post Monday about its testimony for Tuesday, Google reported that it had found 18 YouTube channels it believes were associated with the campaign.The companies' testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism shows that Russian attempts to influence U.S. voters by using the power of social media platforms and an understanding of hot-button social issues was much broader than originally thought..The goal, said Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, was "to try to sow division and discord and to try to undermine our election process."The Russia propaganda machine used a mix of ads and original posts.Facebook says an estimated 11.4 million people in the United States saw at least one ad that was paid for by the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency between Jan. 2015 and August 2017.More: House Intel leaders to release Facebook ads purchased by Kremlin-linked groups But the number of U.S. residents who saw ads was dwarfed by the estimated 29 million people who got content the firm generated and shared in their Facebook News Feeds.And because people frequently share, like and forward material, Facebook estimates that approximately 126 million people might have seen this divisive material during the two years in which the group was using Facebook to place ads and distribute postings."Many of the ads and posts we've seen so far are deeply disturbing seemingly intended to amplify societal divisions and pit groups of people against each other.They would be controversial even if they came from authentic accounts in the United States.But coming from foreign actors using fake accounts they are simply unacceptable," Stretch's testimony said.Ads focused on issues across the ideological spectrum, "from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights," Stretch said.The Internet Research Agency is a St. Petersburg-based organization that posts Russia-government approved propaganda online, under fake identities, according to U.S. intelligence officials.The postings were still only a small portion of the material that Facebook users see every day, he cautioned, equal to about 0.004% or one in 23,000 pieces of Facebook content that users see in their News Feeds.Twitter says the Russia-related accounts sent approximately 1.4 million automated, election-related Tweets, which were seen by approximately 288 million Twitter users.Edgett emphasized these were just 0.012% of the total accounts on Twitter at the time and that the tweets sent by these Russian-linked automated accounts constituted less than 0.74% of all election-related Tweets.Google found two accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency which spent a total of $4,700 on its platforms during the 2016 election cycle, it said in a blog post Monday.The company also found 18 YouTube channels it believes were associated with the campaign.These channels uploaded political videos that represented 43 hours of content.They got 309,000 U.S. views from June 2015 to November 2016.The company noted that a single user might have viewed one video multiple times so its likely fewer people actually saw them.It also found evidence that Gmail accounts associated with the campaign were used to open accounts on other platforms and has shared information about those accounts with the other platforms.Facebook also revealed that in the late summer it began to see fake personas being created on the platform by a group linked to a Russian hacking group that has been publicly linked to Russian military intelligence services.Those fake personas were being used to "seed stolen information to journalists" and were organized under the banner of a group that called itself DC Leaks, according to the Facebook testimony.The stolen information included information and files stolen by hacking into the email accounts of former White House chief of staff John Podesta's and the Democratic National Committee.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2homdaE
Waymo shows off the secret facility where it trains self-driving cars:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE See how self-driving cars prepare for the real world inside a private testing facility owned by Google's autonomous car company, Waymo.USA TODAY A Waymo self driving minivan stops for a cyclist at the company's private test facility in central California.(Photo: Waymo) ATWATER, Calif.If Googles self-driving cars have a school, this is it.Stretched across 91 arid acres here in the central part of the state is Castle, the name derived from a former air base that is now a private testing facility owned by Waymo, the autonomous car company run by search giant Google.For the past five years, engineers and test drivers have been running dozens of cars through their paces in order to better prepare them for real-world scenarios of rude drivers and clumsy movers.For Waymo workers toiling in secrecy under a hot sun, the first-ever arrival Monday of a gaggle of reporters was a bit of a coming-out party and a chance to remind rivals and potential partners of the company's continued progress.Ive been out here for five years testing and testing, said Stephanie Villegas, head of structured testing, during a demonstration that showed how a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan would yield to an aggressive driver.Its so fun to finally show this off.More: What's it like to have a ghost drive your machine?If youre ready to hail a Waymo car tomorrow, hold on.What senior Waymo executives showed off was their cars impeccable road manners on a closed course, including driverless rides in a Pacifica whose steering wheel seemed possessed as it wound effortlessly through Castles faux city.But when it came to offering concrete updates and timelines on when self-driving Waymo cars will be available to the general public, the answer was a repeated mantra: too early to tell.This has the potential to be transformative technology, said CEO John Krafcik, outlining four specific business cases for Waymos autonomous tech: ride sharing, trucking, urban last-mile solutions and passenger cars.Krafcik politely batted away as premature questions about which of these four industries Waymo would push into first, when self-driving cars will finally roll out to the general public and whether such vehicles might be branded Waymo or not.A Waymo minivan outfitted with self-driving sensors brakes suddenly for a black car that has backed out of a driveway without looking.The test was conducted at Waymo's testing facility in central California.(Photo: Waymo) Although there were no announcements or reveals that often justify transporting 50 reporters three hours south east of San Francisco, the visit to a private facility did present an opportunity to put a spotlight on Waymo's evolving self-driving car tech as a growing number of large companies and small startups push into the space.That glimpse also comes in lieu of access to the company's ongoing program in Phoenix, where an undisclosed number of area residents are using 100 self-driving Pacificas for daily chores.The Arizona Early Ride Program experiment is designed to help Waymos engineers gather more driving data critical to reassuring what many polls indicate is a nervous public about autonomous vehicles.But the company has released no details about how that program is going, and what sorts of issues the minivans are facing in real traffic."Whats important is that we are going for fully autonomous driving that can pick you up wherever you are and take you where you need to go," Krafcik said.Rivals have the same aim.Those include big automakers such as Ford and Mercedes-Benz, as well as upstarts such as Faraday Future and NIO.So far, there's a lot of smoke in the autonomous car space, but it's hard to spot the fire.Development may indeed take more time considering the myriad road scenarios such cars need to train for, let alone the often difficult weather conditions in some parts of the country.Although Waymo has remained largely mum about the Early Rider Program, Juliet Rothenberg, head of user experience, said early results show that riders have had some issues getting picked up at the requested location.Sometimes theyll see the car but itll be going to a location nearby where they were, so were working on finding a way for the car to identify the person and stop when they see them, she said.More: No driver anywhere: Here's what it's like to have a ghost drive your car More: Google's self-driving cars are offering free rides More: Are states ready for self-driving cars?Since Arizona weather is easy for self-driving cars to contend with, Waymo just announced it would begin winter testing in Michigan.Although Waymos ongoing lawsuit against Uber was not discussed by the assembled executives, its presence loomed.A trial, already postponed once, is now slated for December, and pits the once highflying ride sharing startup that had rushed into the self-driving space against a 9-year veteran of autonomous tech.Waymo engineers are hoping to make riders feel more comfortable with using self driving cars with the addition of an array of buttons that can call for live help, ask the car to pull over and start the ride.(Photo: Waymo) Waymo contends that Ubers light detection and ranging sensors (LiDAR) are based on proprietary technology stolen by former Google employee Anthony Levandowski and turned over to Uber when the company bought Levandowskis self-driving truck startup, Otto.Levandowski has since left Uber, whose CEO Travis Kalanick resigned in the wake of a firestorm centered on the company's culture and business dealings.Uber maintains that its self-driving cars do not use Waymo tech.'Pull over' Located not far from an airport, Castle features a few dorm-like low-rises, large warehouses and rutted streets that have been supplemented by newly paved roads, highways and cul-de-sacs designed to help facilitate testing.At Villegas testing station, three demonstrations showcased how engineers repeatedly run Waymo Pacificas through a scenario to ensure that the car reacts properly.One involved an aggressive driver merging into the path of the Pacifica.Another involved a car suddenly pulling out of a driveway.And the last featured workers posing as movers who spill boxes into the road.In each case, the driverless car reacted promptly and defensively, causing some to wonder if the Pacificas were capable of honking in frustration.They can be programmed to do that, said Villegas, though it was clear Waymo engineers hadnt gone for that option.In another part of the facility, reporters were escorted into the backseat of a waiting Pacifica, which then toured the facility with no humans in the front seats.Along the way, human-driven cars, cyclists and pedestrians were sent out to give the autonomous cars pause, but none in this controlled experiment gave the minivans a fit.Perhaps more interesting were the developments made inside the Pacificas designed to make riders feel more at ease.The additions to the interior include an array of buttons in a panel attached to the headliner just behind the front row reading Help, Lock, Pull Over and Start Ride.The first summoned a live operator, though it wasnt disclosed whether this remote human had much power over the self-driving car.Pull Over would command the vehicle to do just that at the nearest possible location.Another gesture toward reassurance were the two TV screens attached to the front seat headrests.Instead of playing movies, they show a live map of the car along with stylized representations of others cars, people and even individual traffic cones.Riders in the back seat of a Waymo driverless minivan can see the route being taken by their car as well as related traffic and pedestrians on a headrest mounted screen.(Photo: Waymo) The coming transition from being a driver to only being a passenger is going to require new customs and norms, and thats what were experimenting with now, said Rothenberg.Ultimately, Waymo execs remain convinced that with top notch software and the right in-car touches, human adoption of machine chauffeurs will prove inevitable.During a Q and A with reporters, Krafcik put a positive spin on what remains an exciting if untested revolution in transportation, one that will require buy-in from regulators, municipalities and humans before it takes off.Some surveys say half the respondents are uncomfortable with the idea of self driving cars, he said.We say, wow, that means half are already comfortable with it.Thats a very reasonable starting place.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zSQDZb
The most popular kitchen tool of 2017 is on sale on Amazon right now:::::The most popular kitchen tool of 2017 is on sale on Amazon right now (Photo: Instant Pot) Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue.However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAYs newsroom and any business incentives.Using a pressure cooker can sound really intimidating if you've never tried it.But believe me when I tell you once you make your first meal in an Instant Pot, you'll never want to stop.The best pressure cooker at a great price The Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1 is the best-selling pressure cooker on Amazon and for good reason.It's easy to use and doesn't go overboard with techy bells and whistles, but still gives you lots of ways to customize how you cook.And right now, it's $15 off the regular $99.95 price.There are others that are more affordable, but they lack the preset cooking options and fine-tuning abilities, and others with more features, but learning to use them properly can be annoying and stressful.The DUO60 7-in-1 is the perfect balance.How I went from skeptical to obsessed with my Instant Pot When I first got my Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1, I was really wary of figuring out a machine so foreign to me.I didn't have one growing up, and none of my relatives or my friends' families did either.I thought I'd try it once and go back to my pots and pans...But, it was a gift, and I wanted to see why it was so popular, so I found a few recipes I thought sounded tasty (and easy) and tried them out.I expected the result to be underwhelming (and undercooked), but I was able to make a full meal in no time, didn't have to spend the whole time hovering over the stove, and only had one pot to toss in the dishwasher when I was done.I was in loveno, I was obsessed.An easy way to make the experience even better With the $15 you'll save, I highly recommend investing in a tempered glass lid ($14.99) made to fit your new Instant Pot.It's a lot easier to use than the pressure lid when you're keeping your meal warm so you can have a second helping, and it's great for simmering soups and stews.Prices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2z28BcH

5 reasons the new Apple TV is worth your money:::::A year ago Apple released a highly anticipated update to the Apple TV.It brought big changes, but many were disappointed with the lack of 4K video outputespecially with the Apple TV costing far more than similar boxes from Roku and Amazon.This year Apple is back with a faster, 4K-ready Apple TV.But 4K output isnt the only thing that makes the new Apple TV 4K a worthwhile investment.Here are our top five reasons to upgrade to the new Apple TV 4K.Credit: Reviewed.com / TJ Donegan The 4K Apple TV is the complete package, but the high price is only worth it if you need its exclusive features.1.4K HDR Video The most obvious advantage of getting the new Apple TV 4K is the ability to play back 4K and HDR (aka High Dynamic Range) video.Youve probably heard of HD (720p), and Full HD (1080p).4K is the next level (2160p) and is all about the pixel count; more pixels means you get a sharper image with more detail.Just about every new, name-brand TV above $400 offers 4K resolution.On top of that, most of these also support High Dynamic Range (aka HDR) content.In a nutshell, HDR movies and TV shows are brighter and more colorful than standard ones that youre watching now.Personally, I was pretty skeptical of the difference between Full HD and 4K HDR.That is, until I got the new Apple TV 4K.The difference is incredible.The colors are so vivid you think youre there.Credit: Reviewed.com / TJ Donegan Apple TV is one of the few streaming boxes that supports Dolby Vision HDR.2.Your iTunes Library Gets a Free Upgrade Yep, you are hearing me right.Remember when TVs switched from DVD to Blu-ray and you had to buy all your movies a second time?Well, Apple is making it easy if you bought movies through iTunes, upgrading many existing movie purchases to 4K for free.Disney was surprisingly the only major studio that has not yet conceded to upgrade their movies (Apple claims it is working on this).Apple has also negotiated so that 4K films won't cost more to rent through iTunes than HD versions, making it one of the cheapest places to rent new movies as well.Wonder Woman, for example, costs just $9.99 to own in 4K and $5.99 to rent right now.3.Dolby Vision now, Dolby Atmos coming soon Hang with me here, but there are two competing standards for HDR: HDR10 and Dolby Vision.The technical differences arent that important, but many picture quality purists believe Dolby Vision is the better of the two.All HDR-compatible TVs support HDR10 (since its an open standard), but if you are paying for a Dolby Vision-compatible TV (like LGs OLEDs) then you want Dolby Vision support from your streaming box.The 4K Apple TV has it.On the audio side, the counterpart to Dolby Vision is Dolby Atmos.Dolby Atmos offers surround sound that is far beyond anything else on the market.Again, if youre splashing out for a sound system with Dolby Atmos, you want a box that supports it.The Apple TV has the hardware to support it now and Apple says Dolby Atmos support will be added via a software update in the future.4.All your streaming options in one place If you use Netflix, Amazon Prime Video (soon to be on Apple TV), or Vudu then you already have access to some 4K movies (depending on your subscription).Like other streaming boxes, the Apple TV brings all of these platforms together in one place.That's the easy part.Where the Apple TV sets itself apart is the new TV app, which can bring multiple streaming services into one app, which also keeps track of your progress across all your Apple devices.This helps wrangle all those various streaming services like Hulu, Showtime, HBO Now, ESPN, NBC Sports, ABC, CBS All Access, and more into one place, so you aren't searching through 10 different apps when you want to find something to watch.There are still some headaches, though.Netflix shows aren't pulled into the TV app, Amazon Prime is a no-show for the time being, and the Apple TV doesn't support Youtube's 4K codec, so those videos are 1080p only.Credit: Reviewed.com / TJ Donegan The Apple TV's remote hasn't changed much, with the Menu button getting a white ring to make it more visible.5.The Menu Button This might sound small and silly, but the menu button now has a white plastic ring around it and it has made my life so much easier.When you are picking up the controller in the dark you can see the ring and it's easier to tell which way the remote is pointing.In fact, the entire remote has gotten a nice upgrade over the earliest Apple TVs.If you're still using an early-generation model, the new Apple TV will feel far more usable.Voice searching with Siri is simple and intuitive, and can even be used to enter passwordsa huge timesaver.Other Things to Know: You don't need a 4K TV to use the new 4K Apple TV.You just hook it up via HDMI cable and it will output whatever your TVs max resolution is.That said, you will need to buy a 4K and HDR-ready HDMI Cable (aka HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2) to connect it to a 4K TV.You don't need a 4K TV to use the new 4K Apple TV.HDMI 2.0 cables look physically identical to older HDMI cables, but older cables can't carry 4K/HDR signals.Weve put together a roundup of the best HDMI cables out there to help you pick one.If you don't have a 4K TV yet and you aren't planning on upgrading for a few years, then we recommend trying the 2017 Roku Streaming Stick.It's our preferred solution for people using older HD TVs and it costs less than $50.
Climate change's impact on human health is already here — and is 'potentially irreversible,' report says:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The U.S. federal government should adopt a strategy to manage climate change risks, as their cost to the government may rise as much as $35 billion per year by mid-century, a congressional watchdog office report released on Monday said.Time Indian boys on their way to play cricket walk through a dried patch of Chandola Lake in Ahmadabad, on May 14, 2016.(Photo: Ajit Solanki, AP) Climate change is already having an extraordinary impact on human health worldwide affecting the spread of infectious diseases, exposing millions to air pollution and heat waves and dramatically reducing labor productivity, according to a report released Monday."The human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible," the report by the British medical journal The Lancet says, and the situation is so serious that significant gains by modern medicine and technology are being undercut."The delayed response to climate change over the past 25 years has jeopardized human life and livelihoods," the report says.While most previous similar studies have covered the potential impact of climate change on future public health problems, the Lancet report goes a step further and illustrates how it is no longer a future threat but a present one.The direct effects of climate change "result from rising temperatures and changes in the frequency and strength of storms, floods, droughts and heat waves with physical and mental health consequences," it says.For example, from 2000 to 2016, there has been a 46% increase in the number of weather-related disasters, the report notes.Some of the findings of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change report: Warming is exacerbating the spread of Dengue fever, the worlds most rapidly expanding disease.In fact, two types of mosquitoes ability to spread Dengue globally has increased by 9.4% and 11.1% since the 1950s.An additional 125 million people around the world were exposed to heat waves each year from 2000 to 2016 (as compared with 1986-2008), and a record 175 million people were exposed to heat waves in 2015.Rising temperatures have led to a 5.3% fall in labor productivity in the planet's rural areas since 2000, with a dramatic drop of 2% from 2015 to 2016.In 2016, this effectively took more than 920,000 people out of the global workforce.Global exposure to dangerous levels of air pollution has increased by 11.2% since 1990.Climate change is also worsening allergies in the United States.For example, Americans faced significantly longer exposure to ragweed pollen in 2016 compared with 1990.Cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming is necessary for public health, the report says.Reductions have already begun to occur across major economies, driven by the expansion of renewable energy and the phasing out of coal.Curbing emissions could have immediate and substantial health benefits, the report says, such as cleaner air in previously polluted cities.Preventing illnesses and injuries is more humane, more effective and more economical than treating people once theyve become sick," said Howard Frumkin of the University of Washington School of Public Health, one of the study authors."Thats plain common sense," he added."What this report makes clear is that fighting climate change is disease prevention.Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change, said the Lancet Countdowns report lays bare the impact that climate change is having on our health today.It also shows that tackling climate change directly, unequivocally and immediately improves global health.Its as simple as that."Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hpQea2

Gas prices: Why you'll keep paying less at the pump this year:::::Gas prices: Why you'll keep paying less at the pump this year Adam Shell | USA TODAY Youll probably keep paying less for gasoline despite new tensions in the Middle East driving up the price of oil.American drivers have paid lower prices at the pump for five straight weeks, and the cost of filling up could soon slide back to levels last seen before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.The fall is due to a combination of things, including peak driving season winding down and U.S. refining returning to normal after storm-related disruptions, analysts say.Prices at the pump spiked temporarily as a result of disruptions to Texas oil refineries caused by Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on Aug. 25.But in the week ending Sunday, a gallon of regular gas cost $2.456, down more than 8% from the post-hurricane high of $2.673 on Sept. 7, according to GasBuddy.com.The trend of lower gas prices is expected to continue, despite an increase of around 2 cents Monday to $2.478 amid fears of supply disruptions after Iraqi forces tried to seize oil fields in the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq.The assault aims to prevent Kurdish efforts to create an independent state in that part of the country.More: Hurricane Irma gas shortages could worsen as drivers return to Florida homes More: Nation's emergency oil stockpile tapped to try to limit gas price boosts More: The nation's largest oil refinery shuts down as Hurricane Harvey floods Texas The Iraq-Kurd confrontation pushed up the cost of a barrel of Brent crude, a benchmark for global oil prices, by 65 cents, or 1.1%, Monday to $57.82 per barrel.U.S.-produced crude, which has been on an upswing since falling into a low-$40 per barrel range in June, also inched higher.It rose 42 cents per barrel, or about 0.8%, to $51.87.Prices were off their highs for the day.The limited effect of events in the Middle East on U.S. gas prices is due to reports that suggest oil was flowing normally in the Kirkuk area, analysts said."We haven't really seen any impact to global supply," says Jeanette Casselano, a spokesperson at AAA, adding that oil analysts will monitor the situation for any signs of market disruption.The pain at the pump caused by Hurricane Harvey, which knocked out more than 25% of refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, was short-lived.And there's a good chance gas prices will fall back to where they were before the Category 4 storm caused major industry outages, says Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com."Gas prices are now slowly meandering to the downside," DeHaan says.Here's why gas prices are seen falling further as the year winds down: * Refiners recover.U.S. refineries that turn crude oil into gasoline are back on line after storm-related outages.The supply disruptions that caused the average nationwide price of a gallon of regular gas to jump nearly 14% from $2.355 on the day Harvey made landfall to the post-storm peak of $2.673 on Sept. 7 have subsided."Right now, business is pretty much back to normal," DeHaan says.* Travel fades.After Labor Day, falling leaves and coming winter mark the end of the peak U.S. driving season.And less demand for gas means lower prices.It's not unusual to see gas prices dip 10 cents to 15 cents a gallon in the final months of the year, says AAA's Casselano."When summer ends we normally see a sharp decline," she says.* Plenty of supply.The world is still awash in oil, and until that overcapacity is taken out of the system, drivers will benefit from lower prices at the pump.There are a few wildcards, however, that could affect the direction of gas prices in the months ahead, says GasBuddy's DeHaan.Oil investors are watching to see if OPEC opts to extend its production cuts to keep a lid on supply and prop up prices.Analysts will also be watching to see if strife in the Middle East, including the latest Iraq conflict with the Kurds, changes global crude supplies in any meaningful way."If anything were to change, then you will start to see the market react," DeHaan says.

Colorado taking steps to get its own hyperloop:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The Colorado Department of Transportation has partnered with Hyperloop One to study the possibility of a Hyperloop route in Colorado.Courtesy of the Colorado Department of Transportation In August 2017, tests of a hyperloop prototype in the desert near North Las Vegas, Nev., accelerated a pod to almost 200 mph.The Colorado Department of Transportation and Virgin Hyperloop One are studying the feasibility of a route in Colorado.(Photo: Courtesy of Virgin Hyperloop One) FORT COLLINS, Colo. Colorado transportation officials are looking at possibility of a Rocky Mountain hyperloop to curb traffic woes.Elon Musk's idea of a levitating transit pod that can reach speeds of 700 mph sounds as far-fetched as flying cars.You could travel from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, a distance of about 125 miles with Denver in the middle, in less than 20 minutes.Denver International Airport?Those speeds, it would take less than 10 minutes to travel the 55 miles as the crow flies.After partnering with Virgin Hyperloop One, one of the companies racing to develop the super-speed technology that essentially would transport vehicles and people pods on electric skates in a big pneumatic tube, Colorado Department of Transportation officials plan to spend the next nine months crunching the numbers to determine what it might take to bring this type of transit to Colorado.Oct. 20: This state appears poised to let Elon Musk dig 'hyperloop' tunnels Oct. 12: Richard Branson investing in Hyperloop One Aug. 14: Can Tesla's Elon Musk revolutionize tunneling?Above-ground routes are cheaper to build.But Musk's Boring Co., another company testing the technology, has been focusing on hyperloop transportation in tunnels.Electricity moves hyperloop pods forward and gradually accelerates them through a low-pressure tube.Magnetic forces lift the pods above a railroad-like track, where they glide at speeds similar to airplanes because the friction and wind resistance inside the tube are less than on a train or subway.We cannot build our way out of congestion, and thats why were looking so widely at technology.Amy Ford, Colorado Department of Transportation The proposed Rocky Mountain hyperloop would be centered at Denver International Airport and stretch about 100 miles north to Cheyenne, Wyo.; about 125 miles south to Pueblo, Colo.; and about 100 miles west to Vail, Colo.It carries a hefty $24 billion price tag.State transportation officials estimated it would need an initial investment of $3 billion just to get the first 40 miles from the airport north to Greeley, Colo., completed.This steep financial cost combined with lingering questions about how the technology would function in the real world have left Colorado transportation officials; Virgin Hyperloop One; and their partner, engineering firm Los Angeles-based AECOM (ACM) with a lot of homework before this futuristic fantasy could become reality here.Why a hyperloop?State officials estimate Colorado's population will grow by nearly 50% in the next 20 years.That has left transportation experts scrambling for solutions to address the added pressure to interstates and highways already groaning.Aug. 3: This machine could help Musk whisk you from N.Y. to D.C. in 29 minutes Aug. 2: Hyperloop One pod hits 192 mph in test Moving people rapidly from one place to the next has implications of radically changing how we think about land use, and where people live, and where they work, and how they get between that, state transportation spokeswoman Amy Ford said.Here, about half of working adults drove to jobs in other communities in 2014, according to to the U.S. Census Bureau,.That number was even higher in other cities, such as Loveland, where nearly two-thirds of employed residents had jobs outside of city limits.We cannot build our way out of congestion, and thats why were looking so widely at technology, Ford said.July 21: Hyperloop race gets crowded with new entrant Arrivo and maybe Musk July 20: Elon Musk says he got 'verbal' OK for 29-minute NYC-to-D.C. hyperloop In its proposal to Virgin Hyperloop One, Colorado officials argued that the technology could give a tremendous boost to the state's economy by connecting its industry clusters and workforce.The proposal also estimated that a hyperloop's operation in Colorado would augment the Front Range's gross regional product the market value for all of its goods and services by 7% by 2040.The Colorado Department of Transportation plans to widen the 70 miles of Interstate 25 from Wellington, Colo., to Denver, but that project is slated to be completed in increments with full completion not in sight until 2075.David May, president of the Fort Collins Area Chamber of Commerce, emphasized the importance of not counting on a hyperloop to solve transportation problems.April 30: This is what's in Elon Musk's brain right now April 6: Hyperloop in your backyard?Depends who wins this contest We still need to work within the current transportation technology paradigm, he wrote in an email.That means putting money into widening I-25 and other state transportation projects.Its OK to dream about El Dorado as long as you continue to invest in Realville.But with a hyperloop, Colorado transportation officials see a chance to ease congestion on busy roads and ease the burden of lengthy commutes.Its OK to dream about El Dorado as long as you continue to invest in Realville (roads).David May, Fort Collins (Colo.) Area Chamber of Commerce The traffic congestion, tolls, and transit options within the Denver metropolitan area would no longer be the constraining factor in peoples decisions about where to live and work, they argued in their Rocky Mountain hyperloop proposal.The hyperloop option would make it faster to commute from Colorado Springs or Fort Collins to the DEN Aerotropolis than it would take 80% of the residents of the Denver metropolitan area to reach the airport using existing modes.Although Virgin Hyperloop One, known as Hyperloop One before getting an undisclosed cash infusion earlier this month from Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, has outlined an aggressive timeline for construction it says it wants to have three operating hyperloop systems by 2021 a Colorado route still has potential roadblocks.The biggest is money.No one seems quite sure who would foot the $24 billion price tag.Weve long said we dont intend to be the main pockets for this, Ford said, about the state's transportation budget.How a Colorado hyperloop would be financed could shift its purpose, at least at first.If a private investor paid for the bulk of the project, that could create a bigger incentive to use the system to transport cargo rather than people.March 27: Four of the wildest ideas from Tesla's Elon Musk Jan. 28: Elon Musk-inspired hyperloopers battle in L.A. Ford said she hoped that eventually the system could be used to move both people and goods.The feasibility study that Colorado officials are working on in partnership with AECOM and Virgin Hyperloop One will explore how that could happen.That study is set for completion next summer.AECOM's vice president of transportation, Alan Eckman, said the technology has potential to function in both capacities though he thinks transporting cargo via a hyperloop would be a good start.Jan. 28: Ex-Hyperloop cofounder BamBrogan starts 'Arrivo' Dec. 18: Next big thing from Elon Musk?It could be 'boring' Cargo certainly seems like a more simple way to look at how you could test it, but I think it would be a very fast transition, he said.I dont think it has to be years of operation before you could transition it.Agencies looking at the feasibility of a Colorado hyperloop also are studying what regulatory hurdles they would need to clear before sending hyperloop pods zooming across the state.The Colorado Department of Transportation is focusing much of its efforts in the feasibility study on determining what would need to happen for the technology to gain approval from the federal government.October 2016: Hyperloop One lands ex-Uber CFO, $50M in funding July 2016: Bizarre lawsuit could derail Elon Musks hyperloop The study would need to look at how the different jurisdictions and states in a possible hyperloop would interact with each other and establish consistent requirements for the route, Eckman said.Because no hyperloop is reality yet Virgin Hyperloop One does have a test track in North Las Vegas, Nev., where it set an almost 200 mph speed record in August some of the most basic logistical questions still haven't been answered.The experts still don't know how often hyperloop pods would need to stop at stations along the route or whether passengers would need to go through airport-style security lines before boarding.Hyperloop One's test pod hit nearly 200 mph in August 2017 in the Nevada desert.(Photo: Hyperloop One) "Those basic operational questions would need to be at least addressed in the first feasibility study," Eckman said.In its proposal to Virgin Hyperloop One, Colorado officials acknowledged that building a hyperloop route in phases, starting with stops that would benefit from the high-speed travel and present fewer logistical barriers to construction, would make sense.The proposed first leg would run 40 miles from Greeley to Denver International Airport, linking the home of the University of Northern Colorado, a renewable energy cluster and one of the nation's largest beef exporters to other Colorado transportation hubs.Greeley Mayor Tom Norton said he is interested in the prospect of a hyperloop is waiting for more information about how financing the project would work.Even though Greeley and surrounding Weld County are approaching 300,000 residents, that isn't enough of a population center to carry the technology forward, he said.Instead, a hyperloop would need to be accessible to all of Northern Colorado."Let's find out what the reality of this is," Norton said."You never know what technology will do....It could change your world, so being involved with it is important."July 2016: Hyperloop One co-founder BamBrogan leaves company July 2016: Hyperloop One countersues tech lead BamBrogan The Greeley route could be built faster than other hyperloop options because it would run above ground along more undeveloped plots of land, meaning it would have fewer right-of-way issues, Ford said.The route also would include a stop on Interstate 76, where rail station connects Colorado to Nebraska.That could prove valuable if hyperloop is used for cargo.June 2016: Hyperloop may be a transportation leap too far June 2016: Hyperloop One unveils Russia deal with goal of new Silk Road Colorado's feasibility study will look closely at the Greeley route but is more broadly focused on the Front Range urban corridor, just east of the mountains, and what might make sense for that part of the state, Ford said.If this is a 100-step process.Were probably on step 5, she said.Were defining it, creating parameters under which this could move.Thats the important piece."Follow Alicia Stice on Twitter: @AliciaStice More on the hyperloop concept May 2016: 0 to 400 mph in mere seconds: Welcome to the age of hyperloop May 2016: Hyperloop competitor aims to solve urban commute May 2016: Hyperloop company gets new name, $80M and global partners May 2016: L.A. to S.F.in 30 min: the hyperloop wars are on January 2016: The hyperloop is being built, and we have the photos to prove it June 2015: Elon Musk's SpaceX creates Hyperloop contest December 2014: Elon Musk's 'hyperloop' idea could work, report says Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ho8vo8
7 steps for crafting the perfect password:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Kim Komando tells you what to do, and what old advice to ignore, about creating passwords that will thwart hackers.The man who said use capital letters, special characters and numbers in your password is now taking back that advice.(Photo: hanieriani, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Your password can ruin your life.I know that sounds dramatic, but its true.If someone figures out the password to your email, youre in trouble.Social media?Even worse.Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.It seems not a week goes by that we dont hear about another data breach.How do you know if the hackers have your info?Find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords.We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&.This theory reigned for yearsthat passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember.It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters, and symbols.The organizations manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years.But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasnt nearly as effective as hed thought.Thanks to a new round of research, cyber-security experts have changed their tune.Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like p@ssword1 or letmein.But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.More: Password expert says he was wrong: Numbers, capital letters and symbols are useless 1.Passwords should withstand 100 guesses This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldnt be tied to any public information about you or your family.Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, and a little data goes a long way, such as your birthday and the name of your pet.Experts believe that criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73% of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations on the same password.Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family.Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online.These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches.Here are five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.More Kim Komando: How to stop ads from following you online 2.Use a phrase Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a passphrase.These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuschia.You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your Mom knows such trivia about you.You could compose a passphrase like ilikefuschiaastronauts.Youll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.I actually recommended and told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago.The advice is still valid.Go here to come up with your own.3.Go long You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters in length.As if that isnt weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words.While many people just try to meet the bare minimum requirement of using eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you.You could list all your pets names from childhood, like fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie, or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant, like academy main washington ohio central.Easy to remember.Hard to crack.More: If you're going to use your pet's name as a password, it better be good 4.Dont change your password until you have to Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months.But as NISTs Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Expiration isnt a motivator to create a brand new password, its motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.If youve created a strong password, then dont worry about changing it out all the time.Just stick with it unless youve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.More Komando: How to create passwords that are easy to remember 5.Choose something memorable Remember, each password should be unique, but they dont have to be cumbersome.The NIST calls passwords memorized secrets.You want to avoid the temptation to write down passwords, so pick a password that has enough meaning to you to stay in your mind.Im not a big fan of password managers.I commit my passwords to memory.But if you cannot do that, heres a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.6.Get creative with characters It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions.Go back to Burrs advice on passphrases.You might choose something like ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!or Igivemyjob1000%everyday.Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.7.Use two-factor identification While passwords help protect your information, cyber-criminals are more sophisticated than ever.If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until its too late.Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and its hard to assess how much information has been leaked, nor how it will be used.If you havent checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cyber crooks, do it now.Thats why two-factor identification is so important.Using text-messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, entered on a new device, or at a new location.You will have to verify that its you attempting to gain access.How do you do this?Ill walk you through just a few steps to set it up.What questions do you have?Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio

YouTuber claims Apple fired dad over iPhone X video:::::An engineer who helped work on the iPhone X was reportedly fired by Apple after his daughter posted a YouTube video showing off the smartphone before launch.Last week, YouTube user Brooke Amelia Peterson posted a video which included a trip to Apple's campus in Cupertino, Calif., where she said her father worked as a radio frequency engineer.During the video, Peterson is shown holding the iPhone X and demonstrating use of the touchscreen and other videos.In a subsequent video published Sunday, Peterson said she removed the video at Apple's request."I have no idea how my video got so much attention considering how many other iPhone x videos there are out there from other Youtubers," said Peterson.Because of the video, Peterson claims Apple fired her father.In a tearful response, Peterson said her father violated an Apple company rule by allowing her to film the iPhone X while on Apple's campus."It was an innocent mistake," said Peterson.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.A brief clip from the video appears to identify her father as Ken Bauer, described as an "RF guy" on a profile found in LinkedIn.Bauer did not respond to a LinkedIn inmail asking whether he was the engineer who lost his job.The iPhone X launches on November 3.Last Friday, Apple opened up preorders for the device, which starts at $999.Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zSESlE

Sprint stock dives 11% over report T-Mobile merger is off:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The two sides couldnt agree on terms.Time T-Mobile and Sprint signage.The two companies are reportedly in merger talks.(Photo: Justin Lane/Erik Lesser, EPA-EFE) Shares of Sprint fell sharply Monday after a news report said its parent SoftBank had called off talks with T-Mobile about a possible merger of the two wireless companies.Sprint (S) stock lost 11% before closing down 9% at $6.34.T-Mobile (TMUS) shares fell 5%.According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Japan's SoftBank ended its effort to become a larger player in the U.S. wireless market after Sprint and T-Mobile were unable to agree on how ownership of the new company would be structured.SoftBank acquired Sprint in 2013.Nikkei reported that SoftBank planned to contact T-Mobile-owner Deutsche Telekom as early as Tuesday about ending negotiations.Representatives from SoftBank and T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment.The pairing of T-Mobile, which has about 70 million subscribers, and Sprint, with its nearly 54 million, would create a bigger competitor to industry leaders AT&T, which has 135.7 million and Verizon, with 114.5 million.In 2014, the nation's No.3 and No.4 wireless providers considered joining forces but eventually called off merger talks because it was believed the U.S. regulatory hurdles under the Obama administration were too steep.In December, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son met at Trump Tower with then-President-elect Donald Trump, rekindling speculation that SoftBank would renew merger efforts under a Republican administration.SoftBank Group said it would invest $50 billion into the U.S. economy and add 50,000 jobs.Son reportedly also sought a merger of Sprint and Charter Communications earlier this year, but Charter rebuffed that in July.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zSvdeV

Wall Street bonuses in 2017 are seen topping 2016 average of $138,210:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The Nasdaq surged on blowout earnings from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.The S&P technology index has gained about 30 percent this year.Jade Barker reports.Video provided by Reuters Newslook Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 26, 2017.(Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE) Wall Street workers are on track to receive fatter bonuses in 2017 than last year.Traders can thank the continued bull market in stocks the Dow is up more than 18% this year for what looks to be a coming bump in pay if current trends continue in the final months of the year and financial firms continue to fare well.Securities industry profits on Wall Street jumped by one-third to $12.3 billion in the first half of 2017 versus $9.3 billion in last year's first six months.As a result, Wall Street pros are seen taking home bigger bonuses after hauling in an average of $138,210 last year, according to New York's chief fiscal officer.In its mid-year update on the financial health of New York's financial district, Thomas DiNapoli, the New York State Comptroller, said the industry as measured by the broker-dealer operations of New York Stock Exchange member firms was on pace for its second straight year of higher profits, topping last year's total profits of $17.3 billion.The amount set aside by employers for compensation in the first six months of 2017 was almost 4% higher than a year ago, which DiNapoli says "suggests bonuses could be higher than last year."The average bonus earned by traders, brokers and other industry employees last year is more than double the $59,039 income in 2016 for the median U.S. household, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent income statistics."After a very successful first six months, Wall Street profits are on track to exceed last year's level, barring a major fourth-quarter setback," DiNapoli said in a statement.Jobs in the securities industry inched higher to 178,000 through the end of September, up slightly from 176,000 at the end of 2016.But the total job count is still 6% below 2007, before the financial crisis shredded jobs.But DiNapoli issued a warning to regulators and lawmakers who are moving to undo many of the financial protections put in place following the 2008-09 financial crisis."Attempts to boost profits by rolling back financial regulations and consumer protections could promote excessive risk-taking and volatility and put everyday Americans and the broader economy in harm's way," DiNapoli said.More: Stock market could fall but not enough to kill the bull run More: Black Monday: How this market differs from 1987 crash More: Dow tops 23,000 for first time as stock market rally gains speed This year's profits on Wall Street are being driven by higher revenue from trading and underwriting, which rose 29% versus the same period a year ago, DiNapoli said.Revenue from wealth management businesses, he added, are up 20% so far this year.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hn0gsA

Apple X factor: China buyers rapt by new iPhone, but will they buy?:::::SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Gu Xiaomeng, a 24-year-old primary school teacher in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, says shes excited about the new iPhone X, set to go on sale on Friday.The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.A attendee uses a new iPhone X during a presentation for the media in Beijing, China October 31, 2017.REUTERS/Thomas Peter Im definitely interested, but dont currently plan to get one, said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary models starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone.While interest in the phone is high, that wont necessarily translate into sales.Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apples fortunes in the worlds biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been off the charts.Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.APPLE GEEKS Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week.He has also bought the iPhone 8.I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone, he said, adding he likes the new phones augmented reality and facial recognition features.Ill be very disappointed if I dont get one on the first day.While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed.Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now its mostly the geeks, he said.My friends dont mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apples first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.People are really anticipating this phone because its the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications, said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the E-Feng X from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were very good.Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldnt be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine, said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit.The environment is bad for scalpers.Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag.His last phone was an iPhone 6S.The cost is about a months salary for me, he told Reuters.But Im just used to it now, and there wasnt really anything to make me choose another brand.(For graphic on China chatter about iPhone X, click: tmsnrt.rs/2cbIZ5n)

Sony revives pet AI project with updated AIBO robot dog:::::TOKYO (Reuters) - Japans Sony Corp said on Wednesday it has brought back AIBO more than a decade since it last made the robotic dog, as the electronics and entertainment firm seeks to rebuild its reputation for innovation after years of restructuring.The announcement comes a day after Sony confirmed its renaissance by forecasting its highest-ever profit this financial year, sending its shares surging to a nine-year high.AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings.The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dogs personality.Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999.It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals.It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics, Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing.Sony Corp's entertainment robot "aibo" is pictured at a news conference in Tokyo, Japan November 1, 2017.REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sonys mission (to inspire).The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog.With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner.Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.Slideshow (18 Images) Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame.It also said it is considering overseas sales.The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Incs Google.It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world.It also established a venture capital fund to build partnerships with researchers and start-up companies in AI and robotics.Earlier this year, Sony Education launched its first product, Koov, which aims to teach children coding through building and programming robots using plastic blocks.
Malaysia investigating reported leak of 46 million mobile users data:::::KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia is investigating an alleged attempt to sell the data of more than 46 million mobile phone subscribers online, in what appears to be one of the largest leaks of customer data in Asia.FILE PHOTO: An illustration picture shows a network cable next to a pack of smartphones in Berlin, June 7, 2013.REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski The massive data breach, believed to affect almost the entire population of Malaysia, was first reported last month by Lowyat.net, a local technology news website.The website said it had received a tip-off that someone was trying to sell huge databases of personal information on its forums.The countrys internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), was looking into the matter with the police, Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak said on Wednesday.We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon, Salleh told reporters at parliament.The leaked data included lists of mobile phone numbers, identification card numbers, home addresses, and SIM card data of 46.2 million customers from at least 12 Malaysian mobile phone and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).LIKE EQUIFAX Cybersecurity researchers said the leaked data was extensive enough to allow criminals to create fraudulent identities to make online purchases.Justin Lie, CEO of Cashshield, a Singapore-based anti-fraud company, compared the Malaysian case in its degree of complexity to the cyber attack on U.S. credit-scoring agency Equifax Inc, which said in September that cyber criminals had stolen sensitive information from 145.5 million people.Now these hackers have more quality information such as birth dates, IC numbers, mobile numbers, email address and passwords, Lie said about the Malaysian attack.Customers of Malaysias biggest mobile service providers, including Maxis (MXSC.KL), Axiata Groups Celcom (AXIA.KL) and DiGi (DSOM.KL), among others, were affected.MCMCs chief operating officer Mazlan Ismail said on Tuesday the regulator had met with local telecommunications companies to seek their cooperation in the probe, according to state news agency Bernama.Celcom and Maxis said in separate statements they were cooperating with authorities on the investigation.DiGi did not respond to requests for comment.ALMOST EVERY MALAYSIAN According to a Singapore-based cybersecurity researcher, the leaked database was initially being sold on several underground forums for 1 bitcoin, which was trading on Wednesday at around $6,500.At least one other user was posting a link for anyone to download for free.The researcher, who declined to be named, said he had seen at least 10 people on an online forum in the dark web download the data before it was taken offline.Discussion in the dark web shows a huge interest, he said.Time stamps indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014, Lowyat.net said.We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert, and start immediately replacing the SIM cards, of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014, Lowyat.net said in a post.Malaysias population is just around 32 million, but many have several mobile numbers.The lists are also believed to include inactive numbers and temporary ones bought by visiting foreigners, The Star newspaper reported.Bryce Boland, FireEyes chief technology officer in Asia Pacific, said if the data was widely available as suspected, it could be used for identity fraud and scams.This stolen data may ultimately impact almost every Malaysian, he said.The data also includes private information of more than 80,000 individuals leaked from the records of the Malaysian Medical Council, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the Malaysian Dental Association, Lowyat.net said.
Cryptocurrencies' total value hits record high as bitcoin blasts above $6,500:::::LONDON (Reuters) - The aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies hit a record high of around $184 billion on Wednesday, according to industry website Coinmarketcap, making their reported market value worth around the same as that of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined.A Bitcoin and Dollar notes are seen in this illustration picture taken September 27, 2017.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration The new peak came as the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, hit a record high of more than $6,500 BTC=BTSP.That took its own "market cap" - its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into circulation - to a record high just shy of $110 billion.The latest surge in bitcoin - which has seen an eye-watering increase of almost 800 percent in the past 12 months - was driven by news on Tuesday that CME Group (CME.O), the worlds largest derivative exchange operator, would launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of the year.The announcement was seen as a major step in the digital currencys path toward legitimacy and mainstream financial adoption.The second-most valuable cryptocurrency Ether - sometimes known as Ethereum, after the project behind it - was trading slightly down on the day at $302 per coin, having hit a record high of more than $410 in June.
Record profit forecast for a resurgent Sony sends shares to nine-year high:::::TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Sony Corp (6758.T) soared to a nine-year high on Wednesday after it forecast record earnings that have vindicated its restructuring efforts and raised expectations of sustained momentum in profitability.Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, the tech and entertainment giant has streamlined unprofitable electronics businesses and capitalized on the spread of smartphones with its image sensors.Citing robust sales of image sensors as well as high-end TVs, Sony hiked its full-year operating profit outlook to 630 billion yen ($5.5 billion), up 26 percent from an earlier forecast and 7.5 percent higher than an average analyst estimate.Image sensors will be used in a wide range of areas, and the market is very large, said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan Inc. Profitability is increasing, and in the mid- to long-term we expect the stock price to reach its 2007 level of 7,190 yen.Sonys stock rose as much as 12.4 percent to its highest level since June 2008, becoming the most traded firm by turnover on Tokyos main board.It finished up 11.4 percent at 4,918 yen, giving it a market capitalization of around $54.6 billion.Sony Corp's logo is seen at its news conference in Tokyo, Japan November 1, 2017.REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The new forecast is 20 percent above its current profit record, set two decades ago when strong sales of consumer electronics dovetailed with the popularity of its first PlayStation games console and its Men in Black box-office hit.To develop new profit drivers, the firm has also boosted investment in artificial intelligence and is expanding its consumer products portfolio.It unveiled its Xperia Hello!voice-activated communication robot this month and on Wednesday said it was reviving its robotic dog AIBO that went on sale in 1999.It also aims to lead the budding virtual-reality market by drawing on the content portion of its business such as music and film.Combined with resurgent demand for consumer audio products sparked by the rise of streaming services from Spotify to Apple Incs (AAPL.O) Apple Music, the focus on cutting-edge technology augurs well for future profits, said Macquarie analyst Damian Thong.They should also push into 3D sensors which will be useful for augmented reality and the applications that surround that.Great products, plus great brand, delivering great profitability, he added.Its not rocket science perhaps, but for a long time, Sony seemed to have forgotten this magic formula.

Senators to introduce bill to boost cyber defenses of voting systems:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan pair of U.S. senators plans to introduce legislation on Tuesday seeking to boost the cyber defenses of state election systems, after warnings from senior U.S. officials that future elections may be vulnerable to foreign interference.Voting booths are seen during the New York primary elections at a polling station in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., April 19, 2016.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The Securing Americas Voting Equipment, or SAVE, Act is the latest attempt by lawmakers to respond to what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a multi-pronged cyber operation, including hacking and online propaganda by Russia during the 2016 presidential election aimed at helping President Donald Trump.Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations.The bill will be introduced by Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich and Republican Senator Susan Collins, a Heinrich spokeswoman said.It does not currently have other co-sponsors.Until we set up stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary steps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our nations democratic institutions will remain vulnerable, Heinrich said in a statement.The SAVE Act would authorize the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to grant security clearance to the top election official in each state in addition to one other designee.It would also allow the DNI to share some classified information with the states about threats to their voting systems.Several state election officials have complained that they were left in the dark about Russias attempts to probe their voting systems during the 2016 campaign.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not notify 21 states it said had been targeted by Russian until last month, in part due to confidentiality and classification restrictions.The DHS in January designated voting systems as a critical part of the nations infrastructure, making state elections eligible for more federal protections.The legislation would write that designation into law, and also create a grant program for states to upgrade their systems to better fend off physical and cyber threats.It was not clear whether the bill would gain momentum in an otherwise gridlocked Congress.
Mexico's Puebla state implements stricter rules for Uber, Cabify:::::MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the central Mexican state of Puebla approved new rules on Tuesday aimed at better vetting and monitoring rideshare drivers working for companies like Uber and Cabify after the recent murders of two female college students.The Uber app is seen on mobile telephone in London, Britain, September 25, 2017.REUTERS/Hannah McKay Among the new rules, cash payments are no longer allowed, so-called panic buttons must be implemented and drivers must pass a drug test and not have a criminal record.Authorities can now also access the rideshare apps geolocation systems if necessary.Were looking for the tranquility and safety of the user, said Jorge Aguilar, the president of the governing body of Pueblas Congress.In the first case, the suspect was a former Uber driver working for rival app Cabify, which had its license revoked by Puebla after his arrest.In the second, an Uber driver was arrested, but he was not working when the crime took place.Mexico City was the first city in Latin America to regulate rideshare apps, and Uber is widely used in the capital.It has not faced any federal efforts to rein its growth.Uber has said the Puebla draft bill is discriminatory and does not do enough to protect driver and rider confidentiality.Capitalizing on concerns about dangerous drivers, a Mexican start-up called Laudrive competes with Uber and Cabify for ride-hailing business in Mexico City by exclusively serving women using female drivers.
U.S. senators hammer Facebook for power over elections:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday pressed Facebook Incs chief lawyer on why the company did not catch 2016 election ads bought using Russian rubles, why its investigation of them took so long and how much it knows about its 5 million advertisers.Democrats and Republicans at the Senate crime subcommittee hearing fired questions for much of two hours at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who said that in retrospect the company should have done more.In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens.There are signals we missed, Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money.Stretch called the Russia-based ads reprehensible for their political divisiveness.The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Incs Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.The Russian government has denied it intended to influence the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebooks disclosures.(L-R) Colin Stretch, general counsel for Facebook; Sean Edgett, acting general counsel for Twitter; and Richard Salgado, director of law enforcement and information security at Google, are sworn in prior to testifying before Senate Judiciary Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on on "ways to combat and reduce the amount of Russian propaganda and extremist content online," on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 31, 2017.REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem?Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked.Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last years election, we werent sitting around.The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads.It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers.Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.Slideshow (8 Images) Republican Senator John Kennedy told Stretch that he doubted Facebooks ability to stop people overseas from buying U.S. election ads.U.S. law bars election spending by non-Americans.Youve got 5 million advertisers and youre going to tell me that youre able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?Kennedy asked Stretch.The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.Stretch responded: Certainly potentially.The internet is borderless.Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a patchwork of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.
WiFi-equipped school buses help students get online:::::CNN has produced this story in partnership with the GSMA #caseforchange project.To find out more about how mobile connectivity can change the world, follow #caseforchange on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.(CNN) The digital age continues to spark creative developments in education.Wireless gadgets are now commonplace in the typical American classroom.But while technology is helping thousands of students reach new heights in their education, many others are falling behind.Dubbed "the homework gap" by researchers, students without the use of reliable internet access at home find it harder to complete and submit homework assignments, further expanding the inequality already seen in low-income communities.While some US schools provide their students with laptops or iPads, according to Pew Research Center , almost 5 million American households with school-aged children lack broadband in the home.Low-income homes with children are four times more likely to lack broadband as middle or high income families.Innovative methods With the gap widening, some school districts have taken it upon themselves to change this dynamic by introducing an innovative solution.WiFi school buses are one new approach to help students without access to fast broadband at home get connected.The school buses are equipped with routers and students use a public network to connect to the internet.This allows children who have long commutes, which can be two hours each day, to finish homework assignments on their journey.Richmond County School System in Augusta GA is one of the school districts piloting a WiFi school bus program.According to a national survey in 2012, 24.4% of Richmond County's population lived in poverty with a high school graduation rate of just 61.8%.Many households in the community did not have broadband access so the district, which has more than 30,000 students, introduced two WiFi school buses in 2016.Kaden Jacobs, Richmond County School System's director of communications, says that the WiFi buses were introduced to close the digital divide students in the district were facing."Our goal is to offer all students in Richmond County equal access to broadband that is required for students to meet academic rigor and obtain 21st-century skills," says Jacobs.The buses transport children to and from school and were parked at two community centers daily during the summer.The district is currently analyzing how the program has impacted grades.A global issue But the homework gap is not just an American problem -- schools all over the world are trying to battle the digital divide.Cell phone ownership in developing nations is increasing substantially.According to a report by Pew Research Center , cell phones are as common in Nigeria and South Africa as in the United States.A report by Ericsson Mobility suggests that by 2020 around 70% of the world's population will be using smartphones.Using this new trend to their advantage, schools around the world are implementing mobile learning programs as a tool to connect students outside of the classroom.One example is a program in Niger that used exercises on a mobile phone to improve reading and numeracy in adult education.In South Africa, a Nokia program called MoMath Project let children answer math problems via their cell phones and reportedly improved math skills by an average of 14%.Equal opportunity Keith Krueger is the CEO of Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) a nonprofit professional association for education technology leaders.He strongly believes the homework gap is a major issue that needs to be addressed all around the world."Teachers expect that students can do their homework from home, which requires Internet.While many low-income students [in the United States] have a phone, it typically is on a data plan.Imagine trying to write your senior thesis or apply for college on a smartphone using WiFi at a McDonald's," says Kreuger.Innovative solutions like the WiFi school buses are crucial in helping to end this divide, says Kreuger.Kreuger continues: "It makes bus time a new study hall to do homework.And, this is equally true for times when students are transported to sporting or other school activities."Until last year Coachella Valley Unified School District in California used WiFi school buses.The buses were then left overnight in low-income neighborhoods for students to use.Google also recently granted money to a school in South Carolina to equip their buses with WiFi access.Innovations to bridge the homework gap might even help create more equal societies.As Kreuger puts it: "This is today's civil right -- ensuring that all students have access to equal educational opportunity in a digital world."

"Hidden Valley" in this image.Hide Caption 5 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover recently encountered this iron meteorite, which NASA named "Lebanon."This find is similar in shape and luster to iron meteorites found on Mars by the previous generation of rovers.A portion of the rock was outlined by NASA scientists.Hide Caption 6 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity took this nighttime photo of a hole it drilled May 5 to collect soil samples.NASA said this image combines eight exposures taken after dark on May 13.Hide Caption 7 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity This view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon, taken by Curiosity, includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky.Earth is a little left of center in the image, and our moon is just below Earth.A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright "evening stars."Hide Caption 8 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity The lower slopes of "Mount Sharp" are visible at the top of this image, taken on July 9, 2013.The turret of tools at the end of the rover's arm, including the rock-sampling drill in the lower left corner, can also be seen.Hide Caption 9 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity The rock on the left, called "Wopmay," was discovered by the rover Opportunity, which arrived in 2004 on a different part of Mars.Iron-bearing sulfates indicate that this rock was once in acidic waters.On the right are rocks from "Yellowknife Bay," where rover Curiosity was situated.These rocks are suggestive of water with a neutral pH, which is hospitable to life formation.Hide Caption 10 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity shows the first sample of powdered rock extracted by the rover's drill.The image was

team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing.Hide Caption 19 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve.After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera.Hide Caption 20 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the "Rocknest" site on October 3, 2012.This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple.Hide Caption 21 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here.The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team.The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water.The grains are too large to have been moved by wind.Hide Caption 22 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012.The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as "Glenelg."As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.Hide Caption 23 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity This image shows the robotic

Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer:::::This feature is part of Vision Japan , a series about the visionaries who are changing Japan, and the places that inspire this innovation.See more here .(CNN) Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer, which it hopes will make the country the new global hub for artificial intelligence research.The supercomputer is expected to run at a speed of 130 petaflops, meaning it is able to perform a mind-boggling 130 quadrillion calculations per second (that's 130 million billion).Once complete (the target date is April 2018), the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI) will be the most powerful supercomputer in the world, surpassing the current champion, China's Sunway TaihuLight, currently operating at 93 petaflops.What makes a computer 'super'?While the ABCI will not have a mouse or screen, it's not vastly different from a personal computer -- just souped-up, a whole lot faster, and much, much bigger."The current supercomputer system is one million times faster than your personal computers," explains Satoshi Sekiguchi, a director general at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.Sekiguchi calculates that it would take 3,000 years for a personal computer to achieve what a supercomputer can do in just one day.In terms of size, Japan's supercomputer will be comparable to a parking lot with space for 30 to 40 cars."The supercomputer that is currently under development would take up about 1,000 square meters of floor space," says Sekiguchi.What will it be used for?The ABCI could help Japanese companies develop and improve driverless cars, robotics and medical diagnostics, explains Sekiguchi."A supercomputer is an extremely important tool for accelerating the advancement in such fields," he says.Its supersonic speed will also help Japan develop advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as "deep learning."But supercomputers are to thank for smaller everyday inventions too."The initial design of paper diapers was actually done using a supercomputer," explains Sekiguchi."However, mothers continue to use them without knowing that fact."Photos: Supercomputers breaking barriers Sunway-TaihuLight Chinese supercomputer Sunway-TaihuLight is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world, operating at 93 petaflops.That means it's able to perform 93 quadrillion (million billion) calculations per second.China uses the supercomputer for weather forecasting, pharmaceutical research, and industrial design.Hide Caption 1 of 6

FCC Chief Urges Hold-Out Apple to Enable Radio Chips in iPhones to Save Lives:::::The U.S. military visited the city of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, as the area is dealing with massive damage to buildings and homes, as well as electrical and water infrastructure, from Hurricane Maria.Other US agencies like the Coast Guard, FEMA, Red Cross, the Puerto Rican Emergency Management Agency and Puerto Rican police are also making their way through Humacao, Puerto Rico, bringing aid, meals and water with them.(Published Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017) The iPhone is an incredibly advanced device, but some versions have a very old piece of technology embedded in it lying dormant: a radio receiver.Now, the chairman of the U.S. agency that regulates radio, phones and other forms of communication wants Apple to activate the FM chips in iPhones to help get information to Puerto Ricans, whose island is near-totally blacked-out after Hurricane Maria hit land with devastating force last week."When wireless networks go down during a natural disaster, smartphones with activated FM chips can allow Americans to get vital access to life-saving information," said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai Thursday in a statement."I applaud those companies that have done the right thing by activating the FM chips in their phones.Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so."Pai's call was backed by the National Association of Broadcasters, which also urged Apple to "light up the FM chip."President Trump to Visit Puerto Rico President Donald Trump will visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to view the hurricane damage personally.Trump talked about the rescue and recovery efforts, and the challenges presented due to the island's location.(Published Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2017) "It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first," Pai said in his statement.Puerto Rico is in the midst of what San Juan's mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others have called a humanitarian crisis.Nearly half the island is without water and about all electricity customers without power as of Wednesday, according to federal agencies' most recent updates.About nine in 10 cellphone sites were still out of service by Wednesday, and residents have complained that there's no way for them to get vital news about where to get supplies.Many people continue to be unable simply to reach family members on the mainland.Usually, smartphones get data through the internet, but with so much of the island crippled, internet service is very hard to come by.But the FM chips that most phones are made with would allow them to tune into radio frequencies without anything other than power if the chips are activated, and users have an app downloaded that can access broadcasts.Pai has long identified this capability as being important option for smartphone owners to have when disasters hit, and the FCC has recognized that it's particularly useful in disaster situations when the internet is hard to access."I don't think people realize how vulnerable people get," said former FEMA Administator Craig Fugate, citing cell system overload during Hurricane Sandy and the Virginia earthquake, in an interview with NAB.FEMA urges people to have battery-powered radios in their disaster preparedness kits, but Fugate said in the 2014 interview, "If your radio's now in your cellphone, that's one less device that you have to have extra."Currently, the NAB-supported NextRadio app, which can broadcast from the FM chip, is available on a wide variety of Samsung, HTC, Moto and other smartphones.But not iPhones.Apple did not respond when Wired wrote about the issue of smartphones' FM chips last year.In a statement to NBC on Thursday, an Apple spokesperson said that its iPhone 7 and new iPhone 8 do not have FM radio chips in them "nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.""Apple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and thats why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products," Apple said in a statement."Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts."Apple did not address the older models of iPhones, and the FCC declined to comment on the company's statement.Activating the FM chip wouldn't immediately help anyone in Puerto Rico without internet already.But advocates argue it would help Americans be prepared for the next disaster.'Tonight': Fallon Encourages Fans to Help Puerto Rico Jimmy Fallon takes a moment before his show to encourage his viewers to make donations to help Puerto Rico recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria.(Published Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2017) Wireless companies have long urged Congress to let FM chip activation be up to individual carriers.Asked at a 2013 congressional hearing why cellphone providers are reluctant to activatation of the chips, then-executive vice-president of the wireless association CTIA, Christopher Guttman-McCabe, said, "we leave it up to that ecosystem, and the carriers will compete against each other as well as the handset manufacturers."In a recent statement, CTIA spokesman Nick Ludlum touted wireless providers' quick response to the three recent hurricanes that hit the United States, including by bringing in portable generators and cell equipment.NBC reached out to the CTIA for a response to Pai's statement.

APNewsBreak: Gov't won't pursue talking car mandate:::::The Trump administration has quietly set aside plans to require new cars to be able to wirelessly talk to each other, auto industry officials said, jeopardizing one of the most promising technologies for preventing traffic deaths.The Obama administration proposed last December that all new cars and light trucks come equipped with technology known as vehicle-to-vehicle communications, or V2V.It would enable vehicles to transmit their location, speed, direction and other information 10 times per second.That lets cars detect, for example, when another vehicle is about to run a red light or coming around a blind turn in time to prevent a crash.The administration has decided not to pursue a final V2V mandate, said two auto industry officials who have spoken with White House and Transportation Department officials and two others whose organizations have spoken to the administration.The industry officials spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their relations with the administration.The White House and the Department of Transportation declined to comment, but the proposal has been dropped from the White House Office of Management and Budget's list of regulations actively under consideration and instead has been relegated to its long-term agenda.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said in a statement that it is still reviewing more than 460 comments on the proposed mandate before deciding its next step and that no final decision has been made.Industry officials said decisions on the matter are being made at higher levels of the administration.Administration officials indicated their decision was based on several factors, including general wariness of imposing costly mandates on industry, even though most automakers support requiring V2V, industry officials said.President Donald Trump has made reducing government regulations, which he sees as a drain on the economy, a guiding principle of his administration.The Transportation Department estimates the technology has the potential to prevent or reduce the severity of up to 80 percent of collisions that don't involve alcohol or drugs.V2V was also expected to provide an extra layer of safety for self-driving cars since it can detect even vehicles hidden by buildings or beyond the range of the sensors and cameras of autonomous vehicles.And it was expected to ease traffic congestion since vehicles could communicate with traffic signals, turning them green to prevent needless waiting, save fuel and reduce emissions.V2V is one of the "most important tools" for reducing traffic fatalities, but the Trump administration "is locking it in the trunk if they're not going to put out the mandate," said Deborah Hersman, president of the National Safety Council, a congressionally chartered advocacy group."The only way you're going to get it adopted and deployed in a widespread manner is by having a mandate."The Obama administration shares some of the blame because it waited years to propose the mandate, she said.Traffic fatalities have surged over the past two years to 37,461 deaths in 2016, up nearly 5,000 deaths from 2014.It's the largest two-year increase since the early 1960s.Another reason administration officials are allowing the V2V proposal to languish is strong opposition from the cable and tech industries, auto industry officials said.The government set aside the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for transportation technologies in 1999.It went unused while the government and automakers spent over a decade and more than $1 billion developing and testing V2V.Spectrum is finite and in short supply.Cable and tech companies have been seeking permission to use the 5.9 GHz spectrum for additional wireless bandwidth.Automakers say they need the entire 5.9 GHz spectrum for V2V and other safety uses.The Federal Communications Commission has been conducting tests to see if the spectrum can be shared without interfering with the safety signals.The first test results are expected to be released soon.Automakers wanted the mandate partly because it would establish V2V protocols to ensure that Fords could talk to Toyotas which could talk to Volkswagens, and so on.The mandate was also intended to get the technology onto roads faster.It called for half of new vehicles to have V2V within two years after a final rule was issued, and all new vehicles within four years.The more vehicles equipped with V2V, the more collisions that could be avoided.It would still take many years before there were enough vehicles with V2V to reap the technology's full promise.That might be accelerated by after-market devices that would bring V2V to older vehicles.Automakers can put V2V in vehicles without a mandate.General Motors has put the technology in its Cadillac CTS sedans.Toyota has put V2V in vehicles in Japan and Volkswagen plans to put it in cars in Europe starting in 2019.But it will be more difficult for automakers to protect the 5.9 GHz spectrum and deployment will be far slower without a mandate, industry officials said.Some European manufacturers say they want V2V, but it might be better to wait super-fast 5G cellular technology to achieve it instead of currently available technology.But 5G is still being developed.Years of testing would be required after it's ready before it could go into cars."The longer we wait, the more people die," said Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation."We need to move forward with it."Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APJoanLowy This story has been corrected to reflect that General Motors has put the V2V

GameStop is starting new Blockbuster-like service for used game rentals:::::GameStop will offer a new subscription service for customers just in time for the holidays.The service, called PowerPass Unlimited Gaming Service, will allow subscribers to rent an unlimited amount of used games from GameStop stores over six months, Joey Mooring, GameStop's director of corporate communications, told ABC News.It will be available starting Nov. 19 and can be purchased as a gift.The cost is $60.Guests can choose from any pre-owned video game in our catalog, from the throwback classics to the latest hits, Mooring said.Bloomberg via Getty Images The subscription includes the choice of one free used game to keep at the end of the period.The PowerPass requires customers to pick up game rentals in a physical store, which is reminiscent of how the once popular Blockbuster's movie rentals worked."If a game is not available in that store, we have a web in-store system that allows customers to select the game and then it is shipped to that store for them to pick up," Mooring explained.Bloomberg via Getty Images Subscribers must be registered members of GameStop's Power-Up Rewards program, which has a free tier of membership available.PowerPass will not be a renewable option for members, however.But that could always change."Anything is possible," Mooring said.
Slow flow of human immigration may have doomed Neanderthals:::::What killed off the Neanderthals?It's a big debate, and now a study says that no matter what the answer, they were doomed anyway.Our close evolutionary cousins enjoyed a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa.The search for an explanation has produced many theories including climate change, epidemics, or inability to compete with the modern humans, who may have had some mental or cultural edge.The new study isn't intended to argue against those factors, but just to show that they're not needed to explain the extinction, says Oren Kolodny of Stanford University.He and colleague Marcus Feldman present their approach in a paper released Tuesday by the journal Nature Communications.They based their conclusion on a computer simulation that represented small bands of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe and Asia.These local populations were randomly chosen to go extinct, and then be replaced by another randomly chosen population, with no regard for whether it represented the same species.Neither species was assumed to have any inherent advantage, but there was one crucial difference: Unlike the Neanderthals, the modern humans were supplemented by reinforcements coming in from Africa.It wasn't a huge wave, but rather "a tiny, tiny trickle of small bands," Kolodny said.Still, that was enough to tip the balance against the Neanderthals.They generally went extinct when the simulation was run more than a million times under a variety of assumptions.If survival was a game of chance, "it was rigged by the fact that there's recurring migration," Kolodny said."The game was doomed to end with the Neanderthals losing."Kolodny said the evidence that such migrations actually occurred is suggestive rather than conclusive.Such migrations would not be expected to leave much of an archaeological trace, he said.Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals' demise.It fits in with other recent attempts to explain the extinction without assuming behavioral differences between Neanderthals and our ancestors, said Wil Roebroeks of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.The notion of such differences is largely disproven, he said.Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany said while the new work could be useful in solving the extinction mystery, it doesn't address the question of why modern humans dispersed from Africa into Europe and Asia.It's important to figure out what was behind that, she said in an email.Follow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter His recent work can be found here.
UN environment chief: US likely to live up to Paris accord:::::The head of the U.N. environment program said Tuesday the United States is likely to live up to the Paris climate deal despite President Donald Trump's planned pullout, because "all the big American companies" are working toward greener operations.The comments from UNEP executive director Erik Solheim came as the U.N. agency presented its latest "Emissions Gap" report , which gives a scientific assessment about how national efforts are affecting the greenhouse gas emission trend.The report's release ahead of a crucial climate meeting next week in Bonn, Germany, aims to inject new momentum to the Paris accord and even strengthen it in 2020.Trump, however, has vowed to pull out the U.S. because he insists it's unfair to the United States.U.N. officials are increasingly citing the role of companies in the fight against climate change."There is one question that I get more often than any other question wherever I go on the planet and it is a very simple one.It is: 'What about Donald Trump?'"Solheim told a panel in Geneva by videoconference from Nairobi."In all likelihood, the United States of America will live up to its Paris commitment, not because of the White House, but because of the private sector," he said."All the big American companies are dedicated to go in the green direction."But UNEP said countries and industries still need to do more to meet targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions that experts say contribute to global warming.The report criticizes coal-fired electricity plants being built in emerging economies, and insists that investment in renewable energies will pay for itself and even make money over the long term."The Paris agreement boosted climate action, but momentum is clearly faltering," said Edgar Gutierrez-Espeleta, Costa Rica's environment minister who heads the 2017 U.N.Environment Assembly."We face a stark choice: Up our ambition, or suffer the consequences."The Paris accord aims to cap global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (Fahrenheit) by the year 2100 compared to average world temperatures at the start of the industrial era and even hopes to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees C. UNEP says trends suggest that even if current national commitments are met, a temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century is "very likely meaning that governments need to deliver much stronger pledges when they are revised in 2020.""Should the United States follow through with its stated intention to leave the Paris agreement in 2020, the picture could become even bleaker," UNEP said.Lead author John Christensen of U.N.Environment noted some U.S. states like California were "acting independently of what the White House decides."He said Trump's bid to peel back constraints on the coal industry won't mark a major shift because "it simply doesn't pay off."He also said the U.S. targets in the Paris accord, as agreed by the Obama administration, were "not that ambitious in the first place."But Christensen told the Geneva panel that the Trump administration's impact on efforts could affect "negotiation dynamics" with other countries and embolden "what I call 'noise-makers:' they are the ones that are opposed to the basic idea" of fighting climate change.Bob Ward, an expert on climate change policy at the London School of Economics, agreed that the coal industry is "unlikely to be revived in the United States because it is being displaced by cleaner and cheaper sources of energy.""Many countries now recognize that the transition to a low-carbon economy will generate sustainable growth and development, with lower poverty and higher living standards," he said."High-carbon economies look increasingly uncompetitive."A new round of U.N. climate talks known as COP 23 starts in Bonn, Germany, on Monday, when countries will take stock of their achievements and prepare more ambitious national goals.On the positive, UNEP highlighted "rapidly expanding mitigation action" and says carbon-dioxide emissions have remained stable since 2014, thanks partly to renewable energy use in China and India.It cautioned that other greenhouse gases like methane continue to rise, however.UNEP has trumpeted solar and wind energy, efficient appliances and cars, and efforts to preserve forests.Solheim cited tests this week on the world's first solar-powered railroad in Australia and the launch of a hydrogen-run subway system in northern China."We are at the watershed moment: We have stopped the rise in CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions there is every reason to believe we can bring them down," Solheim said."The train is on the right track, but our duty is to speed it up."
2 states warn Trump against big changes in sage grouse plan:::::Two Western governors on Tuesday warned the Trump administration against making big changes in a plan to protect a ground-dwelling bird across the West, saying it would send a message to states not to bother working together to save other imperiled species.Colorado Democrat John Hickenlooper and Wyoming Republican Matt Mead said a 2015 conservation plan designed to save the greater sage grouse was the product of long negotiation among state and federal governments, conservation groups, industry and agriculture."If we go down a different road now with the sage grouse, what it says is, when you try to address other endangered species problems in this country, don't have a collaborative process, don't work together, because it's going to be changed," Mead said."To me, that would be a very unfortunate circumstance."Hickenlooper said, "We are both very concerned that the new administration is going to take away all the guide rails that allowed this collaboration to exist."They appeared together at an energy conference at Colorado State University.The 2015 plan is designed to protect the bird without putting it on the Endangered Species List, an outcome that most states try to avoid because it usually brings strict restrictions on oil and gas drilling, mining, agriculture and other activities to protect habitat.But Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in June his department would consider changing the plan to give states more flexibility to allow mining, logging and other economic development.Environmentalists have said the planned revision was just a back-door attempt to open up more land to mining and drilling.Millions of sage grouse once lived across the U.S. West, but development, disease, livestock grazing and an invasive grass that encourages wildfires has reduced its number to fewer than 500,000.The 2015 plan covers 11 states and had the approval of the Obama administration.It took years to negotiate and was hailed as a model for saving a species through cooperation, rather than the hammer of the Endangered Species Act.The Interior Department has not released the full details of its planned revisions, but the agency announced in early October it would withdraw protections for about 15,600 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat on federal lands to allow energy development.Despite Mead's support for the 2015 plan, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Smith said the department has been in contact with Wyoming officials "and many, many others who took serious issue with the Obama-era plans.""We look forward to continuing to work with the governor on this and many other issues," Smith said in an email to The Associated Press.Mead said protecting endangered species has become a serious problem, citing figures that show less than 2 percent of the species protected under the act since it was passed in 1973 have recovered enough to be removed from the list."Now, if you care about species, or you care about energy production or you care about commerce, we've got to do better than that, and a collaborative process that brings in Western states on endangered species, in my mind, is the best way to go," he said.Not all Western governors support the 2015 plan.Idaho Republican C. L. "Butch" Otter filed a lawsuit shortly after the plan was released, contending the Obama administration illegally imposed federal land-use restrictions.A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in January, but Otter has appealed.This story has been corrected to show the Interior Department announced it would consider changing the plan in June, not August.Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/dan%20elliott.
iPhone X sells out within minutes overnight:::::If you're just waking up, you're too late: iPhone X preorders sold out within minutes overnight.Interested in Apple?Add Apple as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Apple news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Today marked the kick-off for iPhone X preorders, Apples much anticipated 10th-anniversary edition of its iPhone.Preorders opened at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time and 3:01 a.m.ET for those Apple devotees who wanted to be some of the first to get their hands on the phone that Apple's CEO Tim Cook called the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone at its Sept. 12 launch event.While the iPhone X was gone online in minutes, the phone will be available in stores next Friday, Nov. 3.Heres what you need to know about the iPhone X: Apple has confirmed that stores will have the new phone in stock on Nov. 3 and the company is encouraging customers to arrive early."Stores will have iPhone X available for walk-in customers," Apple wrote.Stores open at 8 a.m.Quantities of the phone available are unconfirmed.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pricing The iPhone X is the most expensive phone on the market, starting at $999 for the 64-gigabit version.The 256 GB phone starts at $1,149.Apples iPhone upgrade program offers monthly billing options: $49.91 a month for the 64 GB and $56.16 a month for 256 GB, including AppleCare insurance.Cellphone carriers have similar offers.Apple/Polaris Key selling features Edge-to-edge OLED screen OLED display means that the screen has crisper colors, brighter hues and blacker blacks.This phone has the highest pixel density for an iPhone yet.Face ID Facial recognition technology is used to unlock the phone.Users simply have to look at the phone to unlock it.Apple says the camera sensors will adapt to your physical changes over time.True-depth camera The iPhone Xs true-depth camera allows users to take selfies with portrait mode and comes with a portrait lighting feature.Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Tech analyst predictions [The iPhone X is] what all phones will be in the future.Im stopping short of calling it game-changing, said Patrick Moorhead, a tech industry analyst at Moors Insights Strategy.He said that the Samsung Galaxy 8 is a better phone but that from a consumer point of view, the iPhone X provides one of the best experiences, I would say the best experience.It has the highest speed LTE, but unfortunately, it doesnt support gigabit LTE that premium Android phones have.Gigabit LTE is the fastest cellphone service available.He sees one of the top-selling features of the phone as the size.It has the display size of the Plus but the pocket size of a regular iPhone, he explained.As for the design of the phone, Moorhead sees it as what all phones will be in the future.Before the phone went on sale, Moorhead had predicted that the iPhone X will sell out so fast that its not even funny and that people are hesitant to buy the iPhone 8 because of the X edition.Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.Tech industry analyst Daniel Ives, the head of technology research at GBH Insights in New York, agreed, referring to the iPhone 8 as a placeholder for the iPhone X. I think presales going on Friday and this weekend could approach 40 million units, said Ives.To actually get your hands on an iPhone between now and the holiday season is going to be an impressive feat.The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.Unlike Moorhead, Ives sees the iPhone X as an industry game changer.From a product functionality standpoint, it is pure optic technology, Ives said.GBH Insights analysis showed that an estimated 350 million iPhone users are up for an upgrade or will be eligible within the next year, and Ives thinks that most of these users will want to spring for the X.The real success of [the iPhone X] is going to be during 2018, Ives predicted, but he questioned whether the sticker shock will be a deterrent for buyers.According to surveys by GBH Insights, fewer than 20 percent of surveyed users saw the price as a deterrent.
Missing Russian helicopter found on seabed in the Arctic:::::Norwegian rescue officials said Sunday the wreckage of a Russian helicopter that crashed with eight people onboard off the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard has been located on the seabed.The Joint Rescue Coordination Center for northern Norway said that the Mi-8 helicopter, which went down Thursday near the Svalbard settlement of Barentsburg, is around two kilometers (one mile) east of Cape Heer at a depth of nearly 210 meters (about 685 feet).A Norwegian remote-controlled submarine was involved in the search, which will now focus on the chopper's passengers.The Associated Press Russian authorities said earlier that the helicopter belonged to Russian coal company Arktikugol but was operated by charter company Konvers Avia.Yevgeny Saidov, head of the Russian emergencies ministry's special group at the site, told news agency TASS that Russian remotely controlled underwater vehicles would join the operation to survey the Mi-8 crash site.The helicopter had been en route to Barentsburg, a coal-mining town of about 500 people, from the Russian settlement of Pyramiden, carrying five crew members and three staff members from Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute.Under an international 1920 treaty, Norway has sovereignty over Svalbard, which is 800 kilometers (500 miles) north of its mainland.Other signatory countries of the treaty have rights to exploit its natural resources at the archipelago, known also with its earlier name Spitzbergen.
U. of Michigan expert puts bird-like robot through its paces:::::A rare bird has landed at the University of Michigan: a two-legged robot named "Cassie" that researchers hope could be the forerunner of a machine that one day will aid search-and-rescue efforts.Cassie whose name is derived from the cassowary (KASS'-uh-WAIR'-ee), a flightless bird similar to an ostrich stands upright on legs with backward-facing knees.The biped that weighs about 66 pounds (29.94 kilograms) may not have feathers or a head, but she is attached to a short torso that holds motors, computers and batteries and is able to walk unassisted on rough and uneven terrain.Cassie, which stands a bit over 3.25 feet (1 meter) at full leg extension, was built by Albany, Oregon-based Agility Robotics and purchased by Michigan researchers using grant money from the National Science Foundation and Toyota Research Institute.Although other institutions have acquired similar models, Michigan's team is excited to use its version to put Michigan Robotics' cutting-edge programming to the test, said Jessy Grizzle, director of Michigan Robotics."This stuff makes our old math look like child's play," Grizzle said.Although there is considerable excitement about Cassie and the potential she represents, certain real-world applications are still a bit out of reach.Search-and-rescue "is a hard problem and serves as a template for 'unsolved problems in robotics,' which is one of the reasons you see it pop up so much when robotics companies talk about applications," said Agility Robotics CEO Damion Shelton, who added that it is "difficult to even speculate" when a robot could be used for such a purpose.Other applications will be launched sooner, according to Shelton, who said a robot capable of walking around the perimeter of an industrial site taking 3D scans is no more than two years away from becoming reality.For now, Grizzle and some of his students are putting Cassie through her paces on and around Michigan's Ann Arbor campus.During a recent a stroll on a pedestrian walkway, Cassie ambled on a grassy, sloped surface, then took a serious tumble and did a face-plant on the concrete."Well, I think that's the end" of the test, Grizzle said, as Cassie lay in a heap on the ground, slightly nicked and scratched but no worse for wear.The programs Grizzle and his students tested "are version 1.0," he said."They are simple algorithms to make sure that we understand the robot.We will now focus on implementing our super-cool latest stuff," Grizzle said.Online: Cassie: http://www.agilityrobotics.com/robots/ University of Michigan Robotics: https://robotics.umich.edu/ Sign up for the AP's weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv

APNewsBreak: Gov't won't pursue talking car mandate:::::The Trump administration has quietly set aside plans to require new cars to be able to wirelessly talk to each other, auto industry officials said, jeopardizing one of the most promising technologies for preventing traffic deaths.The Obama administration proposed last December that all new cars and light trucks come equipped with technology known as vehicle-to-vehicle communications, or V2V.It would enable vehicles to transmit their location, speed, direction and other information 10 times per second.That lets cars detect, for example, when another vehicle is about to run a red light or coming around a blind turn in time to prevent a crash.The administration has decided not to pursue a final V2V mandate, said two auto industry officials who have spoken with White House and Transportation Department officials and two others whose organizations have spoken to the administration.The industry officials spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their relations with the administration.The White House and the Department of Transportation declined to comment, but the proposal has been dropped from the White House Office of Management and Budget's list of regulations actively under consideration and instead has been relegated to its long-term agenda.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said in a statement that it is still reviewing more than 460 comments on the proposed mandate before deciding its next step and that no final decision has been made.Industry officials said decisions on the matter are being made at higher levels of the administration.Administration officials indicated their decision was based on several factors, including general wariness of imposing costly mandates on industry, even though most automakers support requiring V2V, industry officials said.President Donald Trump has made reducing government regulations, which he sees as a drain on the economy, a guiding principle of his administration.The Transportation Department estimates the technology has the potential to prevent or reduce the severity of up to 80 percent of collisions that don't involve alcohol or drugs.V2V was also expected to provide an extra layer of safety for self-driving cars since it can detect even vehicles hidden by buildings or beyond the range of the sensors and cameras of autonomous vehicles.And it was expected to ease traffic congestion since vehicles could communicate with traffic signals, turning them green to prevent needless waiting, save fuel and reduce emissions.V2V is one of the "most important tools" for reducing traffic fatalities, but the Trump administration "is locking it in the trunk if they're not going to put out the mandate," said Deborah Hersman, president of the National Safety Council, a congressionally chartered advocacy group."The only way you're going to get it adopted and deployed in a widespread manner is by having a mandate."The Obama administration shares some of the blame because it waited years to propose the mandate, she said.Traffic fatalities have surged over the past two years to 37,461 deaths in 2016, up nearly 5,000 deaths from 2014.It's the largest two-year increase since the early 1960s.Another reason administration officials are allowing the V2V proposal to languish is strong opposition from the cable and tech industries, auto industry officials said.The government set aside the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for transportation technologies in 1999.It went unused while the government and automakers spent over a decade and more than $1 billion developing and testing V2V.Spectrum is finite and in short supply.Cable and tech companies have been seeking permission to use the 5.9 GHz spectrum for additional wireless bandwidth.Automakers say they need the entire 5.9 GHz spectrum for V2V and other safety uses.The Federal Communications Commission has been conducting tests to see if the spectrum can be shared without interfering with the safety signals.The first test results are expected to be released soon.Automakers wanted the mandate partly because it would establish V2V protocols to ensure that Fords could talk to Toyotas which could talk to Volkswagens, and so on.The mandate was also intended to get the technology onto roads faster.It called for half of new vehicles to have V2V within two years after a final rule was issued, and all new vehicles within four years.The more vehicles equipped with V2V, the more collisions that could be avoided.It would still take many years before there were enough vehicles with V2V to reap the technology's full promise.That might be accelerated by after-market devices that would bring V2V to older vehicles.Automakers can put V2V in vehicles without a mandate.General Motors has put the technology in its Cadillac CTS sedans.Toyota has put V2V in vehicles in Japan and Volkswagen plans to put it in cars in Europe starting in 2019.But it will be more difficult for automakers to protect the 5.9 GHz spectrum and deployment will be far slower without a mandate, industry officials said.Some European manufacturers say they want V2V, but it might be better to wait super-fast 5G cellular technology to achieve it instead of currently available technology.But 5G is still being developed.Years of testing would be required after it's ready before it could go into cars."The longer we wait, the more people die," said Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation."We need to move forward with it."Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APJoanLowy This story has been corrected to reflect that General Motors has put the V2V technology in Cadillac CTS sedans, not CT6 sedans.
Springer Nature blocks access to articles in China:::::Academic publisher Springer Nature said Wednesday it has blocked access to articles within China to comply with demands from the Chinese government, amid a push by Beijing to tighten controls on information from outside the country.The company said in a statement that less than 1 percent of its content available online in global markets has been blocked in China in compliance with "local distribution laws.""This action is deeply regrettable but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors and is in compliance with our published policy," the statement said."This is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world."Springer Nature, which has offices around the world, says it has published more than 275,000 books and 3,000 journals, including "Nature" and "Scientific American."The move is the latest example of how effective China can be at leveraging its economic might to compel foreign companies to make concessions in order to maintain access to its massive market.Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has tightened controls over information and over a wide range of groups that could feed opposition to the ruling Communist Party, including lawyers who take on sensitive cases, non-governmental organizations and churches.The blocked articles related to topics such as Taiwan, the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and the status of Tibet, which are considered sensitive by the Communist Party, according to a survey by The Associated Press.They can only be viewed with a virtual private network that allows users to skirt China's strict internet censorship regime, known as the Great Firewall.The newspaper Financial Times reported that at least 1,000 articles were blocked.In August, academic publisher Cambridge University Press restored more than 300 politically sensitive articles that had been removed from the publisher's website in China at the behest of authorities.Its action followed a petition circulated among academics calling on the university press to turn down censorship requests from the Chinese government.The temporarily blocked articles also touched on the Tiananmen crackdown, Tibet and similar topics.As of Wednesday, CUP's website, The China Quarterly, was fully accessible in China.Academics say that Chinese universities, which have long endured some degree of political interference, have also come under increased supervision, including regular monitoring in classrooms and ideological audits.Springer Nature said failure to block some of the articles as required by its distributors, who it said are the "officially appointed guardians of all content," could have led to its entire SpringerLink website being blocked."Access to 99 percent of Springer Nature content is therefore safeguarded for all our customers in China and we will continue to work with the regulator and other Chinese authorities to minimize the content affected, reduce and ideally eliminate these restrictions on behalf of the global research community and wider society," the company said.
Social-media images shown as evidence of 'Russian trolls':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Senator Patrick Leahy said technology companies could have done "a lot more earlier" about the fake accounts US senators have put on show several examples of what they believe to be Russia's attempt to influence US citizens via social media.Facebook, Twitter and Google had previously shared with congressional investigators some examples of what they suspected to be adverts and messages posted by Russia-based "troll" operatives, but the material had not previously been made public - although some instances had already been identified by the press.Below are the cases displayed during the Senate Subcommittee on the Judiciary's hearing on Tuesday.Further examples are likely to be highlighted during a follow-up event, involving the same three companies, being held by the Senate Subcommittee on Intelligence later on Wednesday.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This tweet falsely suggested citizens could vote via text message during November's presidential election Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This doctored image featuring the comedian Aziz Ansari was also posted to Twitter Image copyright US Senate Image caption Senator Chris Coons said this advert had been run by Russia to target Facebook users identified as being supportive of army veterans Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump was said to have retweeted a message from a fake account run by Russian agents Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An account titled Being Patriotic was used to publicise a "miners for Trump" event held in Pennsylvania in October 2016
Simon's Cat game app showed adult bite advert:::::Image copyright Strawdog Publishing Image caption The Simon's Cat game requires players to connect matching coloured treats The UK's advertising watchdog has intervened after an adult advert was shown within a video game app popular with children.The pop-up ad featured a "temporary tattoo" that looked like a deep bite mark, placed on a woman's shoulder.The imagery appeared in the match-puzzle title Simon's Cat Crunch Time in July.Wish.com, the retailer responsible for creating the ad, failed to respond to the complaint.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was concerned by the San Francisco-based company's lack of response and ordered the business to ensure its adverts were properly targeted in the future.Although the body does not have the power to impose fines itself, it can refer repeat offenders to Trading Standards, which can take further action.The game's publisher has also banned Wish.com from serving ads to its products in the future.'Red and bloody' The Simon's Cat game has a Pegi 3 rating - meaning it has been judged to be suitable for anyone above the age of three - and has been installed more than one million times on Android and iOS devices.As with many titles, adverts are automatically placed within the software by algorithms, which are supposed to screen out adult content.Image copyright Wish Image caption This Wish.com ad was spotted within the game app on 24 July The publisher, Strawdog Studios, told the ASA that it also had the power to remove ads manually.But it added that it relied on customer reports to flag unsuitable content, and had not been alerted to the tattoo image before the watchdog had become involved."We considered the app was likely to have strong appeal to children and therefore children were likely to have seen the ad," said the ASA in its ruling."We noted that it was not clear from the ad that the product shown was a fake tattoo and we considered that the image... which was red and bloody, might cause distress."The authority added that Wish.com was obliged to ensure the ad was not promoted again in an untargeted manner.The company - which describes itself as the world's sixth biggest e-commerce business - sent an automated response to the BBC when asked for comment but has yet to address the problem."The ASA has a growing problem with non-UK online businesses, who will sometimes take the view that a self-regulatory body can be ignored," said Andy Milmore, a partner at the law firm Harbottle & Lewis."This is especially so where the complaints relate to 'inappropriate' marketing, where the ultimate backstop of enforcement action under criminal statute is unlikely to apply."
Hilton Hotels fined for credit card data breaches:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hilton owns, manages or franchises 4,900 properties across the world The company behind Hilton Hotels is paying a $700,000 (525,000) fine after being accused of mishandling two separate credit card data breaches.The attacks were in 2014 and 2015.More than 363,000 accounts were put at risk, although it remains unclear whether the perpetrators managed to extract any details.US government investigators said the firm had taken too long to warn customers and had lacked adequate security measures.The penalty will be divided between the states of New York and Vermont.Their attorney generals agreed the settlement with the company, which operates properties under the Waldorf Astoria, Conrad Hotels and DoubleTree brands in addition to Hilton.Malware alerts The first of the two cases was discovered in February 2015, when Hilton learned that one of its UK-based systems was communicating with a suspicious computer outside its network.Checks revealed that credit-card targeting malware had infected its cash register computers, potentially exposing customers' card details between 18 November and 5 December 2014.In the second incident, an intrusion detection system alerted Hilton to another problem in July 2015.A subsequent probe revealed that payment card data had again been targeted by malware since April of the same year.Hilton only notified the public about the breaches in November 2015, which was more than nine months after the first discovery and more than three months after the second.By this point, there had already been media reports that several banks suspected card details had been stolen from payment systems used in Hilton gift shops and restaurants.Although the Virginia-headquartered firm still maintains it found no proof that any data had been stolen in either case, the attorney generals noted that the intruders had used anti-forensic tools that had made it impossible to determine exactly what had been done.As part of the settlement, Hilton has promised to disclose future breaches more quickly and to perform regular security tests, among other enhanced safety efforts."Hilton is strongly committed to protecting our customers' payment card information and maintaining the integrity of our systems," the company said in a statement.
Google investigates mysterious vanishing files:::::Image copyright Google Image caption Google Docs appears to be locking users out of files by flagging documents as violating its terms of services Numerous Google Docs users have reported being mysteriously locked out of certain files in their accounts.The error had caused files to be flagged as violating Google's terms of service.Users had received a message saying: "This item has been flagged as inappropriate and can no longer be shared."Google told the BBC that a code update had caused the error, but that the problem had now been resolved.Users had taken to Twitter to complain about the issue, saying that while they were working on documents the screen suddenly froze, and then a message came up telling them they could no longer access a file.Some people have also reported that another error prevented them from sending Google appeal requests to unlock their files.Other strange behaviour has been noticed on the service - one user, Iain Mackenzie, said the words "game is over" had flashed up in a Google Docs document he had been editing and then disappeared.Mr Mackenzie said that no other user had been in the file at the time, and that the Google Docs revisions log showed only he had been editing the document for the past few hours."This morning, we made a code push that incorrectly flagged a small percentage of Google Docs as abusive, which caused those documents to be automatically blocked," a Google spokeswoman told the BBC."A fix is in place and all users should have full access to their docs.Protecting users from viruses, malware, and other abusive content is central to user safety."We apologise for the disruption and will put processes in place to prevent this from happening again."
Explainer: What is Russia's new VPN law all about?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption EXPLAINED: What is a VPN service?A Russian law regulating the use of technologies enabling users to search the internet anonymously is coming into force on 1 November.Many are worried the law will make it harder for Russians to bypass internet censorship.Signed by President Vladimir Putin in July, the law imposes restrictions on proxy avoidance tools.These tools include virtual private networks (VPNs) and anonymous proxy servers (anonymisers).VPN providers will be obliged to closely cooperate with Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor and comply with its requests.What's a VPN?A VPN is a private network created over a public network.Despite popular belief, VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, because some VPN providers can keep users' logs.However, they can still increase a user's privacy and security by hiding their IP address.In a corporate work setting, VPNs allow employees to securely access an intranet from outside the office.Both VPNs and anonymisers allow a user to appear as if they were connecting to the internet from another location.What exactly is banned?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Under the new law, VPNs can be used only to access websites not banned by Russia Despite widespread speculation, the law does not directly ban the operation of VPNs and anonymisers.However, it does restrict access to banned websites with the help of these tools.VPN providers will get access to Roskomnadzor's blacklist of banned websites and will be entitled to provide the use of their servers "within the legal framework", the banki.ru banking portal reports.Leonid Levin, the head of the Russian State Duma's information policy committee, has previously said the law is meant to block access only to "unlawful content" and is not intended to impose restrictions on law-abiding citizens, according to business daily RBC.Will it work?Roskomnadzor has been developing measures to identify suspect websites, as well as ways to block them.However, in practice this is very difficult, and it may have unwanted consequences.For instance, the watchdog has a single register of banned domain names.In June, one of Google.ru's web pages contained a redirect to a blocked online gambling domain, so due to the ban, the search engine was blocked for several hours.Image copyright Tor Project Image caption The Tor Project is free software and an accompanying network that lets people visit websites anonymously According to IT experts, the law provides exemption for corporate VPNs.However, it remains unclear how exactly Roskomnadzor will distinguish between corporate and public VPNs.At present, it is impossible to differentiate them, says Leonid Yevdokimov, an expert at the Tor Project - a US-based team that creates software to let people visit websites anonymously and access otherwise hidden parts of the net.What will happen?Some Russian social-media users have been agonising over whether the watchdog will now be able to restrict internet access from home if they search for a banned website.IT experts are unanimous that it will not.It is up to search engine operators such as Google and Yandex to "shield" users from such banned websites, and if they fail to do so, they can be held responsible, banki.ru says.Most lay internet users would not notice any changes once the law came into force, the communications director at media holding Rambler&Co, Matvei Alexeyev, told the BBC.He sees it as a step towards greater transparency of VPN servers.
Hunt challenges social media giants on cyber-bullying:::::Image copyright Getty Images Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is meeting social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, to challenge them on cyber-bullying.In tweets ahead of the discussions, he says some responsibility for rising rates of youth self-harm lies with social platforms.He says the industry must be "part of the solution" regarding young people's mental health.Social media companies have said they do prioritise user safety.Mr Hunt will be meeting representatives from the biggest providers of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft.Mr Hunt said: "Social media has become a fundamental part of our children's lives and while the internet provides amazing opportunities we cannot ignore the negative effect disturbing images and bullying are having on their mental health."Now is the time to turn the tide on this abuse.I will be working closely with the top social media companies to ensure they can become the solution and not the problem."Skip Twitter post by @Jeremy_Hunt We should not'accept' cyber bullying as inevitable but STOP it - my message to social media giants when I meet them for roundtable tomorrow.Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) October 31, 2017 Report Mr Hunt will ask the social media companies: If they can share statistics on how often cyber-bullying happens on their platforms, and what form it takes.If they have information on the number of underage users, and what can be done to prevent them accessing services.Whether it is possible to identify unhealthy online behaviour among teenagers.And take action to try to provide advice and support.A Facebook spokesperson said: "We want to make sure that everyone, including anyone affected by a mental health issue, has a good experience on Facebook and Instagram."We look forward to working with ministers and others to make sure we do everything we can to protect people's wellbeing."We have already introduced online tools such as Instagram's automated offensive comment filter and last month launched a new partnership between Facebook, Childnet International and The Diana Award, which is offering every UK secondary school the chance to have a young digital safety ambassador who can support their peers' safety and well-being."Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has previously been rated as the worst social media platform when it comes to impact on young people's mental health, in a poll of people aged 14-24.Instagram responded by saying it provided tools and information on how to cope with bullying and warned users before they viewed certain content.'Take responsibility' Dr Marc Bush, chief policy adviser at charity YoungMinds, said social media companies had an important role to play in tackling online bullying, but education was also crucial."This means ensuring that young people learn about the positives and negatives of social media from a young age and that they know what to do if they're being harassed or come across upsetting content."It also means encouraging young people to take responsibility for their own behaviour and to understand what the impact might be on other people of what they post."

Airbnb customer allegedly murdered in Melbourne:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man was allegedly murdered while staying in an Airbnb property in Melbourne, Australia A man has allegedly been murdered while staying in an Airbnb-listed property in Melbourne, Australia.Ramis Jonuzi, 36, had rented a room in the house in Brighton East, Melbourne, paying less than A$30 (18) a night.As he was trying to leave the property after a week on Wednesday 25 October, he was allegedly attacked and later died in hospital.Three men who also lived in the property have been charged with murder, and one has also been accused of rape.Craig Levy, 36, Ryan Smart, 37, and Jason Colton, 41, did not apply for bail when they appeared at Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Friday.A spokesman for Airbnb told Australian daily newspaper the Age that the room-rental service was "deeply saddened and outraged" by the tragedy."The family will have our full support and our hearts go out to them and all of his friends," the spokesman said."We have removed this listing from our platform and will fully co-operate with law enforcement on their investigation."There is no place on Airbnb for such an abhorrent act, which violates everything our global community stands for."Mr Jonuzi, a bricklayer, had rented the room because he wanted cheap and stable accommodation while he dealt with some "personal issues", according to the Age.However, not long into his stay, he told a friend that he planned to move out early, because he didn't like the "energy" in the house.He allegedly argued with his three housemates over money, and then decided to cut his stay short.On Wednesday night, he packed his belongings, loaded them into his car and was about to leave when he was allegedly attacked on the front lawn of the property.Paramedics failed to revive him and he was taken to hospital suffering from heart failure, where he died.Mr Levy, the Airbnb host, and Mr Smart were charged with murder.Mr Colton was charged with murder and rape.The accused men have been remanded into custody and are next due to appear in court on 22 March 2018.
'I didn't realise it was going to be part of my entrapment':::::Image caption Beth Ashley and Euleen Hope both experienced technological abuse by former partners Women's charity Refuge is warning about the rise of "tech abuse" - the use of technology to spy on or harass a partner.Many victims of domestic violence report being either being harassed via online messages or having their activity monitored via their phones.However, many do not report it to the police, the charity said.Euleen Hope was a technophobe who escaped the control of her tech-savvy abusive ex-partner after 10 years.He set up her email and social media accounts for her, which meant he had full access to them.He also replaced her flip-phone with an iPhone which he then set up to be mirrored on to the pair's iPad so he could monitor her calls and messages, and activated the phone's location-tracker saying it would help her to get the bus."You wouldn't think he was doing anything bad, he showed you what he was doing," she said."I didn't realise it was going to be part of my entrapment."When she noticed things such as the iPad ringing when her phone rang, her ex told her he was just testing a new app.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Euleen Hope's ex-partner set up cameras in the couple's house He also installed cameras around the house under the guise of security."My twin sister came round one day to visit.Normally if my friends or family came over he would sit in the room with us," she recalled."This time he said he would leave us to catch up and said he would use his computer in the kitchen upstairs."I moved behind the camera and told my sister to keep talking, I went up the stairs and saw him listening to what he thought was our conversation."Ms Hope's former partner was also physically and emotionally abusive and eventually served a prison sentence for assault and GBH.Refuge is teaming up with Google to train its staff to better support victims who contact it as part of a new programme."Domestic violence is the biggest issue which impacts on the police," said Dame Vera Baird, police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, speaking at the project launch."Every 30 seconds there is a domestic violence call.Two years ago, it was every minute."Northumbria's police force gets 32,000 calls a year and that's maybe a fifth or a quarter of what is actually going on."Image copyright Google Image caption Dame Vera said the Northumbria Police force receives 32,000 domestic violence calls per year A 2016 survey by Comic Relief found that four out of five women who experienced abuse said their partner monitored their activity.Twenty-year-old blogger Beth Ashley said a former boyfriend had no interest in tech until she tried to end their relationship because he was controlling and sexually abusive."When I got with him he didn't even have a phone," she said."I thought he was a massive technophobe until we broke up.Suddenly he started all these social media accounts and used them as a harassment tool."Image copyright Google Image caption Beth Ashley said her work as a blogger meant she could not delete her online presence to hide from her ex-boyfriend She says he also sent her a suicide note via Facebook Messenger along with graphic images of self-harm, which she later discovered he had found online."I went round the next day and he was just sitting there on his Xbox," she said.She says he would regularly turn up where she worked and she would end her shift to find 50 messages from him on her phone.Ms Ashley was very active on social media because of her work as a blogger and online writer."There were times when I wanted to delete the blog, the magazines," she said."I have these random moments of wanting to be invisible.Considering my job, that would be awful."Ms Ashley says that she had to block old friends on social media in case one of them accidentally gave him information about her activities.After reporting him to the police, the online harassment stopped, she said."But the paranoia stayed for a long time," she added.Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the charity had seen a case where a man had hacked the CCTV at the pub where his wife worked so he could monitor her, and another who put a tracker on his partner's car, moved it and then accused her of losing it."She thought she was losing her mind," she said."Technological abuse is part of a broader pattern of domestic violence."This project was born out of our clients' experiences of technology-related abuse, and we will continue to make sure their needs and experiences shape our work in the years ahead."

Game studio CCP scales back virtual reality development:::::Image copyright CCP Games Image caption CCP also made the Sparc ball-tossing game for the PlayStation VR headset Developer CCP Games has significantly cut the time and money it is investing in virtual-reality based games.The Iceland-based studio is best known for sci-fi title Eve Online but has also created several VR-centred games.Spaceship dog-fighting simulator Eve Valkyrie helped launch the Oculus Rift headset and CCP also made the Sparc VR ball-tossing game for the PlayStation.CCP boss Hilmar Petursson said the company would re-invest in VR when market conditions improved.The move was a "blow to the viability of VR as a major gaming platform", said Adam Smith on the Rock, Paper Shotgun gaming news website, adding that Valkyrie was one of the few games that tempted him to try VR.The changes come just over a month after CCP overhauled Valkyrie in a bid to get more people playing it.Niche market CCP has cut its investment in VR as part of a broader restructuring effort.The structural changes mean more focus on PC and mobile games, it said in a statement.It is closing its Atlanta, US, office and selling off the development studio it maintains in Newcastle.The VR development work done at both locations will move to London.About 30 jobs are being lost during the restructure, it added, saying that it had given staff "severance packages" and would help them find other work.A potential buyer had been found for the Newcastle office, said CCP, adding that negotiations over the sale were continuing.The changes would have no immediate impact on Eve Valkyrie, said CCP, and a planned winter update for the game would be available as expected.Similarly, it said, Sparc development would continue in London.Image copyright GLENN CHAPMAN Image caption Eve Valkyrie was one of the key demo games for the Oculus headset "Today we have made tough, but important, changes to CCP in response to how we see the gaming market evolving in the coming years," said Mr Petursson."We have been front and centre in the second wave of VR and our belief in the long-term transformative power of the technology remains strong," he said, adding that it would not make "material VR investments" until the market grew substantially.CCP would now concentrate more on Eve Online and the new games emerging from that title, he said.Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit, said CCP took a "calculated risk" with its early VR investment, hoping that the expertise it built up would pay off as VR games became more popular."Unfortunately, adoption of high-end headsets - through which most VR games are being bought - has been a mixed bag since launch," he said.IHS Markit estimates that about 2.4 million PC headsets will have been sold by the end of 2017, said Mr Harding-Rolls."Although millions of users is a respectable number to target, when compared to other platforms, most games publishers would consider that level of adoption small and niche," he added.This explained why CCP had switched to concentrate on the PC and mobile markets which have hundreds of millions of potential players, he said.
Drone delivers food to Japan town hit by nuclear disaster:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The town of Odaka in Fukushima was devastated by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami Drones are delivering food to residents of a Japanese town devastated by the Fukushima nuclear disaster where access to shops is limited.Residents were allowed to return to the Minamisoma area last year but obtaining supplies can be difficult.Operators of the drone food delivery service said it was the first of its kind in Japan.A 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima triggered the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.Convenience store chain Lawson has worked with e-commerce firm Rakuten and this week launched a drone service in the Odaka district of the city of Minamisoma, which has a large population of older people.The district is roughly within a 20km radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Power Station, the site of the nuclear disaster triggered by an earthquake and tsunami six years ago.People were forced to leave their homes because of radiation concerns.The Japanese government lifted an evacuation order for Minamisoma in October 2016 and allowed residents move back to the area following decontamination efforts."The town is starting to regain its former liveliness as its residents continue to return home," Lawson spokesperson Ken Mochimaru told the BBC."However, improving the shopping environment for daily necessities, food, and other products represents a high-priority challenge," he said.The drone service is designed to help.Shoppers can order hot food like fried chicken and household items, which are sent from a nearby Lawson store to a mobile food van that operates at a community centre in the area.The companies are trialling the service for the next six months.Image copyright Lawson Image caption Operators said the drone food delivery service was the first of its kind in Japan The drone can carry up to 2kg of goods.As well as its shops, Lawson operates mobile vans across Japan, particularly in rural and mountainous regions where access is difficult, as well as serving ageing populations in urban areas.More than a quarter of Japan's population is aged over 65, and set to increase over the next two decades, as the total number of people in the country shrinks.
Big net firms invest in trans-Pacific cable project:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption It can take years to lay the lengthy cables that connect up the continents Facebook and Amazon are putting cash into a project to lay a new submarine cable that will link Asia and the US.Once completed in 2020, the Jupiter cable will stretch for more than 14,000km and will be able to carry more than 60 terabits of data a second.The two firms have joined Jupiter as part of plans to build their own global networks and cut data transport costs.The cable is one of many in which the net's biggest firms, including Google and Microsoft, have recently invested.Network edges "There's a bit of a boom in terms of the internet content providers taking a leading role in the development of new submarine cable systems," said Alan Mauldin, research director at analyst firm Telegeography.The big net firms were involved in about 16 separate cabling ventures, he said, and used the capacity to handle the massive amounts of data their users generate.Some projects have already been completed but most are due to start carrying data sometime in the next few years.The net firms were most interested in joining projects that lay cables across the Pacific, the Atlantic and Asia, he said.They have acquired capacity on many other cables around the world as well."They started years ago building their own networks because the scale that they need is bigger than a carrier can provide," he added."Having a global backbone network is a big cost for them."By running their own networks, big net firms gain control over the system, keep costs low and get some redundancy in case of problems, he said."Cables do break sometimes so you need multiple paths and alternatives," he said.Net giants are involved in lots of cable-laying projects Google - Unity, SJC, Faster, Monet, Tannat, Junior, PLCN, Indigo-West, Indigo-Central Facebook - AEConnect, APG, Marea, PLCN, Jupiter Microsoft - Hibernia Express, AEConnect, New Cross Pacific, Marea Amazon - Hawaiki, Jupiter Traditional telecoms firms were also investing in the cable-laying projects to help boost their own trans-ocean bandwidth, he said.Although the big net firms have colossal data needs, they could not use all the bandwidth available on the submarine cables.Mr Mauldin said the data needs of search firms, social networks and cloud providers were growing rapidly while some others, such as Netflix, did not have to splash out on large networks to handle their traffic.Netflix avoided high bandwidth costs by pushing all its content out to the edges of the network where it is stored ready for use.This worked, he said, because an episode of a TV show or a film would not change much once it was made and shipped out to media servers.By contrast, he said, the dynamic content seen on Facebook had to be updated constantly feeding a demand for more bandwidth.
YouTuber Calum McSwiggan slams 'money-grabbing' Hello World Live event organisers:::::YouTuber Calum McSwiggan has slammed the organisers of the Hello World Live vlogger convention - after it was called a rip-off and "completely flat and dull" by some ticket-holders.The two-day event was billed as a "live event like nothing on Earth".But Calum McSwiggan blames event organisers, who he says "just had pound signs in their eyes"."The YouTube community has a really bad reputation sometimes and it's because of events like Hello World."The organisers have apologised after receiving complaints from fans."It's a really big deal for [fans] to meet their favourite YouTube stars and take photos with them," says Calum, who didn't attend the event at the Genting Arena in Birmingham."That's what they were promised and they just weren't given that and it's heartbreaking."The sad thing is, I'm guessing the YouTubers who attended weren't actually paid very much themselves - it's the people who put on the event who are lining their pockets."He also says that the event only adds to "this idea that YouTubers are just out there to grab people's money".Hello World posted an apology on its Facebook page.and has said that it will issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.Peter is one of the parents who has asked for a refund after he bought tickets for his daughter's 13th birthday."It was just completely flat and dull, and void of any atmosphere," he tells Newsbeat."There were arcade games that didn't work, there was no street carnival, there were no street rides, there was no aftershow party as advertised."It was just so poor for the price, it was unbelievable."Tickets for the event - which took place on Saturday and Sunday - were on sale for between 27.50 and 99, plus a booking fee.Jason Perrie, the creative director of the event, says he was "incredibly sorry to hear that anyone didn't have a great experience" and claims the majority of people did."We didn't promise anybody that you'd be meeting and greeting people," he tells Newsbeat."It was a different style of entertaining people - where people had to find their own way of finding their entertainment rather than be guided."While he says that many of the YouTubers "just got train fares and hotel rooms" paid for, he also says that the event also won't make money "in the first few years".He wants disappointed ticket holders to come back next year."We'll spoil them and look after them and really make it up to them."But not everyone had a bad experience.Collette McLean, 30, travelled from Leicester with her younger sister."Teenagers expect to get involved in everything and meet everyone but it's not realistic at such a large event.You make your own experience," she says."When YouTubers did come out they where mobbed and the younger audience ruined it for themselves."Collette paid for the VIP tour, and said: "Jim Chapman was our tour guide and he was brilliant - we also met Joe Sugg and he was amazing."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
North Korea calls UK WannaCry accusations 'wicked':::::Image copyright WEBROOT Image caption WannaCry spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide attack North Korea has hit back at the UK government for accusing it of being behind a massive ransomware attack that badly affected the National Health Service (NHS).A UK government minister last week told the BBC he was "as sure as possible" North Korea was behind the attack.But a North Korean spokesman called the accusations "groundless speculation".More than a third of NHS trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware in May.At least 19,000 appointments were cancelled and computers in over 600 doctor's surgeries infected.WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date and also spread to more than 150 countries.A spokesman for the North's Korea-Europe Association called the UK's accusation "a wicked attempt" to tighten international sanctions on the country."This is an act beyond the limit of our tolerance and it makes us question the real purpose behind the UK's move," he said in comments carried on the Korean Central News Agency on Monday.The South Korean government believes the North has a unit of 6,800 trained cyber-warfare specialists.Pyongyang's cyber military was thought to be behind an online attack on Sony Pictures and a hack last year in which blueprints of a South Korean warship company were stolen.
Apple engineer 'fired' over early iPhone X leak:::::Image copyright YouTube Image caption Ms Peterson posted a follow-up video explaining what had happened to her dad Apple has reportedly fired one of its engineers after his daughter posted a video of the iPhone X before the official launch.The YouTube video was shot on the Apple campus in September when the young woman met her father for lunch.The video was widely shared after being spotted by tech news sites and blogs that watch Apple.She said her father was fired for breaking Apple's strict policy that bans filming on its campus.Apple has not yet confirmed that the man has been fired nor responded to a request for comment.No grudge News of the firing emerged when Brooke Peterson posted a follow-up video explaining why the original, in which she was seen trying out the iPhone X, was no longer available.Ms Peterson said Apple had asked for the "innocent" video to be taken down and said that its posting had led to her father being fired.Although Ms Peterson removed the video from her YouTube pages it has been widely copied online.The video shows Ms Peterson trying out the iPhone X while eating lunch with her father.This demo also inadvertently revealed some Apple employee only QR codes and a text file of codenames for unreleased Apple devices."At the end of the day when you work for Apple, it doesn't matter how good of a person you are, if you break a rule, they just have no tolerance," said Ms Peterson."Apple really did like my dad.And they let him go.Because he broke a rule," she said."It was an innocent mistake, and he fully apologises."Mr Peterson is believed to have been employed at Apple for four years and worked on the iPhone's radio frequency and wireless technologies.Ms Peterson added that the family bore Apple no grudge and that her father was going to be "OK".
Samsung Electronics unveils new leadership line-up:::::Image copyright Getty Images Samsung Electronics has named its new leadership team following the resignation of CEO Kwon Oh-hyun.Three executives have been promoted to joint chief executives of the firm as part of the management overhaul.The shake-up came hours after the firm reported quarterly profits had nearly tripled from a year ago.Net profit rose to 11.2 trillion won ($10bn; 7.6bn) during July to September, driven by strong memory chip and smartphone sales.New leadership The new appointees are all in their 50s and include Kim Ki-nam, Koh Dong-jin and Kim Hyun-suk.They will take up their positions immediately as the heads of Samsung Electronics' three main businesses - Device Solutions, IT and Mobile Communications and Consumer Electronics."The next generation of leaders are well suited to accelerate the pace of innovation and address the demands of the connected world," the firm said in a statement.The South Korean tech giant also confirmed that its chief financial officer Lee Sang-hoon had been recommended as the new chairman of the board, and that long-time co-CEOs J.K. Shin and Yoon Boo-keun would step down.It is the first time the chairman role has not been given to one of the firm's three chief executives.The firm is striving to regain the confidence of the government and financial markets in the aftermath of the corruption scandal in which the Samsung Group's heir apparent Lee Jae-yong was jailed for bribery and corruption.Image copyright EPA Image caption Samsung's heir apparent, Lee Jae-yong has appealed against his five year jail term for bribery and corruption Unprecedented crisis The leadership shake-up began about a fortnight ago when Mr Kwon became the first of the firm's three chief executives to resign, citing an "unprecedented crisis".At the time, he said the company's current profitability was "merely a fruit of decisions and investment made in the past".His resignation came days after Mr Lee began an appeal against his conviction and five year jail sentence, stemming from payments to the secret confidante of South Korea's ousted president Park Geun-Hye.Samsung Electronics is regarded as the jewel in the crown of the Samsung conglomerate, which is made up of 60 interlinked companies.Record result Samsung Electronics described its latest quarterly result as a "robust performance" overall.The world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker expects strong demand for its products to continue, putting it on track for a record annual profit.It will also pay around $26bn in dividends to shareholders over the next three years.While memory chips were the main driver of Samsung's earnings, its mobile phone business was given a boost by its new Note 8 smartphone which received the firm's highest number of pre-orders.It marks a significant turnaround for the firm which was hit badly by the global recall of its flagship Note 7 smartphone in 2016, following the fiasco with its overheating and exploding batteries.
Fixed-odds maximum bet 'could drop to £2':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I was completely caught up in gambling' The maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals could drop to as little as 2 under a government review.Currently, people can bet up to 100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, but ministers are considering a new limit somewhere between 2 and 50.The consultation aims to reduce the risk of people suffering large losses and to tighten up advertising rules.The Association of British Bookmakers said the onus was on the gambling industry to help cut problem gambling.According to a government consultation, cutting the stake to 2 would cost the industry over the next 10 years.But problem gamblers say it is time for action to be taken - including, but not only, lessening the amount they can lose in one hit.Gambling vlogger Andrew Margett told BBC Radio 5live how the machines, also known as FOBTs, proved addictive: "I was just in a trance, in a complete bubble, playing it.Hitting the button, hitting the button, hitting the button."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Nick Eardley explains how the machines work As part of the government review: The Gambling Commission - the industry's regulator - will consult on changes to protect online players.Broadcasters, advertisers, industry and support groups will draw up an advertising campaign to promote responsible gambling, with an annual budget of up to 7m.New advertising guidelines will be drafted to protect problem gamblers, children and young people.Access by under-18s to gambling content and channels on social media will be restricted.Gambling companies are being told to step up funding for research, education and treatment.If they don't, operators may face a levy.Culture minister Tracey Crouch said current laws on gaming machines - which critics have called the "crack cocaine of gambling" - were "inappropriate"."It is vital that we strike the right balance between socially responsible growth and protecting the most vulnerable, including children, from gambling-related harm," she said."We have seen online gambling grow rapidly and we need to protect players in this space, while also making sure those experiencing harm relating to gambling receive the help they need," she said.But in an urgent question session in the Commons, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said the government was kicking the issue into "the long grass" and added that action, rather than a consultation, was needed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Bookies have won' over fixed-odds machines "There's an old maxim that the bookies always win, and they've won again today," he said.Mr Watson, who is also Labour's deputy leader, claimed that 450,000 children are gambling on a weekly basis.Labour wants a new gambling bill to look at the explosion of digital and online products - to stop children gambling on phones and to protect vulnerable people.Carolyn Harris MP, who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on the issues involved, said there was overwhelming evidence people's lives were being destroyed by the machines."When you see the statistics that 31% per cent of people who use these machines are earning less than 10,000... Where do they get the money?Because they are not earning it," she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme.The government began to look again at gambling in October 2016, when it made a "call for evidence" on the number and location of gaming machines and the measures in place to protect players.Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops from 1999, and offer computerised games including roulette and blackjack at the touch of a button.The government is consulting on 11 different types of gaming machine, with stakes ranging from 30p to 5.Each machine accepts bets up to a pre-set maximum and pays out according to fixed odds on the simulated outcomes of games.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the brain of a gambling addict 'Reducing FOBT odds is a matter of principle', by Amol Rajan, media editor Like every other industry, gambling has been radically transformed by technology.The advent of smartphones has made gambling much easier, more convenient, and constantly present than it was before.For centuries, gambling was for the most part an activity or habit that you had to move towards.Now, thanks to the internet, the gambling comes to you.It is dangerous to reduce the debate of FOBTs to one about economics: how much is raised in tax revenue; potential job losses; the impact on our high streets and so on.It is rather also a question of principle.In a free or liberal society, is it reasonable to let fully informed adults of sound mind make their own decisions about how to spend - and yes, waste - their money?Perhaps it is; but it becomes intolerable when this freedom harms others.It seems that public opinion has moved to the view that negative social consequences and harm have flowed from the gambling industry's tendency to cluster in areas of deprivation and high unemployment.Malcolm George, of the Association of British Bookmakers, said the government shared its wish to identify problem gamblers and get them help.But restricting terminals in betting shops would redirect problem gamblers to other avenues where there were fewer controls on the amount of gambling, he said."Just as alcohol policy in this country is not solely determined by alcoholics" he added, there needs to be an environment for the "vast majority who gamble responsibly".The British Amusement Catering Trade Association's John White said the government needed to "strike the right balance", but stakes should be "quite substantially" reduced, he said.Asked about job loss fears, he said half of high street adult gaming centres had disappearing since FOBTs were introduced.Tax law changes in 2001 led to a vast increase in the number of terminals.By 2005, about 20,000 terminals were in use and more than 34,000 are now found across the UK, according to the Gambling Commission.
YouTube tweaks advertising algorithm:::::Image copyright YouTube Image caption Film-maker Casey Neistat called on YouTube to do more to support video creators YouTube is tweaking the way it chooses which videos will have adverts shown with them.The update comes after YouTube made changes to the way videos were monetised, to stop ads appearing alongside extremist content.The changes prompted complaints from some popular vloggers, saying it made it hard for them to earn money.The improved algorithm should mean more videos were classified as suitable for ads, YouTube said.Millions more In April and May this year, YouTube acted after investigations revealed that ads for big brands were being regularly shown on racist videos or those that encouraged violence against particular groups.One consequence of the changes was that videos created by many popular YouTubers no longer ran with ads because the algorithm flagged them as not being "family friendly".High-profile YouTubers criticised the site for the way it had handled the changes.Many said they had been left confused about what criteria would lead to a video no longer getting ads.In response, YouTube created a system that let creators appeal if the algorithm decided that they could not monetise a video.Humans reviewed the decision to see if a video had been wrongly classified.In a blog, the company said it had taken information from the appeals made over the past few months to update its algorithm so it correctly classified more videos."As a result, there will be a 30% reduction in the number of videos receiving limited ads as they move to being fully monetised," said YouTube."In other words, millions more videos will become fully monetised."Anyone who believed videos were still being wrongly classified should continue to appeal, so the algorithm could continue to be trained, it said.
Is your phone listening in? Your stories:::::Image copyright Getty Images Facebook has always denied using smartphone microphones to gather audio from people's real-life conversations and then use that data to serve advertising.Last week Facebook's vice-president of ads, Rob Goldman, said on Twitter that the technology giant did not and had never carried out the practice."Just not true," he tweeted in response to a call for people's stories of occasions when they believed it had happened.Given the amount of online advertising that people see every day, there is a strong argument that it is pure coincidence - that perhaps the advert has been served before unobserved and is only now noticeable because of an unrelated discussion.However, there are those who are convinced that they have experienced it.Here are some of the stories you told us.We saw wedding ads before we announced our engagement "My fiancee and I both had wedding ads the day after we got engaged, before we had told anyone," said Nate, from Springfield, in the US.Image copyright Getty Images "We bought the ring in the spur of the moment and never looked anything related up."And even two weeks ago my fiancee and I went to a friend's and drank a certain kind of liquor neither of us had ever bought or talked about on the phone, and the next morning it was the first ad Facebook showed her."My hearing aid kept connecting to my phone "In 2016, I lost the hearing in my right ear.I was given a 'made for iPhone' compatible hearing aid," said Jon, in the US."This meant I could take calls, stream music, et cetera from my new hearing aid."Whenever the phone connected to the hearing aid, there would be an audible change, like a little click, because it would be switching from streaming the world around me to audio from the hearing aid."This worked in reverse too, with a microphone."In both the Facebook Messenger app for iOS and the main Facebook app, I would hear that click, the flipping over of the audio source for my hearing aid, at inexplicable times, including when I had audio from apps disabled."My jokey career move appeared in an ad Image copyright Getty Images "Just last week I left my employment and was sat with my friend having a chat about which direction I was going to go in," said Lindsey, in Lincoln."I said, 'I like coffee, I might just end up at Starbucks so I can drink more coffee.'"Next time I checked my Facebook on my phone, [I saw] a Starbucks advert as they were holding an open event in London to find new staff."Bin storage suddenly popped up after a chat "I recently had an extremely bizarre and unsettling experience with some targeted advertising that felt like more than coincidence, after a voice call on WhatsApp," said Olivia, from Austin.Image copyright Getty Images "I was catching up with a friend who lives in London and she told me a story about how her new landlord purchased an outdoor storage shed for their bins (a product that I think is rather uniquely British)."We had a good laugh about that, and I expressed how I needed something similar here in Texas."The next day as I was scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed I came across an ad from Wayfair advertising a storage shed for outdoor bins and was immediately taken aback."Before our conversation happened, this was not a product that I even knew existed."Two mattress ads in five minutes "Debated this at a bar with some friends... to test it and settle the debate, we got a random product type from another table: a new mattress," said Justin, in Atlanta.Image copyright Getty Images "As I had not bought, searched for, or even thought about a new bed in several years and I couldn't remember seeing a mattress ad online ever, we started talking about beds and mattresses and guessing keywords, like slipping 'California king' and 'buy a mattress online' into the conversation, while intermittently scrolling facebook."Two mattress ads in five minutes.None before that conversation."Ads appeared in Spanish "I work in the mobile industry and I've noticed this happening more and more over the last few years," wrote Michael, from Grimsby."To put it to the test I started learning Spanish on Duolingo, and within one day I had adverts for normal products in Spanish!It was absolutely unbelievable."Home security became an ad "I visited a friend who was setting up security cameras at her house," Melissa, from Australia, wrote."I have never used the internet to look at anything remotely linked to home security, yet less than an hour after discussing how to set up the cameras, I had a Facebook ad for home security cameras."My phone had been in my pocket the whole time."Eyesight ads but I have perfect vision "Once, my friend was over and he discussed that he needed Lasik eye surgery," said Austin, from Tigard, Oregon."Immediately after, I went on Facebook and a Lasik advertisement appeared.Image copyright Getty Images "I have perfect eyesight, have never searched Lasik ever before."Bug killer I'd never seen before "I saw a product at school called the Bug-a-salt salt shooting gun, used for killing flies," said Peter, "something I'd never seen before, nor have I searched for any related products."That night I was telling my wife about the product in a personal conversation."The following morning after the conversation with my wife about the product, my Facebook opened with an ad from Amazon with the Bug-a-salt fly killer gun listed as 'things you may be interested in'."It's happened more than once "I have experienced several instances of ads that relate to a conversation that I was having or had just finished," said Faris, from Cairo."I was talking to my wife about a second child, and on that day there were ads related to the topic."We talked about a friend's brother who had passed away, and immediately one of the guys we were talking to found ads for undertakers."We were talking about the possibility of a Six Flags theme park being opened in Egypt, and on my Facebook that night were ads for Six Flags."
Smartphone use falls among young for first time:::::Image caption June King is in almost constant contact with her phone Are we seeing the start of peak phone?For the first time, young people in the UK aged between 16 to 24 are spending slightly less time on their smart devices, according to a report.Market researcher Kantar TNS found that those within that group now spent an average of 3.8 hours on their phones a day down from 3.9 hours last year.And this may be a surprise to parents, but a third of those said they thought they spent too much time on their phones and wanted to cut down.That of course leaves the other two thirds.June King, who is 24 years old, says she has not cut down her usage: "It's part of my life, I just use it all the time.I think I'm on it for 12 hours a day!"The only thing that worries me is electro-magnetic waves at night.So I try to keep it away from me while I sleep."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The average smartphone use across all generations is 2.4 hours a day The group with the biggest growth in smartphone use are pensioners, according to the research.Kantar TNS said the amount of time the older generation in the UK spent on their phones had rocketed between this year and last year, from 36 minutes to 54 minutes a day globally.The average use across all generations is 2.4 hours a day.Ann Morseby, who is in her 60s, says her usage remains fairly modest, about 40 minutes a day, but it is creeping up."I check my emails more frequently, although I still mostly use it for texting.I have started playing games more on it, though, so perhaps those 40 minutes are actually more like an hour," she says.Can't live The slight fall in smartphone use among the young in the UK does not mean the appetite for connectivity is still anything less than voracious.The vast majority of under-24s - 94% - have a smartphone, and one device is often not enough.Some 40% of 16 to 24 year-olds use multiple devices at the same time when they're online.Kantar's research found that over half of 16 to 24 year-olds (52%) don't think they could live without social media and 84% use social media on a daily basis - up from 75% in 2015.
Heathrow probe after 'security files found on USB stick':::::Image copyright Reuters Heathrow Airport says it has launched an internal investigation after a USB stick containing security information was reportedly found on the street.The Sunday Mirror reported that the USB stick had 76 folders with maps, videos and documents, including details of measures used to protect the Queen.A man found it in west London and handed it into the paper, it said.Heathrow said all of its security plans had been reviewed and it was "confident" the airport was secure."We have also launched an internal investigation to understand how this happened and are taking steps to prevent a similar occurrence in future," it said.The Sunday Mirror said there were at least 174 documents on the stick, which it said was found on the pavement, and some were marked as "confidential" or "restricted", but could be read.Some files disclosed the types of ID needed to access restricted areas, a timetable of security patrols and maps pinpointing CCTV cameras, the paper said.One document highlighted recent terror attacks and talked about the type of threat the airport could face, it said.The information has been passed to Heathrow intelligence chiefs, the Sunday Mirror said.The statement from the airport said Heathrow's "top priority" was the safety and security of passengers and staff."The UK and Heathrow have some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world, and we remain vigilant to evolving threats by updating our procedures on a daily basis."
UK must prepare for fourth industrial revolution, says report:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK must do more to take advantage of technology such as robotics, a report says Advanced digital technology could give UK manufacturing a huge boost and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, a new report claims.The independent review, chaired by the head of Siemens UK, highlights the benefits of robotics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence.But Juergen Maier said the UK needed "greater ambition" to take advantage of such technology.And he said a huge number of workers would need to be retrained.His report calls for a commission to help businesses adjust to changing technologies.The report, Made Smarter, brought together executives from companies such as Rolls Royce, GKN and IBM, with representatives from small firms as well as academics from the universities of Newcastle and Cambridge.Its recommendations will help inform the government's industrial strategy plans.Professor Maier told the BBC's Today programme the transition would mean job losses: "On the one hand it is going to create productivity and more exports and through that we can create more jobs but at the same time robotics and artificial intelligence will displace some jobs."The best thing we can do is to make ourselves ready for it in a very proactive way and that means training our people... we need to up skill one million existing workers in the industrial and manufacturing sector... so they can transition from tasks that might be displaced to, for example, managing or programming robots."The report proposes: More targeted support for companies, re-skilling workers, and a National Adoption Programme piloted in the north west Five digital research centres to improve innovation and capability A national commission in charge of turning Britain into a global leader in industrial digital technologies The proposals were backed by CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn, who warned about the UK's international competition."The UK must compete with China, the USA and much of Europe where there are already advanced plans to embrace the fourth industrial revolution," she said.Sean Redmond, chief executive of software firm Vertizan and a contributor to the report, said the UK needed to "catch up with international competitors"."Smaller businesses that are growing at scale, especially industrial companies, need support learning about how digitalisation can help their business grow," he said.
Three criticised over £117 iPhone X monthly deal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Dave Lee gets hands on with the new iPhone X Three has announced a 117 ($150) per month contract for the iPhone X.It's been described as "extreme" and "crazy" on social media.The two-year deal, which includes unlimited data and talk time, is for the largest version of the device.The same contract with an iPhone 8 costs 44 per month, plus a 99 upfront fee.The handset is sold by Apple for 1,149 but under Three's deal customers could end up paying more than 2,100, based on its current sim-only charges.Three's current all-inclusive sim-only deal is 29 per month.The firm said it had various tariffs to suit different customers."There are a small amount of people that prefer not to pay an upfront cost yet want access to all-you-can eat data, minutes and texts and this is aimed at them," Three told the BBC.There are cheaper alternatives, it added."If that was an electrical retailer's 'interest rate' there'd be outrage," tweeted Michael Firth."No phone is worth over 30 [per month] in my opinion," tweeted The Cyber Heartbeat.Smartphone price barriers Other operators are offering the device on a monthly contract ranging between 80 and 88 but are also often charging an additional upfront payment.O2 is charging 86 per month plus a one-off 119.99 for a similar deal with 50GB data on the larger phone.Vodafone does not offer unlimited data either but its most expensive tariff is 80 per month plus a 100 charge for 60GB per month of data.The phone is currently available to pre-order only.Apple's pricing for the iPhone X had already shifted smartphone price barriers, said analyst Kester Mann from CCS Insight."However, Three's bold move to break through the psychological 100 per month barrier is a huge ask even for its most dedicated and loyal fans," he added.Technology journalist Kate Bevan said it is generally cheaper to buy a handset upfront rather than as part of a contract deal."I'm sure the iPhone X will be a very good phone," she said."However, if I were going to buy one - which I'm not - I would hold off until the new year if possible, to give Apple a chance to iron out any wrinkles with it and to see if prices from mobile providers come down a bit."
Trump ally Roger Stone suspended from Twitter:::::Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Stone has claimed credit for getting Mr Trump to run for president Roger Stone, a high-profile supporter of Donald Trump, has been suspended from Twitter after using the network to attack journalists.Mr Stone, who advised Mr Trump during his election campaign, said he had been told he had violated Twitter's rules.His suspension came hours after he used abusive and homophobic language to target journalists, including a gay CNN presenter, Don Lemon.Mr Stone has said he will sue Twitter for blocking his account.Twitter has not commented or confirmed if Mr Stone's suspension is permanent.He was an aide to President Richard Nixon in the 1970s and became a political consultant.He says in the Netflix documentary Get Me Roger Stone that he got Mr Trump to run for president.While he acted as an adviser during the early days of the Trump campaign, he left his role in disputed circumstances in August 2015 - Mr Stone says he quit, Mr Trump says he was fired.Since then, Mr Trump has tried to put some distance between himself and Mr Stone, who regularly appears on network television to support his former employer.Over several hours on Saturday, Mr Stone took to Twitter to attack CNN and New York Times journalists over their reporting.His attacks came hours after CNN reported that the first charges had been laid by a grand jury in the investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election.In a Facebook post, Mr Stone said he believed his suspension should have ended "some time ago yet my Twitter feed is still not functional".In an interview with entertainment website The Wrap, he said he had hired "one of the best telecommunications lawyers in the country" and would sue Twitter, but it is not clear whether there are legal grounds to do so."I have been inundated on Twitter with bloggers threatening to kill me, my wife my kids and even my dogs yet Twitter seems unconcerned about that," he said.One of the people he targeted on Saturday, CNN contributor Ana Navarro, said she did not sympathise with Mr Stone over his suspension.
Facebook to show who buys political ads:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tech giants are under pressure to improve transparency of political ads Facebook has announced measures to make political advertising on the social media platform more transparent.Political advertisers will have to verify their identity and location and their posts will carry a disclosure saying "paid for by".The steps come amid allegations that Russian-backed groups used social media ads to interfere in the US election.Executives from Facebook and other internet giants will testify before a Senate hearing on Tuesday."When it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they're running, especially for political ads," Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of ads, said in a blog post.By clicking on the "paid for by" disclosure, users would be able to see more details about the advertiser, he added.Facebook said it was expanding the transparency measures to all ads, and that they would all have to be linked to a page.Users would also be able to view the ads any page was running, it added.Tests for the new tools would start in Canada, with a goal of having them in place in the US ahead of the midterm elections, in November 2018.Tech giants are keen to show they can self-regulate after it was found that Russian-backed groups were exploiting their ad platforms.Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trump has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia On Tuesday, Twitter announced similar transparency measures, including labels for election-related ads and more details about who funded them.It also banned two of Russia's biggest media outlets - Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik - from buying advertising amid fears they attempted to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election.Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the election, but the allegations have sparked an investigation into possible links between Russia and US President Donald Trump.He denies there was any collusion.
Google addresses Pixel 2 handset complaints:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Rory Cellan-Jones takes a tour of Google's Pixel 2 XL Google says it is doubling the warranty on its new flagship smartphones following complaints about the screens.Some reviewers have noticed screen "burn in" - a permanent mark of images that have appeared previously - after only a couple of weeks with the larger version of the new phone.The firm argued that the effect was "in line with that of other premium smartphones" using OLED screens.However it promised software updates to maximise the screen life."We use software to safeguard the user experience and maximize the life of the OLED display, and we'll make ongoing software updates to optimize further," wrote Mario Queiroz, vice-president of product management, in a Google message forum.The warranty for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will now be two years instead of one, he added - although in Europe this is already standard.Mr Queiroz also said "a new mode" for saturated colours would be released in a separate software update in the next few weeks, following other complaints about dull visuals.The Pixel 2 XL, which appears to be the affected handset, is currently only available in the US.The handset reviewed by the BBC was one of those which suffered the mild burn-in first reported by the tech website Android Central.Speaking to the BBC at the time, analyst Carolina Milanesi, from Creative Strategies, said it was "not a great start" for the device.This was Google's big step into really going for the devices market, broadening the breath of the products," she said."It raises the question of whether they can actually take on this much."Google's previous device, the Pixel, had good reviews but accounted for just 0.5% of the global smartphone market in 2016.In a separate forum, Google advised those Pixel 2 users who said their device appeared to be "clicking", to switch off NFC (near field communication) - used to make contact payments - and said a software fix was being developed.The Pixel 2 costs from 629 in the UK (799 on pre-order for the XL).
Artificial intelligence smart enough to fool Captcha security check:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Computer scientists have developed AI algorithms smart enough to crack Captcha tests Computer scientists have developed artificial intelligence that can outsmart the Captcha website security check system.Captcha challenges people to prove they are human by recognising combinations of letters and numbers that machines would struggle to complete correctly.Researchers developed an algorithm that imitates how the human brain responds to these visual clues.The neural network could identify letters and numbers from their shapes.The research, conducted by Vicarious - a Californian artificial intelligence firm funded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - is published in the journal Science.What is Captcha?The Captcha test, which means the "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart", was developed in the late 1990s to prevent people from using automated bots to set up fake accounts on websites.When logging into a website, users prove that they are human by solving visual puzzles, which requires identifying letters, digits, symbols or objects that have been distorted or animated in some way.Computers usually struggle to pass such tests, and Google says that its reCaptcha test is so complicated that even humans can only solve it 87% of the time.However, researchers from Vicarious claim that their computer algorithm can pick out distorted letters and digits from images.Neural networks To get computers to recognise images, computer scientists usually use neural networks, which are computer systems containing a collection of interconnected units called artificial neurons, trained to solve complex problems.A neural network contains hundreds of layers, inspired by the human brain, and each layer examines a different part of the problem.Eventually, the answer from all the layers is combined together to produce one final result.However, neural networks have to be painstakingly trained using thousands of images that have been pre-labelled by humans, which makes it a very arduous task.The team from Vicarious developed Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), a software which mimics actual processes in the human brain while requiring less computing power than a neural network.The human brain has the ability to identify objects even if they are obscured by other objects, by recognising shapes and textures.Vicarious has been developing algorithms for RCN that aim to identify objects by analysing pixels in an image to see if they match the outline of an object.Captcha attacks In 2013, Vicarious announced that it had cracked text-based Captcha tests used by Google, Yahoo, PayPal and Captcha.com with a 90% accuracy.Since then, Captcha designers have made their tests more difficult to beat, but the researchers said in their new paper that the software was now able to pass Google's reCaptcha test 66.6% of the time.The RCN software was also able to solve reCaptacha tests from Captcha generator BotDetect at a 64.4% success rate, Yahoo Captchas at a 57.4% success rate and PayPal at a 57.1% success rate.Image copyright Vicarious / Science Image caption The computer algorithm could crack modern Captcha tests with success rates of more than 50% "We're not seeing attacks on Captcha at the moment, but within three or four months, whatever the researchers have developed will become mainstream, so Captcha's days are numbered," Simon Edwards, a cyber-security architect for data cyber-security firm Trend Micro Europe, told the BBC."The very nature of big data analysis and machine learning is that if you give it enough data to play with, it will eventually work out most things."Mr Edwards said that typically within two months of security flaws being discovered, have-a-go hackers will start attacking every publicly-visible web server they can find, and so it is likely that Captcha tests on websites will soon be under siege."The technology has been around for a long time - there needs to be a better version of Captcha," he said."In my mind, the best form of authentication is two-factor.It's the only real way of getting around these problems."
NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.NHS England said no patient data had been compromised or stolen and praised the staff response.The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now "get their act together".WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to 230 ($300).The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said."Before 12 May 2017, the department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.His "kill switch" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' Home Office Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was "as sure as possible" that North Korea was behind the attack."This attack, we believe quite strongly that it came from a foreign state," he said."It is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea [took on] this role".Speaking on the same programme, former chairman of NHS Digital, Kingsley Manning, said that a failure to upgrade old computer systems at a local level within the NHS had contributed to the rapid spread of the malware.He said: "The problem with cyber security for the NHS is [that] it has a particular vulnerability...It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread."Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also "frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements."This was an extremely unsophisticated attack," he added.The NAO said the NHS "has accepted that there are lessons to learn" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.WannaCry was "a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice," said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO."There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."Keith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: "As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen."Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum."Image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts.When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS.Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem.And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.

Google 'drops everything' to fix burger emoji:::::Google CEO Sundar Pichai has tasked employees returning to work on Monday morning with one key objective: fix the burger emoji.The tech giant's big cheese (sorry) stepped in after a tweet from author Thomas Baekdal highlighted inconsistencies in different tech companies' burger construction.Amid the cheesy puns (sorrier) and breathless bewilderment, it was the meaty issue (sorry - not sorry) of cheese placement which sparked the most fervent debate.Skip Twitter post by @baekdal I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top pic.twitter.com/PgXmCkY3Yc Thomas Baekdal (@baekdal) October 28, 2017 Report Posting a picture from emojipedia, Mr Baekdal said it was: "time to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top".In the image, Google is the only company which places its cheese underneath the meat.Mr Baekdal clearly has his finger on the social zeitgeist, as the discussion he wanted took off online.His initial tweet has attracted 17,500 retweets, more than 36,000 likes and hundreds of comments.You may also like: People really care about burgers, and some were unimpressed with the effort made by both companies.Skip Twitter post by @teroterotero Obviously, cheese must be on top of meat.But lettuce must be insulated by the tomato - so both are in the wrong.Tero Kuittinen (@teroterotero) October 28, 2017 Report The debate came to the attention of Google's CEO Sundar Pichai on Sunday."Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday if folks can agree on the correct way to do this," he tweeted.Skip Twitter post by @sundarpichai Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday:) if folks can agree on the correct way to do this!https://t.co/dXRuZnX1Ag Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) October 29, 2017 Report His pledge to act quickly and decisively was the signal fans of burger puns had been waiting for as a torrent of witticisms was unleashed."If Sundar says he'll do it, then consider it bun," one noted on Twitter."These burger puns are going to ketchup with you in a bad way," another responded.It is unclear what, if anything, Google actually plan to do about their controversial cheese-bottomed burger, but perhaps if they can resolve their burger issues by the end of the day then beer might be their next priority.
'We just outlived LoveFilm':::::Image copyright 20th Century Flicks For some, this Halloween will be a darker day than those past because LoveFilm by Post, the DVD rental service, bites the dust.For Tara Judah, a co-director of a movie rental shop in Bristol, it is a day of triumph."We just outlived LoveFilm, so that's pretty good in my book," she says.One of the last remaining film rental stores in the UK, 20th Century Flicks has been trading since 1982 - the era of VHS video tapes.However, Ms Judah is under no illusions about the future of a business that is an increasingly diminished player in an arena dominated by film and TV streaming giants such as Netflix.Ms Judah tells BBC Radio 5 Live that she and her two co-directors in 20th Century Flicks, a DVD rental shop in Bristol, "do it for the love of it, not the money.I think that's the most important thing".She says: "We all grew up with video stores.For us personally it means quite a lot so we still want to do it for other people."There are still some people who do still want to rent physical videos from us, to have a personal interaction, to talk about the movies."In the post The end of services such as LoveFilm, which was bought by Amazon for 200m in 2011, or nipping down to the local DVD store of an evening has been in the post for a while.At its height, LoveFilm had two million subscribers.Netflix most recent figures shows it has 109.25 million.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Netflix shows include Stranger Things, which is now in its second season Figures from market researchers Kantar Worldpanel show that in 2013, 10.6% of individuals in the UK, rented an DVD.In 2017, that number has fallen to 2.3%.Renting a DVD from a shop was tossed out of the basket of goods used to measure the UK's inflation rate by the Office of National Statistics in 2009 to be replaced by film postal subscriptions.Five years later, film streaming services entered the inflation basket for the first time.But still 20th Century Flicks battles on, though the mix of film genre has changed.Ms Judah says that while the shop still offers big mainstream films, there are a few more of the art house movies "because we know customers think a lot more about whether they'll rent before they buy them".So maybe there is still growth to be had in being a DVD rental business?"Absolutely not," she says."Definitely no growth."Ms Judah says that the rental figures only go downwards, not upwards."We make alterations to our business all the time, to tweak it, to keep it going and we have always said that we will do it until we can't do it any more."Does she know when that will be?"I think we've got a little while longer," she answers."If you'd asked me a couple of years ago if I'd still be open now, I might not have said 'yes', so we'll just keep limping on."

Can a Facebook friend request be 'harassment'?:::::Image copyright Getty Images A filmmaker touched off a debate in Pakistan revolving around one question - can a Facebook friend request ever be considered harassment?It began with a visit to the hospital by the sister of Oscar-award winning Pakistani filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.After the treatment, the sister received a friend request from her doctor.That prompted an angry Twitter outburst by the filmmaker - and a social media storm about the definition of harassment: Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Obaid-Chinoy's description of the Facebook request as "harassment" triggered an angry response from many Pakistanis claiming she had overreacted.Others supported her, claiming the often abusive reaction she received revealed the misogyny of her critics.One of Obaid-Chinoy's most vocal detractors was journalist Ali Moeen Nawazish, who wrote on his own Facebook page that comparing a social media request to harassment was "ridiculous."He added "Whats next, asking for a pen is harassment Looking at someone for three seconds will be harassment???"In his post, he also said that the claim "is actually taking away from real victims of harassment."You might also be interested in: The journalist concluded by criticising Obaid-Chinoy for "Pakistan shaming."Nawazish later claimed that the doctor had been fired as a result of the tweets, however reports indicate that he has been suspended from Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi while an internal investigation takes place.Obaid-Chinoy, who won acclaim for her documentaries on "honour killings" and acid attack victims, has faced similar accusations in the past.She's been accused of being a "traitor" to Pakistan in relation to her work which exposes violent and misogynistic cultural traditions prevalent in certain parts of Pakistani society.Her tweet storm renewed those criticisms and she was repeatedly accused of having harmed the country's international image.Some suggested she exemplified the phrase "wrong women in the wrong family" and called her an elitist.She, however, subsequently clarified she was referring to the fact that "women in my family are strong" and had not meant to "suggest a sense of privilege or power."But that didn't stop many Pakistanis on Twitter from attacking the filmmaker.Some posted photographs of her with other men - apparently suggesting these images made her a hypocrite for complaining about alleged harassment.Facebook pages were created encouraging people to send Obaid-Chinoy friend requests.Image copyright Saith Abdullah / Twitter Many others, including both men and women, questioned whether a friend request amounted to harassment.Image copyright Hamza Ali Abbasi / Twitter But Obaid-Chinoy did find some support in newspaper columns and on social media.Her defenders included Pakistani writer Bina Shah, who told the BBC she wasn't surprised by "the kind of abuse and vitriol" directed at the filmmaker."Any time you try to fight against (the patriarchy) you get an immediate backlash," Shah said.In a subsequent statement Obaid-Chinoy wrote that "The conversation has unfortunately steered far from the safety of women, unchecked unethical practises & harassment."She revealed that the doctor in question had conducted a "very private examination" of her sister before going online and "leaving comments on photographs & trying to add her as a Facebook friend."She clarified she regularly receives "unsolicited friendship requests from strangers" but that she considered this episode a "serious breach of patient-doctor privilege."The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council referred the BBC to their ethical guidelines, which don't specifically mention social media but do state that a "professional position must never be used to pursue a relationship of an emotional or sexual nature with a patient, the patient's spouse, or a near relative of a patient."The doctor at the centre of the controversy has not been named publicly.He has, however, reportedly received a job offer from another hospital in Karachi.Image copyright Hashmanis Hospital / Facebook Blog by Secunder Kermani More from Trending: 'Lack of compromise' brought Civil War Image copyright Drew Angerer/Getty Images President Trump's chief of staff, General John Kelly, claims an inability to compromise caused the American Civil War.The social media reaction came quick...READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.All our stories are at bbc.com/trending.
Somalia's 'touch and feel' e-commerce hit:::::Image copyright Innovate Ventures Image caption Muraadso co-founders Abdiqani Ibrahim, Hamse Musa and Saed Mohamed When Saed Mohamed, a young entrepreneur from Somalia, pitched his online shopping business Muraadso as part of an East African start-up competition in 2015, he was prepared for rejection.And rejection is what he got.Abdigani Diriye, head of the Somalia-based accelerator, Innovate Ventures, which oversaw the competition, was not impressed."We had a few applications from e-commerce start-ups and they just weren't really doing it for me," he told the BBC.But Mr Mohamed and his team were not about to give up."We have had a lot of rejections and we have learned to be persistent.We wouldn't take no for an answer," he says.They did eventually get on the programme and ended up winning it."The irony is they went on to become the most successful start-up we took on," joked Mr Diriye.But the business they were pitching - a online store selling mainly electronics - "failed miserably" at first, admits Mr Mohamed.Image copyright Muraadso Image caption Users can see goods before they buy by visiting one of Muraadso's three offline stores It seemed Somalia wasn't ready yet for online only.Perhaps this isn't surprising given that less than a third of its 14 million people are able to access the internet and few have bank accounts.It's an uphill struggle to get any online business off the ground.So he looked to how Western retailers were combining offline and online sales to revive the flagging brand."The hybrid model is the thing right now.Amazon has opened a physical store and Walmart and other traditional retailers are acquiring e-commerce sites," he told the BBC.Muraadso did the same and "sales sky-rocketed," he said.Opening bricks and mortar stores in three different cities meant that potential buyers could go and touch the goods first before committing to buying them.The site offers traditional home deliveries and flexible ways to pay, including cash on delivery.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon opened a physical bookstore in Seattle in November, 2015 Many purchase are made via mobile money transfer service, Zaad, which operates in a similar way to Kenya's famous M-Pesa platform.Zaad has an 80% market share in Somalia, charging no fees to send or withdraw money, but making its money instead from offering extra services and mobile airtime."The hybrid model wasn't a concept that I was familiar with, but Muraadso started implementing it late last year and they have been growing ever since, going from a three-man team to employing dozens and looking to raise another round of funding," says Mr Diriye.E-commerce in Somalia is nascent, and across Africa generally, online shopping remains niche, says Matthew Reed, a consultant at research firm Ovum."Many people are still living on desperately low incomes, so e-commerce is really just for the middle classes.And there are other big challenges for e-commerce firms, not just in Somalia," he says.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Terrorism, drought and famine have hampered Somalia's technological progress Chief among them is lack of infrastructure - both decent roads that enable quick and efficient deliveries, and the telecoms infrastructure that allows people to access the platforms in the first place.But things are changing.Millions in Africa have bypassed traditional telephone landlines and leapt straight to mobile - the oft-quoted "leapfrog" effect.According to mobile body the GSMA, there will be 725 million unique mobile subscribers on the continent by 2020.And Somalia is benefiting from this improved connectivity.In 2013, fibre optic firm Liquid Telecom connected the East African country to its network of cables, which now spreads 50,000km (31,000 miles) across 11 other African countries."There is increasing connectivity, mobile is increasingly widely available, and more of that is data-enabled with the increase of 3G and 4G networks," says Mr Reed.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Devices are also becoming more affordable."Changing social and cultural patterns of behaviour, an increasingly youthful population, and urbanisation, mean the stage is set for e-commerce to thrive, he believes.According to Mr Mohamed, Facebook is "huge" in Somalia among younger people, so Muraadso is aggressively exploiting the platform to market its products, gaining 25,000 likes along the way.It aims to have 100,000 by the end of the year.Perhaps unsurprisingly, South Africa has the most mature e-commerce market in Africa, with others such as Kenya and Nigeria gaining user quickly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jumia delivers goods via scooter and offers a variety of payment options Online retailer Jumia is in all three countries and, while it offers a very similar set of services to global market leader Amazon, there is one crucial difference."They realised that they couldn't just copy-and-paste the approach and methodology of Amazon because of factors such as infrastructure, access to couriers and cultural preferences," explains Dr Diriye.So Jumia pioneered the idea of letting customers see the goods before they paid for them.Safari.com, Kenya's leading communications firm, recently announced that it would be launching its own online shopping offering by the end of the year and it plans to expand that service beyond Kenya.Muraadso is still small - its turnover is at around $40,000 (30,000) a month - but already it has a rival - Samionline - and Dr Diriye predicts more will follow."Every day another one pops up in Somalia as the digital wave starts to flow," he says."People are getting online, becoming more tech-savvy and the cost of owning a smartphone is falling."The benefits to the people of Somalia go beyond access to better quality goods and more choice, he adds."It also saves them time as they don't have to travel to town, and it saves them money because they don't have to pay for a bus."People are more productive with their time, and when you multiply that to a whole city or country, the impact can be very significant."
What a Facebook experiment did to news in Cambodia:::::Image caption Catherine Harry says the new design couldn't have come at a worse time for Cambodia Until recently, video blogger Catherine Harry was a Facebook success story in Cambodia.Her page, A Dose of Cath, featured a series of outspoken first person videos on taboo topics like virginity and menstruation that never got airtime on TV.Then, on 19 October, Facebook tweaked its News Feed in Cambodia and five other small countries.Instead of seeing posts from Facebook pages in their general News Feed, users in the test had to go to a new section called Explore Feed to see the content.And so when Ms Harry posted a new video on Facebook on Saturday, just 2,000 of her fans saw it in the first hour, compared to about 12,000 who normally watched."Suddenly I realised, wow, they actually hold so much power," she said.Facebook "can crush us just like that if they want to".Ms Harry, who quit her job to focus on vlogging, isn't just worried about her livelihood.Cambodia is in the throes of its most severe government crackdown in years ahead of a national election next July that could test the durability of Prime Minister Hun Sen, one of the longest-serving heads of government in the world.The crackdown has already claimed two NGOs, more than a dozen radio stations, and the local offices of two independent media outlets, Radio Free Asia and The Cambodia Daily.Hun Sen's main opposition, the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), could be dissolved entirely at a Supreme Court hearing on 16 November."Out of all the countries in the world, why Cambodia?"Ms Harry asks of Facebook's experiment."This couldn't have come at a worse time."Facebook surpassed TV as Cambodians' most popular source of news last year, according to a survey from the Asia Foundation, with roughly half of respondents saying they used the social media network.The platform helped power the CNRP's gains against the governing Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in the 2013 national elections and has been one of the only places for dissent in a country ranked 132nd out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2017 World Press Freedom Index.With most mainstream traditional media aligned with the CPP, Facebook's test could mean that locals only get a skewed version of the day's news, said Von Vorn, a 30-year-old tuk-tuk driver."It's like a frog in a pond," he said."If the frog is in the pond, it won't know anything about the world - just the pond."Image copyright AFP Image caption The Cambodia Daily newspaper was shut in September amid a tax dispute with the government Facebook's popularity has not been lost on Hun Sen, who has amassed almost nine million followers with a mix of seaside selfies, state news and singing contests, and whose page was ranked by global public relations firm Burson-Marsteller as the eighth most popular of any world leader.Hun Sen's longtime rival, Sam Rainsy, the exiled former president of the CNRP who runs a popular page of his own, said his traffic had dipped 20% since the start of the Facebook test.Unlike the prime minister, whom he accused of buying Facebook supporters from foreign "click farms", Mr Rainsy said he could not pay to sponsor his posts to put them in front of more users in their usual News Feeds."Facebook's latest initiative would possibly give an even stronger competitive edge to authoritarian and corrupt politicians," he said.Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.But in a blog post last week, Adam Mosseri, the platform's head of News Feed, said the changes were made "to understand if people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content".The platform had no plans to expand the test globally, he said.Cambodian publishers of all stripes said they were frustrated by the unannounced changes.Leang Phannara, web editor for Post Khmer, the Khmer-language version of independent English daily the Phnom Penh Post, said Khmer Facebook posts were reaching 45% fewer people, while web traffic was down 35%.The only way to recapture that audience was to pay to sponsor posts, he said."It's a pay-to-play scenario," Mr Phannara said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sam Rainsy (left) and Hun Sen (right) made a political deal in 2014, but it didn't last Lim Cheavutha, CEO of the stridently pro-government online outlet Fresh News, was upset by changes he said had eaten into his traffic, though he did not have numbers to hand."I absolutely do not support this new [Facebook] policy," he said."It affects not only my company, but also all other media."Local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are also worried about the effect of the move on their marketing efforts, according to Jaime Gill, a local communications consultant."Small NGOs have been able to compete by telling really powerful stories about their results," he said."This experiment has banished those posts to a new feed which I suspect few will use."'Fake news rampant' On the streets of Phnom Penh, no one approached by reporters had noticed the change.Sugarcane juice vendor Phorn Phel said he used Facebook to check in on developments across the country and would continue to do so by searching for his usual news sites, which he preferred over state-aligned media."We don't want to watch local TV much because there's nothing interesting," he said."That's why I need to find something on social media instead."Shop owner Sron Chathou said she spent nearly of all her free time on Facebook but hadn't noticed the experiment.She liked the immediacy of the platform, where her favourite pages would broadcast news like traffic accidents or flooding as they happened."We can bring our phone everywhere in our pocket," she said."No need to wait and see it on TV."Political analyst Ou Virak said Cambodians' trust in Facebook was misplaced given the rampant amount of fake news and conspiracy theories, often translated from English sources."They don't distinguish the source or credibility of information," he said, estimating that seven out of 10 stories that he encountered on his News Feed were false or exaggerated.Facebook's test, then, was less important than building media literacy."I don't see many Cambodians getting real or credible news anyway," he said.Ben Paviour is a freelance journalist based in Phnom Penh.Additional reporting by Ben Sokhean.
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and grey so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
How Australia's A$49bn internet network came to be ridiculed:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rollout of Australia's National Broadband Network has been heavily criticised In 1872, rugged, frontier Australia was lauded for overcoming the tyranny of distance to connect itself to the world via the "bush telegraph", a two-year project stringing 3,200km (2,000 miles) of wire through the outback that became part of the nation's folklore.By contrast today, while striving to be seen as an "innovation nation", Australia stands condemned, even ridiculed, for its latest drive for connectivity: a modern, fast internet network.Three letters - NBN - have come to strike dread into the minds of consumers, with the National Broadband Network symbolising for many a template in how not to do things.Given Australia's large size and sparse population density of three people per square kilometre, the NBN is the country's largest ever infrastructure project.The total budget sits at A$49bn (29bn; $38bn).Of that budget, around 35% must be spent connecting the final 10% of users, including wiring to remote areas, erecting many of the required 2,600 wireless towers and, most expensively, putting two satellites in the sky.This week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the NBN a mistake and a "calamitous train wreck" by a previous Labor government.Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd hit back by saying the project's issues "lie all on your head" - meaning the current conservative government.The escalating blame game, the NBN's slow roll-out, and a switch to inferior technology midstream have combined with other factors to leave Australians frequently asking the question: Why is our internet so slow?In 2013, Australia ranked 30th for average internet speeds.The NBN was meant to improve that, but the most recent standings ranked Australia 50th.The State of the Internet survey by US internet firm Akamai put Australia - with an average of 11.1 Mbps (megabits per second) - behind countries including Kenya, Hungary and Russia.And while it promotes itself as part of go-ahead Asia, Australia sits only eighth in the region, behind neighbours such as Thailand (21st overall) and New Zealand (27th).Some comparisons are misleading.Only 1.75% of Kenyan homes have fixed-line internet, compared with 90% in Australia.For many, particularly inner-city Australians on the best NBN technology, fixed-line speeds are adequate, particularly if you pay more.But there's no escaping Australia has been overtaken by many countries on the internet table.What's worse is that with many of those connected to the NBN reporting no improvement over old ADSL connections, of the homes equipped to take the new service, only 40% have chosen to do so.In business, and international competitiveness, the fears are perhaps more serious.NBN by the numbers A$49bn The current estimated cost of building the network 2007 The year the project was announced 2020 When the rollout is expected to be completed A$91,196 The cost of connecting one remote property 159% The rise in complaints since last financial year Getty Images "Going lower in ranking is alarming, and just not acceptable," says University of Sydney academic Dr Tooran Alizadeh, who has researched the NBN extensively and, like others, worries Australia's best minds will be lost to countries with better technology."Australia wants to be in the first 10 or so economies in the world.Obviously if you want to do that your internet access cannot be ranked 50th."The history In 2007, Mr Rudd announced 98% of Australian homes would be on the NBN by 2020.It was a breathtakingly ambitious idea.It was also, according to critics, backed by inadequate research into logistics and costs, initially put at A$15bn.The natural starting point was Australia's oldest telecom company, Telstra.Elsewhere, countries like New Zealand simply used the infrastructure already laid by their major telecom company to install fast internet cabling.But Telstra, halfway privatised at the time, clashed with regulators over how it might onsell broadband access to its competitors, and so pulled out of the running to build the network.Eventually, the government announced it would simply start a whole new semi-autonomous company from scratch.Called the NBN, it would set up the infrastructure to connect Australians with state-of-the-art fibre optic cables to their homes, selling bandwidth wholesale to retailers.Progress was slow, sporadic, and expensive.With Australia's preference for underground wiring, often concrete driveways would have to be dug up and relaid.Costs thus blew out for connecting houses from an envisaged average of A$4,400 to, in some cases, more than A$20,000, an NBN spokesman says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A rocket carrying the NBN's first satellite is launched into space from French Guiana in 2015 Complaints soon arose over why some regions were connected before others, with schools and hospitals, for example, getting very unequal standards of internet quality.Accusations of government pork-barrelling, however, were wide of the mark."The government just wanted progress, so it became a matter of which places were easiest and quickest to connect," one source with intimate knowledge of the subject told the BBC."Often this came down to issues like basic geology - where was the rock easiest to drill through?"After the conservative government attained power in 2013, the NBN struck more upheaval, with copper wire ordered for the final stretches of connection, surrounding neighbourhood broadband nodes.This presents a slower connection to the twice-as-expensive fibre optics.It also means residents, say 400 metres from the node, will have slower internet than a neighbour a few doors away.Critics also charge it's a false saving, since copper wire needs replacing far earlier than fibre optics.Complaints and competition Then came the NBN's high pricing to retailers, who buy limited supply to pass on to consumers, which leaves so many Australians staring in frustration while buffering or, worse still, service drop-outs occurring each peak hour."NBN has worked hard to bring the cost of bandwidth down but we cannot fill the pipes ourselves - it is up to the retailers to make sure that they are buying enough capacity to deliver a good quality of service," an NBN spokesman told the BBC.Yet another complication is the number of retailers - 180 - making it hard for the NBN to police quality control for end users."We've had huge problems getting our house connected to the footpath node," says Matt Grant, a factory manager in suburban St Clair, just 39km from central Sydney."But when I complained to the retailer, they told me to talk to the NBN.When I talked to the NBN, they sent me back to the retailer."Image copyright Getty Images He was eventually connected, but said "it's no better than we had with ADSL, especially in peak times".Last week, Australia's Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman revealed there had been a 159% increase in NBN-related complaints in the last financial year.NBN chief executive Bill Morrow told the Australian Broadcasting Corp this week that it "turns [his] stomach" that some customers were being left behind, but he placed blame on retailers, and said the government would ultimately decide when to replace copper connections.He also noted increasing competition from mobile broadband technology."Look, it is a competitive environment, but I just want to repeat we are doing everything we can to ensure the NBN delivers a great service," he said.The network says it's still on target to have 98% of homes connected by 2020, but Australia's internet malaise will still take some solving.There's hope of improvement, but not until base prices can come down as the NBN gradually recoups its massive expenditure.And despite the political finger-pointing, Mr Turnbull's government insists the network will be "fit for purpose"."Australia needs a 21st Century broadband network and this is not being delivered," said Laurie Patton, executive director of consumer advocacy group Internet Australia."The way we're heading now, whoever is in office in 2020 will have to deal with our biggest ever national infrastructure debacle."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
