'Waltons' actress Mary McDonough struggled after getting breast implants:::::Mary McDonough receives emails almost every day from people, and its not just because she once starred as the pretty, wholesome Erin Walton in one of TVs most beloved families these strangers are asking for help.The reason?They want her advice on plastic surgery.The former child star, who wanted to give her career a boost after appearing on The Waltons from 1971 until 1981, went under the knife at age 24.It was a decision she would later regret.The 56-year-old star previously chronicled her personal journey in the 2012 memoir Lessons from the Mountain.I had breast implants trying to fit in and be part of the Dallas era, McDonough told Fox News.I made that choice because I was told they were safe and would last a lifetime.They werent and I got very, very sick My implants ruptured and disintegrated in my chest.I was sick for 10 years and no one knew what was wrong with me.After the surgery, McDonoughs health began to deteriorate.Not only was she faced with chronic muscle pain, but her famous red mane was falling out.McDonough felt like she was constantly succumbing to the flu and was unable to hold her only daughter Sydnee.By 1994, McDonough decided to remove the implants that she felt were contributing to her physical decline.I got so sick over the course of time, not knowing what was wrong with me, recalled McDonough.It was a very difficult decision for me to have [breast implants] in the first place because I felt like I needed to do it for my career.And so, I didnt want to have another surgery to have them removed But I was so sick, I could not risk my baby daughter.I could not feed her.And I was in so much pain I decided I would have my implants removed.At age 35, McDonough was diagnosed with lupus, an inflammatory disease.She believes the implants were to blame for her unbearable health woes over the years.Once I had my implants removed, I started to get better, said McDonough.My lupus is in remission.I still deal with fibromyalgia and arthritis But, Im... healthier.Im way healthier than I was in my 30s The further I get from those implants, the better I get.McDonough has since found a new purpose as an activist for womens body image issues.Her goal isnt to discourage others from getting plastic surgery but to empower them with knowledge about the potential risks and how to cope.Ive never been anti-implants, said McDonough.What Ive lobbied for is to have it be safe I also want to educate people on the dangers and what women should look out for Some things have changed.You are supposed to have them replaced every six to seven years.But how many people can afford to do that?"And some people lose their health insurance because they have breast implants.So theres a lot of issues and I always work to get the information out to people.To try to get people to make an educated choice.If they want to do it, know what youre getting into.Many fans can identify with McDonough, who once faced pressure in Hollywood to look a certain way while growing up in front of cameras.There was pressure from the wardrobe department [on The Waltons] about [whether] I can fit into my clothes from last year or had I gained more weight, she claimed.And I was just a kid!I was a growing girl and you had these old clothes that we wore for years.We never had a fancy wardrobe, and so when youre becoming a teenager, your body has to change.McDonough, who was growing up in front of America, struggled to accept the discouraging words.I didnt deal with it well at all, she admitted.I took it personally and I had always strived to be so perfect.I was always trying to be the perfect girl.The perfect weight.I was literally trying to fit into all of it."And I took it personally and it hurt my feelings and I reacted by doing starvation diets And not being very good to myself.And my focus became about the external parts of me instead of the inside of who I was and what I had to offer, which is what I had to learn later in life.McDonough never shared her personal struggles with her cast-mates.Its funny, Richard Thomas told me after he read my book, I had no idea you were going through this.Why didnt you say something?she said.But I think I was so set on trying to be the perfect girl that to me, it was just a part of what I was supposed to do.And look, it wasnt like I was the only one in the show.There was a focus on what the others should look like as well.I just took it more personally and internalized it.But these days, McDonough, who currently resides in Colorado, is feeling good about herself.And she still stays in touch with her TV family.Were all very loyal and true to each other, she explained.I see other shows where a cast member dies and the other cast mates completely throw them under the bus.We would never do that.We love each other too much Weve lost cast members and we miss them.We would never dishonor their memory.
The Tear-Stained Confessions of Sam Smith:::::IN THE LONELY HOUR was a little more than a half-hour crying jag about longing for a man a straight, married one he was in love with whom he never so much as kissed.Nearly every song was about this: Stay With Me, the sad song about wanting a man to stay even when its clear hes not in love; Good Thing, the sad song about deciding that hes stayed too long waiting around that one begins with a vision of him getting mugged outside the mans door and dying in his arms like ponine.And, on the deluxe edition of the album, a cover of Whitney Houstons How Will I Know?which was not a sad song until he sang it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He told Rolling Stone that he had to be careful so that straight people could sing along with his music, too.I am not Sam Smith, the gay singer, he said at the time.I am Sam Smith, the singer who happens to be gay.He gave an interview where he talked about Grindr and Tinder, the hookup apps, and how sad it was that all the possibility behind love and serendipity came down to a swiping culture, and saying this offended some in the gay community too.He accepted the Oscar for best original song for Writings on the Wall, from Spectre, the James Bond movie, referring to an article hed read in which Ian McKellen had said that no openly gay man had ever won an Oscar.If this is the case even if it isnt the case I want to dedicate this to the L.G.B.T.community all around the world.Well, he woke up the morning after the Oscars to an assassinations worth of ridicule, including from an openly gay man who had won an Oscar.The Verge called Mr. Smiths statement vague and inaccurate, saying, If youre going to stump for a cause on stage, you need to come correct.Gawker, in an essay about Mr. Smiths gay conservatism, wrote, His philosophy is, in short, to be gay, but not too gay.Sure, he quickly realized, the Oscar thing was wrong hed meant to say that thered never been an openly gay lead actor winner but the other stuff: why was it taken so badly?So what if he didnt like hookup apps?Why was that surprising?Hadnt people seen him, dressed like a 1950s lounge act, complete with a pompadour?Hadnt they heard his retro soul?What exactly about him seemed modern?So what that he wanted his music to be a universal experience?He never said he was the spokesman for gay people.Photo The vitriol of the Oscar incident surprised him.His heart was clearly in the right place.He was a proud gay man.How could that not mean anything?Im not the most eloquent person, Mr. Smith says now.I didnt get the best grades in school.I mean, Im just good at singing.It felt like he was getting hammered every time he opened his mouth.All he wanted was to remind people that love is love is love, particularly his brand of young adult love: heart-eye emoji love, cupid-arrow love, the love from The Notebook and Titanic.Thats how big love is.Once again, on his favorite subject, he pretend-faints on the couch in swoon and desire.He clutches his heart and makes his eyebrows almost touching a near-steeple of longing.This was the thing we all had in common.Why talk about the things that make us different?YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND what it was like for him.Mr. Smith was raised in Great Chishill, a village an hour and a half from London with a population of less than 700.He wore a full face of makeup to school to Catholic school and fake eyelashes, too, and elaborate arrangements of flowers pinned to his lapel, along with the occasional all-over sprinkling of glitter.Some kids were mean to him about his sexuality, but it was the making fun of his weight that bothered him.His sexuality was not a negotiation; his weight was.He grew up with two younger sisters in a pink house; theres a tattoo of its address around the C6 vertebra of his cervical spine.His bedroom walls were painted a shiny gold and his bed had a red silk duvet.He applied cheap, clumpy mascara each morning and on the gold wall next to his mirror, he dabbed his mascara wand to rid it of excess.One day, in detention, someone told him about dream boards, and so he spent the hour making one to put up on his bedroom wall.There was a sketch of a Grammy there.He drew the back of his head performing to an arena.Photo He came out when he was 10.Literally someone at school said, Are you gay?and he said, I am!His mother said shed known since he was 3.Hed always had very short hair, but when he was young, he used to make the gesture of pushing strands behind his ears, like it was long, or flicking imaginary hair off his shoulder.In the car, when the windows were open, he would pretend hed gotten a hair stuck to his lips and pick it away.And it was all totally fine, even when it wasnt, even when the first boy he had a crush on said nasty, homophobic things to him that still make him cry.But he had a lot of friends.There were no other (openly) gay boys.He fell in love with straight boys.He could barely picture a future when one of them would look back at him with lust or sexual curiosity, let alone love.And still he was happy.He grew comfortable in his longing.People sometimes made fun of him, but so what?He understood who he was.He thought that if you know who you are, and if youre confident in that and you dont make a big deal of it, people will accept you.Advertisement Continue reading the main story His parents signed him up for voice lessons when he wouldnt stop crooning throughout the house.He had a manager from the age of 11, then another, then another, each promising him that he would become very famous very soon.It didnt happen.He moved to London, where he tended bar.One day, he met Jimmy Napes, who introduced him to his eventual managers, who in turn introduced him to the electronic duo Disclosure, with whom he recorded the vocals for Latch, Disclosures single and his breakout in 2012.The rest the album, the tour it all happened fast.He woke up the day after the Oscars, saw the chaos online, apologized, and slunk off.Why wasnt this working?People loved his music, but they were turning on him.He couldnt bear being thought of as a traitor to his people he was so open about everything!Sure, he didnt like Tinder, and its mostly true that he didnt like it because it isnt romantic, but it is maybe truer that he was afraid he would be swiped away.Believe it or not, he did use Grindr, but he didnt want random hookups so he arranged dinner dates with several very confused men.Then, one day, he went to Australia for a show, and afterward had a talk with his publicist there, a gay man who lives with his partner of 18 years.The publicist took Mr. Smith to the Stonewall, a gay bar in Sydney, for a drink one afternoon.He decided to help educate him, taking him to a gay bookshop.My mind just went, Mr. Smith said.He read the memoir Holding the Man, which blew his mind.He watched Paris Is Burning.He still has Tales of the City on his night table.Next, the Australians introduced him to drag.They crammed his feet into thigh-high, high-heeled boots.They draped a red sequin dress over his 62 body.They had barbecues and played Madonna and danced.I lived in a village in the middle of nowhere as an openly gay man from the age of 10 years old, Mr. Smith said.I didnt meet another gay man until I was 19 when I moved to London.I just went gay clubbing a few times with some straight friends and with some girlfriends of mine, and then I became famous.I never got an opportunity to find my people in the gay community and find my friends.He decided not to drink or smoke or be with a man, even just kissing, for a long time, while he was figuring all this stuff out.He was trying to understand how he fit into the gay community at large.I just really sat with myself and got to know myself and started to just like my stretch marks and not be so hard on myself and stop watching perfection everywhere.He began seeking out the art that struck him as truest.He stopped watching Titanic and The Notebook.O.K., he watched The Notebook again last week but he also watched Weekend, the gay indie film, so it balanced out.Photo Then he found George Michael.He had always been a fan of his music.He was 15 when he saw him in concert.But now, reading and watching interviews with him in his last years, after Mr. Michael came out, Mr. Smith found him to be a great mentor.I just feel like Im going to offend someone every time I open my mouth, he said.I feel like George Michael had a way of being authentic to himself and honest in a way that was warm.Back at the interview in West Hollywood, he leaned back on the couch, looked up at the ceiling and blew a stream of breath out through pursed lips.People forget but no one learns about gay history in school.Nothing.So I didnt know anything about my history as a gay man and then words like spokesperson are being thrown at me when Ive just brought out my first album, he said.It scared me because I was like, I dont know anything about being gay, really.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He realized two things.One was that he was ready to make a second album.The other thing was that coming out as gay wasnt enough.He now understood that every visible gay person still had a leadership role.He now understood that he wasnt operating on his own, but that he lived in context to a community whether hed realized it or not.No, having come out as a gay singer, he realized it was now time to come out as a gay man.THE NEXT AFTERNOON, Saturday, he rode to the Hollywood Bowl, where he was performing at a breast cancer benefit that included Lorde and Kesha and Harry Styles.He was wearing a pastel, airbrushed silk, short-sleeve button-down shirt and olive silk pleated pants.I can tuck them in now, he said proudly.Im a tucker.Photo Since he left the public eye for the studio, which is where hed been since the end of his last tour, in 2015, hed lost a ton of weight by doing something called intermittent fasting, meaning he waits five hours after eating to eat again (and which is also called not eating between meals).A trainer.A nutritionist.He stopped eating bread.Probably being a man in his 20s helped.His transformation was sparked by seeing a tabloid picture of himself on the beach without a shirt, and that was not the self he wanted to be.He was also concerned about his health.He gets acid reflux, and its bad for his voice.He knows other stars mime, as he puts it, but he doesnt want to.His voice is his whole thing, his whole bag of tricks.Mr. Smith had also cut off his pompadour, which he called his quiff, his short hair now reminiscent of George Michaels on his 2011 Symphonica tour.His hair was thicker than its been recently.After the Oscars, it had started falling out from stress, he thought.He began to use Rogaine and take Propecia, and it worked.Men need to talk about hair loss, he thinks.Photo Photo Photo If In the Lonely Hour was the myopic look into the heart of a boy helplessly in love, then the new album, The Thrill of It All, is about a man who turns his gaze outward.Midnight Train is a sad song about ending a relationship that was inspired by friends; Palace, a sad song about whether or not love is worth it if it ends; HIM, a sad story of an imagined boy in Mississippi coming out to his father.Some of the tracks are about Mr. Smith himself, including Burning, a sad song about pining for a man who has left; and One Last Song, a sad final ode to the man who was the subject of In the Lonely Hour.The new album wont be a surprise to anyone familiar with the first one: The old-timey soul is still there.Mr. Smith decided long ago that his voice was the instrument: melisma, whispered baritones, surprise out-of-nowhere ultra-high falsetto, even a haunting, beautiful croak of longing sprinkled here and there.It is still prime music for having sex with your sadness, as Mr. Smith said.But he can now recount actual relationships in his songs.Hes still never been in the kind of magical Notebook love he longs for, he said, but about a year ago, he had a five-month relationship that took three breakups before the breakup took and which is the subject of Too Good at Goodbyes, the first single off the new album, which is in the Billboard Top 10 as of this writing.Hes been dating the actor Brandon Flynn, from Netflixs 13 Reasons Why, seeing where that goes.Backstage at the Hollywood Bowl, Mr. Smith drank a cup of Throat Coat, and then took a Gaviscon for acid reflux.He sang through a cocktail straw while holding up a tissue to make it move with his breath to strengthen his throat muscles, something he learned from an opera singer.He motor-boated his lips.He was ready for the show.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next day, the news media would pick up a statement he made about feeling as much like a woman as a man, and social media would get on him for being too casual about gender fluidity when he identifies as a gay man.One day he will get it right, he said, his eyes shiny with big, sad Sam Smith tears, The only thing Id like everyone to know is Im really sorry if I say the wrong things, he said.I dont want to offend anyone and my intentions are genuinely pure and good.Im still trying to figure [expletive] out and Id like to be treated like a human.If I make mistakes dont kill me.Yes, one day.One day when hes old, he said, hes going to know what to say.Hes going to be someone who can figure out how to think his words through before he says them.Hell get older, and as he does, hes going to stop using his falsetto so much, he said.Its a sound that cant age with you, and even on the new album, hes started to sing more in his regular voice.Eventually, hes going to be like Joni Mitchell and just use the lowest registers.Hes going to come out on stage like Joni on the cover of Both Sides Now, with a glass of wine and a cigarette (yes, by then hell be drinking and smoking again).Hes looking forward to that, when his voice starts to get breathy and broken like Judy Garlands when she sings Over the Rainbow at Carnegie Hall.Eventually hell retire and open up a flower shop in the English countryside, he said.Hell get really into cooking, hell have a pet pig named Kong or maybe Flo, and hell live forever happily, surrounded by his husband and children and his closet full of drag.His funeral will call for fancy dress, and the men will have to dress like women and the women will have to dress like men.Drag queens wearing big black hats with veils and high heels will carry his coffin out.Then disco music will play.Thats nice, isnt it?Yes, its nice to think of a time when hell know for sure just how to be.
Hidden Treasures of Nazis’ Art Dealer Finally Go on Display:::::Advertisement Hidden Treasures of Nazis Art Dealer Finally Go on Display Image A museum official presenting works from the collection of Cornelius Gurlitt at the Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland in July.Credit Valeriano Di Domenico/Agence France-Presse Getty Images Weeks after a German magazine tipped off the world that an 80-year-old man had hoarded hundreds of artworks collected by his father during the Nazi era in a Munich apartment, the world gasped at the prospect of rediscovering long-lost treasures.This week, four years after the discovery of the collection inherited by Cornelius Gurlitt, the public will be able for the first time to view 450 of the most valuable works, previously seen only in photographs , in a pair of coordinated exhibitions at the Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland and the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn , Germany.The parallel shows, running under the title Gurlitt Status Report, will allow the public to view works by Monet, Czanne, Renoir, Otto Dix and other artists found in Mr. Gurlitts apartment and in another home of his in Salzburg, Austria.The collection contains 1,500 items, including paintings, sculptures, sketches and drawings but also ledgers and other documentation, much of which will not be displayed.Most of the finest works were acquired by Mr. Gurlitts father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who began working for the Nazis in 1938.His son inherited the collection and kept it in the apartment for decades, until authorities discovered it as part of an investigation into tax evasion.The younger Mr. Gurlitt died months after the discovery , leaving the collection to the Kunstmuseum Bern.But a distant cousin challenged the will .The dispute left the ownership of the collection in limbo for more than a year, delaying the exhibitions.Gurlitt Status Report delves into the history behind the collection and the circumstances under it came together.This includes an exploration of the ambiguities surrounding Mr. Gurlitts fathers personal history.He was persecuted as the grandchild of Jew, but he also became one of only four dealers allowed to sell artworks confiscated by the Nazis.Also displayed are documents that record the efforts of the two galleries staging the exhibition to establish the original ownership of the works.Each of the shows focuses on a different aspect of the Third Reichs policies on art.The Bern exhibition, Degenerate Art, Confiscated and Sold, opens on Thursday.Its focus is on works acquired as part of the 1938 law that allowed the Nazis to seize so-called degenerate art, mostly Modernist pieces viewed by Hitler as un-German or as Jewish.In Bonn , works in Nazi Art Theft and its Consequences will go on display on Friday.Most of the art in the Bonn show is suspected of having been wrongfully taken by the Nazis from its Jewish owners and the ownership history of many pieces on display is not yet clear.Last week, researchers working with Project Gurlitt , the team of art historians and provenance researchers tasked by the German government with establishing the original ownership of works in the collection, identified a Thomas Couture painting as having belonged to Georges Mendel, a Jewish French politician.The work, Portrait of a Seated Young Woman, was the sixth to have been identified, thanks in part to the restoration team in Bonn, which was readying it for the exhibition.They noticed a barely detectable repaired hole in the canvas, at the level of the young womans chest, a detail which had been recorded in an initial claim filed after the end of the war.The fact that the researchers have been able, through their meticulous and unstinting work, to identify the painting by Thomas Couture as Nazi-looted art demonstrates once again how important it is not to let up in our efforts in the field of provenance research, Monica Grtters, Germanys culture minister said in a statement.News of the collections existence, first reported by Focus magazine in November 2013, spurred Germany to intensify efforts to establish provenance, following intense criticism for having kept the works secret for months after their initial discovery by tax authorities in February 2012.But three years after research efforts began, researchers had established the original ownership of only five works .The collection was hailed by art historians when it was found as the most important discovery of Nazi-looted art since the Allies discovered the hoards in the salt mines and the castles, and initial speculation placed its total value at more than $1 billion.As the reality of the scope and contents of the collection have become clear, the monetary value has been scaled back to hundreds of millions.Rein Wolfs, director of the Kunstmuseum Bern, and Nina Zimmer, director of the Bundesdunsthalle, wrote in the catalog that accompanies the exhibition that they do not see the value of the collection in monetary terms.Rather, they wrote, it is an opportunity to pay homage to the people who became victims of the National Socialist art theft, as well as the artists who were defamed and persecuted by the regime as degenerate.Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE

Review: Greta Gerwig’s ‘Lady Bird’ Is Big-Screen Perfection:::::I want you to be the very best version of yourself, says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).Video But what if this is the best version?Lady Bird responds.Its a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice.She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.While Lady Bird honors the gravity of Christines struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight.The very first scene begins in tears.Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of The Grapes of Wrath while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novels moving final sentences.Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy.It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the admissions process.Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage.She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time.She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush).She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.Photo You might think youve seen this all before.You probably have, but never quite like this.What Ms. Gerwig has done and its by no means a small accomplishment is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise.The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothe Chalamet).None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig.(Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument.Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted.It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family.The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larrys melancholy and Marions ill humor.They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesnt always express itself as kindness.They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make Lady Bird sound drab and dutiful, but its the opposite.I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is.I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits.Id tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail.Im tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself.In life, thats a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies.Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, Lady Bird is.
A Refusal to Compromise? Civil War Historians Beg to Differ:::::Constitution as Compromise Photo The compromises over slavery began with the Constitution itself.It famously declared that slaves would count as three-fifths of a person for purposes of representation and taxation.It also, in euphemistic language, allowed Congress to ban the international slave trade, but not for 20 years.And then there was the fact that the framers, deliberately, did not explicitly mention slavery even once.David Waldstreicher, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the author of Slaverys Constitution, said this approach created ambiguity about the framers intentions and the constitutionality of both proslavery and antislavery legislation.The Civil War was caused by the compromises in the Constitution over slavery, which shaped not only the evolution of slavery but also so many of the functions and dysfunctions of national politics, and still does, Mr. Waldstreicher said.It makes no sense to talk of a failure to compromise, except insofar as every war or political conflict is a failure to make a deal.The original compromises shaped everything.Battle Over Territorial Expansion Photo Most Northern states passed abolition laws by 1800, but the national debate intensified as factions fought over whether slavery would be allowed in the expanding western territories.In 1820, Congress enacted the Missouri Compromise, which allowed Missouri to enter the union as a slave state but otherwise forbade slavery above the 36th parallel, effectively drawing the lines for the sectional battle to follow.In 1836, it passed what would be the first of several gag rules, forbidding antislavery petitions from even being discussed.The Missouri Compromise unraveled with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which mandated that new states, regardless of geography, be allowed to decide the question of slavery by popular sovereignty.The act unleashed violence in Kansas, as well as in Congress itself, including an infamous brawl on the floor of the House in 1858 during debate over a proposed proslavery Kansas state constitution.That constitution was later defeated by a coalition of Republicans and Northern Democrats.Southern Democrats pushed so hard for such extremely proslavery policies, they drove Northern Democrats away from them, Kate Masur, a historian at Northwestern University, said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lincoln, the Great Compromiser?As slavery spread, so did the antislavery movement.Abolitionists then were often depicted as dangerous fanatics, but in truth the antislavery movement included many compromises when it came to black equality.One was the idea of colonization, which advocated resettling freed blacks in Africa, out a belief that they could never coexist with whites.One advocate of colonization was Abraham Lincoln, who indicated support for colonization as late as 1862.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even as a presidential nominee, he and the Republican Party were willing to entertain deals to keep the slaveholding South in the Union, including a proposed Constitutional amendment that would allow slavery to continue without federal interference where it already existed but prohibit its establishment in new territories.On that, it was the slaveholding states that refused to compromise, said Manisha Sinha, a historian at the University of Connecticut and the author of The Slaves Cause: A History of Abolition.Lincoln could have avoided the Civil War if he had agreed to compromise on the nonextension of slavery, but that was one thing Lincoln refused to compromise on, and rightly so, she said.When it comes to the Civil War, she added, we still cant seem to understand that the politics of compromise was a politics of appeasement that at many times sacrificed black freedom and rights.The Compromise of 1877 The 13th amendment, ratified in December 1865, eight months after the end of the Civil War, abolished slavery, but the battle over full citizenship for African-Americans continued during Reconstruction.There was widespread resistance to black male suffrage, which had been guaranteed by the 15th amendment.Tensions came to a climax with the deadlocked presidential election of 1876, when the results in Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana were disputed.The impasse ended with the Compromise of 1877, in which the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, was granted those states electoral votes in exchange for an end to federal support for republican governments in those states.Reconstruction was effectively over.Though the Compromise of 1877 is the one we remember, Ms. Masur, co-author of a recent National Park Service study of Reconstruction-related sites, noted that the way had been paved by earlier trade-offs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The election was as close as it was because Northerners had already compromised on the 15th amendment, she said.If there hadnt been voter suppression in the South from the outset of Reconstruction through the 1876 election itself, Hayes might well have won the presidency decisively.A Tragic Family Disagreement After Reconstruction was rolled back and Jim Crow segregation instituted in the South, a growing number of white Americans depicted the Civil War as a tragic family disagreement, rather than a battle over principle.In 1913, veterans from both sides gathered at Gettysburg for a Great Reunion, where President Woodrow Wilson gave an address that included no reference to slavery or secession.The era also saw a surge in the construction of Confederate monuments, including many outside the former Confederacy.Mr. Blight, the author of Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, said that Mr. Kellys remarks were themselves part of this reconciliationist tradition.It reflects a very old set of ideas about the meaning of the Civil War, Mr. Blight said.Everybody was right, and nobody was wrong.Everybody was noble, everyone fought for their conscience, you dont have to worry anymore about what they fought for.It takes all responsibility away, he said.Thats your compromise.
Maria Bamford: The First Time Someone Loved Me for Who I Really Am:::::I checked out of the hospital a few days later, hoping to feel better on the new medication.But as I flew to Chicago, I knew something was wrong.I somehow ended up bleeding, hysterical and lost downtown without any identification an hour before showtime.My manager heard me hyperventilating over the phone and canceled all four shows.Thus began a breakdown.Every moment of my life felt unbearable for a year and a half of hospitalizations and outpatient treatment programs.I drooled, I dropped glassware, I passed out face-first into Caesar salads.I could not think, had difficulty speaking and could not in any way work.I kept asking other patients the same questions: Do you still have a job?Do you think youll ever be able to work again?I kept asking my doctors when they thought Id be well enough to go back to comedy.Of course, none of them could guarantee full recovery.But I did gather some surprising information that I wasnt particularly interested in at the time: Many patients had partners and wives and husbands.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There was the wife and mother of grown children receiving ECT treatments that caused short term memory loss.A young woman who, after a psychotic episode involving the K.G.B.and aliens, spoke of her longtime boyfriend and all the support he provided when she was fired from her sales job.There was the man who came into the ward after a manic, knife-wielding episode in which he might have stabbed someone (I was very out of it and couldnt get the whole story).He chatted amiably with his wife during visiting hours.Over and over again, I encountered people with debilitating mental illness who were also part of a couple.They werent working, they needed care.They were a burden.And yet they were loved.I started to think: That could be me.If I ever got better, maybe I would meet someone who could love me as I am.That maybe, work or no work, Id no longer have to wait to be lovable (translation: productive) in order to be loved.And I was right.A year and a half later, when my mood had stabilized (I still had a tremor and memory problems), I met a man named Scott through OkCupid.It was his second internet date; my 97th.It wasnt particularly magical, just nice.We met for coffee, and he was easy to talk to.I love art, and thats what he does; he thought I was funny and loves comedy.He really wanted to go out again, despite the fact that he had Googled me and knew about my perceived deal-breaker.On our second date a hike with my dog in Griffith Park he was eager to share his own perceived flaws ($52,000 in student loans!Arthritis!An overheating 92 Saturn!Cant travel by airplane! )And then, on our fourth date, he said one of the most romantic things Ive ever heard: I know they dont let you have sharp stuff in the psych ward.When my mom was in there, she grew a little beard.If that happens to you, Ill come in and shave your beard!His mother, Linda, has passed away, but I think shed be proud that her son is ready with a Daisy razor.Ive been stable for the past several years, but I am comforted by that promise of support.Our mutual failure with long-term relationships (Scott had made it to three years) is weirdly what makes us both so committed and connected.As they say in 12-step recovery, its weakness, not strength, that binds us to each other.Scott and I have been moody in front of each other many times, most recently when we moved and he saw me scream for the first time.Over a television placement.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But we talked about what is now called The Regrettable Incident of the Television Placement with our couples therapist the next day and later laughed about it with friends.And Scott has had his own embarrassing emotional lows, too.Its no secret who we are and what our flaws are.I think thats what love is not having to hide exactly who you are.We got married on April 13, 2015, and have been together for four years, breaking both of our previous records.
Hilde Lysiak, Reporter, Author, 10-Year-Old:::::Growing up, Ms. Lysiak traveled around the country with her father, a former reporter for The New York Daily News, when he was on assignment.Asked what she remembers from that time, she mentions a wild turkey chase in Staten Island and a visit to an oversize Christmas tree in Pennsylvania.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But her father notes that she was exposed to serious reporting early on.They spent a month in Florida after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by George Zimmerman and went to South Carolina after the massacre at a church in Charleston.We would have conversations, but I wish I could tell you I said, Well, in journalism, heres what we do, Mr. Lysiak said.Instead, Ms. Lysiak learned through exposure.Photo The family moved from New York City to Pennsylvania when she was 6, and soon after she started covering minor family events she broke the news to her father, for instance, that her mother planned to buy a new car writing the articles on notecards in crayon.But she quickly realized it wasnt getting me anywhere and asked her dad if he could help her start a real newspaper.He agreed to handle the printing and the layout if she did all the writing and reporting.She began by covering her block, then broadened to the neighborhood.Sometimes she gets stories from emailed tips, but mostly she rides around on her bike, asking people if theyve heard of anything strange going on.Ms. Lysiak started out charging $1 for a years subscription and had a few dozen subscribers; now her print circulation is close to 600 $20 for a yearlong subscription with hundreds of thousands of online views.Ms. Lysiak uses some of this money to pay her 13-year-old sister Izzy $25 a week to be her videographer.She credits her older sibling with making her paper a multimedia operation.Ms. Lysiak is home-schooled and used to spend all her time reporting.Shed leave in the morning, and we wouldnt see her until the afternoon, said Mr. Lysiak.His wife, Bridget, wanted to make sure their daughters had a contingency plan in case their passions changed.They balance out reporting with regular math, science and history lessons for Ms. Lysiak, while Izzy, who has a regular advice column in The Orange Street News and works as an actress, takes 10th-grade-level math, biology and history at the local high school.Ms. Lysiak also has two younger sisters, Juliet, 3, and Georgia, 6.Photo Our familys really big on people having free time, Mr. Lysiak said.Theres so much homework in school these days, and we had to make the decision about whether shed have her paper or not.And she really wanted her paper.The Lysiaks send Hilde to camp for a few weeks every summer to make sure she gets a break from reporting, and she spends her free time making slime, which I find great joy in, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In fact, slime comes up quite a bit, to her fathers chagrin.Ms. Lysiak laments that her biking limits prevent her from riding to Walmart, where they sell inexpensive glue that is great for slime.And she recounts an accident in her laboratory her closet after which her parents relegated her slime-making to the outdoors.Ms. Lysiak is as serious about her reporting as she is about being a kid.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Hilde Cracks the Case is part of the Branches line at Scholastic, a group of early chapter books geared toward children 5 to 8 years old who are newly independent readers but not yet ready for conventional chapter books.Its the brainchild of Katie Carella, a senior editor at Scholastic; before getting into publishing, she was a teacher, and she noticed a gap in the books available to her students who were burgeoning readers.I want to have a series that can reach every reader, Ms. Carella said.Kids at this level need to build their reading stamina and fluency, and its important that they be allowed to make their own reading choices.The Branches line was first introduced in 2013, and now it includes 18 series (the 19th will be published in January), with 12 million books in circulation.Hilde Cracks the Case is its first mystery series.When the real Hildes parents left New York, they thought they were putting journalism behind them.Mr. Lysiak had become disenchanted with the industry, so he left his job at The Daily News.When I saw her real passion, it brought my passion back, he said, because she does it so simply its like who, what.The things that I used to go do before it got complicated.Despite earlier criticism, people in the town definitely take her seriously now.There are a lot of people in town that dont like her, Mr. Lysiak said.They want her writing stories about parades and promoting the town.But no, Hilde wants to report crime and scandal when she finds it.In response to her neighbors wariness, Ms. Lysiak added, It makes me think Im a good journalist.
‘Stranger Things 2’: Pixar’s Andrew Stanton on Directing 2 Episodes:::::On the continuum between the heavily collaborative Pixar productions and something more director-driven like John Carter, where does working on Stranger Things fall?Advertisement Continue reading the main story I shadowed the production for almost a month in the fall of last year, while the Duffers were shooting their first two episodes and Shawn was prepping his, and the thing that didnt surprise me at all was that crew was having such fun.It was almost like an internet start-up atmosphere.They were already deep into the second season before they realized the phenomenon they were sitting on.Nobody was jaded.Everybody was just so innocently excited.Stranger Things has a distinctive visual style, referencing Steven Spielberg and James Cameron and a lot of other 80s movies.Is the look of any given scene dictated in the script?You know, the Duffers dont like to admit what theyre referencing too head-on.I think they try to let inspiration fall where it may.I was basically allowed to run free, to get my Spielberg on and my Cameron on.You try not to be gratuitous.But man, was it fun, staging these shots that were not just straight out of a movie, but that for me were like, This is exactly what it felt to watch this scene from Aliens.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get expert TV and movie recommendations from the Watching newsletter The best of what to watch and where to watch it, delivered to your inbox twice a week.What about the cultural references?In one of your episodes, Dacre Montgomerys bad boy character Billy is listening to Ratt.In the other episode, someones watching Family Feud on TV.Were any of those touches up to you?Family Feud was mine.The songs are a separate thing.But really, the Duffers trust their art department and props department and set-dressing department and costume department to go on little archaeological digs.I havent talked about this with the Duffers or with Shawn but I have to believe that half the fun of directing an episode of Stranger Things for them is walking onto the set and suddenly seeing the extras wearing those clothes and seeing all the vintage props and getting inspired by whats in front of you.That surprise is really useful.I remember in one of my episodes, Billys working out with weights and smoking, and he has a sleeveless shirt on.The minute I saw it, I thought, Oh my god, I wore so many of those.And Dacre said, I think my character would work without a shirt on.I told him, Well do a take without it, but just for this rehearsal, can you try it with the shirt?This is a scene where the shot is of him coming outside the house, so I was all the way across the street with the camera crew.The second he stepped out of the house, I heard about four guys behind I camera go, Oh man, I totally had that shirt.I was like, O.K., were keeping it.You have a sequence where Sean Astin walks through the Byers house and realizes that what Wills strange drawings are actually a map.Why did you do it mostly as a series of long tracking shots?Not only was it hard to shoot in that house, but also I knew that Shawn had already shot some of the drawing and piecing-together of the maps.I didnt want my scenes to feel the same.What can I do differently that feels supportive of the narrative, and which captures this slow build of Bob going, I get it, I get it, I got it?I wanted to do one well-choreographed take.We ultimately ended up cutting it into three shots, because we got some other coverage.But it was mostly one long master shot, so you could feel Bobs mood.And we could feed off Seans acting, to have like a musical build to the Aha!Whats next for you?Ive got an independent feature that Im trying to get off the ground called Revolver.Its actually written by Kate Trefry, who wrote Episode 6 of Stranger Things, but it was a different route through which I connected with the script.Right now Im back at Pixar.Part of my job is to be one of the creative overseers of the projects going on here.I spend half my year here, keeping that all going.Hopefully Ill be doing more TV.I want to be all over the map.
Kahlil Joseph’s New Film Is Steeped in Harlem’s History. And His Own.:::::That was at the urging of his brother, Noah Davis, a contemporary artist who founded an influential exhibition space in Los Angeles called the Underground Museum.Mr. Joseph was a successful filmmaker at the time, directing music videos for artists like Flying Lotus, and was later nominated for an Emmy as one of the directors of Beyoncs visual album Lemonade.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in 2014, Mr. Joseph had just completed a 14-minute film that he couldnt release.It was based on work hed done for Mr. Lamar, after the release of his album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.Blending home video from Mr. Lamars family with original footage filmed in Compton, Calif., Mr. Joseph had made something new.But it was not a traditional music video, and Mr. Lamar was not interested in putting it out, Mr. Joseph, 36, recalled in a recent interview.Thats when Mr. Josephs brother advised him to turn it into an installation for the Underground Museum.Projected on two screens arranged in a V shape, the film, m.A.A.d, was a striking success, drawing a host of new visitors to the space.All of a sudden, Im a fine artist, Mr. Joseph said.All thanks to my brother.Photo Among the transfixed viewers was Helen Molesworth, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.I literally drove back to the museum and put it on the schedule, she said.The films triumphant run at the Museum of Contemporary Art was followed by more work, including Lemonade and Music Is My Mistress, a project for the fashion house Kenzo.Then, last year, came the invitation from the New Museum: Could Mr. Joseph create a new film, a sort of New York-based companion piece to m.A.A.d.?For the first time in his career, Mr. Joseph faced a blank slate.There was no song, no album, no core material to draw on.But he quickly found that its impossible not to think about all your heroes and references when you write, he said.In addition to Mr. DeCarava, the photographer, Mr. Joseph drew on the work of Chris Marker, whose film Sans Soleil offers an extended meditation on memory and time.With Fly Paper, Mr. Joseph pays homage to a host of literary and cultural figures, splicing and mixing in references among its scenes of fictional characters.Some figures skate away, while others recur.Photo Photo The film builds in layers, with vrit footage from the street interspersed with elegant, vividly staged scenes.A woman places a handbag on a bed; an elegant gentleman (Ben Vereen) climbs a set of stairs, then reclines, fully dressed, in a bathtub.He visits an art gallery.He dances in an empty room and with the Brooklyn-born flex dancer Storyboard P. The soundtrack leaps, too.Music collides with the sounds of the city: drums, bass, an ambulance, a train.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I wanted people to feel like they saw a Harlem that they cant see, Mr. Joseph said.You can take a tour bus around Harlem and see the exterior.His hunt for the heart of the neighborhood also shows the influence of Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, author of the 2011 book Harlem Is Nowhere (its title is from a 1948 essay by Ralph Ellison).The neighborhoods role as a capital of American culture, and exuberant celebration of African-American life is a voice in his work, which includes a passage read from Ms. Rhodes-Pittss book.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But some of the ghosts are his own.A middle-aged man in an overcoat gets into a cab.Hes on a gurney, proceeding down a hospital hall.Hes in a chair, head shaved, a surgical scar circling one side of his skull, watching ESPN.That would be Mr. Josephs father, the sports and entertainment attorney Keven Davis, who lived in Harlem until his death in 2011 at 53.That shock still reverberates for Mr. Joseph.I remember having no concept that my parents could ever pass away, he said.They seemed like these eternal experiences.The next shock came in 2015, when Noah, his brother, died at 32.You think you have a lot of time with people, when youre young, Mr. Joseph said.Theyre going to live until theyre at least 70.Right?Photo It was a struggle to edit Fly Paper, because of its deeply personal nature, and only late in the process did Mr. Joseph decide to include footage of his family.Searching through video he had shot in 2011 during his fathers last months, he said, led to a wormhole, all this stuff that I totally forgot I shot, because I was in such automatic mode.Again, he was inspired by Mr. DeCaravas work, noting how the photographer included portraits of his wife and daughters in his 1996 MoMA retrospective, alongside his depictions of jazz greats like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis.He was able to not compartmentalize, Mr. Joseph said.Thats why I started to include my family.Thats my big reference to Roy.That was his big genius.The loss of his father and brother also contributed to the erosion of Mr. Josephs sense of time, he said a huge preoccupation for a filmmaker.Our understanding of time as linear is completely false, he said.In the film, its rarely clear whether everything is happening in the same period, across generations, or in a kind of eternal loop.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Visitors at the New Museum show wander in, not knowing quite what to expect.But that kind of serendipity is fine with Mr. Joseph, who compared it to his youthful experience of flipping TV channels, only to happen across a movie in progress.The likelihood that I would finish the film was probably increased by coming in somewhere in the middle, not knowing where I am, he said.A sense of dislocation defines the film, which slips from one visual format to another from 35-millimeter color film to coruscating black-and-white to bleary hand-held video in a way that recalls the rapidly shifting frames of a dream.In the coda, just after the final shot of Mr. Josephs father, there is a sequence of video clips from the 1990s, highlights from the career of the former Detroit Lions star running back Barry Sanders, who abruptly retired before the 1999 season.Mr. Joseph warmly recalled that during his fathers final months they would bond over sports, and Mr. Sanders, a particular favorite.Ive always been drawn to the ballet-like nature of his specific play, Mr. Joseph said.He also praised the athletes decision to step away from the sport at the peak of his powers.It was like a Zen samurai principle thing, right?In the clips, which last a minute or so, the football star streaks across the field, again and again, a flash of joy that sharply contrasts with the painful hospital scenes.It may seem like a jarring shift in mood, but it is in keeping with the films essayistic form.I really love filmmaking, to be honest, Mr. Joseph said.More than plot.
Review: ‘The B-Side’ Is an Extraordinary Masterclass in Listening:::::Before he sets needle to vinyl, Mr. Berryman gives us a bit of matter-of-fact introduction to what we are about to hear and how this performance came into being.Several years ago, he had seen Early Shaker Spirituals.While working in a Chinese tea shop as a waiter, he met that shows director, the Wooster stalwart Kate Valk, and told her he had an idea for her.And so Ms. Valk wound up staging The B-Side.It is a task to which she and a design team overseen by Elizabeth LeCompte, the Wooster Groups artistic director, with lighting by Ryan Seelig and sound by Eric Sluyter have brought a rigorous elegance and clarity.Mr. Berrymans prefatory remarks are delivered with the smooth, Everyman diction you associate with actors doing voice-overs or pitching their rsums at auditions.It is not a tone that prepares you for the voice no, make that voices that subsequently emanate from Mr. Berryman and his two fellow performers, Philip Moore and Jasper McGruder.For what these men do is something you have probably done when alone at home.They sing along with the record, their voices layering and merging with, in this case, those of convicts doing hard labor a half-century ago.Perhaps unlike you, Mr. Berryman and company do so with a concentration, lucidity and visceral force that suggest profound and old acquaintance with the music.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I mean, really, really old as in centuries old.Not that any of these performers are geriatric.But they become conduits for the songs of prisoners who were themselves conduits for an oral tradition that stretches back to at least the early days of slavery in this country.This is music that feels viral not in the technological sense of current usage, but in the sense of residing in the bloodstream.Mr. Berryman occasionally annotates the separate numbers (there are 14 in total) with readings of passages from Mr. Jacksons book of oral history, Wake Up Dead Man: Hard Labor and Southern Blues.As in Mr. Berrymans introduction to the show, none of these descriptions is politically or emotionally shaded.Theyre neutral, so as not to block our view of the main event here.Thats the music, of course, and the recorded spoken-word toasts.Performed a cappella, the songs spin tales of mythologically mean prison guards, and loves and lives lost, and the backbreaking purgatory of unendingly repetitive physical tasks.The actors do not try to re-create the wood-hacking and hoeing that was the daily lot of the men they are channeling.Mostly, they are uncommonly still, conflating the acts of singing and listening.Gestures and movements are severely rationed, so that each one reads incisively.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Only once does Mr. Berryman fully cut loose, to deliver a parody of an evangelical spiel, which releases him from the aural backdrop of the record and has him sprinting into the audience as an animated cartoon of a money-collecting preacher.Entitled Daniel in the Lions Den, it is the penultimate piece in the show.For the final number, the work song Forty-Four Hammers, Mr. Berryman falls silent to become the quintessential listener again.He takes a chair and watches old grainy film showing an unbroken line of chain-gang members chopping wood in unison.(Robert Wuss is the video designer.)That found footage is projected against images, on a sleek monitor, of Mr. Berrymans apartment in Harlem, where his vinyl record collection fills shelves.His home could be said to have always been the setting for this show or rather any place where you feel safe developing an intense and intimate relationship with the art of others.
Broadway’s Comic Chameleon Writes a Heartfelt New Tune:::::That, too, was wrong.Mr. Yazbek doesnt smoke.Photo Its a musical chameleons curse, and maybe his protection, that people dont have any idea, sonically or otherwise, who he really is.Those familiar with Mr. Yazbek as Broadways go-to songwriter for comedy film adaptations probably havent heard his solo work as frontman for a series of rock bands with names like Coke Machine, Moon Pudding, Barn and His Warmest Regards.And vice versa: Those who groove to his sulfurous, often cheerfully pessimistic albums, with songs like Monkey Baby Hanging on a Chicken Wire and Ultrasad, would probably be surprised by brassy show tunes like Here I Am and unironic ballads like Breeze Off the River.Which is why its understandable that the talk around Broadway about Mr. Yazbek and The Bands Visit, which opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 9 in a production directed by Mr. Cromer, is so wrong.This delicate, contemplative and thoroughly gorgeous musical, first seen last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not represent, as some say, Mr. Yazbeks unlikeliest disguise to date.Quite the opposite.The Bands Visit is the truest version of him Broadway has yet heard, or is ever likely to.All my life Ive written songs, right?he half-asks, half-demands, lying like an analysand on a couch in the studio he built a few yards from his house in Rockland County.Unlike most people in analysis, though, he noodles gently on a bass as he speaks.Ive made five albums that have nothing to do with musical theater, he continues.And, like most singer-songwriters, my motive for writing them was to tell people what I was thinking and feeling.That usually has to do with human connection and death, in a good way: How life is ennobled by the fact of death, and is deeper than what we run around frittering about all day.He pauses and plinks.But unlike my other shows, in which I had a real but superficial connection to the characters issues, almost every song in The Bands Visit gives me the feeling that Ive expressed something I feel deeply about.Photo Photo If thats a tall order for a musical, The Bands Visit is unusually ambitious, its many comic moments woven like countermelodies into a story of human beings crying from the heart in joy or pain, as Mr. Yazbek puts it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With a book by Itamar Moses, based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, it concerns a ragtag Egyptian police orchestra that gets stranded in the wrong Israeli town en route to a gig at an Arab cultural center.Instead of exciting Petah Tikvah, with a P, they wind up in a stultifying Negev outpost called Bet Hatkivah, with a B like in basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah, as one of Mr. Yazbeks dead-on lyrics puts it.The theme is miscommunication, including the romantic kind: the terrible gap between what we feel and what we say.In The Bands Visit, the only cure is music, and yet it isnt enough.The Egyptians and the Israelis reach out to one another on waves of melody, from ethereal Arab song to thumping klezmer.Two in particular the bands leader, Tewfiq (Tony Shalhoub), and Dina, who houses him (Katrina Lenk) nearly find a common language.But even they eventually have to acknowledge the emptiness, if perhaps a slightly less empty emptiness, that seeps back when melody passes.Video This theme and setting made The Bands Visit a natural playground for Mr. Yazbek, who grew up on Manhattans Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father and a half Jewish, half Italian mother.For a song about the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, he could call on his own memory of her voice on the radio in a cab while visiting his grandfather in Lebanon.To shape the scores swirling contours, he did not have to study Middle Eastern scales or Egyptian instrumentation; he was already handy on darbouka (a goblet-shaped drum) and oud (a short-necked lyre).He was also in a good position to translate what he calls the sound of Israeli sarcasm.But he had a surfeit of other sounds as well.Growing up surrounded by every kind of music Kiss Me, Kate and Miles Davis on the stereo, the polyrhythms of congas in Central Park he developed an early and eclectic ear.He started his first band, whose name cannot be published here, when he was 12; played gigs for a thousand students at college block parties; landed a solo recording contract at 28.Another lifetime later, at 57, though married (to Elizabeth Doberneck, a meditation teacher) and with a son, Omar, in college, Mr. Yazbek retains the slightly hassled aura of a man who has almost made peace with his work or, maybe more accurately, a man who remakes that peace every day.(He, too, meditates.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This is a vast improvement over the person who seemed to be jumping out of his skin when I first encountered him in the Full Monty era.Back then, he seemed embarrassed that, of all the roads open to him, hed found his biggest success on the one that led to Broadway, with its corny philosophies and unprovoked belting.Among the roads less taken was comedy.Directly out of Brown, he wrote for David Letterman, part of a Late Show team that won an Emmy Award in 1984.(His favorite bit was called The Most Dangerous Game, in which a pack of bloodhounds searched 30 Rock for the announcer Bill Wendell.)And his career as a solo musical artist never took off the way he had planned though that was, he says, his own fault.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I made my own bed when I decided not to tour all the time, he explains.There were guys like Ben Folds and Dave Matthews who started off at the same time, doing what I should have done: get in a van with a baby grand, go up and down the East Coast circuit and make a subsistence living while developing a fan base.But if I doomed myself by staying home, it turns out it was a great doom.Now all those guys are sick of touring and want to write musicals.Even so, for a long time the regret was easily read on his face.The man-dudes in his poker game, hoping to annoy him into making mistakes, insisted on calling him Broadways David Yazbek.That taunt would have been incomprehensible during the so-called Golden Age of musicals.Loesser, Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim, three of Mr. Yazbeks idols, could aspire to nothing higher than Broadway success though Mr. Sondheim, coming at the end of the line, eventually grew so disheartened that he threatened to give up musicals for murder mysteries or video games.Its worth noting that what toppled theater music from its position as the prime engine of popular culture was the same trend that Mr. Yazbek was hoping to ride: the rise of the rock singer-songwriter.Mr. Yazbek has played both sides of the fence, bringing to each discipline the skills and, well, the discipline of the other.Thanks to rock, he writes musical theater lyrics that arise from their stories at unexpected angles and with a looser diction than most of the classics.The rhymes in The Bands Visit are accurate enough to get laughs (awful/falafel; marrow/Pharaoh) but not obsessively mitered.Thanks to musical theater, his rock songs are tighter and better structured than almost anyones.And after decades in which critics openly prayed for a savior to resuscitate theater music with the primal energies of pop, perhaps we can now see that Mr. Yazbek has been doing it, insufficiently heralded, for years.(He received Tony Award nominations for all three of his previous Broadway scores, but has never won.)In the shadow of The Producers, The Full Monty was a marginal hit; Dirty Rotten Scoundrels recouped only on the road.Women on the Verge, through no fault of Mr. Yazbeks, was a major flop (though a revised version met with more success in London).Even The Bands Visit, despite its Off Broadway raves, is nobodys idea of a sure thing.Mr. Yazbek would, of course, love a hit, but his pleasure in the work itself acts as a kind of professional prophylaxis.He has nearly completed the score for a musical version of the 1982 hit film Tootsie as flat-out a musical comedy as you could imagine and is working on the lyrics to Henry Kriegers music for a show about the evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker.The luxury of writing only what he wants, while recording the occasional solo album, is enough, he says, to service my pretensions.Servicing his spiritual aspirations is a different matter.This used to require performing in public: The connection you make while sharing in the creation of music with other people in real time, he says, is the closest metaphor for the actual connection that every sentient being has, way beneath the surface, at the root of truth.Photo Now, he says, he can achieve that connection without so much performing.Still, after certain performances, when company members gather outside the Barrymore or beneath its stage for a jam session of Arabic music, Mr. Yazbek sometimes joins in.On a recent evening, after a two-show day, he grabbed a spare drum from the darbouka player Ossama Farouk, while George Abud, who plays Camal in the musical, improvised on his oud, with Ms. Lenk on violin.They fed one another melodies like canaps.A few rugs and lanterns could not disguise the grimness of what was actually the musicians locker room, with costume racks pressing in.But as the four worked through El Hayah Helwa (Life Is Beautiful) by Farid al-Atrash, and an Umm Kulthum song called Awedt Ainy, which Mr. Abud translated as Im Addicted to You, all the discomforts disappeared.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And so, after a while, with a huge smile, did Mr. Yazbek.He got what he wanted, and was gone.
‘The Exterminating Angel’ Brings Together Opera and the Movies:::::I think Buuel understood and loved music as much as any other film director.But the movies from his fecund late period in France dont have musical scores.Theres music in some of them memorably, the flamenco that ngela Molina dances to in That Obscure Object of Desire but no scores.The music in those late films is mostly in their rhythms.In Belle de Jour, when the film wants to convey the disjointed consciousness and subconscious of its conflicted heroine, her memories and fantasies are cut with a syncopated abruptness.Advertisement Continue reading the main story WALLS This is one of the biggest hurdles for a composer trying to adapt Buuel: defining in music something that originally had little of it.Mr. Ads responds to the challenge with a crazily varied score.His earlier works have exhibited some similar traits; his 1995 opera Powder Her Face is full of self-consciously outrageous winking.But his sounds here are stranger and funnier.He emphasizes the situations surrealism with his choice of instruments, like the ondes Martenot and its ethereal, swooping tones.Miniature violins and a salad bowl are included.Video The orchestras regular instruments also get in on the fun.Theres a lot of dissonance in some of the ensemble scenes but also some abstracted waltz pulses that are amusing for the would-be-elegant way they wander in from nowhere.What did you make of the music?Photo KENNY Even though theres little music in the film, The Exterminating Angel is about people attending a dinner party after an opera Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor and the film is steeped in music appreciation.One of the guests, Blanca, entertains everyone on the piano, and theres talk of pizzicato and sonatas.The most beautiful woman in the group, Leticia, is mockingly given the Wagnerian nickname Valkyrie.Its commendable that Mr. Ads doesnt take these specific classical-music allusions as a cue for lazy pastiche.When Leticias nickname is first mentioned, a Wagnerian motif does not follow.Thats not to say that Mr. Ads isnt referential.Like many of our best contemporary composers, hes got an exhaustive command of musical idioms.I heard percussion like that of Calanda, the town where Buuel was from; flamenco; Wagner by way of Bernard Herrmann.WALLS During intermission, you reminded me that Buuel used the Liebestod from Wagners Tristan und Isolde twice, in Un Chien Andalou and LAge dOr, right at the start of his career.KENNY The Liebestod was a piece of music Buuel was drawn to almost as much as he was to the drums of Calanda.He also uses it in a rarity, his 1953 Mexican adaptation of Wuthering Heights.For him the Liebestod is the ultimate musical expression of amour fou, the surrealist ideal of wild romantic love, an overwhelming destructive force against bourgeois values.WALLS Its clear that he enjoyed music and that he also detested the snobbish attitudes that can ruin our experience of it.In The Exterminating Angel, the characters seem to become enmeshed in their fateful trap right after the pianists performance, when a conductor in the group harshly corrects another guest who uses the wrong terminology.Its as if that casual elitist cruelty is spurring Buuel on.Photo KENNY Thats an interesting read on it.Almost invariably, Buuels films, when they depict the bourgeoisie, depict forces at work to confuse or punish it.This theme, and its particular pertinence today, may be why artists are lately drawn to The Exterminating Angel.Theres Mr. Ads and Stephen Sondheim, whos at work on a musical that merges the story with The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, another film about an upper-class dinner party gone awry that Buuel made 10 years later.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But I have never looked at the outlandish situations in terms of cause and effect.I always see Buuel as a deadpan presenter of outsize existential quandaries with no rational explanation.WALLS When I glanced over some of Buuels writings, I found many references to music.In a short 1922 piece, Orchestration, he came up with character sketches for instruments.About the cello: Murmurs of sea and woods.Serenity.Deep eyes.They have the conviction and grandeur of Jesuss sermons in the desert.Regarding the timpani: Skins filled with olives.By the time he wrote his autobiography, My Last Sigh, he was suffering from deafness.Yet his musical memory was still crisp: He recalled trying to draft Andr Breton into opera fandom.It didnt take since the production, of Charpentiers Louise, was bad enough to drive everyone from the theater.KENNY That last chapter of My Last Sigh, in which he describes his preparation for death, is sad and funny at once and never more poignant than when he complains that his deafness has made it impossible for him to listen to music.

5 Shows to See if You’re in New York in November:::::Photo New Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be.This citys theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places.Consider some of the new productions opening this month.Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America.And, oh yes, space as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.The Bands Visit Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel.But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies.A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.Tickets: thebandsvisitmusical.com Brigadoon Photo Perhaps the ultimate escape from New York fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress.City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location.Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of An American in Paris, and the cast includes Kelli OHara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too).Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of Brigadoon will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tickets: nycitycenter.org The Wolves Photo First seen in a Playwrights Realm production last year, Sarah DeLappes high-voltage drama of young women coming of age on AstroTurf is being remounted at the Mitzi E.

Yes, Breitbart News Has a Fashion Critic:::::Advertisement Yes, Breitbart News Has a Fashion Critic Image John Binder at his home in Slidell, La.The painting behind Mr. Binder is a portrait of him painted by his sister.Credit Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times John Binder has a bone to pick with his fellow fashion chroniclers.Mostly their attitude is you can be with us, but you have to believe all the things that we believe, he said.If you dont, youre just not chic enough for us.From the vantage of a professional outlier, and ultraconservative at that, he may not be far off the mark.You wont find Mr. Binder in the front row of the seasons hottest shows, gushing over the sometimes kinky collections of star brands including Alexander Wang or Marc Jacobs.Nor is he likely to get much love from the left-leaning fashion establishment.Image Credit Frazer Harrison/Getty Images He routinely heaps accolades on the high-profile personalities that style-world insiders, at least privately, tend to scorn.Chief among them is the first lady, whom Mr. Binder exalts as a role model for ordinary American women.Nicole Kidman, who, in his phrase, rocked Hollywood with her vocal postelection support for Donald Trump, gets similar treatment , soaring to the top of Mr. Binders best-dressed list.She stunned at the Emmy awards, he writes, in a red gown cut at the ankle with the most exquisite silver roping around the neckline.He reserves his barbs for the likes of Jane Fonda, the leftist actress, who in a faux, Beyonc-esque ponytail looked like she had developed a classic case of trying to be a teeny-bopper.Give it up, Jane.Samantha Bee, liberal Hollywoods talk show darling, fared no better, pretty much a train wreck, Mr. Binder writes , a leprechaun in her shoulder-padded, emerald green ensemble.For Mr. Binder, 25, delivering tart commentary is all in a days work.He is the fashion critic for Breitbart News.Yes, Breitbart has a fashion critic (!), a man who by his own account is uniquely cut out for the job.Mr. Binder has been following his twin passions, fashion and politics, since his student days at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, La.His professors were all too predictably liberal, he said in a phone conversation last week.Which left Mr. Binder, a contrarian by nature, to take an opposing position.The university turned me into a total right-winger, he said.All the same, he remained enthralled by the celebrity culture that spoke to his more progressive peers.I loved music, the whole punk rock era, all of those things, he recalled, such attractions all the more compelling to a boy with a nose perpetually pressed to the glass.I dont live this grand fabulous lifestyle, said Mr. Binder, who was reared in Slidell, La., near New Orleans, the youngest of eight siblings in a family of moderate means.I dont come from a place of growing up in a grand apartment in the West Village, from a place of having the same opinion as everyone else.His opinions, as might be expected, are in line with those of his employer.At its founding a decade ago, Breitbart dedicated its ideologically right-leaning coverage to celebrity culture.One of our governing principles, said Alex Marlow, the sites editor in chief, is that culture is upstream from politics.Meaning that the culture in influencing our political climate more than our political climate is influencing the culture.Mr. Marlow, who hired Mr. Binder in April, would like those priorities reflected on the sites home page.I want people to go there and find something amusing, he said, and not regard it purely as a place where readers get outraged.The site attracts its audience through, among other things, Mr. Binders relentless O.K., obsessive monitoring of Mrs. Trump, a click magnet, Mr. Marlow noted, to both male and female readers, and the member of the first family that gets the highest approval rating.Mr. Binder places her on a pedestal alongside a couple of his other revered tastemakers, the greatest living women, in his phrase: Victoria Beckham and the Olsen sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley.In part, he admires his seemingly unlikely idols for their skillful self-branding.Ms. Beckham, in particular, works a kind of uniform, he noted: With her perfect hair, oversize sweaters, pants and a handbag, you cant imagine her any other way.In that sense she is very much like Melania.The first lady, he said, rarely veers from her signature formality, cleaving to a daytime wardrobe of crisp shift dresses or tailored suits.Never mind that she flaunted a $51,500 Dolce & Gabbana coat during a visit to Sicily.Or got down in the dirt at the White House in September, gardening in a Balmain tartan shirt that costs $1,380.Or that she walked tall in stilettos en route to Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.Even in that time of crisis, Mr. Binder enthused the other day, she was unapologetic and fabulous.That sort of boosterism may not raise his stock with fashion insiders, but Mr.

Frank Stella’s Favorite Cities for Art:::::Photo The American artist Frank Stella, 81, best known for his Minimalist and abstract styles, will tell you that, without travel, he wouldnt have been able to sustain his career as long as he has.Seeing great art in different destinations gives me the motivation to keep going and holds me to a high standard professionally, he said.Now, Mr. Stellas 60-year trajectory as an artist, which developed as he traveled the world, is on display in an exhibition, Frank Stella: Experiment and Change, at the NSU Art Museum Fort Lauderdale, in Florida; the show will run from Nov. 12 to July 8, 2018, and includes approximately 300 of his paintings, sculptures and drawings spanning from the late 1950s to the present.Mr. Stella lives in New York City and spends between 30 and 40 percent of his time on the road for work, traveling to his exhibitions and giving talks on his art.Below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation with him.How did an exhibition of your works end up in Fort Lauderdale?What is the citys art scene like?Advertisement Continue reading the main story When I think about art in Fort Lauderdale, I also include Miami because they are so near each other, and together, they are a lot more visible now in the arts world than they were several years ago.The excitement around Art Basel, the show in Miami Beach, is an example of this visibility, but some of the museums are also high-caliber.The NSU Museum, for one, is in an interesting modernist building designed by the American architect Edward Larrabee Barnes.I had visited the museum before and admired many of the works inside.I had also worked with the exhibits curator, Bonnie Clearwater, in the early 2000s on an exhibition of my art at the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, and when she approached me about this show, it was a no-brainer for me to say yes because of my relationship with her and my fondness for the museum.

El Museo del Barrio to Close for Several Months During Renovations:::::Advertisement El Museo del Barrio to Close for Several Months During Renovations Image El Museo del Barrio will close for several months for renovations.Credit Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times El Museo del Barrio, the countrys oldest museum devoted to Latino art, announced on Tuesday that it will close its exhibition galleries and theater for several months as part of a planned renovation.The galleries will close starting Monday, Nov. 6, and reopen in the summer of 2018, the museum said.Its theater, El Teatro, will be closed until the fall of 2018.El Museo has scheduled two off-site exhibitions during the renovations.We are confident that the planned renovations and upgrades will enable El Museo del Barrio to provide visitors an improved experience and ultimately address its structural needs as a growing museum, Patrick Charpenel, the executive director, said.As a part of a city-owned building, these proposed upgrades have been in the pipeline for some time, and we are excited for the expanded opportunities in exhibition and rentals that these improvements will bring.The museum was started in a public school classroom in 1969 by artists and activists who wanted to emphasize Puerto Rican cultural contributions.But the museums mission has expanded since then, and its collection now includes a wide range of art from the Caribbean and the Americas.Since 1978 it has occupied more than 6,500 square feet inside a building at Fifth Avenue between 104th and 105th Street.The organization has faced difficulties recently even as it has mounted well-received exhibitions.Financial problems have forced staff cuts, and the museum went from being open six days a week to five.Since 2010, El Museo has cycled through three directors as well as other senior executives.The closings are one of the first major decisions announced since Mr. Charpenel, a curator from Mexico, took over in September.Renovations to galleries will include upgraded heating and air-conditioning systems and a new glass entryway.A new mechanized lift for the 564-seat theaters orchestra pit will be put in along with updated lighting equipment, and hand-painted murals there will be cleaned and restored.In January and February 2018, El Museo will showcase work by Latino graduates of the master of fine arts program of the School of Visual Arts in an exhibition at the SVA Chelsea Gallery.The second off-site show, scheduled to run from April to June at the Longwood Arts Project, Hostos Community College in the Bronx, will explore the pattern and decoration movement.Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up

After 25 Years, Michael Tilson Thomas Will Leave San Francisco Symphony:::::Why did you decide it was time?It will be my 75th year when this happens, and will also be my 25th year as music director of the San Francisco Symphony.Almost my entire adult life Ive been the music director of some organization or another.I have volumes and volumes of almost-completed compositions and stories and poems and collections and all sorts of things.For years Ive been thinking that if Im going to be able to devote time to making sure that these things are in good shape before Im outta here, this would be a kind of good moment to think about doing that.Photo How is this orchestra different from the one you inherited?Im not a control-freak maestro.From night to night were not trying to make the performances congruent to one another, but different from one another.And when we come back to a piece, it will be different, as weve all changed.And I think that keeps it a very living kind of experience.I have encouraged people to color outside the lines, for lack of a better analogy.Were not trying to reproduce the notation here.Were trying to get back to the inspiration that caused the notations to exist.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.So youre not an originalist?I only do exactly whats in the score, the score has everything in it: I do not believe that at all.I think the score is only the suggestion of what the piece actually has in it.The composers assume that the musicians who are going to play that music have imaginations and identities, and are going to bring something special to it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Looking back, are there favorite performances that stand out, or composers you are especially proud of having brought back into the repertory?We have found our way with Mahler, which is recognized.Also composers that I knew when I was a kid: Stravinsky and Copland and Bernstein and Feldman.And the orchestra has had an extraordinary relationship with John Adams over the years.The Maverick festivals in their various incarnations generally opened up the idea that American music could be many, many different things from very intricate and very technical to very simple and acoustic.And that of course allowed composers like Lou Harrison to really become culture heroes.I should also mention that it really meant so much to Joshua [Robison, his husband] and to me to be able to be such an accepted, loved couple in this city in its artistic life, in its social life.This was a really wonderful kind of acceptance, which somehow symbolized so many changes that have happened for the good in our society in this time.
Hear 9 New Psalm Settings for Challenging Times:::::This text is so timeless, even urgent, he said.We seem to live in a time when the differences between us are getting not smaller, but larger.The more vulnerable people need our protection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mohammed Fairouz, Psalm 14 At its heart, Mr. Fairouz said, this psalm is about believing in something bigger than yourself, even while living in divisive times.In writing his setting, Diversions, he felt the psalms message was ultimately one of hope.The piece unfolds in three parts: a poem by Michael Bembenek Jr. that opens darkly (Fresh corpses line the boulevard); text by Isaac Newton, including his famous phrase If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants; and Psalm 14, which ends with the feeling, Mr. Fairouz said, that if you look at the world were living in today, the opportunities are tremendous.William Knight, Psalm 21 Mr. Knight, a British tenor who grew up singing sacred music, is familiar with this psalm.Still, he said, it was interesting to read it and interpret it in a new way.He found himself drawn to the psalms message about eternal life something that can be achieved through remembrance, he said and the concept of divine right.He thought of world leaders using religion to justify their actions, but pointed to the second half of the text, which depicts a wrathful God who has more power than any king.Zad Moultaka, Psalm 60 Reading this psalm for the first time was difficult for Mr. Moultaka, a composer from Lebanon now based in Paris.There is a lot of violence in it, he said, pointing to moments in the text where, for example, God tramples down enemies.Mr. Moultaka said that while revisiting this psalm for his piece, Sakata (its text in Aramaic), he interpreted it as: We are lost, and we have to find a new way, maybe, to relate and find a new space together.Nico Muhly, Psalm 63 Choral music, especially sacred music, is Mr. Muhlys home base.Its the first music that I loved and the first music that I made, he said, adding that he enjoys setting psalm text because it can bear the weight of a variety of musical interpretations.His setting, Marrow, takes its title from the line My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness.Anchoring the piece is a musical texture in three-quarter time a kind of wet aquatic ide fixe, as Mr. Muhly called it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Isidora Zebeljan, Psalm 78 Ms. Zebeljan, a Serbian composer, translated her psalm into Portuguese because there is a very special melody in this language, she said.The words fit naturally into the tone of her piece, which she described as a slow dance.Even though the psalm deals in holy fury, Ms. Zebeljan said she wanted the music to reflect the line in which God remembers that people are but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.She said she tried to capture that breeze as a brief dance of changing and passing, like the danse macabre that closes Ingmar Bergmans film The Seventh Seal.Caroline Shaw, Psalm 84 This psalm opens with one of the most memorable lines in Brahmss A German Requiem: How beloved is your dwelling place.Ms. Shaw, who wrote the beginning of her setting like an Anglican chant, made sure to preserve that line while treating the rest of the text more liberally.Ms. Shaw said the psalm made her think of the immigration crisis, which she alludes to her repeated use of the phrase the sparrow found a house.She added that she wanted to set that phrase in a way that feels urgent and not calm.David Lang, Psalm 101 Mr. Lang, who describes himself as religious, rewrote the psalm for his setting, if i sing.The piece straddles the line between sacred and secular, as does the little match girl passion, his Pulitzer-winning oratorio inspired by Hans Christian Andersen and Bachs St. Matthew Passion.The psalm is really like a bargain, Mr. Lang said.Its like, If I do this, will that work?Will you come to me?That question is present in nearly every line.By the end, it appears as a plea: Come to me.Evelin Seppar, Psalm 129 This is about overcoming difficulty, Ms. Seppar, an Estonian composer, said of her psalm setting.Something horrible has been done to you for a long time, but you havent given up.She aimed to create a dense, sea-like structure with lots of voices, so that you cant really tell what exactly is the harmony.I wanted this almost drowning feeling, that youre in the water and its pulling you.Yet Ms. Seppars message is ultimately one of perseverance.It ends in unison, she said.I dont normally finish pieces like this, but after this turmoil it felt like clarity was necessary.
Vivian Maier, Through a Clearer Lens:::::But stories like snapshots are shaped by people, and for particular purposes.Theres always an angle.A new biography, Vivian Maier: A Photographers Life and Afterlife, by Pamela Bannos, strives to rescue Maier all over again, this time from the men who promulgated the Maier myth and profited off her work; chiefly Maloof, who controlled her copyright for a time.After a legal battle the Vivian Mire, one critic called it her estate passed into a trust last year, where it will be held for possible heirs and eventually released into the public domain.Photo The book braids together three strands: a brisk, rather generic history of American photography; a biography of Maier; and a withering account of how the artist has been represented since her death.My goal was always to recognize and give Maier agency within her own story, Bannos writes.She tries to dislodge the portrayal of Maier as a mysterious, freakish figure, and to see a person where others have seen mostly pathology: her hoarding and possible paranoia.Bannos makes the case that Maier lived a much larger, more varied life than assumed.This famous recluse once took a five-month trip around the world as well as a subarctic train expedition, both times traveling with just her camera for company.As for her notorious secrecy, it served a purpose, at least in the beginning.Her parents were frantic dissemblers who struggled to conceal scandals of illegitimacy, abandonment and institutionalization.Of course Maier was wary about sharing her personal details, Bannos reasons: Who would hire a nanny with such a sordid family life?Photo Nor should we be so struck that Maier never wanted to show her work to anyone.Sharing comes easily, too easily, to us.Not so for Maier, who told a friend that if she had not kept her images secret, people would have stolen or misused them how prophetic that now seems.And her compulsive photographing prefigured our own relationship with our phones, Bannos says, our own desire to constantly document our lives.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In this way, almost point by point, Bannos refutes how Maier has been marketed.And she looks at how it has benefited Maloof et al.to present Maier as a strange, incapable wraith, how it made them look all the more heroic, and allowed them to cavalierly overlook her absolute unwillingness to show her work publicly.In a strange coincidence, Bannos reports, 21 years after Maier lived on Manhattans Upper West Side, where she cared for the dark-haired girl who often appears in her photos, Susan Sontag would move into the penthouse of the very same building and begin the essays in On Photography.Photographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe, Sontag wrote in the opening pages of that book.They are a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing.Finally, the most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads.Biographies and documentaries can tempt us the same way.They can offer the fantasy of absolute knowledge, absolute possession (perhaps this is how Maloof went astray).The achievement of Bannoss intelligent, irritable self-reflexive study is in its restraint.She unseats the ghost and restores to us the woman but in her own words and images, and without psychologizing.Its a portrait as direct as any of Maiers, and what a distinct pleasure it is to meet her gaze again.
Netflix Suspends Production of ‘House of Cards’:::::Photo Production on the final season of House of Cards was suspended Tuesday, two days after its star, Kevin Spacey, was accused of having made an unwanted sexual advance toward a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s.In a statement, Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio behind the show, said production was being halted to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.On Monday, executives from both companies spoke to the cast and crew of House of Cards in Baltimore, where production of its sixth season had recently gotten underway.The streaming service announced on Monday that the season would be the shows last.A spokeswoman for Netflix said that decision had been reached months ago, long before the allegation against Mr. Spacey.On Sunday, BuzzFeed reported an allegation by the actor Anthony Rapp that Mr. Spacey had made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in the 1980s, when he was 14 and Mr. Spacey was in his mid-20s.Mr. Spacey released a statement shortly after the article was published in which he said that he did not recall the episode but attributed it to deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.The decision to stop production raises questions about whether it will resume, and, if it does, whether Mr. Spacey will return to the series.Also on Tuesday, Variety reported that the start-up MasterClass had pulled Mr. Spaceys $90 online acting lesson videos from its site.Over the summer, production for the ABC reality show Bachelor in Paradise was shut down after an allegation of sexual misconduct on the shows set.Production resumed after an investigation turned up no wrongdoing.
Review: ‘The Light of the Moon’ and the Trauma of Rape:::::Photo When we meet Bonnie, a young architect in Brooklyn, shes on her way to a well-deserved night out.Bonnie drinks and dances, swatting away a few overeager hands.After turning down her friends offer to split a cab, she stumbles toward home.Bonnie puts on her headphones, shes in her own world.And then Bonnie is pulled into an alleyway, where she is brutally raped by a stranger.The rape is an early turning point in The Light Of The Moon and what follows are the aftereffects of this violation.Charismatically played by Stephanie Beatriz of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Bonnie walks us through the bureaucratic process of victimhood having a rape kit administered, going to the police station to identify suspects, and meeting with lawyers to discuss the likelihood of arrests.But Bonnie also experiences the emotional consequences of rape.Shes angry at her boyfriend, Matt (Michael Stahl-David) for changing his behavior as he tries to care for her, but Bonnie changes too.Shes moody, shes secretive, her work suffers, and she cant have sex without thinking of the attack.No matter how low Bonnies spirits sink, the films writer and director, Jessica M. Thompson, holds her star up to the light.With colorful sets and bright cinematography to match its lucid emotional logic, The Light of the Moon is a realistic exercise in psychological clarity.For viewers whose experiences mirror Bonnies or Matts, this therapeutically minded movie might remind them of past anxieties, but as a resource for those looking to understand the process of recovery, its hard to imagine a more comprehensive or sympathetic look at the challenge of surviving.Video
Rock, Reminiscence and Sci-Fi Will Be Part of Under the Radar Festival:::::Photo The Public Theaters 2018 Under the Radar Festival will feature pieces inspired by the work of the pioneering science fiction writer Octavia Butler and the influential rock critic Lester Bangs, as well as an autobiographical show from the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik.The theater on Tuesday announced the lineup of the festival, which, in its 14th year, is dedicated to exposing audiences to works that fall outside of the mainstream.Among the troupes that gained recognition at the festival are Elevator Repair Service and the Belarus Free Theater.While Mark Russell, the festivals director, said he doesnt program according to a theme, he mentioned the show Parable of the Sower, based on the Butler novels Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents, as emblematic of the lineup.An operatic adaptation by the mother and daughter Toshi Reagon and Bernice Johnson Reagon, the dystopian story follows a young woman named Lauren as she moves through her life in a crumbling America.Photo Thats what we decided would be the heart of the festival and then I started moving from there, he said on Monday, pointing to Andrew Schneiders After and Dickie Beaus Hamlet-inspired Re-Member Me as other notable building blocks.
Review: In ‘1945,’ Hungarian Villagers Are Forced to Revisit Wartime Sins:::::Photo The men in hats arrive by train and slowly walk the dusty road toward the village, following the horse-drawn flatbed that carries their cargo.The stationmaster bicycles ahead of them to issue a warning at the watering hole; the residents begin to whisper.Its the wedding day of the son of the town clerk, who doesnt want any trouble with elections coming up.The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fianc is still hovering.Video Ferenc Toroks lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, 1945, shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon.The visiting men in black hats a father (Ivan Angelus) and his adult son (Marcell Nagy) arent villains out for revenge, but Orthodox Jews, who have come to the village at the end of the war.They are transporting trunks said to be filled with perfume or cosmetics.The purpose of their journey is obscure.The two barely speak over the course of the film; the guilty villagers talk among themselves.We have to give it all back, the town drunk (Jozsef Szarvas) tells the clerk, Istvan (Peter Rudolf), believing that the strangers have a connection to the towns deported Jews.Dismissing the concern, Istvan nevertheless understands that fear; he played a pivotal role in betraying the local Jews, a sin for which his opiate-addicted wife (Eszter Nagy-Kalozy) holds him in contempt.As the film slowly reveals how the villages veneer of civility is built over a foundation of treachery, the darkened foregrounds suggest conspirators hiding in plain sight.Absorbing and finely wrought, 1945 is not perfect.It oversimplifies Istvans motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend.The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric, especially when it riffs on Max Bruchs widely used composition for Kol Nidre, a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context.And by design, the movie is something of a tease, more interested in setup than in payoff.The guilt that eats at these characters resists easy closure or absolution.
At 90, Still Raising the Bar for Himself — and the Other Guys:::::The painting Golden Image, I never did anything like it.It was a sunset in Maine.I usually paint the sensation of what Im seeing.Here, Im actually painting the analysis of it, all memory.I made four or five little sketches in different colors.I lost any discernability of which one was better.I said to Ada, Which one do you like?She said the yellow one.I heightened the colors.Theres very little tonal difference [between the trees and the sky].It sort of merges.I took it right up to 12 feet.It came out like dynamite.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This portrait of a disembodied face against the vivid yellow background also feels new to me.I was painting this woman [Susanne Orton, in the portrait behind Mr. Katz, top, on the left] and all of a sudden I said, Im sick and tired of white.I just arbitrarily put the lemon yellow against the flesh, like an Indian combination.Then I kept cropping it and made it a less conventional, more aggressive image.You can get the whole feeling with parts missing.Do you consider yourself a collector?Im not a collector type, actually.I throw everything out.But when I started making money, I thought I should buy some stuff for the education.Since Ive been around for so long, it adds up.Photo Thats a [Francis] Picabia.His work always fascinated me because hes such a lousy painter technically and such a great artist.I have a late piece from the 1940s when he went into kitschy figurative stuff.His image energy is fantastic, a lot of bounce.What was an early acquisition?I got this [Willem] de Kooning drawing from around 1959 from his gallery.Hes like the opposite of my temperament, but hes a really good draftsman.He supported me when I had my first big show.He came over and said, Your paintings are like photographs, but theyre painted; dont let them knock you out of your position.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.You share a Maine connection with Marsden Hartley.Was that part of your interest in collecting him?Hes able to make you see what he saw.When I moved out to where I am now in Maine, it was three miles from the shore.I didnt want to go near his subject matter; its too dominating.I got [Hands] at an auction.[The collector] Sandy Schwartz said, You cant bid.I said, O.K., when you run out of your money, use mine.So I got it.This Matisse drawing of a woman reminds me of the economy of line in your work.I like his thin paint and the effortless way he paints and gets so much out of it.He and the Impressionists see the world with golden eyes.They dont do garbage pails and people suffering.Do you have an affinity for that kind of outlook?Yeah, no sad songs.No minor key.Not for me.
Review: ‘Frank Serpico’ Updates the Story of the Man Behind a Classic Movie:::::Photo This movies intention is in its title.The documentary Frank Serpico fills out an American classic that is now almost 45 years old.Serpico, the 1973 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino, was an adaptation of a book by Peter Maas about a New York City police officer who fought corruption in the ranks and got, among other things, a bullet in the head for his trouble.The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino DAmbrosio, the movie lights up.I told myself I was an actor, he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests.He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his fathers shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience.Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying.Next time, Franks father demanded payment upfront.The cop never came into the store again, Mr. Serpico says.Although he had the shield of the law, he demeaned it by his actions.Mr. Serpico joined the force in 1959 and, witnessing casual payoffs that were accepted without a thought, encountered further disappointment: The job was not on the level.Video The star of the movie is a compelling figure, and Mr. DAmbrosio presents quite a few people from Mr. Serpicos past who have a similar draw.But the directors filmmaking instincts are not always salutary.He introduces each new interviewee with a shot of the subject standing, looking into the camera for several seconds.This affectation grows wearying.The actor John Turturro is not an uninteresting subject, but watching him talk about his reaction to the Lumet-Pacino movie, you get the feeling he is only there because Mr. DAmbrosio could not secure an on-camera interview with Mr. Pacino.The movie does feature a sit-down between Mr. Serpico and Arthur Cesare, his partner in the narcotics division, who was present the night Mr. Serpico was shot.He tells Mr. Cesare that he considers it peculiar that no 10-13, or officer in need of assistance, call went out on his behalf.But theres no combustion in the confrontation, and the exchange goes limp.Could Mr. Cesare have called it in, and if so, why didnt he?Like much else in the movie, its frustrating.
A Reader’s Guide to Impeachment:::::Photo This week, Harvard University Press released Cass R. Sunsteins latest book, Impeachment: A Citizens Guide.The timing is fortuitous.Although the charges filed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, did not implicate the president, the subject of impeachment is on peoples minds.We asked Mr. Sunstein, a professor at Harvard Law School, to recommend books that might help readers understand the history and process of charging a public official with misconduct.Despite its importance, impeachment is a challenging and arcane subject the Finnegans Wake of constitutional law.Fortunately, there are some terrific books on the topic, helping to guide the perplexed.The most revelatory, I think, is Impeachment in America, 1635-1805, by Peter Charles Hoffer and N.E.H.Hull.The Declaration of Independence was ratified in 1776 and the United States Constitution in 1788. Who knew that in the colonies, impeachment had a history 140 years before the American Revolution started?Hoffer and Hull demonstrate that our nation developed a homegrown, all-American framework for impeaching high-level officials.By the middle of the 18th century, we converged on a republican understanding of impeachment, by which the colonists had the temerity, and the guts, to impeach officials who were following orders from the king.The War for Independence, and American exceptionalism, started right there.Photo A magisterial, defining volume, answering dozens of tough questions, is Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems, by Raoul Berger.Bergers emphasis is on the origins of impeachment in England, and the continuity between British and American theories and practices.Readers learn that in England, officials could be impeached for all sorts of misconduct, even if they had not committed crimes.The United States Constitution did not quite land in the same place as English practice, but what happened there is indispensable background.Charles Black was a professor of constitutional law who could blend, more than anyone before or since, astonishing technical mastery with an ability to communicate.His slim volume, Impeachment: A Handbook, is a treasure trove.It cuts through confusion like a knife.It is focused less on history than on hypothetical cases, some of which have become, in the decades since Black wrote, all too real.Photo For students of impeachment, its also crucial to read Gordon Woods The Radicalism of the American Revolution, even though the author says nothing about that topic.Wood demonstrates that in the decades that preceded the American Revolution, republicanism, with its commitment to self-government and the equal dignity of human beings, was on the march in the colonies.That commitment changed the world.If you want to understand impeachment, and why it is so fundamental to the American experiment, thats a good place to start.
Borghese Gallery Gathers a Full House of Bernini Masterpieces:::::The gallerys halls offer a lushly decorated backdrop for the pieces in a way that we hoped that Bernini who was also a showman, playwright and creator of extravagant spectacles might have envisaged, had he been alive, Ms. Coliva added in an interview.The gallery has staged a Bernini exhibition with loans before, when it reopened in 1998 after a lengthy renovation.The latest exhibition builds on the Borghese collection, fleshing out the artists career from his apprenticeship with his father, the sculptor Pietro Bernini (a collaboration that Gian Lorenzo would later try to expunge, Mr. Bacchi said), with a series of sculptures they crafted in tandem, to his ambition to become an all-around artist, adding architecture and painting to his already considerable skills.For the first time, over a dozen paintings portraits and half-figures that are universally accepted as by Bernini are being shown under one roof.They are juxtaposed with his better-known marble and bronze busts, mostly of powerful clerics.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The marble portraits cover a 60-year period during which Bernini depicted a marmoreal Whos Who of Rome.The Louvre lent its bust of Cardinal Richelieu, whom Bernini never met.He crafted the statue from a painting, something Mr. Bacchi said was both an innovation and a challenge: He wrote that it was hard enough to give the warmth and life of people to marble, but doing it without ever meeting the person is nigh-on impossible.Berninis fame in his lifetime and beyond Bernini is synonymous with the Baroque and the Baroque with Bernini, Mr. Bacchi said has made him a much-studied figure.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Borghese exhibition provides new nuggets for scholarship, and offers an opportunity to closely compare works that are normally thousands of miles apart, like two versions of the Crucified Christ lent by institutions in Madrid and Toronto.Restoration work around the exhibition also led to discoveries.A Bernini statue of St. Bibiana was removed from its church so that it could be restored directly at the museum.The sculpture had previously been moved during the bombing of Rome in World War II, and the restoration which cost 62,000 euros, or about $72,000 suggested that it had been mounted incorrectly on its return.Ms. Coliva said that once the exhibition is over, she hopes to find funds to build a new altar for the church, so that the statue can be admired from the viewpoint that the restoration work suggests Bernini had intended.Bernini worked throughout Rome, but clearly curators couldnt move monumental works like the sculptures in St. Peters Basilica and the Four Rivers Fountain in Piazza Navona.They came up with the next best thing: a series of models and sketches of such pieces, showing Berninis way of working.But those are just appetizers.Just look up Bernini in the index of any guidebook to Rome: His impact and legacy are citywide.
A Seed Artist Germinates History:::::About 140 years ago, a botanist named Addison Brown noticed an unfamiliar red-tendriled plant growing around Red Hook, Brooklyn.Trade had lately picked up, he told readers of the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club in 1879, and as ships arrived, they dumped thousands of tons of ballast earth and stones used to stabilize ships that carried seeds from far-off lands: The red plant, among several new species growing along Gowanus Creek, was Amaranthus crispus, native to South America.Amaranth, said Marisa Prefer, a gardener leading a group through the same neighborhood last week, picking up a stalk of the crumbly plant, which was spilling out from a crack in the sidewalk like a Medusa head.These wild urban plants can survive in the craziest circumstances.This year, a few dozen New Yorkers have been learning about and growing plant species that were inadvertently brought to the city in ship ballast as part of Seeds of Change, an ongoing exploration of the phenomenon by the artist Maria Thereza Alves.Ms. Alves, whose exhibition on local ballast plants opens on Friday at the galleries of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center at The New School, is the most recent winner of the Vera List Center Prize for Art and Politics.She has spent nearly two decades uncovering long-buried colonial histories using ballast seeds, which can lie dormant in the soil for hundreds of years, only to sprout in the right conditions.Photo Photo Photo Photo Born in Brazil, Ms. Alves has explored several European and British port cities, creating a floating garden using seeds native to Africa and North America found in the soil of Bristol, England; documenting exotic plants from Asia and elsewhere that turned up in peoples yards in Reposaari, Finland.I liked the idea that these plants were witnesses to things we would never understand, to paths of trade that we no longer have information about, said Ms. Alves, in a phone interview.They are living there in our midst and saying hi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is Ms. Alvess first look at ballast seeds brought to the Americas.The exhibition, Maria Thereza Alves, Seeds of Change: New York A Botany of Colonization, will include examples of local ballast flora, watercolor maps, and drawings and texts by the artist exploring two centuries of maritime trade, including the slave trade.

Bob Dylan’s Nobel Lecture Signed, Sealed and Delivered:::::Photo Recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature inevitably see renewed interest in their work, and one publisher is banking on especially high regard for the first literal rock star to win it.Simon & Schuster today released a special edition of Mr. Dylans Nobel lecture, which runs to 23 pages.One hundred individually signed and numbered hardcover copies in slipcases are available for $2,500 each.(Next-day shipping is included.)Photo The lecture is also available in a more routine edition for $16.99.After winning the prize in October 2016, Mr. Dylan left many wondering if he would ever deliver the lecture that historically accompanies the honor.The singer did not attend the prize ceremony last December, and the Nobel Foundation released his acceptance speech on June 5.The speech has to be delivered within six months of the official ceremony for the honoree to receive the cash prize of about $900,000.In the speech, Mr. Dylan talked about the way he was influenced by musicians like Buddy Holly and Leadbelly, and about books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school, including Moby-Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and the Odyssey.(A week after Mr. Dylan issued the speech, Andrea Pitzer on Slate suggested that some of the singers analysis of Moby-Dick was appropriated from the study-guide website SparkNotes.)A year after Mr. Dylans groundbreaking Nobel victory, Simon & Schuster has also published 100 Songs, which collects the lyrics to a selection of Mr. Dylans work, and an updated edition of Bob Dylan: The Essential Interviews, edited by Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor for Rolling Stone.
Roman Polanski Retrospective in Paris Draws Protests:::::Advertisement Roman Polanski Retrospective in Paris Draws Protests Image Protesters shouted slogans and hammered on the windows of the Cinmathque Franaise in Paris on Monday as the director Roman Polanski arrived for an event honoring his work.Credit Yoan Valat/European Pressphoto Agency French feminist groups staged demonstrations Monday night at the opening of a retrospective in Paris for the film director Roman Polanski.Photographs appeared on social media of protesters holding placards outside the Cinmathque Franaise film institute, where Mr. Polanski, 84, was attending the event honoring his work.One video showed demonstrators chanting Polanski, rapist and hammering on the Cinmathques window.The Associated Press reported that the demonstrators, some of whom were topless, included members of the feminist collective Femen.Mr. Polanski, who holds dual Polish and French citizenship, is wanted in the United States for sexual abuse of minors.In 1977, he pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer when she was 13 , but fled before sentencing to France, which does not extradite its citizens.Fresh allegations emerged this month, when the former actress Renate Langer accused him of raping her when she was 15 .Ms. Langer is the fourth woman to publicly accuse Mr. Polanski of assaulting her when she was a teenager.Before the demonstration on Monday, several womens rights groups, including Osez le Fminisme , had called for the retrospective to be canceled.Image Mr. Polanski arriving at the film institute on Monday.Credit Yoan Valat/European Pressphoto Agency An online petition signed by more than 28,000 people criticized the timing of the Polanski tribute, citing the widening allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and ensuing social media campaigns that highlighted the extent of sexual abuse.I started the petition because I cant stand anymore the impunity of famous people, the feminist campaigner Laure Salmona said by telephone.In France, we have a problem with men who perpetrate sexual violence, but famous people can be convicted or accused by women, and they get away with it.Costa-Gavras, a film director and head of the Cinmathque, said in a statement that it was not the institutes place to act as an arbiter of morality and dismissed objections to the programming as censorship.We dont award prizes or certificates for good behavior, he said.Our ambition is different: to show the complete work of filmmakers and to place them in the permanent history of the Cinmathque.Mr. Polanski, whose films include Chinatown and Rosemarys Baby, won the Academy Award for best director for The Pianist in 2003.In January, Mr. Polanski was invited to host the Csar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, but declined after the announcement sparked outcry .Ms. Salmona said that the petition and the protest were about the message that the retrospective sent, adding that it was possible to separate Mr. Polanskis alleged crimes from his body of work without putting a spotlight on him.We cant continue to praise rapists, she said, even if they are great film directors or if they are talented.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C 3 of the New York edition with the headline: Feminists Protest Polanski Retrospective Sign up for the Watching Newsletter Get recommendations on the best TV shows and films to stream and watch, delivered to your inbox.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up

What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown’ and ‘Major Crimes’:::::Photo The final season of Major Crimes begins on TNT.And the classic Peanuts Halloween special streams on ABC.com.Whats Streaming ITS THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN on ABC.com.This quintessential Peanuts special captures the melancholy of fall.A dark palette and jazzy score set a somber mood for a story in which childrens dreams go mostly unfulfilled: Linus sits in a pumpkin patch all night waiting for the Great Pumpkin to appear.(It never does.)Charlie Brown rushes to kick a football, trusting that Lucy wont pull it away at the last second.(She does.)The show doesnt discourage dreaming, though.In a letter to his mythical pumpkin hero, Linus writes: If you really are a fake, dont tell me.I dont want to know.JUDAH FRIEDLANDER: AMERICA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE UNITED STATES (2017) on Netflix.This shaggy comedian is perhaps best known for his role on NBCs 30 Rock, where he played a trucker-hat-wearing television writer.His character may have been in the writing room, but in this stand-up special, shot in black and white at an intimate New York City club, Mr. Friedlander is in the spotlight, riffing on life in the United States.He still wears a trucker hat.Photo WIND RIVER (2017) on iTunes and Amazon.A murder mystery set on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming showcases the awesome scope of that location through wide, sweeping shots.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen star as a federal wildlife officer and an F.B.I.operative in the film, which was written and directed by the Hell or High Water writer Taylor Sheridan.In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny designated the film a Critics Pick, writing that the story builds to a shocking climax, and that a standoff scene near the movies finale would not be shamed if put next to one of Michael Manns better set pieces.Whats on TV JAWS (1975) 8 p.m. on Showtime 2.There has been no shortage of horror this year.(The Times recently reported that 2017 is already the highest-grossing year in horror-movie history.)But those looking for a classic blockbuster fright fix could do worse than revisit Steven Spielbergs shark-hunt megahit, which at one point held the title of highest-grossing film of all time.If you think about Jaws for more than 45 seconds you will recognize it as nonsense, Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The Times.But its the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun if you like to have the wits scared out of you at irregular intervals.Photo MAJOR CRIMES 9 p.m. on TNT.Last season, this procedural which began as a spinoff of The Closer added multi-episode story arcs.The sixth and final season of the show will continue in that vein, delving into more cases presented to a unit of the Los Angeles Police Department led by Cmdr.Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell).
Review: ‘Illyria’ Eavesdrops on a Young Joe Papp and Friends:::::Those uniquely topical dramas explored of-the-moment events through the eyes of two different families.They were vivid slice-of-life works in which meals were prepared and consumed, as the people onstage looked at a changing nation from their own beleaguered corner of it.Mr. Nelson takes a similarly sideways approach in Illyria, with more mixed results.If you dont know much about the real Joseph Papp (1921-1991), you may wonder what the hecks going on and why you should be interested.If you do know a lot about Papp and his associates, you may be a bit exasperated by the liberties Mr. Nelson has taken in bringing them to life.But Illyria also affords distinctive if fleeting pleasures that no one these days does better than Mr. Nelson.I mean the sense of experiencing life, in all its trivia and eventfulness, happening in a very specific moment, among people who know one another well.And once again, Mr. Nelson has assembled a fine cast that wears its alter egos with the ease of old cardigans.Photo Aside from Joe, only one of the characters is likely to be familiar to much of the audience.Thats the formidable actress Colleen Dewhurst (played by Rosie Benton), who is just beginning to forge a career in the late 1950s.In Illyria, she appears as the hostess of the last-minute birthday bash in the plays second scene, and she by no means dominates the proceedings.Though the scandalous professional behavior of her future husband, George C. Scott, is much discussed, Colleen is just one of many theatrical aspirants here, a band of almost equals still struggling to make a living.Shes part of Joes nascent New York Shakespeare Festival, which puts on plays from the canon for free in the citys parks.Others on the team include Joes actress wife, Peggy (Kristen Connolly), who has just had a baby; the press agent Merle Debuskey (Fran Kranz); the stage manager John Robertson (Max Woertendyke); and the composer David Amram (Blake DeLong).The resident director is Stuart Vaughan (John Sanders), whose wife, Gladys (Emma Duncan), is Joes assistant.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Local theater buffs may recognize the names of Mr. Debuskey and Mr. Vaughan, as well as that of another character, Bernie Gersten (Will Brill), a longtime friend of Papps who would become a producer at his Shakespeare Festival and later Lincoln Center.The dramatis personae is rounded out by Mary Bennett (Naian Gonzlez Norvind), a young actress new to this insular world.Mostly these people just talk and, this being a play by Mr. Nelson, eat (sandwiches, generally).The subjects of conversation melt and swirl and resurface in thick eddies.They include who to cast as Olivia in Twelfth Night, Peggys reluctant return to the stage and the consequences of Joes and Bernies being summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee for suspected Communist affiliations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The political taint of such presumed associations has put Joes fledging troupe in jeopardy, and we hear accounts of his run-ins with the citys parks department, then overseen by the mighty Robert Moses.Will the establishment put the kibosh on these maverick idealists?Will Twelfth Night in Central Park, the occasion for the plays third and final scene, be this troupes last production?These dramatic questions are not posed with histrionic flourish in Illyria.(The title comes from the fantastical setting for Twelfth Night.)Often they loom less large than romantic crosscurrents and nagging rivalries, particularly between Joe and the more successful Stuart, whom Mr. Sanders portrays with a canny subliminal smugness.Theatergoers expecting the explosions, resolutions and emotional payoffs of a conventionally well-made play are likely to leave Illyria frustrated.Though it verges on starry-eyed sentimentality in its final scene, most of this production designed with spot-on period detail by Susan Hilferty and Jason Ardizzone-West refrains from thematic signposting.Instead, it inhabits a landscape where the petty and the momentous are practically indistinguishable, and even the strongest feelings are muddied with ambivalence.The real Joe Papp, showman that he was, might have deemed Illyria too muted and inconclusive to be satisfying.Theatergoers with patience, though, will be rewarded by moments throughout when they will feel transformed into proverbial flies on the walls of a distant time and place.Real life is happening, as boring and confusing and riveting as it usually appears without the magnifying lens of hindsight.
What Experts Know About Men Who Rape:::::The most pronounced similarities have little to do with the traditional demographic categories, like race, class and marital status.Rather, other kinds of patterns have emerged: these men begin early, studies find.They may associate with others who also commit sexual violence.They usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to nonconsensual sex.Clarifying these and other patterns, many researchers say, is the most realistic path toward curtailing behaviors that cause so much pain.If you dont really understand perpetrators, youre never going to understand sexual violence, said Sherry Hamby, editor of the journal Psychology of Violence.That may seem obvious, but she said she receives 10 papers on victims for every one on perpetrators.This may be partly connected to a tendency to consider sexual assault a womens issue even though men usually commit the crime.But finding the right subjects also has complicated the research.Early studies relied heavily on convicted rapists.This skewed the data, said Neil Malamuth, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been studying sexual aggression for decades.Men in prison are often generalists, he said: They would steal your television, your watch, your car.And sometimes they steal sex.But men who commit sexual assault, and are not imprisoned because they got away with it, are often specialists.There is a strong chance that this is their primary criminal transgression.Advertisement Continue reading the main story More recent studies tend to rely on anonymous surveys of college students and other communities, which come with legal language assuring subjects their answers cannot be used against them.The studies avoid using terms such as rape and sexual assault.Instead, they ask subjects highly specific questions about their actions and tactics.The focus of most sexual aggression research is acknowledged nonconsensual sexual behavior.In questionnaires and in follow-up interviews, subjects are surprisingly open about ignoring consent.Men who rape tend to start young, in high school or the first couple of years of college, likely crossing a line with someone they know, the research suggests.Some of these men commit one or two sexual assaults and then stop.Others no one can yet say what portion maintain this behavior or even pick up the pace.Antonia Abbey, a social psychologist at Wayne State University, has found that young men who expressed remorse were less likely to offend the following year, while those who blamed their victim were more likely to do it again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One repeat offender put it this way: I felt I was repaying her for sexually arousing me.There is a heated debate among experts about whether there is a point at which sexual assault becomes an entrenched behavior and what percentage of assaults are committed by serial predators.Most researchers agree that the line between the occasional and frequent offender is not so clear.The recent work of Kevin Swartout, a professor of psychology and public health at Georgia State University, suggests that low-frequency offenders are more common on college campuses than previously thought.Its a matter of degree, more like dosage, said Mary P. Koss, a professor of public health at the University of Arizona, who is credited with coining the term date rape.Dosage of what?Certain factors researchers call them risk factors while acknowledging that these men are nonetheless responsible for their actions have an outsize presence among those who commit sexual assaults.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Heavy drinking, perceived pressure to have sex, a belief in rape myths such as the idea that no means yes are all risk factors among men who have committed sexual assault.A peer group that uses hostile language to describe women is another one.Yet there also seem to be personal attributes that have a mediating effect on these factors.Men who are highly aroused by rape porn another risk factor are less likely to attempt sexual assault if they score highly on measures of empathy, Dr. Malamuth has found.Narcissism seems to work in the other direction, magnifying odds that men will commit sexual assault and rape.What about the idea that rape is about power over women?Some experts feel that research into hostile attitudes toward women supports this idea.In general, however, researchers say motives are varied and difficult to quantify.Dr. Malamuth has noticed that repeat offenders often tell similar stories of rejection in high school and of looking on as jocks and the football players got all the attractive women.As these once-unpopular, often narcissistic men become more successful, he suspects that getting back at these women, having power over them, seems to have become a source of arousal.Most subjects in these studies freely acknowledge nonconsensual sex but that does not mean they consider it real rape.Researchers encounter this contradiction again and again.Asked if they had penetrated against their consent, said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes.Asked if he did something like rape, the answer is almost always no.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Studies of incarcerated rapists even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones find a similar disconnect.Its not that they deny sexual assault happens; its just that the crime is committed by the monster over there.And this is not a sign that the respondents are psychopaths, said Dr. Hamby, the journal editor.Its a sign that they are human.No one thinks they are a bad guy, she said.Indeed, experts note one last trait shared by men who have raped: they do not believe they are the problem.
Dance and Cultural Conventions, Ripe for Upending:::::The movement is occasionally representational at one point the dancers mime playing sports but more often it escapes such easy readings.In one striking passage, the four recline on the ground and merge into one amorphous being, crawling over one another, caught up in sticky entanglements.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The works many elements busily war for attention at times, though fracturing our focus may be a deliberate move.Jason Finkelmans eclectic soundscape and Susan Beckers costumes, which morph in the final scene from pants into gauzy skirts, heighten the sense of an environment in continuous flux.Words, spoken and projected, evoke the difficulty of having to explain oneself or justify ones actions.Phrases like see, wait and its complicated and dont misunderstand me recur in various guises.If I use a little force, it doesnt mean Im angry, Duane Cyrus says, discussing his fluency in many different languages, all of them English.The frequently loping and strutting Niall Noel Jones, who often peels off from the others and lingers onstage after their final exit, is the only performer who doesnt speak, as if freed from the weight of explanation, or perhaps troubled by a different burden.Photo Nearby at the BAM Harvey Theater on Thursday, ODC/Dance, the 46-year-old modern dance company from San Francisco, was upending gender conventions in a different way through the full-throttle partnering for which the group is known.The sleekly produced boulders and bones, choreographed by the artistic directors Brenda Way and KT Nelson in 2014, was inspired by the construction of Culvert Cairn, a stone installation by the British land artist Andy Goldsworthy in the woods of Marin County, Calif.The hourlong work, for 10 superbly strong and resilient dancers, opens with a wordless version of RJ Munas time-lapse video documenting the creation of the elegant structure, a sort of stone tunnel housing a large, egg-shaped stone mass, over which rainwater can flow.At its most compelling, boulders and bones captures the textures and energies of crumbling rock or cascading water, and not through high-definition projections (of which there are plenty) or the white dust that the dancers fling onto the stage, but through the dancing itself.Propelled by a lush, layered cello score composed and played live by Zo Keating, who sits prominently atop a portable platform, the dancers slide deftly through swooping phrases on the floor or fly ardently into one anothers arms.More than once, Natasha Adorlee Johnson plows into a row of her peers, corralling them with her torso.In work so dependent on partnering and ballet technique, its heartening that the women show just as much brute strength and daring as the men.The alert Josie G. Sadan, a kind of exalted figure, dances with a more ethereal remove, until an exacting solo in silence at the end, where she gathers energy like a brewing storm.Yet boulders, with its outpouring of highly technical movement, sometimes loses its grasp on a larger sense of purpose, detached from the essence of the landscape it seems intent on embodying.Nature is more spontaneous and more unruly.
Review: From Maguy Marin’s Toolbox, Sex and Violence and Farandole:::::Photo How many dancers does it take to form a human chain (by way of a folk dance) that breaks apart for sexual assault and links back up again?In this case, an even six.Thats right: Maguy Marin was back in town.And her BiT, though created in 2014, seemed particularly timely.This French choreographer hasnt presented her work in New York in nearly a decade, but in BiT, she made up for lost time, filling her evening-length dance with items from her ever-disturbing tool kit.On the sex-and-violence side, there was assault, an orgy and, make no mistake, a gang rape.By monks.Ms. Marin lives for provocation in her work, and though the means to her end can slip into hokeyness, her insistence on digging into human behavior the good, the bad, the ugly has always seemed heartfelt.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In preparation for BiT, the Joyce Theaters website and press materials were filled with warnings about nudity and explicit sexual content.Well-meaning ushers laid on more cautionary phrases so that by the time you sat down, the show lost some of the bite it might have had.How could anything live up to such hype?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.BiT started out gently enough.Ms. Marin was inspired by the farandole, the lulling French folk dance in which the performers hold hands and skim the floor with light, skipping steps.But there were anomalies here: For one, the music was buzzing and electronic.And for another, the dancers didnt always glide along on the flat surface of the floor; they also moved up and down six ramps with controlled, elegant footwork.

Review: Three Dance Legends Walk Into a Church …:::::Photo Ugh, memory lane, Yvonne Rainer groaned.It was Saturday night at Danspace Project in St. Marks Church, and Ms. Rainer was with her old friends Simone Forti and Steve Paxton.In the cultural sphere of Danspace Project, the slice of the dance world sometimes known as downtown or postmodern, there are no more esteemed living legends than these three.And though they had performed together in various combinations over the nearly 60 years since they met, their first outing as a threesome came only last year in Los Angeles.Saturday was the third and final evening of the New York iteration.In other words, Tea for Three, as they called the event, was a historic occasion, sold out well in advance, the kind of show in which a standing ovation at the end is guaranteed.The audience on Saturday included several luminaries of the performers vintage (David Gordon, Valda Setterfield, Carolee Schneemann), as well as many younger dancers there to learn from the masters.This was the most receptive of crowds, the sort that would, as Ms. Rainer quipped, laugh at anything.That was her dry, anxious way of acknowledging that the mostly improvised performance might not have been going as well as the audiences eager chuckles suggested.Im sorry to say it wasnt the best night for her or for Mr. Paxton, the more talkative and in-charge two thirds of the trio.Perhaps they were worn out.Ms. Rainer and Ms. Forti are in their early 80s, Mr. Paxton only a few years younger.That day, the church had hosted a memorial for their beloved colleague, Trisha Brown, who died in March.The evening began with a moment of silence.Photo The rest of the show, though, was largely talking.There were props: wooden frames of various sizes, masks of presidents faces, plastic bins to sit in or wear on the head.And there were physical tasks: a two-person arm drop exercise that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Rainer invented after a long-ago chicken dinner; Ms. Rainer trying to dance (again!)some of her groundbreaking, overexposed 1966 work Trio A while Ms. Forti glommed onto her body.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But most of the show was strained attempts at wisecracks, mixed in with misfiring allusions to passing time and regrets.The performers, famous for their quick-witted spontaneity and mold-breaking audacity, occasionally read quotations from pieces of paper taped to the churchs pillars potential buoys in an improvisational ocean with few breezes of inspiration.But these were more stale bread, and the old stories the trips down memory lane taken reluctantly, dutifully, as if required by the occasion seemed chewed-over and flavorless.Thank goodness for Ms. Forti.The frailest-looking of the three, her hands shaking from Parkinsons disease, she needed help from the others to rise from the floor, and once when she stumbled, people gasped in alarm.Much of the time, she hid under a jacket, blowing sounds through a long piece of metal pipe; or seemed to wander off, so that Ms. Rainer felt the need to put her back on track.

Travis Scott Sued by Fan Who Says Concert Injury Paralyzed Him:::::Photo Concerts by the rapper Travis Scott are known to be like high-octane punk shows with a bigger budget as fans form mosh pits, crowd surf and stage-dive with abandon.The artist himself, dubbed one of contemporary hip-hops most energetic and disruptive live performers, often encourages the typically good-natured bedlam and has been known to sacrifice his own body to participate.But the same factors that have made Mr. Scott one of the most sought-after live acts in rap music also led to the serious injury of one of his young fans, according to a lawsuit filed on Friday at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.Kyle Green, 23, said he was paralyzed and has to use a wheelchair after he was pushed from a third-story balcony and then dragged on stage while the rapper performed at the Manhattan venue Terminal 5 in April.Mr. Green is now suing Mr. Scott and his manager, David Stromberg; the concert promoter the Bowery Presents, which runs Terminal 5 and put on the show; and the security company Strike Force Protective Services for what his lawyer called negligence, carelessness and recklessness.Mr. Green, a student, is seeking unspecified damages.A representative for the Bowery Presents said the company would not comment on pending litigation.Representatives for Mr. Scott did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but had said after the concert that there would be an internal investigation into the incident.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We are deeply concerned about the guest who was injured and intend to offer him our support, their statement said at the time.
In the Time of Trump, a Horror-Movie Maker Rules Hollywood:::::Mr. Blum, a 48-year-old Hollywood producer, takes this stand even though he thinks that goose bumps about Donald J. Trump have buoyed Blumhouse, his hit factory that has made Get Out, Sinister, Insidious, The Purge, Paranormal Activity, Split, The Gift and The Visit.Blumhouse also produced the Oscar-winning Whiplash and won Emmys for The Normal Heart and The Jinx, the eerie six-part documentary about Robert Durst that ended with him caught on a hot microphone whispering to himself in a bathroom about his dead wife and dead best friend: What the hell did I do?Killed them all of course.Mr. Blum is now teaming with John Carpenter for the final Halloween with Ms. Curtis returning as Laurie Strode.In the time Mr. Blum and I were having dinner, his latest, Happy Death Day, a ghoulish twist on Groundhog Day, leapt to No.1 at the weekend box office.I think when people are scared, they like to see movies where the scares are not real, Mr. Blum says.The current administrations been terrific for the scary-movie business.Its been our best year ever.I think Get Out did four times the business it would have done if Hillary had been president.Mr. Blum frets about the White House swallowing his former communications chief, Josh Raffel, who left him to become Jared Kushners lieutenant, much like the hero of Get Out is swallowed by the sunken place.He jokes that he wants to rescue Mr. Raffel from the cult because Im scared Jared is drinking his blood.Christopher Landon, the director of Happy Death Day, agrees that President Trump has stirred up all these dark places and dark corners and old shadows of our culture, and horror is so well suited to address these things.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Hollywood is in atrophy, endlessly and tediously replicating comic-book franchises, Mr. Blum is able to be original and risky by staying fast and cheap.And once he got successful, he did not jump to blockbusters.He has created a business model that works, making films for $5 million or less with clear commerciality and marketability, says Donna Langley, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, who signed Mr. Blum to a 10-year, first-look film deal.Hes excitable and exciting to be around.Ethan Hawke, an old Blum friend who starred in Sinister, says that when you think of a horror impresario you think of a dour, terrifying person, but the big surprise about being Jasons friend is how much joy he has.In a fear-based business, Mr. Blum sprinkles pixie dust, making filmmakers dreams come true on a budget.Mr. Landon calls Mr. Blum a cross between Willy Wonka and Robert Evans.He has this sort of mad-professor vibe but an old-school charm as well, an energy fluttering about him that is hard to contain.Photo RELATED: Jason Blums favorite film genre Dressed in khaki pants and a blue vest from Zara and wearing a 1987 Rolex, Mr. Blum pulls out his phone to

her, noting dryly: Its fun to play government.When she tweeted on empowering and investing in women, Mr. Blum retweeted with this acidic comment: But dont give them birth control.You are a gross opportunist.I ask him about the PC crackdown on costumes.Universities now issue guidelines and hold social justice workshops about how to avoid cultural appropriation.A list of instructions circulating on Twitter read: How to Not Be a Jerk This Halloween: No problematic historical figures; Dont glorify violence against women; Cultures are not costumes (absolutely no blackface, brownface, yellowface; absolutely no religious garb (i.e.hijabs, bindis, etc.); absolutely no native headdresses; absolutely no gypsy-related costumes); Gender identity is not a costume (dont dress trans if youre not trans); Sexual identity is not a costume (dont dress as a gay figure if youre not gay.)Mr. Blum observes simply: Halloween is woke, and theres nothing we can do about it.Over a mango lassi at the Bombay Club, he explains how he drove his customized van that doubles as an office down the road to inheriting the mantle of Val Lewton and Roger Corman as a master of shadows.My favorite thing about horror is that it attracts this great group of nuts, of which I include myself in, Mr. Blum says.I was always kind of an oddball.I collected my fingernails, for instance.Halloween was definitely

he says.I ask about his five-year stint from 1995 to 2000 working for Harvey Weinstein in Mr. Weinsteins film acquisition unit.Looking pained, Mr. Blum says he is reprogramming Mr. Weinstein to a different place in his brain and that he knew his boss was dark, just not that dark.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel

he shouldnt have done.Hes a bully.She left.She threatened to sue him and rather than go through litigation, he gave her 100,000 bucks.And the settlements were described as People are taking advantage of me because Im rich.Thats what we all thought, like, Yeah, hes gross, Harveys being a scumbag again not, He was a rapist.I was in his hotel room when he was in his robe.He was in his robe all the time when we were traveling at film festivals.He worked 24 hours a day and he was always in his robe.When Mr. Blum lost the distribution rights to Run Lola Run in a Toronto negotiation, after Mr. Weinstein changed the terms at the last minute, Mr. Weinstein ordered Mr. Blum to run over to the hotel of the rights holders and stay there until they changed their minds.Im 28 years old, Mr. Blum recalls.Im bawling.Its 3:30 a.m. Im knocking on the guys door, begging him to open the door.And crying.Im crying, Im crying.He wont open the door.Mr. Weinstein rushed up to Toronto and they went into one of the multiple hotel suites his boss always kept there were always endless hotel rooms, Mr. Blum says and Mr. Weinstein threw his lit cigarette.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And the lit cigarette hit me, Mr. Blum continues.It bounced off me and bounced on the floor and Harvey knew he shouldnt have done it and he said, I was going for the garbage can.And I was so upset at the other side, and attracted to being abused, that I was fully on Harveys side.I was like, Harvey, dont worry about it.Im so mad, too.I cant believe what they did to us.Oh my God, it was total Stockholm syndrome.He bullied me, he threw a lit cigarette at me.And I tried to hide that it happened, trying to protect him.I mean, it was very, very abusive.When he called, you would go into a sweat.Every time he called, I was terrified.And wherever I was, from the time I was under that contract, I was never free.I went into cognitive therapy after I was there 12 months, because I had depression.The therapist gave him a self-help book called The Assertive Option, which he began using in interactions with the Weinstein brothers, who were so brutal that everyone else banded together and protected each other against these guys.They werent Cain and Abel, because they were both awful.But they also hated each other.He said he is struggling to figure out why I chose to stay in a place for years where I was abused.He didnt force me to stay there.I could have quit at any time.Why didnt I quit?He agreed with a former colleague at the company who told him recently: I wish I could go to the hospital and get the part where Harvey existed in my brain taken out of my brain.He did learn a lot from Mr. Weinstein, he says, including the frenetic pace and the never-give-up attitude.But in other ways, he has modeled his company to be the reverse of that one.He never micromanages.Harvey would spend days arguing over a part that was three days long, Mr. Blum says.I dont know who plays those parts.Its such a waste of time.We give a ton of creative input, but I dont spend 700 years arguing over something like Nicole Kidmans nose in The Hours.Harvey would say Im the best editor in Hollywood.He didnt look at his job as supporting the artists.He looked at himself as an artist.And I look at myself as a curator, blowing a path through to let the artist do their thing.I would be terrible at directing a movie.I dont have that kind of brain.Because of his parents, Mr. Blum understands how to talk to artists, but he also gets the needs of the business side.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He has always made it a practice not to meet with actresses alone.I just dont want to be in my office alone with an actress.It might be because of Harvey, because Im terrified the actress will walk out of the door and say I did something wrong.So theres no way they can do that if theres someone else in the room.Hes the Mike Pence of Hollywood, I suggest.Its the power dynamic, he says.You get a 23-year-old actress sitting in your office, I think they feel like, do they flirt in the meeting, do they not flirt?Its just uncomfortable.It just lingers in the air.And I dont want it lingering in the air.And if my head of casting, who is a woman, is sitting there, its fine.And I can ask for an actresss email and its not weird.Then I send them a script directly, I dont go through their agent, and its fine.Before the Weinstein revelations, Mr. Blum had bought Gabriel Shermans book on Roger Ailes to turn into a eight-part series for Showtime, the saga of the guy who enabled the guy, the Fox News chief who rolled out the red carpet to the Trump White House.Mr. Blum says the movie he would most like to do now is a remake of the 1957 Andy Griffith classic, A Face in the Crowd, about a wealthy, megalomaniacal television personality who swans about as the voice of the people until hes exposed as a phony.Sounds vaguely familiar.Jason Blum faces more of his demons in

At 100, Thelonious Monk Gets a Hero’s Celebration:::::The context was the same for Joshua Redman on Wednesday as it was for Ravi Coltrane on Thursday: They were backed by a standard jazz trio led by the pianist Ethan Iverson as they played tight renditions of classic Monk repertoire.But while Mr. Redman soloed with a smokestack effusiveness, getting underneath the melodies and setting them alight, Mr. Coltranes horn was liquid.It seemed to move freely on its own, as if any expansion or turn was coming directly from the notes themselves.The festival, Monk@100, was produced by Duke University, and studiously programmed by Mr. Iverson and Aaron Greenwald, the director of Duke Performances.It was the highest-profile and probably the most far-reaching of the many Monk tributes happening this year, and it attested to the durability of Monks influence, even at a time when consensus in jazz has grown rare.Photo The major focus, perhaps inevitably, was on Monks pen.The 60-plus tunes he is known to have written are some of the most beloved pieces in jazzs canon, partly because they live just barely outside of its conventional language.Thats what the daytime show on Oct. 21 was about, when five pianists took turns playing solo and duo renditions of almost every work Monk wrote.The same applied for the performances of the J.D.Allen Trio, which worked with a different guest each of the festivals first three nights.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it went beyond that.On Oct. 20, the pianist Jason Moran came together in a duo with the drummer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey.(I wasnt in town for this part of the festival but was able to watch video shot by a film crew documenting the entire event.That footage may someday be public.)Their first set began with a loose reading of the ruminative melody to Monks Mood and ventured quickly into abstraction, dispatching with the standard ideas of what it takes to interpret Monks music.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.This set was one of the moments when the spirit of Monks piano playing got called up and shocked back to life in the air of the present day.This came naturally through Mr. Morans fingers and his memory.He grew up idolizing Monk and reworked Monks language of halting gestures and piquant dissonance, eventually rendering his own approach.Playing with Mr. Sorey here, he often reduced Monks song themes to scaffolds and wisps; his own chiming, splintery swing feels attested to Monks long shadow, even in a context dominated by free improvisation.
Kevin Spacey Criticized for Using Apology to Anthony Rapp to Come Out:::::The accusation has encouraged me to address other things about my life, he continued in the statement.He then publicly divulged for the first time that he had loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life.While coming out is often met with support by peers, fans and gay rights activists, the response was far different for Mr. Spacey.Coming out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault, Sarah Kate Ellis, president and chief executive of Glaad, a gay rights organization, said in a statement.This is not a coming out story about Kevin Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advances.The media and public should not gloss over that.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.George Takei, who has used his large social media following to advocate social-justice causes, said in an emailed statement that Mr. Rapps accusations were about power, not sexuality.Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight that is a deflection, he said.They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.Zachary Quinto, an actor, said in a statement that Mr. Spacey had come out not as a point of pride that could inspire children but as a calculated manipulation to deflect attention from the very serious accusation that he attempted to molest one.I am sorry that Kevin only saw fit to acknowledge his truth when he thought it would serve him just as his denial served him for so many years, he said.A representative for Mr. Spacey did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.While Mr. Spacey made reference to rumors regarding his sexuality when he hosted the 2017 Tony Awards, he had never publicly confirmed them and fiercely guarded his privacy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2010, Kevin Sessums, a journalist, pressed Mr. Spacey on his sexuality in an interview for The Daily Beast.We gay men have always proudly claimed you as a member of our tribe, and yet you dont proudly claim us back, Mr. Sessums said.Why?Mr. Spacey responded: Look, I might have lived in England for the last several years but Im still an American citizen and I have not given up my right to privacy.Mr. Sessums continued the line of questioning, but Mr. Spacey pivoted to a discussion of bullying without addressing his own sexuality.No ones personal life is in the public interest, Mr. Spacey said.Its gossip, bottom line.End of story.
Niall Horan Helps One Direction Tie a Beatles Chart Record:::::Photo One Direction now shares something big with the Beatles: Both groups are the only ones to have had three members reach No.1 on the Billboard chart with solo albums.That is thanks to Niall Horan, whose new album, Flicker (Capitol), opened on top with the equivalent of 152,000 sales, including 128,000 copies sold as a full album and 26 million streams, according to Nielsen.As with recent albums by Pink, the Killers, Shania Twain and Katy Perry, Mr. Horans sales were helped by a marketing bundle that included the CD of Flicker in the cost of a concert ticket.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.Mr. Horan follows his former band mates Zayn Malik (No.1 in April 2016) and Harry Styles (No.1 this May) to the top of the chart.Among the Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison all went to No.1 with solo albums, while Ringo Starr remains stalled at No.2.(Liam Payne, the heat is now on you.)Also this week, Future and Young Thugs mixtape Super Slimey (Epic/300) opened at No.2 with 87 million streams the vast majority of its 75,000 sales equivalents and the country singer Chris Young started at No.5 with Losing Sleep (RCA Nashville).Pinks Beautiful Trauma, which opened at No.1 last week, lost 84 percent of its sales in Week 2, but fell only two spots to No.3, avoiding the second-week plunges suffered recently by the Killers and the rapper NF.The rapper Post Malone holds at No.4 with Stoney in that albums 46th week on the chart.
Review: ‘Red Roses, Green Gold’ Brings Back the Grateful Dead:::::Photo For an act to get the jukebox-musical treatment, hits are a minimum requirement.Abba, Frankie Valli and Carole King all had success on the charts before their music overtook Broadway with Mamma Mia!, Jersey Boys and Beautiful.The Grateful Dead had only one Top 10 song, Touch of Grey, and yet here is Red Roses, Green Gold, Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater.Not only that, but this is the third show the writer Michael Norman Mann has created using the Deads catalog, after Cumberland Blues in 1998 and Shakedown Street in 2005.Not too bad for a band whose reputation was built on intense touring and extended live jams.The good news is that the songs, which lean heavily on a classic Americana sound, are effective in a sit-down, smoke-free theatrical context.The show, which is billed as featuring the music of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter (Mr. Hunter was the Deads nonperforming lyricist), sometimes feels like a wacky relative of the Steve Martin and Edie Brickell Broadway bluegrass musical Bright Star.Photo Even better for non-Deadheads, Red Roses, Green Gold lasts just over two hours rather than four, with numbers that mostly clock in around three or four minutes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Unfortunately, Mr. Mann has shoehorned them into a cartoonishly corny story.Like Cumberland Blues, the show takes place in a theme-park version of a Maryland mining town in the 1920s, more specifically at the saloon and mining company owned by the debonair Jackson Jones (Scott Wakefield).Alas, a pair of scheming brothers (Brian Russell Carey and Michael McCoy Reilly) have their sights on taking over the Palace, which is that in name only.
Rostam Batmanglij, Formerly of Vampire Weekend, Gets Lost in Brooklyn:::::After crossing McGuinness Boulevard into the quieter, more traditionally Polish area, he paused before a bland beige apartment building on Diamond Street.I feel like I lived here for three weeks, after college, he said, studying the building before deciding it was the wrong place.Photo Much like this improvised field trip, his artistic endeavors dont adhere to any prescribed path.I dont think my life conforms to that narrative, he said with a moody shrug.Things come out when they come out, but it doesnt correlate with when decisions were made.Its fitting then, that Half-Light is a slippery, elusive album concerned with memory and dreams.Its elegiac and eclectic, a long way from the erudite indie rock that he helped write, play and produce for Vampire Weekend.In 2016, he shocked fans when he announced via Twitter that hed be venturing out on his own.There is so much amazing music all of it dear to me on its way to you, he wrote then.Its an exciting time and I feel lucky to share it with you.Mr. Batmanglij made good on his promise.He has produced songs with a wide range of performers since, including Frank Ocean, Solange Knowles, Carly Rae Jepsen and the sisterly trio Haim, making him a sort of consigliere to the slightly hipper edge of the pop music scene.A lot of what being a producer is, is giving people space, he said of his ability to work with such a varied roster.Like psychologically being there to help them realize what theyre trying to do.It also helps to have an outsiders perspective.The son of Iranian immigrants, he was raised in Washington, D.C., and came out as gay with little fanfare in a 2010 Rolling Stone article.(He was already out to his parents and to his college friends.)All those elements inform, but do not necessarily define, his work.In that way, he is part of a growing vanguard of artists like Mr.Ocean and Dev Hynes, making music that is, by virtue of its creator, a commentary on race, sexuality and identity.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I certainly think that my music is a response to my experience as a person who doesnt identify as straight, as a person who grew up American, he said.Ive always had a complex relationship towards my identity as an American.Mr. Batmanglij walked north along Diamond Street, and passed a large building with prewar flourishes on a sleepy stretch of Meserole Avenue, where Halloween skeletons and pumpkins adorned the entrance.He studied it for a moment.Maybe it was this building, he said.Im trying to remember the building that I lived in.After deciding this wasnt it, he kept walking, looking about.The neighborhood no doubt has changed in the decade since he lived here, but he was surprised by its consistency.This streets not different at all, he said to himself, half-smiling.Mr. Batmanglij has a tendency to speak slowly and cautiously, and is unafraid to give a succinct answer followed by a inscrutable laugh.He wont say what model car he drives, whether he is involved with anyone romantically, or who makes his gray jeans.(Theyre French, he said.)He thought he had revealed too much as is.In my next phase Im not even going to tell people where I live, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food

he said, entering.Freelance types pecked away at their laptops.Whats the matcha cider like?he asked the barista.Its like cider, with matcha, the barista replied flatly, before adding, Its not my personal favorite.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Batmanglij opted for a mint tea before continuing on his way.His recent sold-out show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg hosted a diverse crowd.Some people said, I was surprised at how many hetero guys were at your show, he said.And other people said, You were definitely the soundtrack to a lot of gay couples making out.If Mr. Batmanglij wears his sexuality lightly, its partly because he recognizes that gay life has been integrated into the larger culture.The idea of the gay experience, it feels like a relic, he said.I felt like in the 90s when we were watching the gay characters on The Real World, there was definitely a gay experience that was distinct from a straight experience.If you talk to high schoolers in 2017, I dont know that is as much a part of how they experience a social dynamic.Still, its refreshing to hear Mr. Batmanglij playfully sing about two boys, one to kiss your neck and one to bring you breakfast, in the song Bike Dream.As he turned a corner, Mr. Batmanglij put his blue shirt back on and stopped before a two-story beige building on an industrial block.That was a pretty good place to live, he said, pointing to a rather sad-looking window on the second floor.He had furnished that apartment with a rented upright piano, which he ended up buying and bringing to Los Angeles.Recorded a lot of music there, he said, before continuing his walk.
‘Stranger Things’ Season 2: Finished Watching? Let’s Talk:::::Watching is The New York Timess TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.In the first episode of the new season of Stranger Things, we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins.By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and Demodogs upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon.Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bobs brutal Demomauling and her sons tribulations.via Giphy But the success of the very good second season of Stranger Things is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max.Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid.Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new MTV punk look.0 The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day.For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and Stranger Things 2 Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters is what makes viewers invest in your show.As with last season, the story got going efficiently.Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasnt revealed until it feasted on the family pet.(Im sorry, Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar.You ate my cat.)Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the labs complicity in her death.At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.[ Need help figuring out what to watch next?Get movie and TV show recommendations from the Watching team with our thrice-weekly newsletter.Sign up here. ]Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster basically, face it and tell it to go away which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead.The show cleverly played with Wills connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a spying asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles.(Again: Wills had a tough time.)The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last years Demogorgon.So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs?Or what?And arent we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after Lost, Game of Thrones and probably others Im forgetting?But its amorphousness did make for some of the seasons most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Wills body.Noah Schnapp in Stranger Things 2.Netflix As Will, Noah Schnapp was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one.He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy.(He likes it cold.)With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A.of Elliott from E.T.and Danny Torrance from The Shining.But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last years bike-bound adventures.Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didnt know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper.Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush.As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself.His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected was maybe the most touching love story of the season.Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasnt a one-season wonder, telegraphing Elevens varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship.(Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?)And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesnt work without Mr. Harbours and Winona Ryders deeply felt performances.The newcomers were more of a mixed bag.Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the party (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons).Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman.Sean Astins flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.Dacre Montgomery in Stranger Things 2.Netflix But after Billys (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him.By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals.(I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video.After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police.This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.Kali was the Darth Vader to Elevens Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force.While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.A scene from Stranger Things 2.Netflix It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins.But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue Bon Jovis Runaway as she was literally running away the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire 80s urban clich and overwrought conflict.It didnt help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to Temple of Doom (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture.(Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the 80s.)Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the Matrix.She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy?and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father.Whatever transpires in future Stranger Things installments, shell have that going for her.One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season.They didnt get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each others company.It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry.(Theres always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face lifes terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball 84.After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results.(Oh Dustin, your time will come.)It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth Whats at the X?Bob wondered as he looked at Wills map.Pirate treasure?You may recall that as Mikey in The Goonies, one of the ur-texts of Stranger Things, Sean Astin led the hunt for One-Eyed Willys loot.It was one of several fun meta moments this season.(See also: Max dismissing Lucass description of last seasons events as a little derivative in parts.)In the premiere recap I doubted that Dr. Owens was truly on Joyces side, as he said, but it turns out he more or less was.I probably should have guessed the Duffers would upend expectations attached to the lab doctors, after Matthew Modines evil turn, and Paul Reiser, who played a duplicitous character in Aliens, another of this series touchstones.Mistakes have been made, Dr. Owens told Nancy and Jonathan.You killed Barbara, Nancy countered.Abundant mistakes, he replied.R.I.P.Barb, finally.Your turn: Did Stranger Things 2 recapture the magic of the first season?Were you fine with Eleven being away from the main action for so long?How many puffs of Farrah Fawcett Hair Spray does it take you to achieve Harrington-like coif perfection?Please email us at filmandtv@nytimes.com and well share the best comments in a future Watching newsletter or article.
‘Poet in Spain’ Offers New Translations of Lorca’s Soulful Work:::::He evoked duende perhaps most fully in his Gypsy Ballads, published in 1928.Its a canonical book in Spain.Here was a highly cultivated poet reworking Andalusian folk culture and myth.The high-low effect was startling.It was as if Robert Lowell had made a murderous little book that drew its inspiration from Harry Smiths Anthology of American Folk Music.The poet and translator Sarah Arvio is here now with Poet in Spain, a new translation of Lorcas poems into English.It is the first major undertaking of its kind since Collected Poems: A Bilingual Edition (1991), the work of several translators and edited by Christopher Maurer.Unlike Maurer, Arvio omits Lorcas intemperate and political and Whitman-inflected New York poems, written after he visited the city in 1929 and 1930.(These were published after his death under the title Poet in New York.)She focuses instead entirely on what she calls his moonlit earthbound Spanish poems.Photo About Lorcas New York versus his Spanish poems, Arvio writes, To my ear, these voices are so different they could almost be the voices of two different poets.The crucial word here is almost.The absence of these vital poems immediately renders Arvios book less necessary than Maurers in terms of seeing this complicated poet whole.There are consolations.Arvio is a supple translator, and she has delivered a personal book.She has felt free to shift Lorcas poems around in sequence, as he himself often did when putting together his books.Most notably she has shorn the poems of punctuation, as Lorca sometimes did in his drafts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The spare effect can be riveting.Take this snippet of Dreamwalking Ballad: Compadre can I swap my horse for your house saddle for your mirror knife for your blanket compadre I come bleeding from the Cabra passes If I could young friend the deal would be done But Im no longer me my house isnt mine At other moments, the punctuation is missed.You feel Lorca has been tamped down.His poem Cazador (Hunter), for example, begins with these words: Alto pinar!Arvio translates this, with a vast diminution in energy, as High grove of pines.Lorca wrote in an exclamatory style that gave his work a flamenco brashness.Witness the first stanza of rboles (Trees) from 1919: rboles!Habis sido flechas Cadas del azul?Qu terribles guerreros os lanzaron?Han sido las estrellas?Arvio renders this in telegraphic yet somewhat lobotomized fashion: Were you once arrows falling from the sky What terrible warriors shot you Were they the stars At other moments, Arvios translations are both less accurate and less felicitous than those in Maurers edition.The opening lines of Reyerta (Brawl or Feud), for example, read this way: En la mitad del barranco / las navajas de Albacete, / bellas de sangre contraria, / relucen como los peces.Arvio gives us this translation: Halfway down the gully / the blades from Albacete / glisten like fishes / flush with fighting blood.In Maurers book, it is: Halfway down the gorge / knives of Albacete, / beautiful with enemy blood, / shine like fish.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Beautiful with enemy blood.That isnt just a gorgeous phrase, ripe with meaning, but it comports more exactly with Lorcas Spanish.The poems in this book include not only Gypsy Ballads, but the Dark Love Sonnets, with their death-haunted homoeroticism, and poems about the deadly goring of Lorcas friend the bullfighter Ignacio Snchez Mejas, among others.Lorcas poems from Spain are a poetry of dreams and journeys and glimpses from balconies, of sunbaked meadows and realms of erotic yearning.He went to the well often for the same elemental imagery: the sea, the wind, the moon, flowers and trees.His mind worked feverishly enough to induce hallucinations.He completed 13 plays and nine books of verse between 1917 and 1936.This book includes one of those plays, a rich and gripping retranslation of Blood Wedding, written in 1932.Its an unconventional choice to print it in a book of poems, but Arvio argues and then demonstrates that the language in it is of a piece with Lorcas blood-warm verse.The poet Ted Hughes, who once translated Blood Wedding, observed that Lorca cannot be Englished.Perhaps.But his life and work offer mysteries were still profitably untangling.
New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s:::::Ms. Matthau, the dancer who reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, said she was willing to break its confidentiality clause even if it meant that he might pursue legal damages.I want to do my part to help bring this to light so it doesnt happen with other people in Hollywood or anywhere else, she said in an interview.The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere.Photo Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her.The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinsteins, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006.The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein.Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the departments hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses.Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted.Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States.The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015.Mr. Weinsteins spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.Cynthia Burr For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein.Photo But she didnt forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City.How he tried to kiss her in the elevator.And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was just him and me alone, she said.I was fearful I didnt have the wherewithal to get away.It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s.Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a real up-and-comer, Ms. Burr remembers.Her manager said they should meet.After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed.The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself, she said.What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress?Nobody would have believed me.Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood.She appeared in Scarface and the first two Lethal Weapon films, and in soap operas and other television shows.Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened.Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago.Im really sad for everybody, but Im really glad its out in the open, Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein.I finally felt like I had a voice.Hope Exiner dAmore Ms. Exiner dAmore had worked for Mr. Weinstein for just a few weeks when he asked if shed like to take a trip to New York City.Both of them were in their 20s, living in Buffalo in the late 1970s.Photo She was working for Mr. Weinsteins concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs.She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner dAmore recalled.He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room.They would have to share.I gave him a look like that was ridiculous, she recalled.But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless.When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I told him no.I kept pushing him away.He just wouldnt listen, Ms. Exiner dAmore said.He just forced himself on me.She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her.She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo.She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room.After the trip, Ms. Exiner dAmore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees.She declined.Within three or four weeks, she was fired.It was a relief, she said.I hated being there.Ms. Exiner dAmore never went into the film industry.She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising.Ashley Matthau Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004.She was in Puerto Rico performing in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights when Mr. Weinstein visited the set.As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting.Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged.She said he persisted.Photo When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid.No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car.Dont worry, Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat.Nothing is going to happen.Were just going to discuss future projects.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same.When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said.He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her.I kept telling him, Stop, Im engaged, but he kept saying: Its just a little cuddling.Its not a problem.Its not like were having sex.Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fianc, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened.Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged.With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men.Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron.The experience, she said, was chilling.She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein.Well drag you through the mud by your hair, she recalled the lawyer saying.Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment.Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle.Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again.Lacey Dorn Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries.Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party Advertisement Continue reading the main story A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email.He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said.Great meeting you, he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m. On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein.As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes.I was so nave, I didnt say anything.And he didnt say anything either, she said.I just got out of the party as fast as possible.Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again.Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a rite of passage, an acknowledgment of how awful the entertainment business could be.
‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 1, Episode 7: Party Time:::::Photo Season 1, Episode 7: Magic To Make The Sanest Man Go Mad This weeks Star Trek: Discovery has a very similar story line to the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Cause And Effect.In that one, the crew of the Enterprise finds itself in a time loop which only has one ending: the ships destruction.Eventually, they figure it out and find a way to break it, thanks to an advantage that other starships dont have: an android.(Data probably shouldve used future Google to look up the plot for Groundhog Day, but we digress.)The Discoverys advantage is Stamets, whose dabbling in mycelium somehow gives him the ability to remember all the time loop experiences to warn Burnham and Lorca in future occurrences.This episode also features the return of Rainn Wilson as Harry Mudd, who weaponizes that time loop to sell out the Discovery to the Klingons, partially to get revenge for being abandoned in a Klingon prison.( Mudd kind of had a point there.)The best episodes of the Star Trek franchise are often ambitious, adventurous and teach us something new about the characters.On top of that: They are fun.In Cause and Effect, the Enterprise crew realizes something is amiss because of a poker game.In this weeks episode, Magic To Make The Sanest Man Go Mad, a party is used as the vehicle of choice to solve a complex problem.Discovery has often lacked the ability to have fun with itself.This was the first episode to even try and it worked, even while keeping the stakes as high as possible.It did just enough, however, to make it more than just a direct rip-off.The portrayals of Harry Mudd by Roger Carmel in the original series and Mr. Wilsons in Discovery are distinctly different.Yet, this show made a curious choice in the end.Mr. Carmels Mudd was a bit of a fool and hardly a man of extreme malevolence.Mr. Wilsons is a murderous villain, one who delights in mass murders of Starfleet personnel.For the purposes of Discovery, its a choice that Mr. Wilson makes work.And yet, at the end of the episode, Stella, Mudds lover, arrives and says she understands Mudds plight.Lorca and his crew let Mudd go, even though he had become essentially an enemy combatant.It was an odd choice one that would have made sense for Mr. Carmels Mudd, not the one that Mr. Wilson was inhabiting.
10 Places That Define New York City, Reimagined:::::Advertisement 10 Places That Define New York City, Reimagined New York is a city of landmarks: world famous skyscrapers, grand monuments and cultural icons.But many of its must-see places each came shockingly close to becoming something completely different, some for better, some for worse.Visiting the sites of these remarkable unbuilt schemes can heighten the enjoyment of touring the things that actually got built.You could see dozens of unbuilt plans at the new Queens Museum exhibition , and in the book Never Built New York (Metropolis Books, 2016).Or roam the city, with these visions in the back of your mind.Central Park Image A view of the park from One57, looking north.Credit Piotr Redlinski for The New York Times Central Park is, in every sense, the Clearing in the Distance that Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux originally imagined it should be.It is a bucolic idyll hemmed in by an uproarious metropolis.Now spread out on the Great Lawn and imagine a completely different landscape : perfectly symmetrical, flattened formal gardens composed of topiaries patterned as stars and spirals and paisley flowers.That was the engineer John Rinks 1857 rigidly whimsical vision for the park, one of the entries submitted to the city-sponsored competition.A few years later, the architect Richard Morris Hunt argued that what the silent stretch of rural landscape lacked was the artistic grandeur of Paris.Image John Rinks plan for Central Park Credit New York Historical Society Hunts dream was to position a series of gates throughout the park, including the Gate of Peace, a huge semicircular terrace framing a 50-foot-high column leading to a pair of stair-stepped cascades that would feed a basin below, on the southeast end of the park.It had all the grandiloquence, Calvert Vaux sneered, of Napoleon III.Farther west along 59th Street, at the intersection of Sixth Avenue, might have been home to yet another reimagined Central Park this, from the fecund pen of Ernest Flagg , the noted architect, circa 1904.The park would have been drastically cinched.He proposed a slender mall that would run the entire length of Manhattan, subsuming a thin strip of the park and Sixth Avenue, too.Of course Olmsted and Vauxs pastoral vision won out (as it did in Brooklyns Prospect Park), and their creation is today considered hallowed ground that not even the most determined designer would dream of altering.Grand Central Terminal Image Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Grand Central Terminal, with its celestial ceiling and unshakable aura of Beaux-Arts magnificence, is arguably the grandest space in New York.But it almost suffered the same fate as its exceptional sibling, Penn Station, whose above ground structure, designed by McKim, Mead & White, was demolished to heighten the value of air rights amid the railroads decline.As pressure to use the air rights above Grand Central Station mounted, developers tried time and again to propose lofty alternatives.Image I.M.Peis Hyperboloid Credit Pei Cobb Freed The gutsiest was I.M.Peis Hyperboloid, sponsored by the developer William Zeckendorf, in 1956.The hourglass-shaped design, whose altitude would have surpassed that of the Empire State Building, was light years ahead of its time, incorporating a weblike steel exoskeleton to support the open floors within.Squint and youd think you were in Dubai, 2016.More than a decade later, the developer UGP Properties proposed Marcel Breuers 175 Park Avenue, a modernist slab mirroring Walter Gropiuss Pan Am Building just north that would have rammed right through the stations Grand Concourse (and in a later plan, would replace its facade).Preservationists, led by none other than Jacqueline Onassis, fought the project all the way to the Supreme Court, winning a battle that finally gave the fledgling movement much-needed momentum.The city renewed its love affair with Grand Central, and almost 20 years later the station was renewed with the completion of a $200 million restoration, highlighted by a thorough cleaning of Paul Csar Helleus magnificent gold-leafed Zodiac mural on the ceiling of the Main Concourse.Ellis Island Image The Ellis Island National Museum of immigration.Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times There are few places as evocative as the Great Hall of Ellis Island, where thousands upon thousands came to the New World.After the federal government decommissioned the island in 1954, it opened the site to developers, who proposed all manner of projects, from a resort to a university to a prison.The highest bid came from the Damon Doudt Corporation, which commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to sketch a city-within-a-city called the Key Plan, consisting of stacked living spaces arranged around a large open plaza surrounded by bubble-shaped buildings containing theaters, a planetarium and much more.The plan was conceived by Frank Lloyd Wright, but the drawings were executed by his successor firm, Taliesin Associated Architects.Wright, not surprisingly, would have designed every square inch of the development, including the boats to get there.None of the proposals were accepted, and later the National Park Service commissioned Philip Johnson to turn the site into a nostalgic landmark.Vines would have overgrown what would become a neglected ruin; side by side with Johnsons 130-foot-tall, ziggurat-shaped tower dedicated to the millions of immigrants who had first disembarked there.Image Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for Ellis Island.Credit Avery Archives, Columbia University Instead, Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc , and Beyer Blinder Belle , restored the main building of the station over the course of eight years, and it reopened as home to the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration in 1990.It has received more than 40 million visitors since.Columbus Circle Image Columbus Circle Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Crossing into Columbus Circle on foot is daunting.Cars, buses and cabs decidedly have the upper hand.Its much simpler to circumnavigate it rather than wade into the circle itself.Travel backward in time to 1948, however, and in an alternate universe you might have encountered a genuinely futuristic construct that allowed you to cross the circle, in style.Matthew Nowicki, a Polish migr architect, hoped to encircle the vexing roundabout with an elevated linear accelerator-cum-shopping center.His promenade, lined by stores and cafes, would have been a sleek, white, 60-foot-wide saucer with two loops.One, facing the Columbus Monument, was an exterior colonnade whose columns were the exposed steel arcs supporting a poured-in-place concrete roof.The other, outer loop, was enclosed by 20-foot-high floor-to-ceiling glass windows tilted toward the surrounding streets.You could have walked the 1,100-foot circumference, master of the streets below, levitated two stories above the roadway.It was never built.A full renovation of Columbus Circle completed in 2005 included a new fountain, benches and green space.By far the largest development on the circle is the Time Warner Center, which contains CNNs studios, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Jazz at Lincoln Center and some of the fanciest shopping and dining in the city.Around the circle, the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD) opened inside Edward Durell Stones refaced Huntington Hartford Gallery of Modern Art.Times Square Image A pedestrian plaza at Times Square.Credit Yeong-Ung Yang for The New York Times In recent years Times Square has become a syrupy sweet haven for tourists and a hated destination for everyone else.But what if the land that has been transformed from porn empire to outdoor mall had an entirely different precedent?Just before the Great Depression, the designer Joseph Urban proposed the Reinhardt Theater, an Art Deco masterpiece wedding beauty and ballyhoo with a black glass facade offset with intricate golden metalwork.A theater is more than a stage and auditorium, Urban wrote in his 1929 book, Theaters.It is a place to experience a heightened sense of life.If only that were the case for Times Square today.Another ambitious, but unrealized, precedent for the area would have been Ely Jacques Kahns Dowling Theater, a postwar fusion of Modernism with Art Decos bursts of neon color, texture and light.Image The proposed Dowling Theater.Credit Avery Archive, Columbia University Years later, Venturi Scott Brown proposed a tower for 42nd Street and 8th Avenue that would have announced itself with a fiery starburst, making Times Squares omnipresent billboards a key element of the buildings design.Times Square is still a constant work in progress.Its latest iteration is more pedestrian-friendly, thanks to five plazas that span almost two acres of space formerly occupied by bumper-to-bumper traffic.Madison Square Image Credit Julieta Cervantes for The New York Times When you think of Madison Square today, what springs to mind are recent staples like Shake Shack and Eataly, and immortal landmarks like the Flatiron Building and the clock tower of the Metropolitan Life building.The areas stately character would certainly have been stretched skyward had it not been for the Great Depression, which reduced the size of Henry Wiley Corbetts Metropolitan Life North Annex from more than 100 stories to a scant 29.From Madison Square Park, consider the bulky stump and its relatively short size, and now hypothesize whether Lower Manhattans canyons would have been replicated here after its completion.Image Henry Wiley Corbetts Metropolitan Life North Annex.Credit Avery Archive, Columbia University Another severe downturn, The Great Recession, killed Rem Koolhaass 24-story building at 23 East 22nd Street.Hoping to take advantage of the neighboring air rights, Koolhaas proposed a building that stepped its way out and up from its site, its cantilevered units containing glass bottoms.Another building killed by that downturn was Daniel Libeskinds One Madison, an ethereal, vegetation-laced tower built on stilts, hovering above what is now the Credit Suisse Tower.The Flatiron district is now booming perhaps too quickly.Two of the newest towers erected in recent years are CetraRuddys 621-foot-tall One Madison, a vertical line of stacking cubes, and KPFs 777-foot-tall 45 East 22nd Street, which cantilevers over an adjacent building.Rem Koolhaas has set his sights on the area again: he is now planning his first New York residence down the street, 121 East 22nd Street.Washington Square Park Image Washington Square Park.Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times It is the stomping ground of academics and potheads, hustlers and innocents, dissidents and wing-tipped businessmen, poets and folk singers.Despite the domineering formality of the neo-Classical arch honoring the 100th anniversary of George Washingtons inauguration, Washington Square Park is certainly one of the citys most deeply informal public spots.But if you take a seat by the fountain, you are occupying a spot that would have been smack in the middle of the mini-freeway that the citys former construction czar, Robert Moses, planned to build, slicing the park in half.As you looked through the arch, youd have been watching cars speeding beneath its marble entablature, along a newly extended Fifth Avenue pushing south into Lower Manhattan.Image Robert Moses' vision of what land use at Washington Square Park.Credit M.T.A.Archives If Mosess wider vision had been fulfilled, the lengthened artery would have served a whole new neighborhood of superblock apartment buildings he had designated to replace the blighted slums along the blocks south of the park to Houston Street.The historic streets eviscerated, Washington Square blanched and bloodless, you would have wondered why it was youd decided to visit the park in the first place.While Washington Square is in fact gleaming from a recent $30 million update, it has, like the village around it, lost much of its bohemian character.Now the major issue here is not blight, but gentrification.Lincoln Center Image From left, the David H. Koch Theater, the Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall, the grand performance spaces that make up Lincoln Center.Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times Obligatory photos in front of Lincoln Centers famous fountain would have been quite different if Wallace K. Harrisons ambitious proposals for the Metropolitan Opera hadnt been quashed by untold layers of bureaucracy.Before Harrisons plans, sites for the Metropolitan Opera had been proposed near Columbus Circle, Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art and Washington Square.None of those came to be, either.But once Lincoln Square was settled on, Harrison, the lead designer of the United Nations, proposed more than 50 designs.Most of them featured experiments with sculptural concrete, each more dazzling than the next; more evocative of the Sydney Opera House or J.F.K.s TWA Terminal than the Rubiks cubes of Lincoln Center.Image One of Harrison's proposed designs.Credit Avery Archive Columbia University But a consortium of officials wagged their heads at these plans, for budgetary and aesthetic reasons.The blandest design of all is the one that got built.Lincoln Center completed a major overhaul, led by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, in 2010, but one of its most ambitious plans a redesign of David Geffen Hall by Thomas Heatherwick and Diamond Schmitt Architects was recently abandoned.American Museum of Natural History Image The American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.Credit Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times As you climb the subway steps to Central Park West, looming overhead is the faceted red-granite American Museum of Natural History, whose rusticated walls and 150-foot-tall towers look like a Brobdingnagian brownstone .Race up the south entrance stairs, pause beneath the arches of the loggia, run your hands along the soft limestone pillars, and imagine a metamorphosis occurs: The vermilion walls peel away, fine dentils recede into flatness, turrets and towers, with their finials and conical caps, transform themselves into concise pyramids.The entire 77th Street front would butter itself over with a thin veneer of sober gray limestone.Image Credit American Museum of Natural History The building, Aymar Emburys 1942 conception, would be a windowless two-story base pierced by an entrance spaced precisely in the middle of a blank wall.The final effect: unenchanting institutional modernism indistinguishable from a government office building.Since this proposal to wrap the museum in austere facing failed (as did Emburys plan across town to replace the Metropolitan Museums steps with a circular driveway), the museum has continued to grow by accretion.In 1992 Kevin Roche built an eight-story library; in 2000, Polshek Partnership (now Ennead Architects) completed the Rose Center for Earth and Space; and now Studio Gang is planning the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation.Battery Park Image Pier A Harbor House, a multilevel food and drink destination in a stately 19th-century pier.Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Battery Park, at the southernmost tip of the city, might be the ideal starting point for an imaginary journey into Manhattan.A stroll along the bayside offers vistas of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and the Jersey skyline, and a view uptown of the seemingly unending escarpment of skyscrapers implanted on formerly Dutch colonial farmland.The primo location has made the area the number one spot for unbuilt ventures.At least a half-dozen watergates, elaborate landings for dignitaries arriving by sea; a floating airport, by the genius industrial designer, Norman Bel Geddes; a bridge landing for the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge, in 1939; a Ferry Terminal building, with a giant big-screen clock by the postmodernist architects Venturi, Scott Brown ; the list goes on.Image A proposed bridge would have connected to Battery Park.Credit Brooklyn Public Library But none can match, for sheer bravado, the Obelisk by the architect Eric Gugler, in 1929.At 800 feet, the Gateway to America, would have dwarfed the Washington Monument by 250 feet.On axis with Broadway, the tower would have risen on 16 acres of landfill, extending Manhattan in a broad paved arc 400 feet into the bay.From Broadway, looking south, the obelisk would have stood out.From its observation deck, nearly 65 stories up, Brooklyn, Bayonne, Sandy Hook, Far Rockaway the very curvature of the Earth would have been within view.These days Battery Park, with its unobstructed views of New York Harbor, is best known as the place to queue up to catch the ferry to Ellis Island or the Statue of Liberty.And while Louis Kahn never built his planned Holocaust Memorial on this site, it is also home to Kevin Roches ziggurat-shaped Museum of Jewish Heritage.Correction : An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the architecture firm that did the drawings for Frank Lloyd Wright's plan for Ellis Island.It is Taliesin Associated Architects.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page TR 4 of the New York edition with the headline: New York Landmarks, Reimagined Get the Travel Dispatch Newsletter Every Saturday, get travel tips, destination coverage, photos from all over the world and more.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Luke Skywalker Speaks:::::It is, if you can be objective about it, he said a few weeks ago, sitting in his home here near the Pacific Ocean.Photo Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood?I could be the size of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, whos going to know?You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with Star Wars, which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal.The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.But Mr. Hamill isnt bitter or jaded, and he isnt Luke, though he has retained some of that characters incorruptibility.Hes gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing Star Wars war stories.At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought Star Wars into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im such a fraud, he said with a theatrical air.But Im enjoying all the residual attention that the movies getting.I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn.Whats not to love?On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin.The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to Star Wars its mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamills own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of Return of the Jedi.Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up.In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; hell slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues the adenoidal clip of the Star Wars creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was King Kong.Proudly recalling a fight scene from Return of the Jedi, Mr. Hamill said, For me, sitting in the rancors hand, I was going all Fay Wray its like a major accomplishment to me.But it was always that way.Id say Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3POs cereal!Photo The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings.He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could.If I didnt get a part, no problem, he said.Then where do I go?I sell tickets.I make props.I make posters.I dont have to be in the show I want to be near the show.He landed early roles on General Hospital and The Partridge Family.And then, of course, came Star Wars: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects.I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity, Mr. Lucas said.He added that Mr. Hamill brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character, and that made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first Star Wars and its sequels.Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience.I thought, even if this thing doesnt slay at the box office, its got midnight cult movie written all over it, he said.Move over, Rocky Horror, Star Wars is here!Instead, Star Wars became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them Harry and Carrison as they promoted the movie together.When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed adequately, Mr. Hamill uninspiredly and Ms. Fisher wretchedly, Mr. Hamill said, We had T-shirts made: adequate, uninspired and wretched.I said, Harrison, adequates practically a rave compared to what we got.Photo Photo Mr. Ford said that during this time, the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness.We really were figuring this out as we went along.Mr. Hamill struck him as a very bright, sincere young actor, who Mr. Ford said seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the Star Wars royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now.Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: Hes a brilliant actor thats a given, he said.Hes also a leading man.When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.Mr. Hamill believed hed find his destiny on a different path one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.After two blockbuster sequels, The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the Star Wars story was complete.With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in The Elephant Man.I wasnt getting character parts in movies and television, he explained.Unless youre Meryl Streep, they dont let you do accents.He starred in the Broadway production of Amadeus while Return of the Jedi was still in theaters.But his 1985 musical Harrigan n Hart, about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his Star Wars legacy.He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on The Simpsons, he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of Guys and Dolls.Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.He was always comfortable being part of the Star Wars subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for ultra-passionate fans).Its clearly not for everyone I get that, Mr. Hamill said.But the passion of it all is just astonishing.The way its become part of the fabric of their lives I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia its moving.Photo He was not involved in the much-maligned Star Wars prequels from 1999 to 2005.And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new Star Wars trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate.We figured we had the middle three, he said.It was over.When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, I was completely stunned.Carrie, not a minute went by she slapped the table and goes, Im in!I said, Carrie, poker face!Mr. Hamill needed more time to think.I was just really scared, he said.I thought, why mess with it?The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their Star Wars heyday.No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star, he said.Its sad.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse The Force Awakens, expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.Hes too old and too rich and too cranky, Mr. Hamill said.Hes not going to do this.But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no?Id be the most hated man in nerd-dom.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of Star Wars fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega).He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists.But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of The Force Awakens, and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Lukes story line.(The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)The idea of it was so enormous, Mr. Abrams said.It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters.That had to be the next movie.Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in The Force Awakens.I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal, Mr. Abrams said.I dont think he knew just how minimal until he read it.In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was not particularly happy with how little he was in it.Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Lukes big reveal at the end would fall flat.If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if theres a big groan in the house, the eggs on my face, not J.J.s, he said.Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read he jokingly calls it a table listen of the Force Awakens script.He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration.(I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse, Mr. Hamill said.)Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.Photo Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in The Force Awakens, lamented that they had worked together on the early Star Wars movies far less than viewers realize.The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few, he said.I knew Chewbacca better.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.Hes very centered in his own experience and his own life, Mr. Ford said.Hes not a grandstander.Hes a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and thats what were there for.Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in The Force Awakens when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, thats fabulous, he said.But now he and the The Last Jedi creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this, said Rian Johnson, the Last Jedi writer and director.Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.Mr. Johnson said The Last Jedi also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke.In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with the youthfulness and innocence he now embodies a person full of soul and experience, Mr. Johnson said.Video While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the Star Wars filmmakers on big plot points hes still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in The Last Jedi.Thats the hard part, Mr. Hamill said.You dont want to admit how possessive youve become.There are times where you go, Really?Thats what they think of Luke?Im not only in disagreement Im insulted.But thats the process and you thrash it all out.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December.Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to Star Wars.Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his Star Wars work, he said, She goes, Whats your problem?I said, Well, its theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.She goes, I am Princess Leia.Youre Luke Skywalker.Get used to it.More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.She deserved that second act, he said.Harrison was more prominent in VII, Im more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one.Her timing was perfect, except in this case.His Star Wars colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise Hes the last man standing, said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in The Force Awakens.But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.It means what it means to him, and thats all that matters, he said.Im sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone that its all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.Photo Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either.Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original Star Wars movies outside of theaters and has seen The Force Awakens only twice.All I notice are flaws, he explained.Oh, why did I do that?Look at my hair.What was I thinking?Advertisement Continue reading the main story During production of The Force Awakens, he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt and was struck by what he saw.They were all great, Mr. Hamill said.They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is A Hard Days Night, Richard Lesters madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, I saw it originally going, Oh, can you imagine it?Girls chasing me down the street!It looks like so much fun.But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light.Its like a horror movie, he said.Theyre trapped.They cant go anywhere.One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamills mind was the Cant Buy Me Love sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.Its the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy, Mr. Hamill said.It plays so differently now, when youre on the other end of it.
Reading by the Numbers: When Big Data Meets Literature:::::Its a question that draws heated answers.Digital humanities has been accused of fetishizing science, of acting as a Trojan horse for the corporate forces threatening the university, and worse.A recent broadside in The Chronicle of Higher Education called The Digital-Humanities Bust took a bludgeon to the fields revolutionary rhetoric, with Mr. Moretti among those accused of issuing a stream of vague promissory notes for results that never arrive.Mr. Moretti who prefers to call the labs work computational criticism tends to greet such challenges with a mixture of modesty and bravado.Our results are not as good as what I had hoped for 10 or 15 years ago, he said in an interview earlier this month, during a brief trip to New York.We have not yet created a revolution in knowledge.But how much of literary scholarship is even trying to do that?Advertisement Continue reading the main story [Read about some of the Stanford Literary Labs findings.]Mr. Moretti, who was born to teacher parents in a small town in northern Italy (his brother is the filmmaker Nanni Moretti), represents something of a paradox.Hes an intellectual trained in the grand European tradition who questions its most cherished methods.And hes a professor who has achieved some measure of celebrity by promoting a ruthlessly impersonal idea of both scholarship and literary history itself.Literary criticism typically tends to emphasize the singularity of exceptional works that have stood the test of time.But the canon, Mr. Moretti argues, is a distorted sample.Instead, he says, scholars need to consider the tens of thousands of books that have been forgotten, a task that computer algorithms and enormous digitized databases have now made possible.We know how to read texts, he wrote in a much-quoted essay included in his book Distant Reading, which won the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism.Now lets learn how to not read them.These days, Mr. Moretti has softened his rhetoric, though the underlying point is the same.Reading is one of lifes greatest pleasures, which we would be insane to give up, he said.But the question is whether reading and knowledge are continuous with each other.Mr. Morettis own output has a similar dividedness.His early work was grounded in close reading, and his last book The Bourgeois: Between History and Literature, included fine-grained analysis of classic works.That his digital provocations command wide interest even among highly skeptical colleagues may owe something to what Leah Price, professor of English at Harvard, called a Nixon in China effect.Only because his own close readings are so dazzling, does Moretti have the credibility to say: Read as closely as you want, but if you want to understand literary history youll need other tools, she said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The literary quality of the labs pamphlets, which are usually credited to teams of researchers, also doesnt hurt.Yes, they bristle with bar charts, scatterplot diagrams and sometimes eyeball-blistering terminology.(Operationalizing must be the ugliest word Ive ever used, Mr. Moretti writes in the first sentence of a solo-authored pamphlet called Operationalizing.)But they are also full of witty asides and suspenseful first-person narration that acknowledges surprises, dead-ends and the collaborative, experimental nature of the labs work.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theyre very good at dramatizing the method, said Ted Underwood, a professor at the University of Illinois who also uses computational analysis.Thats part of the fun of reading them.Photo Some of the labs results may seem less than earthshaking.For example, it turns out that what distinguishes the Gothic novel isnt just castles and ghosts, but more frequent use of the certain verb tenses and prepositions.(The critic Kathryn Schulz, writing about some of the early pamphlets in The New York Times Book Review in 2011, said she mostly vacillated between two reactions: Huh?and Duh!)But even modest-seeming results like the finding that from 1785 to 1900 the language of the British novel steadily shifted away from words relating to moral judgment to words associated with concrete description unsettle established ideas of literary history.We tend to see literary history as a story of movements, periods, sudden revolutions, Mr. Underwood said.There are also these really broad, slow, massive changes that we havent described before.Some of the labs findings have themselves had sudden, and totally unexpected, real-world results.Mr. Moretti noted with amusement a flap last spring at the World Bank, where Paul Romer, the chief economist, was relieved of some management duties at its research arm after demanding, among other changes, that its publications reduce their use of the word and one of the stylistic tics mocked in Bankspeak, a Lit Lab pamphlet analyzing the banks drift over 60 years toward more abstract and self-referential language.How many literary critics can say they got the chief economist of the World Bank, O.K., not fired, but deprived of some of his power?Mr. Moretti said with a laugh.Since retiring from Stanford, Mr. Moretti has moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he is helping to create a new digital humanities program at the countrys leading polytechnic.He also has a full slate of writing projects, including a study of forgotten 19th-century British best-sellers and an algorithm-free book based on his undergraduate lectures on American culture, to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.Even if the results of computational criticism never catch up with his early polemical fervor, Mr. Moretti remains unapologetic about trying.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Id rather be a failed revolutionary, he said, than

The Book Crunchers:::::Advertisement The Book Crunchers Counting ands, mapping emotion and other explorations of the Stanford Literary Lab.Image Franco Moretti Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times The Stanford Literary Lab, founded in 2010 by Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, uses computer analysis to detect hidden patterns in literary texts by reading hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of them at a time.[ Read more about that work .]Here are a few findings from the new book Canon/Archive, which collects 11 of the labs research pamphlets.The Novel Quiets Down Loudness in the Novel, by Holst Katsma, explores how volume functions both in individual works and across the genre as a whole.This chart, based on analysis of a broad corpus of 19th-century British novels, shows how fiction quieted down over the course of the century, as the use of loud speaking verbs like screamed, shouted and cried declined from 19 percent to 6 percent of the total, and the neutral said gained a near monopoly.Not that characters had stopped talking: The total number of speaking verbs remained fairly constant over the decades, the researchers found.Image Credit n+1 Books Talk Banking to Me Bankspeak, by Franco Moretti and Domnique Pestre, analyzes shifting language patterns across six decades of World Bank annual reports.The study finds a steep rise in abstract bureaucratese like governance, framework and priorities, as well as a spike in self-congratulatory terms like outstanding, key, stronger and better.(The verb disagree, the researchers note, does not appear even once.)But the oddest finding may be the sharp increase in an innocuous little word: and.In 1946, and accounted for around 2.6 percent of the words in the reports, a frequency similar to that of average academic prose.But by 2015, as this chart shows, its share had almost doubled, reflecting what the researchers describe as the growing tendency toward long lists of nouns that create the illusion of activity, sometimes despite a total absence of logic.Image Credit n+1 Books Mapping Londons Emotions In The Emotions of London , Ryan Heuser, Franco Moretti and Erik Steiner look at how different emotions come to be associated with different locations in fictional London, as represented by texts published from 1700 to 1900.As might be expected, the fashionable West End was increasingly associated with happiness, while Bedlam (an asylum), Newgate (the site of the famous prison) and the Tower of London were more associated with fear.But perhaps more strikingly, the researchers write, most named places in novels were associated with neutral states.Image Credit n+1 Books Which isnt to say that London life itself had become less emotional.When the researchers analyzed 200-word passages that did not include the names of specific locations in London, the prevalence of both fear and happiness grew substantially.Instead of a general muting of emotion, they write, it appears to have retreated out of recognizable public spaces.Follow on Twitter: @jennyschuessler Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page C 6 of the New York edition with the headline: Let Us Count the Words Sign up for the Louder Newsletter Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Hidden Treasures of Nazis’ Art Dealer Finally Go on Display:::::Gurlitt Status Report delves into the history behind the collection and the circumstances under it came together.This includes an exploration of the ambiguities surrounding Mr. Gurlitts fathers personal history.He was persecuted as the grandchild of Jew, but he also became one of only four dealers allowed to sell artworks confiscated by the Nazis.Also displayed are documents that record the efforts of the two galleries staging the exhibition to establish the original ownership of the works.Each of the shows focuses on a different aspect of the Third Reichs policies on art.The Bern exhibition, Degenerate Art, Confiscated and Sold, opens on Thursday.Its focus is on works acquired as part of the 1938 law that allowed the Nazis to seize so-called degenerate art, mostly Modernist pieces viewed by Hitler as un-German or as Jewish.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In Bonn, works in Nazi Art Theft and its Consequences will go on display on Friday.Most of the art in the Bonn show is suspected of having been wrongfully taken by the Nazis from its Jewish owners and the ownership history of many pieces on display is not yet clear.Last week, researchers working with Project Gurlitt, the team of art historians and provenance researchers tasked by the German government with establishing the original ownership of works in the collection, identified a Thomas Couture painting as having belonged to Georges Mendel, a Jewish French politician.The work, Portrait of a Seated Young Woman, was the sixth to have been identified, thanks in part to the restoration team in Bonn, which was readying it for the exhibition.They noticed a barely detectable repaired hole in the canvas, at the level of the young womans chest, a detail which had been recorded in an initial claim filed after the end of the war.The fact that the researchers have been able, through their meticulous and unstinting work, to identify the painting by Thomas Couture as Nazi-looted art demonstrates once again how important it is not to let up in our efforts in the field of provenance research, Monica Grtters, Germanys culture minister said in a statement.News of the collections existence, first reported by Focus magazine in November 2013, spurred Germany to intensify efforts to establish provenance, following intense criticism for having kept the works secret for months after their initial discovery by tax authorities in February 2012.But three years after research efforts began, researchers had established the original ownership of only five works.The collection was hailed by art historians when it was found as the most important discovery of Nazi-looted art since the Allies discovered the hoards in the salt mines and the castles, and initial speculation placed its total value at more than $1 billion.As the reality of the scope and contents of the collection have become clear, the monetary value has been scaled back to hundreds of millions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rein Wolfs, director of the Kunstmuseum Bern, and Nina Zimmer, director of the Bundesdunsthalle, wrote in the catalog that accompanies the exhibition that they do not see the value of the collection in monetary terms.Rather, they wrote, it is an opportunity to pay homage to the people who became victims of the National Socialist art theft, as well as the artists who were defamed and persecuted by the regime as degenerate.
Kahlil Joseph’s New Film Is Steeped in Harlem’s History. And His Own.:::::Advertisement Kahlil Josephs New Film Is Steeped in Harlems History.And His Own.Image Kahlil Joseph at the Underground Museum in Los Angeles.Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times It was Kahlil Josephs brother who made him an artist.Or at least thats one way to describe how Mr. Joseph, a successful director who has worked with Kendrick Lamar and Beyonc, came to premiere his film Fly Paper at the New Museum this fall.An impressionistic collage of Harlems past and present, Fly Paper is being shown continuously in a new ground-floor gallery space at the museum as part of the exhibition, Kahlil Joseph: Shadow Play.The films title evokes one of Mr. Josephs critical influences: the photographer Roy DeCarava, renowned for his chiaroscuro images of Harlem life and culture.Mr. DeCarava, who died in 2009 , collected some of his photographs in a best-selling book, The Sweet Flypaper of Life (1955), with text by Langston Hughes.Image Two dancers, Storyboard P and Ben Vereen, in Kahlil Josephs film Fly Paper, now at the New Museum.Credit Courtesy of the artist Image Dancers, a 1956 photograph by Roy DeCarava.Credit via Estate of Roy DeCarava 2017 This New Museum show is Mr. Josephs first solo exhibition in New York.That would be a milestone for any artist but it may be especially significant because Mr. Joseph first showed his work in a gallery a mere three years ago.That was at the urging of his brother, Noah Davis , a contemporary artist who founded an influential exhibition space in Los Angeles called the Underground Museum.Mr. Joseph was a successful filmmaker at the time, directing music videos for artists like Flying Lotus , and was later nominated for an Emmy as one of the directors of Beyoncs visual album Lemonade.But in 2014, Mr. Joseph had just completed a 14-minute film that he couldnt release.It was based on work hed done for Mr. Lamar, after the release of his album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.Blending home video from Mr. Lamars family with original footage filmed in Compton, Calif., Mr. Joseph had made something new.But it was not a traditional music video, and Mr. Lamar was not interested in putting it out, Mr. Joseph, 36, recalled in a recent interview.Thats when Mr. Josephs brother advised him to turn it into an installation for the Underground Museum.Projected on two screens arranged in a V shape, the film, m.A.A.d, was a striking success, drawing a host of new visitors to the space.All of a sudden, Im a fine artist, Mr. Joseph said.All thanks to my brother.Image Mr. Josephs installation at the New Museum is his first exhibition in New York.Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times Among the transfixed viewers was Helen Molesworth, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.I literally drove back to the museum and put it on the schedule, she said.The films triumphant run at the Museum of Contemporary Art was followed by more work, including Lemonade and Music Is My Mistress , a project for the fashion house Kenzo.Then, last year, came the invitation from the New Museum: Could Mr. Joseph create a new film, a sort of New York-based companion piece to m.A.A.d.?For the first time in his career, Mr. Joseph faced a blank slate.There was no song, no album, no core material to draw on.But he quickly found that its impossible not to think about all your heroes and references when you write, he said.In addition to Mr. DeCarava, the photographer, Mr. Joseph drew on the work of Chris Marker, whose film Sans Soleil offers an extended meditation on memory and time.With Fly Paper, Mr. Joseph pays homage to a host of literary and cultural figures, splicing and mixing in references among its scenes of fictional characters.Some figures skate away, while others recur.Image Roy DeCaravas David (1953).Credit via Estate of Roy DeCarava 2017 Image A still from Fly Paper.Credit Courtesy of the artist The film builds in layers, with vrit footage from the street interspersed with elegant, vividly staged scenes.A woman places a handbag on a bed; an elegant gentleman (Ben Vereen) climbs a set of stairs, then reclines, fully dressed, in a bathtub.He visits an art gallery.He dances in an empty room and with the Brooklyn-born flex dancer Storyboard P .The soundtrack leaps, too.Music collides with the sounds of the city: drums, bass, an ambulance, a train.I wanted people to feel like they saw a Harlem that they cant see, Mr. Joseph said.You can take a tour bus around Harlem and see the exterior.His hunt for the heart of the neighborhood also shows the influence of Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, author of the 2011 book Harlem Is Nowhere (its title is from a 1948 essay by Ralph Ellison).The neighborhoods role as a capital of American culture, and exuberant celebration of African-American life is a voice in his work, which includes a passage read from Ms. Rhodes-Pittss book.But some of the ghosts are his own.A middle-aged man in an overcoat gets into a cab.Hes on a gurney, proceeding down a hospital hall.Hes in a chair, head shaved, a surgical scar circling one side of his skull, watching ESPN.That would be Mr. Josephs father, the sports and entertainment attorney Keven Davis, who lived in Harlem until his death in 2011 at 53 .That shock still reverberates for Mr. Joseph.I remember having no concept that my parents could ever pass away, he said.They seemed like these eternal experiences.The next shock came in 2015, when Noah, his brother, died at 32 .You think you have a lot of time with people, when youre young, Mr. Joseph said.Theyre going to live until theyre at least 70.Right?Image A still from Fly Paper, Kahlil Josephs film at the New Museum.Credit Courtesy of the artist It was a struggle to edit Fly Paper, because of its deeply personal nature, and only late in the process did Mr. Joseph decide to include footage of his family.Searching through video he had shot in 2011 during his fathers last months, he said, led to a wormhole, all this stuff that I totally forgot I shot, because I was in such automatic mode.Again, he was inspired by Mr. DeCaravas work, noting how the photographer included portraits of his wife and daughters in his 1996 MoMA retrospective , alongside his depictions of jazz greats like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis.He was able to not compartmentalize, Mr. Joseph said.Thats why I started to include my family.Thats my big reference to Roy.That was his big genius.The loss of his father and brother also contributed to the erosion of Mr. Josephs sense of time, he said a huge preoccupation for a filmmaker.Our understanding of time as linear is completely false, he said.In the film, its rarely clear whether everything is happening in the same period, across generations, or in a kind of eternal loop.Visitors at the New Museum show wander in, not knowing quite what to expect.But that kind of serendipity is fine with Mr. Joseph, who compared it to his youthful experience of flipping TV channels, only to happen across a movie in progress.The likelihood that I would finish the film was probably increased by coming in somewhere in the middle, not knowing where I am, he said.A sense of dislocation defines the film, which slips from one visual format to another from 35-millimeter color film to coruscating black-and-white to bleary hand-held video in a way that recalls the rapidly shifting frames of a dream.In the coda, just after the final shot of Mr. Josephs father, there is a sequence of video clips from the 1990s, highlights from the career of the former Detroit Lions star running back Barry Sanders, who abruptly retired before the 1999 season.Mr. Joseph warmly recalled that during his fathers final months they would bond over sports, and Mr. Sanders, a particular favorite.Ive always been drawn to the ballet-like nature of his specific play, Mr. Joseph said.He also praised the athletes decision to step away from the sport at the peak of his powers.It was like a Zen samurai principle thing, right?In the clips, which last a minute or so, the football star streaks across the field, again and again, a flash of joy that sharply contrasts with the painful hospital scenes.It may seem like a jarring shift in mood, but it is in keeping with the films essayistic form.I really love filmmaking, to be honest, Mr. Joseph said.More than plot.Kahlil Joseph: Shadow Play runs at the New Museum through Jan. 7;

Japanese Art, on Its Own Terms:::::How to prevent flattening cultural context while encouraging foreign audiences to embrace the unfamiliar?Ms. Hasegawa tackles that question in Japanorama.Having previously presented Japanese contemporary art in Brazil, Britain and Germany, she looked very carefully at the past 10-15 years: what was organized, what kind of Japanese contemporary art has been collected in public institutions in Europe.She continued: I want to bring awareness to context behind what people misunderstand, to the social commentary behind the works.Ms. Hasegawas vast and thoughtful synopsis encompasses six themes (called archipelagos) that bridge art, architecture, video, fashion and music.She porously connects movements and multimedia across two floors, with a mise-en-scne conceived by the Tokyo architects SANAA.(The Pompidou Center Metz itself was designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban).Photo The first section, Strange Object/Post-Human Body, confronts visitors with Electric Dress, a multicolored cluster of lights, created in 1956 by Atsuko Tanaka, that prefigures todays evolving relationship between the physical and the digital.The piece resonates with Comme des Garons garments on display, which present an alternative approach to Western ideas of beauty and body image.Transfigurations unfurl throughout this section: Ms. Hasegawa notes traumatic ideas about the atomic bomb and pollution-activated mutation in two very weird, very critical late 1960s cocoon pods by Tetsumi Kudo).New technology informs the work of the 80s collective Dumb Type, the techno-pop musical outfit Yellow Magic Orchestra and the programmers and artists behind Rhizomatiks.Rhizomatiks contributes a visualization of Bitcoins blockchain system rejigged according to live transactions, in a digital ballet that shows a forward-looking evolution of Japanese creativity.Within the Pop Art sphere, Ms. Hasegawa has highlighted works with a strong conceptual background and Japanese specificity.She wishes to undercut the way in which Japanese pop culture is often understood as sunny or silly: The graphic kitsch is, in fact, inherently critical, she says.Its vernacular but also very sophisticated, she added.The artist Takashi Murakamis work in this vein, is perhaps the most well-known, but it is also the most misunderstood.The painted smileys of his Cosmos are not just bright and fun the composition owes everything to 18th-century Edo paintings.His lesser-known Polyrhythm Red canvas, adorned with Tamiya soldier figurines, reflects, Ms. Hasegawa said, Japanese culture becoming childish, and a malaise about violence and vulnerability.Photo The exhibition also overturns the seeming navet of kawaii, Japans signature brand of cute, to reveal assertions of sociopolitical frustration.A 2002 kimono using Bingata, the traditional dyed fabric of Okinawa where the artist Yuken Teruya grew up, near a United States Army base is especially striking.The cheery flowers and trees on the garment are, upon closer inspection, composed of fighter planes and parachutes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The exhibition concludes with a section on Materiality and Minimalism, highlighting examples such as Hiroshi Sugimotos calm photographs of horizon lines and Ryoji Ikedas trancelike work based on numerical data.Its a landing, Ms. Hasegawa said of the exhibitions finale, to look at something sublime.Kohei Nawas breathtaking Force, an installation of viscous black silicone oil, which rains down without making a splash, appears soothing, but this is deceptive: Its subject is radioactive fallout.Like many works in Japanorama, it shows that simple does not mean straightforward, that beautiful things can contain disquieting fears.To grapple with these nuances requires being open to another perspective.In this sense, the shows most emblematic piece is by the artist Shimabuku.His video Then, I Decided to Give a Tour of Tokyo to the Octopus from Akashi, is as gently funny as it is affecting.He collects an octopus from his hometown and brings it to the metropolis on the bullet train takes it to the fish market, introduces it to another octopus there and eventually releases it back into the sea.Its a fitting narrative for visitors to the exhibition, who, at the end, are returned to their usual setting, more enlightened for having explored an unfamiliar territory.
A Provocative Museum Places African Art on the Global Stage:::::But some question the large sums spent on a private museum while the countrys public museums languish, as well as its location on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in South Africa the sprawling V & A Waterfront complex of shops and restaurants, much visited by tourists.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What they see inside is the representation of one mans taste in contemporary art although that man is not Mr. Zeitz.He is Mark Coetzee, the Cape Town-born curator who Mr. Zeitz hired to help him form the collection, and who is now the museums chief executive and director.Leading early visitors on a hard-hat tour of Zeitz MOCAA in the spring, Mr. Coetzee explained that its mission is cutting-edge contemporary, so the work is all made after 2000.He added that the focus was large-scale and in-depth: The one rule we made was to buy bodies of work.With very few exceptions, we have 40, 50, 60 pieces of every artist whose work we acquired.Photo A sampling can be seen in the opening exhibition, All Things Being Equal, which is mostly a demonstration of some of the museums headliners: Wangechi Mutu (Kenya), Zanele Muholi (South Africa), Chris Ofili (United Kingdom), Glenn Ligon of the United States, and El Anatsui (Ghana) whose bold installations made from bottle caps, aluminum, copper and other discarded materials of trade alludes to the scars of Africas colonial history.Mr. Coetzee, 53, has also staged early career retrospectives of the Zimbabwean-born artist/activist Kudzanai Chiurai and of the South African artist Nandipha Mntambo, known for her cowhide-covered human figures, molded from her own body.Outside of the white-cube galleries, in the soaring atrium, a giant rubber dragon made from tubing, multicolored ribbons and an animal skull, by the South African Nicholas Hlobo, references Xhosa myth.In the underground tunnels that transported grain, the photographer Edson Chagas has recreated the Angola Pavilion that won the Golden Lion award at the 2013 Venice Biennale.The prominence of photography and video in the collection Isaac Juliens nine-screen Ten Thousand Waves is also on display has drawn criticism.Mr. Coetzee said he was aware that there were imbalances, as well as omissions, but that the museum needs time to develop a comprehensive collection Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.Over breakfast recently in London, where Mr. Zeitz lives part of the year, he described meeting Mr. Coetzee in Miami in 2007 when the curator was working for the Rubell Family Collection.Puma SE sponsored Mr. Coetzees show, 30 Americans, featuring work by African-American artists of the last three decades.We had a pizza together and I asked him why artists from Africa are so little represented, and why there is no significant cultural institution in Africa.I said, why dont we do it?A year later they began forming a collection of contemporary African art.This is not a private collection that I purchased for myself, said Mr. Zeitz, 54, who looks more like a rumpled game ranger than a C.E.O.We collected on a scale that you wouldnt do privately because we always had the idea there would be a place somewhere in Africa where we would exhibit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Asked whether he had a budget, Mr. Zeitz laughed.I had to somehow still be able to pay my bills, he said.But no, there was no budget in mind.The mission, Mr. Coetzee said, was to allow Africans to tell their own story.He acknowledged that there were still large gaps in the collection.There are countries and areas where there are no art schools, no infrastructure and its hard, he said.Photo He added that another goal was to make the work accessible to people who didnt usually see art, with free entrance for visitors under 18 and, each Wednesday, for anyone with an African passport.Our public museums, through no fault of their own they have no money have not been accessible to people, even postapartheid, Mr. Coetzee said.What we have decided to do is to think very carefully about work that is experiential and evocative and really engages a broad spectrum of society.I do believe its possible to do that and still have brilliant work.Still, the tension between the founders philanthropic goals and the corporate reality is palpable.The museum sits in the newly developed Silo District at the Waterfront, which boasts apartment blocks, offices and shops.A luxury hotel (not designed by Mr. Heatherwick) sits above the museum itself.As The Guardian noted, For an institution that is trying to be open and accessible to all, its upstairs neighbor is a painful reminder of the extreme inequality that still racks this city a luxury playground for some, an impoverished slum for others more than two decades after apartheid.Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz looked at spaces in other parts of Africa for their museum.When David Green, the chief executive of the V & A Waterfront, approached them, it was actually ready made: They had a building and an architect; we had a collection, Mr. Coetzee said.Photo Mr. Heatherwick, though not a licensed architect, was well known internationally for the British pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, and his flaming caldron for Londons 2012 Olympics.(Several recent projects, including Pier 55, a $250 million project for Barry Diller along the Hudson River, and the Garden Bridge in London have since flamed out.)He had first visited the silo unused since 2001 10 years ago.I spent two days crawling through the silo, which had a monumental amount of bird poo, Mr. Heatherwick, 47, recalled in an interview at his spacious London headquarters near Kings Cross Station.Nothing came of a development idea the Waterfront had at the time, but I was fascinated by the place.The hollowed tubes were rubbish for showing art in, he noted, but it was so idiosyncratic, such a spectacular tube-tastic thing, that we felt we shouldnt knock this building down and land a modern art spaceship.He added, It felt like our role should be to amplify the power of that building.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A deal was struck: The V & A Waterfront would provide the building and pay for the renovation and Mr. Heatherwicks fees.Mr. Zeitz would give his collection as a lifetime loan, and contribute half to the initial costs of staffing and offices.The billionaire, who currently oversees a nonprofit foundation with Richard Branson to support the clean energy economy and the Zeitz Foundation for Intercultural Ecosphere Safety, will also provide an unspecified annual contribution for acquisitions over the next 10 years.The renovation budget of $37.6 million, is high for South Africa, but small compared to new museums internationally.Mr. Coetzee did not disclose the operating budget, but said it would be comparable to a midsize American museum.Photo Even before Zeitz Mocaa opened last month, dissenting voices were raised.In a 2015 article in Art Africa magazine, the journalist Matthew Blackman wrote an open letter to Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz, complaining that the collection reflected Mr. Coetzees tastes, rather than those of an acquisition committee with rigorous selection criteria.Another worry, he wrote, is the power of the museum to skew the choices made by local galleries, which he suggested are developing their stables purely to fit the buying habits of ZMocaa.Joost Bosland, a director of the Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town and Johannesburg, which represents Mr. Hlobo, Penny Siopis and Kemang Wa Lehulere (all are in Zeitz Mocaas collection) wrote in an email that while there was a basis of truth to this criticism, it was hard to predict what the new museums influence would be on the market for African art until its acquisition budget was known.However, the best African artists have a deep, global collector base, and it is hard to imagine a single actor determining the direction of their market.Most artists and gallerists contacted for this article were reluctant to voice their reservations about the museum on record, saying that they had too much at stake.Artists are criticizing it privately, but saying, how do I get my work into the museum?said Sue Williamson, a Cape Town-based artist who is currently part of a group show at Axis Gallery in New York.Mr. Coetzee said he and Mr. Zeitz had consulted extensively with museum curators around the world while building their collection and had tried to put protocols in place as fast as possible.We have boards of trustees and advisers, governance boards, 20 curators on staff, and two acquisition committees.He added, Do I have influence?I hope so.But I dont have a final say over what should be bought.Even where the issues simmer, however, reaction has so far been largely positive.I put the criticisms down to a very reductive identity politics, said Ashraf Jamal, the former editor of Art Africa magazine, referring to a tendency for Afro-centric art fairs to emphasize black empowerment rather than focus on the quality of the work.Its an international museum, its not a provincial or national concern, but people lose sight of that, Mr. Jamal added.Right now, the collection needs more painting and more sculpture; its dominated by photography and video art, but this is such a young initiative.Its a major phenomenon globally, and a heartfelt attempt to place the African aesthetic on the global stage.
Everyday Horrors: Art in the Age of Terror:::::Photo LONDON The artist James Bridle remembers the first time he heard of military drones.Back then, some seven years ago, it took intensive online searching to track down an image of one.As reports of drones as weapons of war and instruments of surveillance became more common, he wanted to understand them better.For him, they were an idea without a physical reality.Mr. Bridle found and downloaded the plans for a type of drone used by the United States Air Force and, using string and chalk, drew a full-size outline of the aircraft on the tarmac of the parking lot behind Bridles London studio.Seeing the form sketched out as if the drone were casting a full-scale shadow over an urban setting revealed that this previously unseen combat apparatus had a wingspan about the length of a bus.Photo As an artist, Mr. Bridle is interested in the relationship between the digital and physical world, in how the former changes the way we think about the latter.Drones are one of those technologies that seemed to go from science fiction to completely mundane without going through a critical-thinking stage, he said.It seemed to stand for so much: war, crime, violence and technology.He has since realized versions of the work, called Drone Shadow, in locations from Washington to Istanbul.The latest version of Drone Shadow falls across the atrium of the Imperial War Museum London as the first work in the exhibition Age of Terror: Art Since 9/11.Curated by Sanna Moore, the show explores how artists have responded to conflict since those calamitous events.Taking the attack on the World Trade Center as a cultural turning point, the exhibition reflects on the continuing state of emergency weve been in and how the world has changed: mass surveillance, civil rights, detentions without trial, Ms. Moore said.Photo The scale of Age of Terror the largest contemporary art exhibition ever staged by the Imperial War Museum reflects the increase in the number of artists responding to conflict in recent years, Ms. Moore said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The show opens with works that respond directly to Sept. 11 before moving on to consider how the attacks have permeated daily life, in the United States and beyond.Some began in the immediate aftermath: Tony Oursler started filming the footage used in his work 9/11 in Lower Manhattan soon after the second plane hit.The piece 9/12 Front Page by the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann assembles 151 newspaper covers from around the world from the following day, many carrying the same photograph.
Club 57, Late-Night Home of Basquiat and Haring, Gets a Museum-Worthy Revival:::::At any given time, the club was a dance hall, a screening room, a watering hole, a theater lab, an art gallery, or a self-styled let it all hang out encounter group, Ann Magnuson writes in MoMAs Club 57 exhibition catalog.Sometimes it was all those things at once.Photo That interdisciplinary spirit had painters making music, musicians making sculptures, sculptors acting in plays, and actors tossing their scripts in favor of improvised performances, or as Keith Haring called the evenings he organized, Acts of Live Art.Case in point: Min Thometz, a freshly arrived graduate of a high school in Minnesota, who began bartending at Club 57 when she wasnt also stepping out mid-shift to act in a play or perform in Pulsallama, an all-female 13-member percussion ensemble.We were all about being very silly at Club 57, she said in a recent phone interview, which made for a purposely stark contrast with the similarly artist-heavy crowd at TriBeCas Mudd Club, which was more about fashion, about being cool.We were about wearing costumes and having theme parties.Indeed, her own Bongo Voodoo party ended with dead chickens being flung around, a raging bonfire in the middle of the clubs floor, and her future husband Oliver Sanchez passing out on her turntables as she was D.J.-ing, a novel twist on a meet-cute story.Yet indoor fires and flying poultry were the least of the worries for a club that never had a liquor license.Letters from Mr. Strychackis archives show the Holy Cross parishs bishop, John Jakubik, tirelessly intervening on Club 57s behalf with a string of judges and government agencies.In 1981, when frustrated neighbors finally hired a lawyer to help shut down the club after repeated police summons for noise violations, Bishop Jakubik patiently informed him that Club 57 is the youth circle of our church Please try to understand that the East Village is not the best of areas and our parish hall is the only place where our youth can socialize under supervision.Photo Sleep-deprived neighbors on St. Marks Place werent the only ones fixating on Club 57.The art world was taking notice as well.New collectors began arriving, pumping money into a previously moribund market.With them came a burst of fresh galleries throughout the East Village a handful in 1981, over a hundred by 1985.The downtown art world, centered around academia and small government grants, had previously seemed separated by a chasm from free-spending buyers.No longer.As checkbooks opened and media attention skyrocketed, it suddenly looked like artists could have it all.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget what Jean-Michel said to me one night, Mr. Sanchez said, recalling a walk home from the club.Ill learn to draw later.First I want to get famous.His work was already good, but he was so astute in his strategy.His plan was to charm his way into the right circles.And it absolutely worked!There was this mad rush to cash in, Mr. Scharf said.It stopped being as fun as people became competitive with each other.He includes himself.For the 1983 Whitney Biennial, Keith and Jean-Michel were in it, and I wasnt.Which freaked me out!Part of his solution was a pre-internet social media campaign: I started spray painting my Hanna-Barbera post-nuclear-holocaust mutant characters like Wilma Flintstone with a snake body all up and down the East Side, from the 59th Street Bridge to the East Village.I had no idea who the curators for the 1985 Whitney Biennial were, but I figured they would at least know my work.
Yves Bouvier Sells His Geneva-based Art Storage Company:::::Photo Yves Bouvier has sold off his familys Geneva-based art storage and transport company, a business that has been one of the largest tenants of the freeport there and one that helped him become a high-profile figure in the international art market.Franco Momente, the director of the company, Natural Le Coultre, confirmed the sale Friday.No price was disclosed.Mr. Bouvier, who is Swiss, made his reputation as a businessman involved with freeports, the largely tax-free storage depots where wealthy collectors now store so many of their treasures.In addition to operating in Geneva, where his storage spaces have been filled with many of the worlds most famous and expensive masterpieces, he also opened new facilities in Luxembourg and Singapore where his businesses continue to operate.Photo But in the past few years Mr. Bouvier has been battling legal cases in courtrooms in Monaco, Paris, Singapore and New York, and has likely been facing mounting legal bills as part of that effort.
Wartime Quilts Honor Battles and Leaders, but Mostly Art:::::Photo Theres plenty of visual heat to be had in New Yorks galleries and museums this fall, but nowhere more than at the American Folk Art Museum.The radiance shines forth from the bold geometries in War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts From Military Fabrics.This ravishing exhibition features 29 sturdy, intricate wartime quilts dating from the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars and also the British colonies, made by soldiers, sailors or regimental tailors in Europe or India.The military fabrics used here are scraps of soldiers uniforms, that is, felted wool in strong, clear colors: predominantly red, black, cream and gold.The show initially resembles an array of extra-large game boards, and the checkered center of one quilt was indeed intended for playing chess, another pastime of enlisted men.Photo The exhibition reminds us that while war is never less than hell, some of its byproducts can be breathtaking and, in their soul-nurturing beauty, the very antithesis of war.But these textiles are also freighted with patriotism, male bonding and commemoration.In addition, wartime quilts were sometimes a means of behavior modification.In Britain at least, quilting was encouraged by the military and temperance organizations alike; they gave idle hands something to do between military engagements, staving off the temptations of drink and gambling.They also occupied the time of wounded soldiers recovering in military hospitals and prisoners of war.Some were made for families back home, others to be sold and a few by orderlies as gifts for their commanding officers.Photo With their pulsating squares, diamonds and triangles of color, these works attest to the expansiveness of geometry, as well as its use in flags, banners and coats of arms.The unusual quatrefoil motifs of some individual quilt blocks are based on the four-pronged footprint of battlements known as star forts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Interspersed among their patterned borders and fields are beaded crowns, embroidered portraits of monarchs, and dedications to siblings.A quilt made by Samuel Sadlowski, a tailor in the Prussian Army taken prisoner during the Napoleonic Wars, is dated 1806; it includes among its many fort blocks, a lovely pastoral frieze in appliqu illustrating the folk tale of a goose-stealing fox pursued by a hunter.In a quilt from 1766, the central medallion features profile portraits of King George III and Queen Charlotte of Britain, but perhaps most riveting is the thick border distinguished by large appliqu blocks with propeller-like designs.Photo Some quilts are influenced by cultures under occupation, especially Britains greatest colony, India, where tailors sometimes outlined the composition with rows of tiny glass beads, to spectacular effect.
After a Late Start, an Artist’s Big Break: Michelle Obama’s Official Portrait:::::The Obama commission is likely to catapult her into another league.There is going to be a spotlight on her, said Paul Staiti, a professor at Mount Holyoke College who is an expert on portraiture.She should fasten her seatbelt.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A tall, athletic woman in white-framed glasses who lives with her Pekingese-Jack Russell terrier, named August Wilson, Ms. Sherald said she is not allowed to speak about the commission until it is unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery early next year.Nor would Mrs. Obama comment.Kim Sajet, the Portrait Gallerys director, would only divulge that Mrs. Obama and Ms. Sherald have already met about the portrait, that the paintings typically involve multiple sittings and that this years subjects chose the artists from about 20 portfolios submitted by the curators.The first lady has to personally approve the finished work, as does the Portrait Gallerys advisory board.Photo The Smithsonian plans to pay for both works with $500,000 in private donations of which $300,000 has been raised so far.This amount covers everything including each artists fees, which Ms. Sajet would not specify.Ms. Sheralds paintings typically sell for $15,000 to $25,000.There is no prescribed format for an official portrait, Ms. Sajet said, except that it be a painting not a work on paper and that the artists be respectful of both the person and the position they hold.Official portraits have ranged from highly formal to much more relaxed, Ms. Sajet added, citing as examples Ron Sherrs 1994 portrait of George H. W. Bush standing in a suit and tie at the White House and Robert Andersons 2008 likeness of George W. Bush in an open-collared shirt on a couch at Camp David.The selection of Ms. Sherald, who typically depicts African-Americans doing everyday things two women in bathing suits, a man holding a child has historical significance.Its as if shes saying, Lets be clear: the President and I are African Americans and proudly so, Mr. Staiti said, and these portraits are going to have an African-American vibe theyre going to break out of that rather staid tradition.I think its important and I think its political, he added, referring to Mrs. Obamas choice.Photo While Ms. Sherald could not discuss her interactions with Mrs. Obama, the way she generally works offers clear insights into her likely process with the former first lady.She invites her subjects to her studio here, where she photographs them in an outfit she has selected for them.Or, she said, she may go to their homes to shop from their closets and photograph them there.Ms. Sherald always shoots her subjects outdoors with natural light.I like the way it highlights the textures of the skin, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The commission represents something of a departure for Ms. Sherald; she usually chooses subjects who arrest her attention on the street, in an airport.She literally approaches strangers.I would wonder how shed feel about this leading to commissions of other prominent people, Mr. Staiti said.Shes interested in the exact opposite; shes interested in ordinariness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.Ms. Sherald said how much the selection means to her, how Mrs. Obama loomed large in her life, though they had not previously met.Weve been on a first-name basis for eight years, she said jokingly.Seeing her made my world better.Shes an archetype that a lot of women can relate to no matter shape, size, race or color, Ms. Sherald added.We see our best selves in her.Ms. Sherald has yet to start the Obama portrait, though it is due to be finished by years end.Im not going home for the holidays, she said with a laugh.Yet sitting among her paint tubes their colors smeared on paper plates with three canvases-in-progress leaning against the walls, Ms. Sherald seemed remarkably calm in the face of such a daunting deadline, perhaps because she has confronted far tougher challenges.Photo Ms. Sherald is a survivor of congestive heart failure, diagnosed at age 30 just as she was earning her masters degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art and was training for a triathlon.She received a transplant at 39.She interrupted her career again, taking a four-year break to care for two ailing relatives back in her hometown Columbus, Ga.

El Museo del Barrio to Close for Several Months During Renovations:::::Photo El Museo del Barrio, the countrys oldest museum devoted to Latino art, announced on Tuesday that it will close its exhibition galleries and theater for several months as part of a planned renovation.The galleries will close starting Monday, Nov. 6, and reopen in the summer of 2018, the museum said.Its theater, El Teatro, will be closed until the fall of 2018.El Museo has scheduled two off-site exhibitions during the renovations.We are confident that the planned renovations and upgrades will enable El Museo del Barrio to provide visitors an improved experience and ultimately address its structural needs as a growing museum, Patrick Charpenel, the executive director, said.As a part of a city-owned building, these proposed upgrades have been in the pipeline for some time, and we are excited for the expanded opportunities in exhibition and rentals that these improvements will bring.The museum was started in a public school classroom in 1969 by artists and activists who wanted to emphasize Puerto Rican cultural contributions.But the museums mission has expanded since then, and its collection now includes a wide range of art from the Caribbean and the Americas.Since 1978 it has occupied more than 6,500 square feet inside a building at Fifth Avenue between 104th and 105th Street.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The organization has faced difficulties recently even as it has mounted well-received exhibitions.Financial problems have forced staff cuts, and the museum went from being open six days a week to five.Since 2010, El Museo has cycled through three directors as well as other senior executives.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The closings are one of the first major decisions announced since Mr. Charpenel, a curator from Mexico, took over in September.Renovations to galleries will include upgraded heating and air-conditioning systems and a new glass entryway.A new mechanized lift for the 564-seat theaters orchestra pit will be put in along with updated lighting equipment, and hand-painted murals there will be cleaned and restored.
At 90, Still Raising the Bar for Himself — and the Other Guys:::::The painting Golden Image, I never did anything like it.It was a sunset in Maine.I usually paint the sensation of what Im seeing.Here, Im actually painting the analysis of it, all memory.I made four or five little sketches in different colors.I lost any discernability of which one was better.I said to Ada, Which one do you like?She said the yellow one.I heightened the colors.Theres very little tonal difference [between the trees and the sky].It sort of merges.I took it right up to 12 feet.It came out like dynamite.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This portrait of a disembodied face against the vivid yellow background also feels new to me.I was painting this woman [Susanne Orton, in the portrait behind Mr. Katz, top, on the left] and all of a sudden I said, Im sick and tired of white.I just arbitrarily put the lemon yellow against the flesh, like an Indian combination.Then I kept cropping it and made it a less conventional, more aggressive image.You can get the whole feeling with parts missing.Do you consider yourself a collector?Im not a collector type, actually.I throw everything out.But when I started making money, I thought I should buy some stuff for the education.Since Ive been around for so long, it adds up.Photo Thats a [Francis] Picabia.His work always fascinated me because hes such a lousy painter technically and such a great artist.I have a late piece from the 1940s when he went into kitschy figurative stuff.His image energy is fantastic, a lot of bounce.What was an early acquisition?I got this [Willem] de Kooning drawing from around 1959 from his gallery.Hes like the opposite of my temperament, but hes a really good draftsman.He supported me when I had my first big show.He came over and said, Your paintings are like photographs, but theyre painted; dont let them knock you out of your position.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.You share a Maine connection with Marsden Hartley.Was that part of your interest in collecting him?Hes able to make you see what he saw.When I moved out to where I am now in Maine, it was three miles from the shore.I didnt want to go near his subject matter; its too dominating.I got [Hands] at an auction.[The collector] Sandy Schwartz said, You cant bid.I said, O.K., when you run out of your money, use mine.So I got it.This Matisse drawing of a woman reminds me of the economy of line in your work.I like his thin paint and the effortless way he paints and gets so much out of it.He and the Impressionists see the world with golden eyes.They dont do garbage pails and people suffering.Do you have an affinity for that kind of outlook?Yeah, no sad songs.No minor key.Not for me.
Construction Delays Sink British Museum’s Deal With Abu Dhabi:::::Photo LONDON Delays in the construction of the Norman Foster-designed Zayed National Museum in Abu Dhabi means that an agreement with British Museum which was to help curate exhibitions and lend the new institution around 500 valuable artifacts is unlikely to be realized.Although a report in The Art Newspaper on Saturday said that the British Museum and the Zayed National Museum had terminated their 10-year deal, signed in 2009, a spokeswoman from the British Museum said that the agreement had not ended, and that the contract would run until 2019.But since construction has not yet begun on the Zayed museum, the loan is unlikely to take place within the framework of the existing contact, the spokeswoman, Hannah Boulton, said.As the Zayed Museum focuses on building up its own collection over the next several years, she added, the British Museum does not anticipate lending objects within the current contract period, but loans could be discussed at a later date.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Zayed Museum, originally scheduled to open in 2013, is part of the Saadiyat island development that includes outposts of the Louvre and the Guggenheim.Under the original partnership agreement, the British Museum was to receive fees for the long-term loan of some of its holdings, which had not yet been formally specified.
‘So Long, Bobby’: New Exhibit Looks Back at Robert Kennedy’s Funeral Train:::::Photo Museums often organize exhibitions celebrating the anniversary of the birth or death of major artists.The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is taking a slightly different tack next spring.To mark the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy 50 years ago, the museum has organized The Train: RFKs Last Journey, an unconventional blend of historical photographs and cutting-edge projects.Photo On March 17, 2018, the museum will put on view its recently acquired portfolio of 26 large color prints taken by a Magnum photographer, Paul Fusco, now 87.On June 8, 1968, working for Look magazine, Mr. Fusco rode the train carrying the body of Kennedy from New York City, where it had lain at St. Patricks Cathedral, to Washington, D.C., where the former attorney general was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.Photo The trip between the two cities, usually four hours, took eight because thousands of distraught men, women and children, many holding American flags and signs reading, So long, Bobby, lined the tracks to pay their respects.Mr. Fusco took more than 1,000 photographs.Photo A few years ago, when Rein Jelle Terpstra, a Dutch photographer, noticed that lots of people in Mr. Fuscos prints were holding cameras, he decided to track down some of them.After crowd sourcing on Facebook as well as contacting local churches and community centers, he found dozens of people who still had scrapbook photographs, snapshots in attic boxes and amateur movies of the funeral train as it passed by.Photo Also inspired by Mr. Fuscos portfolio, the French conceptual artist Philippe Parreno went the re-enactment route, renting a train and dressing people like the onlookers in Mr. Fuscos photographs.Mr. Parennos 70 mm, high-definition film is seven minutes long.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Clement Cheroux, the senior curator of photography at the museum, told me, This multidisciplinary exhibition mixing still and moving images, historical and contemporary works, vernacular material and high art is exactly the type of show I am interested in promoting at SFMoMA.
A Watch Brand by and for Millennials:::::The business is built on a simple, if implicit, premise: Young adults, with their do-everything smartphones and tablets, may not need another device to help them navigate their daily existence.But they care deeply about any image enhancer that helps them pop on Instagram.It seems to have worked.Company research shows that 88 percent of its customers are under 34 years old, and 45 percent are under 24.The belief that traditional watches are relics of the past is false, Mr. Kassan said.Our consumers may not be not the most formal in their attire, but they are very intentional.They think about what they wear, about what is on trend and up-to-date.That may be ripped jeans and a T-shirt, but its not a baggy T-shirt with stains on it.Photo A watch, he said, is their statement piece.The partners, who met in Santa Barbara, Calif., after leaving college, each had tried his hand at e-commerce and crowdfunding ventures, with middling success.While neither was what you would call a watch obsessive, both considered them important fashion accessories, but had a hard time finding a brand to fit their style sensibility and budget.You had Nixon, which is very action-sports oriented skater, surfer, Mr. Kassan said.You had Michael Kors, which was too blingy.Many so-called entry-level brands were priced at $400 or $500, a stretch when youre barely able to make rent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They sought to create the kind of watch that they would want to buy.In an era of H & M-style fast fashion, they sought to produce watches that were head-turning, but also inexpensive enough that you could buy four or five.The strategy was to keep costs under $200 by selling directly to consumers online, eliminating the standard retail markup, and relying on social media for marketing.As the company has grown, however, it has begun selling in stores, like Nordstrom, advertising on radio and television, and has also expanded into sunglasses.The original Mvmt line, which was introduced on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform, was tastefully designed.Watch geeks will draw obvious parallels to minimalist Swiss classics like the Movado Museum Dial series and the IWC Portofino, which are far more expensive.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.The Mvmt watches delivered sleek, hyper-minimalist design for prices that were roughly in line with the average monthly cellphone bill, and had, as they say, great branding.(Prices now range from $95 to $180).Timekeeping, clearly, was not the point.Mvmt watches largely did away traditional functional design elements, like numerals for hour markers, or luminescent hands.To set itself apart in the sea of under-$200 fashion watches, Mvmt positioned itself as an Instagram-first watch company.Its Instagram feed for its mens line, for example, which has more than 855,000 followers, is a cornucopia of F.O.M.O.-inducing shots of stylish young lovelies cavorting in exotic locales wearing cool watches.And while the company experimented with celebrity endorsements, including Kylie Jenner and Klay Thompson, it seemed to find its footing with a social media star known largely to other millennials: Sam Kolder, a globe-trotting young videographer and thrill seeker with 585,000 Instagram followers and great abs.Our whole thing is, Dress with intent, live with purpose, Mr. Kassan said.He scales buildings and scuba dives with sharks.But hes not going to five-star resorts.Hes just doing something everyone can do.And wearing a watch that everyone can wear.
Manhattan Gallery’s Squeaking Floor Angers Rodent Lovers:::::The interaction was the result of a campaign that has emerged since animal activists took notice of the monthlong exhibit, Prehysteria, which opened on Oct. 19.And it has sent the four-year-old space, Castle Fitzjohns Gallery, into the same cross hairs of controversy recently trained on more venerable institutions: This fall, the Guggenheim pulled exhibits involving live animals, including lizards and insects, from an installation called Theater of the World by the Chinese conceptual artist Huang Yong Ping, where the penned animals vied for survival.The gallery has been inundated with negative online comments, as well as haranguing phone calls from as far away as Europe.The owner, Vincent Harrison, said the public response had revealed the challenges of weighing criticism against artistic repression, not to mention the well-being of a bunch of rodents.Photo Bothering people, causing conflicting emotions, to me is part of my job as an artist, Mr. Grazi said.He said he often calls out what he sees as the hypocrisy of treating, say, an eagle better than a chicken in his art.Everywhere I walk there is some barbaric rat trap, or some sign that says, We are currently poisoning rats, but nobody cares because they are out of sight, out of mind, he added.Here the only problem is that they are the opposite: They are in sight, in mind.Mr. Grazi, 33, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, created the mouse-tiled floor installation, called The Social Network, as a commentary on the isolation endemic in social media.Arranged like a chessboard, each tile is roughly a square foot and contains a tiny dish of water, a stick, some food pellets and a little white mouse with red eyes sitting on black sand.On Sunday afternoon, children jumped from square to square, playing hopscotch atop the mice, as the structure creaked.In their little boxes, the mice did mice things, chewing wood or sitting stock-still in tightly knotted poufs.They scrabbled at the clear ceiling, gnawed at the air holes drilled in the top of each box, and tried to shove pink, whiskered noses through the ports.The mice are all available for adoption, and three have been adopted.Those who are not claimed will be fed to Mr. Grazis pet ball python, Mr.Clip.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In September, the Guggenheim announced the live animals would not be shown, out of concern for the safety of its staff, visitors and participating artists, and said that it was dismayed at the attack on freedom of expression.Mr. Grazi said he would consider modifying the piece if he were concerned about animal welfare, but never shutting it down.This week, he will add little hideaways to the terrariums, so the mice have a place to duck into and hide from the shadows above, he said.That did little to satisfy Nicole Hall, an animal activist who lives in Hells Kitchen and arrived at the gallery on Sunday to voice her distaste.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont think that living beings should be considered as art, said Ms. Hall, 47, who works at a rabbit rescue center in Connecticut.Hundreds of years ago, Africans, people from other countries were actually art installations, said Ms. Hall.Now, as we have moved away from that, we look back at that and say, How hideous were we?
Ancient Limestone Relief Is Seized at European Art Fair:::::The bas-relief is the latest in a string of antiquities the Manhattan district attorneys office has seized from art dealers and museums in New York City as part of a concerted effort in recent years to recover ancient works.Those seizures have been led by the assistant district attorney Matthew Bogdanos, a classics scholar and colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve who played an important role in recovering antiquities stolen in Iraq during the fall of Saddam Hussein.The district attorneys office declined to comment on the evidence underpinning the search warrant.The possible charge listed on the papers is possession of stolen property.No one had been arrested in connection with the seizure on Sunday evening.Photo Experts on artifacts from Persepolis say the bas-relief was first excavated in 1933 by a team of archaeologists from the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.It appears in photographs of the site taken as late as 1936.The Persian government passed a law in 1930 making it illegal to transport such antiquities out of the country.An Iranian cultural official, Ebrahim Shaqaqi, told the Tehran Times the bas-relief had been stolen from Persepolis decades ago prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Legal follow-ups are underway to first prove that the relic belongs to Iran and finally repatriate it, said Mr. Shaqaqi, who is the director of legal affairs at the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Wace said the relief was donated to a Canadian museum in the early 1950s by Frederick Cleveland Morgan, the heir to a Canadian department store fortune who was an art collector and philanthropist.The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts displayed the work until 2011, when it was stolen.Three years later, the Canadian authorities recovered it from a collector in Edmonton and returned it to the museum, according to CBC News.But the curators opted to keep the insurance money and let the AXA Insurance Company take possession.Mr. Wace said he acquired the piece from the insurance company and believed its provenance was legitimate.Several dealers in ancient art at the fair, known as TEFAF, said they assumed the bas-relief was one of dozens of artifacts that had been taken from the Persepolis site in the 19th century, long before it became illegal.But Lindsay Allen, an expert on Persepolis at Kings College London, said fewer artifacts were smuggled out in the 19th century than many dealers believe.The number taken out of the country surged in the late 1920s, just before the Iranian government outlawed their exportation.In the 1930s, very few pieces left Iran, she said, beyond the items the government agreed to allow the Oriental Institute in Chicago to take for its collection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The bas-relief is an eight-inch-square piece of carved limestone that was part of a long line of soldiers depicted on a balustrade at the central building on the Persepolis site.It dates to the Achaemenid dynasty the First Persian Empire and was made sometime between 510 and 330 B.C., when Persepolis was sacked by Alexander the Great.
Fragments and Elephants: Howard Hodgkin’s Eclectic Art Collection Is Sold:::::Sothebys presale exhibition recreated the ambience of Mr. Hodgkins studio and home in the Bloomsbury district of London, allowing people to see the relationships between the artists vibrant paintings and prints and the Indian miniatures, Turkish tiles, Persian carpet fragments and other antiques that surrounded him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hes unique, said the London-based artist Nicholas Hatfull, 33, at the preview, describing Mr. Hodgkins art.Hes a sort of English Cy Twombly.No other artist has his depth of color, or warmth, he added, referring to the American abstract painter, who was also a collector.By any measure, Mr. Hodgkin had unusually eclectic taste, beyond the comfort zone of many of todays investment-minded collectors.This was duly reflected in what was, in pure financial terms, a relatively modest return for a lifetime of collecting.The final total of $6.8 million was less than a tenth of the current auction high for a single painting by Mr. Twombly.Photo Had Mr. Hodgkin collected international contemporary art or held on to more of his own paintings an early 1980s Hodgkin sold at Christies earlier this month for $2.2 million that total would have been far higher.Proceeds would also have been boosted if the sale had included the artists renowned holdings of museum-quality Indian miniatures.Comprising some 130 drawings, the collection is being treated as a separate, single entity and will be available for sale privately at a price to be decided after the auction, according to Mr. Peattie.However, Sothebys auction did include two paintings by Mr. Hodgkin from the 1960s that he had retained.These earlier, more figurative works are not from the most coveted phase of the artists career, as was borne out by the below-estimate 248,750, or about $330,000, given by a British private collector for Bedroom (1960-61), and the failure of Travelling (1961) to attract any bids.But 20 proofs of prints by Mr. Hodgkin all soared above their estimates, led by a 32,500 (about $43,000) offer given by a bidder in the room for a proof of the large blue-and-white Frost (2000-2).Photo The prices of the prints were three or four times retail, said the London-based dealer Offer Waterman.But we werent treated to any of his first-rank paintings.They were transitional works.The most hotly contested artwork at the auction was instead the 1972 painting De-Luxe Tailors by the Indian modernist painter Bhupen Khakhar, who was a friend of Mr. Hodgkins.The bidding on this piece, which shows two tailors in their shop, soared to 1.1 million, or about $1.4 million, three times the estimate and an auction high for the artist.Sweet Bowl, the much-admired 1966 painting by the British artist Patrick Caulfield, also a lifelong friend, was another standout lot, selling for 524,750, or about $690,000.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The commercial appeal of the collection was further complicated by Mr. Hodgkins enthusiasm for fragments rather than objects in complete condition.Fragments were more potent than entire panels, because they freed the imagination, explained Mr. Peattie in his catalog foreword.These included a fragment of 17th-century Persian carpet, formerly owned by the legendary collector Robert von Hirsch, which sold for 224,750, or about $295,000.But there were also items like the bottom half of a 13th-century Persian Kashan luster pottery tile that failed to sell against a low estimate of 2,000, or about $2,600.In all, 14 percent of the lots were left unsold, a relatively high figure for the collection of a prominent private individual.Photo And then there were the elephants, featured in at least 40 of the Indian drawings included in the sale.Mr. Hodgkin regarded Rajasthans Kota-style portraits of elephants in particular as my downfall my Waterloo as a collector, according to the catalog.Yet all but one of his elephant drawings sold, with a Kota image of an elephant stampede from the late 18th or early 19th century selling for 32,500, more than 20 times the estimate.In the pure financial terms of the top end of the auction market, the sale of Mr. Hodgkins collection could not be regarded as serious or important.Yet the connoisseurial refinement and curiosity of Mr. Hodgkins taste served as a timely reminder of just how homogeneous the buying habits of todays investment-minded collectors have become.Last month Artnet News revealed that in the first six months of this year just 25 artists (Twombly comes in at No.5) accounted for almost half the $2.7 billion of sales at the worlds contemporary art auctions.During that same period, premodern works represented just 17 percent of the global auction turnover of fine art, according to a report published by Artprice, the lowest share yet recorded by the French website.It was a wonderful old-fashioned collection, said Ted Few, a London-based dealer, who bought a 17th-century German lime-wood relief sculpture for 1,500, or about $2,000, at the Hodgkin sale.Its very different from so many of todays collections.People are obsessed with specializing and are much more minimal in their approach.Admittedly, Mr. Hodgkin became wealthy enough not to have to worry about overspending on Indian drawings of elephants.But in todays finance-obsessed times, collectors have become much more reluctant to lose money and a lot less curious about art history.As a result, the wealthy now buy art like Mr. Hodgkin used to read Agatha Christie novels.They always begin at the end.
A Dutch Treasure Trove Returns to New Amsterdam:::::The European Fine Art Fair, known as TEFAF and held every March in the southern Dutch city of Maastricht, had a reputation for stability: the same dealers year after year, bringing their choicest paintings, furniture, and diamond brooches to a well-heeled collector base.But a roiling art market, and increasingly eclectic tastes, led the Dutch fair to set out for New York and to establish a pair of satellite events, spring and fall, that brought the gentility of Maastricht to a new American crowd.The autumn fair, whose second edition opens this weekend at the Park Avenue Armory, stretches from the dawn of time to around World War I.Even if youre not in the market for Flemish tapestries, Chinese porcelain or a mourning angel by Antonio Canova, the 95 exhibitors here offer a bounty of surprises for connoisseurs and amateurs alike.And a mini-show of pinhole photography by Vera Lutter, displayed by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, brings this showcase of the past right up to the present day.Here are a few prizes that caught my eye during a preview.CHARLES EDE Photo TEFAF includes a hefty sampling of Greek and Roman art, but this London dealer has brought something older and from further afield: a Persian rhyton, or ceremonial drinking vessel, that dates to around 1000 BC.The terra cotta vessel takes the shape of a zebu bull, and though it would have served a ritual purpose, its simplified forms curve with the easy elegance that Picasso would lavish on bovines nearly 3,000 years later.Hundreds of decorative scratches run from his horns to his hindquarters, and two metal earrings, on either side of the vessels spout, make this an uncommonly punk antiquity.VANDERVEN ORIENTAL ART Photo Within a diverse and sumptuous display of Chinese porcelain and statuary, this Dutch specialist gallery has brought an alluring pair of Tang dynasty stone lokapalas, or tomb guardians.These sentries between this world and the next wear ornate body armor frond-shaped helmet crests and flaming epaulets and raise their legs to stomp on ill-fated evil ghouls.Now they appear the color of coral, but look closely at their breastplates and spaulders, and you can still see traces of green and red paint that would have made these sentinels appear even more fearsome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story DANIEL CROUCH RARE BOOKS Photo In the late 18th century, about a thousand years after an anonymous Chinese sculptor carved those tomb guardians, the mapmaker Huang Qianren completed a stunning map of the world for the Qianlong Emperor.The edition here, more than seven feet long and printed in a brilliant blue, depicts the Middle Kingdom as a dynamic network of cities and town hooked up by waterways, and cradled by bumpy seas.China takes up nearly all the surface of this world map, and the Qing dynastys trading partners of Britain and the Netherlands are nearly forgotten in a corner; for this mapmaker, as for his imperial patron, anything beyond China barely counted as civilization at all.
Art and Museums in NYC This Week:::::Photo Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon.DRAWN TO GREATNESS: MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION, at the Morgan Library & Museum (through Jan. 7).This major group drawing show constitutes a grand summing-up of a career, of an art form and of an institutions holdings.During the past 60 years, the New York art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare Eddy Thaw, amassed a phenomenal drawing collection notable for its chronological breadth, running from the early Renaissance to the near present.This year they gave more than 400 items outright to the Morgan, expanding and deepening its range.The 150 works on view include a super-rare Andrea Mantegna, an unearthly Samuel Palmer and a soulful Vincent Van Gogh.(Holland Cotter) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org LAUREN GREENFIELD: GENERATION WEALTH at the International Center of Photography (through Jan. 7).They that will be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, warns the Book of Timothy.For 25 years, this Beverly Hills-born photographer has been shooting brand-obsessed, money-addled Americans rich and poor alike whose moral rot is expressed through hot-pink Birkin bags, Versace-upholstered furniture and McMansions the size of a small principality.The result is a tasteless show for a tasteless time.Some of Ms. Greenfields photographs have a moral passion that exceeds distaste.But most of these shots are dismissive and shallow, and imply that vulgarity is a greater crime than economic unfairness.(Jason Farago) 212-857-0000; icp.org THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975 at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22).In contrast to the stately PBS series The Vietnam War, this jammed exhibition delivers historical data, and a lot of it, quick-and-dirty, through labels, film clips, audio bytes and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art.Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, theres graffiti-style drawing on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in the form of album covers and protest posters.Words and images work together in illustrated murals labeled Home Front and War Front that put you right in the middle of the wars primary issues and events.(Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org AI WEIWEI: GOOD FENCES MAKE GOOD NEIGHBORS at Washington Square Park, Doris C.

J.C.C. Manhattan Gets $20 Million Gift and Jenny Holzer Artwork:::::Photo The J.C.C.Manhattan on the Upper West Side will be renamed the Marlene Meyerson J.C.C.in honor of a $20 million gift from the Meyerson Family Foundation, which is believed to be one of the largest donations ever made to a Jewish Community Center in the United States.The foundation which made the donation in the name of Marlene Meyerson, a philanthropist who died earlier this year has also commissioned a site-specific artwork for the J.C.C.by Jenny Holzer.Photo To create the installation, the J.C.C.will ask its members over the next several months to share their own words or quotes by others that address the question: What does community mean?Ms. Holzer will choose a handful of these to chisel onto marble benches and stone plaques throughout the building on Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street.Ms. Holzer will also incorporate hundreds of other such word contributions into a virtual piece of art that will map the buildings interior and exterior, as well as an augmented-reality smartphone app that will allow users to see the words as if they, too, were actually engraved.The artwork will be unveiled at a naming ceremony in the spring.The naming rights will revert to the J.C.C.in 30 years.Ms. Meyersons daughter, Marti, has supported the J.C.C.for more than 20 years as a founder, board chairwoman and as an active member.The building opened in 2002.This gift enables us to secure our foundation, said Joy Levitt, the J.C.C.s executive director.Were going to begin now to talk with our community about what their dreams are for the next 15 years.
The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age:::::In the kitchen, the appliances are hidden in twin blue cabinets; the faucet and sink have been powder-coated the same hue.In the airy front room, the low-slung sectional sofa is nothing more than blue vinyl cushions topped with blue cotton pillows.The adjacent blue coffee table is one of the three-legged stainless steel pieces, 1 on 2 and 2 on 1, for which Nuriev is known, and which are sold by Not So General in West Hollywood.In the dining room, there are six chairs of the same color and design where one leg is an arch that ingeniously doubles as the back set around a long, blue-flecked marble table.In both the dining room and the kitchen hang pendant lamps Nuriev created out of blue-capped Bic pens.Why these particular pens?he asks rhetorically.First of all, all Soviet kids had pens like these in school.Second, its my color.Advertisement Continue reading the main story MANY OF US, lets admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media.Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind.But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place thats actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture.Nurievs apartment is certainly photogenic he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness.That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus.Even as his apartment serves as his showroom its not like a website where you go and see pictures, he says.Its honest.For Nuriev, honesty that intangible virtue is fundamental to good design.This sofa, he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, its pure function, but its still beautiful.His goal when designing a room, he says, is to leave only whats only useful.He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a machine for living.These are often the references for Nurievs cohort of global minimalists, even if they dont always realize it.So many people are riffing on things they dont know about, says Patrick Parrish, Nurievs New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins.Harrys not like that.He knows exactly what hes referencing.Photo Photo This style, in part, follows last decades midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting.Its also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration.Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, theyve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Margs apartment.And then theres the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, dont require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because it was very classic Roman, Italian, Greek, and he wanted to figure out how to use it in real life, to make it sexy.He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, it looked weird.The pink, likewise, looked girlish, and people would ask him why he was using it.Its not that everybody copied me, he says.Its just that I sensed something.Whats difficult to spot are references to Nurievs Russian upbringing, but theyre in fact there, if quietly.On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls the Patti Smith of Russia.Above the sofa, hes taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhoods Russian Orthodox Church: In Russia, he says, its as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.
Murakami Balances Modernity and Tradition in Boston:::::Times journalists around the world bring you a new 360 video every day.
What to See in New York City Art Galleries This Week:::::The Peter Blum Gallery has moved to a space on the Lower East Side that is so much like its previous one, on 57th Street, that it seems simply to have slightly expanded its space in all directions.The architectural resemblance can make you laugh, but Stars Without Distance, John Zuriers show of new paintings here, may take your breath away.Mr. Zurier has devoted over two decades to making increasingly engaging monochromatic paintings that are not quite monochromes.Their delicate fields of blue, mint green, pink, yellow or smudgy white are airy and semitransparent.Their brushwork is thin-skinned, and there is much else going on: thin lines often border these fields or cut through them.Small boxy marks dabs from a narrow brush pace off distances at the sides or sneak into the fields where they sometimes resemble stars in the firmament.The paint moves into corners, creating irregularities that reveal other colors.These elements are especially clear in Taktur, a deep blue surface edged in lighter blue, with a wire-thin line crossing the field top and bottom.Each line has a white mark above and below it.These arrangements add intimations of quietly sparkling moonlit views at sea.Photo Mr. Zuriers paintings are acts of full disclosure; you see every decision, gesture and mark that went into their making.This is true of many foundational postwar painters, especially Jackson Pollock and Robert Ryman.But Mr. Zuriers process is more intuitive and personal.No detail of a painting determines any other; you absorb each, oddity by oddity, fitting them into the whole, and into the experience of really looking.ROBERTA SMITH Genesis Belanger Through Nov. 4.Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.Surrealism and Pop Art were concerned with mass production, consumerism and the psychic impact of living in a world flooded with objects.Genesis Belanger picks up this thread in Cheap Cookie and a Tall Drink of Water at Mrs. Photo Ms. Belangers sculptures, made with stoneware, porcelain and concrete, allude to recognizable objects and yet blur their references.Cheap Cookie (all works are from 2017) is an Oreo grasped between two human fingers, rounded into a nearly abstract circle.Dog in Heels is a hot dog eased into a sandal and Big Yummy looks like a minimalist concrete slab, but actually represents a piece of chewing gum wrapped in foil paper.Photo Part of the attraction of Ms. Belangers work is how it conjures art history: Salvador Dals lobster phone; Meret Oppenheims fur-covered teacup; Claes Oldenburgs soft sculptures; Man Rays objects wrapped in felt; and pieces by Evelyne Axell, Marisol, Niki de Saint Phalle, Tom Wesselmann, Brian Calvin, Al Hansen and many others working in the Pop idiom.Photo Where earlier artists were focused on the uncanniness of new electronics and mass-produced food, however, or stripped them down to a midcentury malaise, Ms. Belanger takes a middle path.Her sculptures, with their rounded surfaces and pastel hues, reflect an era of postmodern design, of so-called user friendly electronics and relatable experiences.Gadgets have become more prosthetic than ever and everything from hot dogs to cigarettes can be organic.Rather than filling us with Freudian angst or existential terror over this situation, Ms. Belangers sculptures feel like emotional support animals: comforting creatures (or biological interfaces) that ease our way through a difficult and confusing world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story MARTHA SCHWENDENER Craig Kalpakjian Through Nov. 5.Kai Matsumiya, 153 Stanton Street, Manhattan; 646-838-9595, kaimatsumiya.com.In the early days of digital photography, Craig Kalpakjian was among the first artists to make images that depicted entirely artificial spaces: rooms and structures that did not exist anywhere except as pictures or in software programs.Now that these phenomena are commonplace particularly in video games, but also in architecture, design and other fields Mr. Kalpakjian has moved on to thinking about the digital in other ways, like surveillance and control, as he does in this show at Kai Matsumiya.In one series of images here, Mr. Kalpakjian remakes Josef Alberss famous Homage to the Square paintings, giving them depth and an eerie feeling of space but also basing his images on the temperature of light rather than using Alberss focus on the interaction of color.Mr. Kalpakjians latest project, Intelligence (2016-2017) ratchets up these stakes even higher.In a series of black and white images with text, he juxtaposes excerpts from a manual for the Sony AIBO robotic dog with declassified C.I.A.and Army Intelligence interrogation manuals.Psychology (or affect, to use a current art buzzword) is paramount in both how humans can be cracked to how they can bond with a robot animal companion programmed with feelings and a personality (according to the Sony manual).Elsewhere in this dense and potent exhibition are mirrors and a robotic arm suspended from the ceiling, which suggest both how we view ourselves and are viewed by others in a technology-saturated world (or what the philosopher Vilem Flusser called the photographic universe).For some, the mirrors are clearly a selfie-op; for others, theyre a reminder of how cameras, software and digital imaging have altered our way of being in the world, and perhaps our very existence.MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Women Accuse Knight Landesman, Art World Mainstay, of Sexual Harassment:::::For decades, Mr. Landesman, 67, had been a pillar of the international art scene, a man-about-town known from the galleries of Manhattan to the Art Basel fair in Switzerland for his primary-colored suits and deep connections in the industry.The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, who once served as the head of the National Endowment for the Arts, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and until Wednesday had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell.Photo The lawsuit that preceded his departure was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and included accusations that he had harassed nine women, groping them, attempting to kiss them, sending them vulgar messages and, on occasion, retaliating against them when they spurned his advances.The accounts were from both former employees at the magazine and women Mr. Landesman met at art events, all of whom said he took advantage of them at the start of their careers when they were economically and professionally vulnerable.The suit also accused the owners of Artforum, one of the art worlds premier publications, of being aware of his behavior but doing little to stop it.The only named plaintiff in the suit is Amanda Schmitt, a New York curator who started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21.Shortly after Ms. Schmitt took the job, the suit contended, Mr. Landesman singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention, subjecting her to questions about her sex life while touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email, reviewed by The Times, in which he praised brown nosing as a sales technique before veering off into a different and sexually explicit description of the practice.Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea, ostensibly to discuss her career, and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, the suit said.It also cited another incident in which Mr. Landesman is said to have told Ms. Schmitt that she needed to be more open to physical contact to succeed and demonstrated by running his finger down her body.In December 2012, while both were attending Art Basel Miami, Mr. Landesman barraged Ms. Schmitt with text messages asking that she meet him alone and kiss him for three seconds, the suit claimed.When Ms. Schmitt refused, Mr. Landesman sent an email saying: Give yourself to me!ALL of you = to all of me.Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending notes, asking if she was making herself climax and was ready to make it a bit physical.Over the next two years, when he saw Ms. Schmitt at art events, the suit said, he would often whisper to her about masturbation and spanking, and touch her without consent.In May 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with Mr. Landesman, pleading with him to stop.But according to the suit, he responded by reaching his shoeless foot out to caress her.The following month, Ms. Schmitt sent him a text message saying: You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so.I want it to stop.Mr. Landesman wrote back promising professionalism in the future, but then asked if they could get on the same page, adding, Id like to be an ally.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On June 15, 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with two of Artforums other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent.That same day, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising he was taking action to insure that whatever may have transpired never happens again.But according to the suit, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events.Then in May, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic.Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had unfairly accused him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended.Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment.Three months ago, Ms. Schmitts lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, sent Artforum a letter detailing those acts as well as the accounts of other women who claim Mr. Landesman harassed them.The letter demanded that the harassment stop and that Artforum pay Ms. Schmitts legal and therapy bills.Negotiations broke down last week, Ms. Reisbaum said, partly because Artforum demanded that Ms. Schmitt not speak to the media.Her lawsuit includes the other womens accounts, although none of them joined it as plaintiffs.While their stories suggest a pattern of harassment, it remains unclear if they can be considered as corroborating evidence since some of the accusers never worked for Mr. Landesman.One of them, Elisabeth McAvoy, did work at Artforum on and off from 2010 to 2013 and described how Mr. Landesman often subjected her to unwanted touching.Ms. McAvoy, who was in her 20s then and shared a bedroom with her sister, said that Mr. Landesman once encouraged her to get her own apartment so that her sister could masturbate herself to sleep.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jordana Zeldin, a former Manhattan gallery owner, met Mr. Landesman at an art opening in 2012 and said that when he saw her boyfriend giving her a back rub, he began to pressure her for back rubs in a series of emails over the next several weeks.When Ms. Zeldin finally put her foot down, Mr. Landesman sent her an email saying she should ask for forgiveness.How about a small apology, the email said.Knight I feel a little guilty that somehow I may have lead you on into thinking Id give you a great backrub.Valerie Werder, who worked in a gallery, said that Mr. Landesman groped her after introducing her to one of her favorite art writers at an industry gala last year.Another gallery worker, Alissa McKendrick, said he did the same to her at the Whitney Biennial in 2012.In an interview this week, Ms. Schmitt said that she never wanted to sue, but that she did so not just to protect herself, but also the countless young men and women starting out in the art world.I had no power and no voice then, she said.I dont feel that way anymore.
Review: Greta Gerwig’s ‘Lady Bird’ Is Big-Screen Perfection:::::I want you to be the very best version of yourself, says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).Video But what if this is the best version?Lady Bird responds.Its a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice.She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.While Lady Bird honors the gravity of Christines struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight.The very first scene begins in tears.Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of The Grapes of Wrath while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novels moving final sentences.Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy.It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the admissions process.Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage.She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time.She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush).She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.Photo You might think youve seen this all before.You probably have, but never quite like this.What Ms. Gerwig has done and its by no means a small accomplishment is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise.The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothe Chalamet).None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig.(Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument.Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted.It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family.The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larrys melancholy and Marions ill humor.They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesnt always express itself as kindness.They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make Lady Bird sound drab and dutiful, but its the opposite.I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is.I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits.Id tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail.Im tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself.In life, thats a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies.Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, Lady Bird is.
Luke Skywalker Speaks:::::It is, if you can be objective about it, he said a few weeks ago, sitting in his home here near the Pacific Ocean.Photo Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood?I could be the size of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, whos going to know?You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with Star Wars, which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal.The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.But Mr. Hamill isnt bitter or jaded, and he isnt Luke, though he has retained some of that characters incorruptibility.Hes gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing Star Wars war stories.At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought Star Wars into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im such a fraud, he said with a theatrical air.But Im enjoying all the residual attention that the movies getting.I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn.Whats not to love?On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin.The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to Star Wars its mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamills own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of Return of the Jedi.Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up.In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; hell slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues the adenoidal clip of the Star Wars creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was King Kong.Proudly recalling a fight scene from Return of the Jedi, Mr. Hamill said, For me, sitting in the rancors hand, I was going all Fay Wray its like a major accomplishment to me.But it was always that way.Id say Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3POs cereal!Photo The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings.He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could.If I didnt get a part, no problem, he said.Then where do I go?I sell tickets.I make props.I make posters.I dont have to be in the show I want to be near the show.He landed early roles on General Hospital and The Partridge Family.And then, of course, came Star Wars: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects.I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity, Mr. Lucas said.He added that Mr. Hamill brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character, and that made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first Star Wars and its sequels.Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience.I thought, even if this thing doesnt slay at the box office, its got midnight cult movie written all over it, he said.Move over, Rocky Horror, Star Wars is here!Instead, Star Wars became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them Harry and Carrison as they promoted the movie together.When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed adequately, Mr. Hamill uninspiredly and Ms. Fisher wretchedly, Mr. Hamill said, We had T-shirts made: adequate, uninspired and wretched.I said, Harrison, adequates practically a rave compared to what we got.Photo Photo Mr. Ford said that during this time, the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness.We really were figuring this out as we went along.Mr. Hamill struck him as a very bright, sincere young actor, who Mr. Ford said seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the Star Wars royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now.Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: Hes a brilliant actor thats a given, he said.Hes also a leading man.When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.Mr. Hamill believed hed find his destiny on a different path one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.After two blockbuster sequels, The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the Star Wars story was complete.With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in The Elephant Man.I wasnt getting character parts in movies and television, he explained.Unless youre Meryl Streep, they dont let you do accents.He starred in the Broadway production of Amadeus while Return of the Jedi was still in theaters.But his 1985 musical Harrigan n Hart, about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his Star Wars legacy.He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on The Simpsons, he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of Guys and Dolls.Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.He was always comfortable being part of the Star Wars subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for ultra-passionate fans).Its clearly not for everyone I get that, Mr. Hamill said.But the passion of it all is just astonishing.The way its become part of the fabric of their lives I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia its moving.Photo He was not involved in the much-maligned Star Wars prequels from 1999 to 2005.And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new Star Wars trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate.We figured we had the middle three, he said.It was over.When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, I was completely stunned.Carrie, not a minute went by she slapped the table and goes, Im in!I said, Carrie, poker face!Mr. Hamill needed more time to think.I was just really scared, he said.I thought, why mess with it?The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their Star Wars heyday.No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star, he said.Its sad.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse The Force Awakens, expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.Hes too old and too rich and too cranky, Mr. Hamill said.Hes not going to do this.But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no?Id be the most hated man in nerd-dom.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of Star Wars fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega).He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists.But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of The Force Awakens, and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Lukes story line.(The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)The idea of it was so enormous, Mr. Abrams said.It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters.That had to be the next movie.Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in The Force Awakens.I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal, Mr. Abrams said.I dont think he knew just how minimal until he read it.In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was not particularly happy with how little he was in it.Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Lukes big reveal at the end would fall flat.If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if theres a big groan in the house, the eggs on my face, not J.J.s, he said.Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read he jokingly calls it a table listen of the Force Awakens script.He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration.(I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse, Mr. Hamill said.)Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.Photo Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in The Force Awakens, lamented that they had worked together on the early Star Wars movies far less than viewers realize.The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few, he said.I knew Chewbacca better.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.Hes very centered in his own experience and his own life, Mr. Ford said.Hes not a grandstander.Hes a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and thats what were there for.Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in The Force Awakens when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, thats fabulous, he said.But now he and the The Last Jedi creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this, said Rian Johnson, the Last Jedi writer and director.Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.Mr. Johnson said The Last Jedi also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke.In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with the youthfulness and innocence he now embodies a person full of soul and experience, Mr. Johnson said.Video While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the Star Wars filmmakers on big plot points hes still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in The Last Jedi.Thats the hard part, Mr. Hamill said.You dont want to admit how possessive youve become.There are times where you go, Really?Thats what they think of Luke?Im not only in disagreement Im insulted.But thats the process and you thrash it all out.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December.Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to Star Wars.Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his Star Wars work, he said, She goes, Whats your problem?I said, Well, its theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.She goes, I am Princess Leia.Youre Luke Skywalker.Get used to it.More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.She deserved that second act, he said.Harrison was more prominent in VII, Im more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one.Her timing was perfect, except in this case.His Star Wars colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise Hes the last man standing, said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in The Force Awakens.But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.It means what it means to him, and thats all that matters, he said.Im sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone that its all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.Photo Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either.Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original Star Wars movies outside of theaters and has seen The Force Awakens only twice.All I notice are flaws, he explained.Oh, why did I do that?Look at my hair.What was I thinking?Advertisement Continue reading the main story During production of The Force Awakens, he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt and was struck by what he saw.They were all great, Mr. Hamill said.They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is A Hard Days Night, Richard Lesters madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, I saw it originally going, Oh, can you imagine it?Girls chasing me down the street!It looks like so much fun.But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light.Its like a horror movie, he said.Theyre trapped.They cant go anywhere.One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamills mind was the Cant Buy Me Love sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.Its the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy, Mr. Hamill said.It plays so differently now, when youre on the other end of it.
Kahlil Joseph’s New Film Is Steeped in Harlem’s History. And His Own.:::::That was at the urging of his brother, Noah Davis, a contemporary artist who founded an influential exhibition space in Los Angeles called the Underground Museum.Mr. Joseph was a successful filmmaker at the time, directing music videos for artists like Flying Lotus, and was later nominated for an Emmy as one of the directors of Beyoncs visual album Lemonade.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in 2014, Mr. Joseph had just completed a 14-minute film that he couldnt release.It was based on work hed done for Mr. Lamar, after the release of his album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.Blending home video from Mr. Lamars family with original footage filmed in Compton, Calif., Mr. Joseph had made something new.But it was not a traditional music video, and Mr. Lamar was not interested in putting it out, Mr. Joseph, 36, recalled in a recent interview.Thats when Mr. Josephs brother advised him to turn it into an installation for the Underground Museum.Projected on two screens arranged in a V shape, the film, m.A.A.d, was a striking success, drawing a host of new visitors to the space.All of a sudden, Im a fine artist, Mr. Joseph said.All thanks to my brother.Photo Among the transfixed viewers was Helen Molesworth, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.I literally drove back to the museum and put it on the schedule, she said.The films triumphant run at the Museum of Contemporary Art was followed by more work, including Lemonade and Music Is My Mistress, a project for the fashion house Kenzo.Then, last year, came the invitation from the New Museum: Could Mr. Joseph create a new film, a sort of New York-based companion piece to m.A.A.d.?For the first time in his career, Mr. Joseph faced a blank slate.There was no song, no album, no core material to draw on.But he quickly found that its impossible not to think about all your heroes and references when you write, he said.In addition to Mr. DeCarava, the photographer, Mr. Joseph drew on the work of Chris Marker, whose film Sans Soleil offers an extended meditation on memory and time.With Fly Paper, Mr. Joseph pays homage to a host of literary and cultural figures, splicing and mixing in references among its scenes of fictional characters.Some figures skate away, while others recur.Photo Photo The film builds in layers, with vrit footage from the street interspersed with elegant, vividly staged scenes.A woman places a handbag on a bed; an elegant gentleman (Ben Vereen) climbs a set of stairs, then reclines, fully dressed, in a bathtub.He visits an art gallery.He dances in an empty room and with the Brooklyn-born flex dancer Storyboard P. The soundtrack leaps, too.Music collides with the sounds of the city: drums, bass, an ambulance, a train.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I wanted people to feel like they saw a Harlem that they cant see, Mr. Joseph said.You can take a tour bus around Harlem and see the exterior.His hunt for the heart of the neighborhood also shows the influence of Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, author of the 2011 book Harlem Is Nowhere (its title is from a 1948 essay by Ralph Ellison).The neighborhoods role as a capital of American culture, and exuberant celebration of African-American life is a voice in his work, which includes a passage read from Ms. Rhodes-Pittss book.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But some of the ghosts are his own.A middle-aged man in an overcoat gets into a cab.Hes on a gurney, proceeding down a hospital hall.Hes in a chair, head shaved, a surgical scar circling one side of his skull, watching ESPN.That would be Mr. Josephs father, the sports and entertainment attorney Keven Davis, who lived in Harlem until his death in 2011 at 53.That shock still reverberates for Mr. Joseph.I remember having no concept that my parents could ever pass away, he said.They seemed like these eternal experiences.The next shock came in 2015, when Noah, his brother, died at 32.You think you have a lot of time with people, when youre young, Mr. Joseph said.Theyre going to live until theyre at least 70.Right?Photo It was a struggle to edit Fly Paper, because of its deeply personal nature, and only late in the process did Mr. Joseph decide to include footage of his family.Searching through video he had shot in 2011 during his fathers last months, he said, led to a wormhole, all this stuff that I totally forgot I shot, because I was in such automatic mode.Again, he was inspired by Mr. DeCaravas work, noting how the photographer included portraits of his wife and daughters in his 1996 MoMA retrospective, alongside his depictions of jazz greats like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis.He was able to not compartmentalize, Mr. Joseph said.Thats why I started to include my family.Thats my big reference to Roy.That was his big genius.The loss of his father and brother also contributed to the erosion of Mr. Josephs sense of time, he said a huge preoccupation for a filmmaker.Our understanding of time as linear is completely false, he said.In the film, its rarely clear whether everything is happening in the same period, across generations, or in a kind of eternal loop.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Visitors at the New Museum show wander in, not knowing quite what to expect.But that kind of serendipity is fine with Mr. Joseph, who compared it to his youthful experience of flipping TV channels, only to happen across a movie in progress.The likelihood that I would finish the film was probably increased by coming in somewhere in the middle, not knowing where I am, he said.A sense of dislocation defines the film, which slips from one visual format to another from 35-millimeter color film to coruscating black-and-white to bleary hand-held video in a way that recalls the rapidly shifting frames of a dream.In the coda, just after the final shot of Mr. Josephs father, there is a sequence of video clips from the 1990s, highlights from the career of the former Detroit Lions star running back Barry Sanders, who abruptly retired before the 1999 season.Mr. Joseph warmly recalled that during his fathers final months they would bond over sports, and Mr. Sanders, a particular favorite.Ive always been drawn to the ballet-like nature of his specific play, Mr. Joseph said.He also praised the athletes decision to step away from the sport at the peak of his powers.It was like a Zen samurai principle thing, right?In the clips, which last a minute or so, the football star streaks across the field, again and again, a flash of joy that sharply contrasts with the painful hospital scenes.It may seem like a jarring shift in mood, but it is in keeping with the films essayistic form.I really love filmmaking, to be honest, Mr. Joseph said.More than plot.

Review: ‘Frank Serpico’ Updates the Story of the Man Behind a Classic Movie:::::Photo This movies intention is in its title.The documentary Frank Serpico fills out an American classic that is now almost 45 years old.Serpico, the 1973 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino, was an adaptation of a book by Peter Maas about a New York City police officer who fought corruption in the ranks and got, among other things, a bullet in the head for his trouble.The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino DAmbrosio, the movie lights up.I told myself I was an actor, he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests.He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his fathers shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience.Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying.Next time, Franks father demanded payment upfront.The cop never came into the store again, Mr. Serpico says.Although he had the shield of the law, he demeaned it by his actions.Mr. Serpico joined the force in 1959 and, witnessing casual payoffs that were accepted without a thought, encountered further disappointment: The job was not on the level.Video The star of the movie is a compelling figure, and Mr. DAmbrosio presents quite a few people from Mr. Serpicos past who have a similar draw.But the directors filmmaking instincts are not always salutary.He introduces each new interviewee with a shot of the subject standing, looking into the camera for several seconds.This affectation grows wearying.The actor John Turturro is not an uninteresting subject, but watching him talk about his reaction to the Lumet-Pacino movie, you get the feeling he is only there because Mr. DAmbrosio could not secure an on-camera interview with Mr. Pacino.The movie does feature a sit-down between Mr. Serpico and Arthur Cesare, his partner in the narcotics division, who was present the night Mr. Serpico was shot.He tells Mr. Cesare that he considers it peculiar that no 10-13, or officer in need of assistance, call went out on his behalf.But theres no combustion in the confrontation, and the exchange goes limp.Could Mr. Cesare have called it in, and if so, why didnt he?Like much else in the movie, its frustrating.
Review: ‘The Light of the Moon’ and the Trauma of Rape:::::Photo When we meet Bonnie, a young architect in Brooklyn, shes on her way to a well-deserved night out.Bonnie drinks and dances, swatting away a few overeager hands.After turning down her friends offer to split a cab, she stumbles toward home.Bonnie puts on her headphones, shes in her own world.And then Bonnie is pulled into an alleyway, where she is brutally raped by a stranger.The rape is an early turning point in The Light Of The Moon and what follows are the aftereffects of this violation.Charismatically played by Stephanie Beatriz of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Bonnie walks us through the bureaucratic process of victimhood having a rape kit administered, going to the police station to identify suspects, and meeting with lawyers to discuss the likelihood of arrests.But Bonnie also experiences the emotional consequences of rape.Shes angry at her boyfriend, Matt (Michael Stahl-David) for changing his behavior as he tries to care for her, but Bonnie changes too.Shes moody, shes secretive, her work suffers, and she cant have sex without thinking of the attack.No matter how low Bonnies spirits sink, the films writer and director, Jessica M. Thompson, holds her star up to the light.With colorful sets and bright cinematography to match its lucid emotional logic, The Light of the Moon is a realistic exercise in psychological clarity.For viewers whose experiences mirror Bonnies or Matts, this therapeutically minded movie might remind them of past anxieties, but as a resource for those looking to understand the process of recovery, its hard to imagine a more comprehensive or sympathetic look at the challenge of surviving.Video
Kevin Spacey Issues Apology to Actor After Sexual Accusation:::::Photo Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, apologized Sunday night for what he said would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior after the actor Anthony Rapp made an accusation about his sexual conduct with him 31 years ago, when Mr. Rapp was 14 years old.Mr. Spacey, who has long been fiercely private about his personal life, said in a statement that he did not remember any such encounter, but added that Mr. Rapps accusation has encouraged me to address other things about my life.He then disclosed that he had loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man.The rapid cycle of accusation and apology began Sunday evening, when BuzzFeed published an article in which Mr. Rapp alleged that Mr. Spacey was trying to get with me sexually after a party at Mr. Spaceys apartment in 1986.After all the other guests had left, Mr. Rapp said that Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold.But I dont, like, squirm away initially, because Im like, Whats going on?And then he lays down on top of me.Mr. Rapp, who is best known for playing the character Mark Cohen in the original Broadway production of Rent, confirmed the contents of the article and said he had decided to speak out at a time when several women have accused the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.Photo I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me, Mr. Rapp said in an emailed statement.Everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article, and I have no further comment about it at this time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Spacey had not responded to requests for comment from BuzzFeed.But a few hours after the article was published, he posted a statement to Twitter, saying he was horrified but did not remember the encounter.Mr. Rapp said he met Mr. Spacey in 1986 when both were performing in Broadway shows.Mr. Rapp was a child actor in a new play called Precious Sons, while Mr. Spacey, then 26, was performing in a revival of Long Days Journey Into Night.Mr. Rapp told BuzzFeed that he met Mr. Spacey at a Broadway party that year, and that Mr. Spacey invited him to the party where the sexual advance occurred.
‘Jigsaw’ Carves Up Clooney’s ‘Suburbicon’ at the Box Office:::::Photo LOS ANGELES George Clooney served up a comedic drama that gave Paramount Pictures the worst wide-release opening total in its history.Steven Spielbergs production company delivered a military drama that went widely ignored.The Weinstein Company offloaded a horror movie in very limited release and took in a grand total of $742.Put simply: Hollywood had another horrific weekend at the box office.The No.1 movie was Jigsaw, the eighth installment in the Saw horror series.It took in about $16.3 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data, tying Saw VI for the lowest opening in the franchise, after adjusting for inflation.Analysts had anticipated ticket sales of roughly $20 million for Jigsaw, which received poor reviews.Lionsgate, which spent a modest $10 million to make Jigsaw, also had the No.2 movie.Tyler Perrys Boo 2!A Madea Halloween collected an estimated $10 million, for a two-week total of $35.5 million.According to comScore, domestic ticket sales for October totaled $539 million, a 13 percent decline from the same month last year, when dramas like The Accountant and The Girl on the Train got turnstiles clicking.Explanations for the downturn include the escalating popularity of streaming services Stranger Things 2 arrived on Netflix on Friday and subpar offerings from Hollywood; Mr. Clooneys film, Suburbicon, received a D-minus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After years of focusing on big-budget fantasy movies, Hollywood may also have inadvertently trained people to think of moviegoing as less of a pastime and more as a special event.(Next weekend, Disney will release Thor: Ragnarok in theaters, and ticket sales are expected to be massive.In partial release overseas over the weekend, Thor: Ragnarok collected $107.6 million, beating Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 in some countries.)
Making Room for Deaf Performers in Hollywood:::::Millie Simmonds plays Rose, a lonely deaf girl in 1927 New Jersey enamored of silent movies and of one star in particular (played by Julianne Moore, the hearing actress who also plays the grown-up Rose).Roses story alternates with that of Ben (Oakes Fegley), a Minnesota boy who becomes deaf when he is struck by lightning in 1977.In Brian Selznicks best-selling book, which he adapted for the screen, Roses story is conveyed wordlessly in pencil drawings; Bens is shared entirely in words.In the movie, her story unfolds without speech in black and white, his with blazing 70s pop color but for nearly an hour no dialogue.I was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film, Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview.To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day.He became aware of acute shards of visual information, he said, though he wasnt kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: This was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.Like Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences.Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture.Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college.The couple were advisers for Wonderstruck, both the book and the movie.Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film and not just as deaf characters.Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles a policeman and a maid, among others in Wonderstruck, and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie.There was one I missed, she said, which is a good sign of his acting.I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look less intently at others so they would seem more hearing.But authenticity works both ways.Its hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers, Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body.For hearing viewers, she said, being deaf is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, its the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking.Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.Mr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and the only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.He turned to Ms. Moore.She took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie succeeded way better than most, but he also said that you cant achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.Even films with deaf involvement can misstep by putting the hearing point of view first.In the summer hit Baby Driver, for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights.But Mr. Humphries pointed out that the editing cut into CJs signed lines so much we often couldnt see his signing and added, Thats reality, audiences are overwhelmingly hearing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Matlin said that not so much has changed since Children of a Lesser God when it comes to studio movies.In independent films, where budgets are smaller, she said, risks can be taken, and there has been some progress.A recent Ukrainian film, The Tribe, has gone further than any Hollywood movie.It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, there are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers and lots of stories to tell.Chief among those stories may have been the cable series Switched at Birth, which ran for five seasons, featured multiple deaf actors and included an episode shot almost entirely in A.S.L.A current example is the ABC series Quantico, now shooting Season 3 in New York.Ms. Matlin (who had a recurring role in Switched at Birth) joins the cast as an ex-F.B.I.agent who lost her hearing in a bomb blast.They just put me in and have had no qualms about How do we do it?she emailed from the set.In films, by contrast, there isnt much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: Usually theyre victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.Ethan Sinnott, director of the theater and dance program at Gallaudet University and a set designer, said that deaf theater professionals like him were not waiting for hearing Hollywood to call but taking matters into their own hands.Deaf filmmaking is ascendant, he said in an email, likely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.He also said that he was gobsmacked by the success of Switched at Birth, adding, I never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.Millie Simmonds has seen neither The Tribe nor Children of a Lesser God (they both have very adult themes), and she never, never never dreamed of being an actress.I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous, she said.But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, A Quiet Place, with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.She has no time to watch noisy scary movies anytime soon, even if she wanted to.
‘The Exterminating Angel’ Brings Together Opera and the Movies:::::I think Buuel understood and loved music as much as any other film director.But the movies from his fecund late period in France dont have musical scores.Theres music in some of them memorably, the flamenco that ngela Molina dances to in That Obscure Object of Desire but no scores.The music in those late films is mostly in their rhythms.In Belle de Jour, when the film wants to convey the disjointed consciousness and subconscious of its conflicted heroine, her memories and fantasies are cut with a syncopated abruptness.Advertisement Continue reading the main story WALLS This is one of the biggest hurdles for a composer trying to adapt Buuel: defining in music something that originally had little of it.Mr. Ads responds to the challenge with a crazily varied score.His earlier works have exhibited some similar traits; his 1995 opera Powder Her Face is full of self-consciously outrageous winking.But his sounds here are stranger and funnier.He emphasizes the situations surrealism with his choice of instruments, like the ondes Martenot and its ethereal, swooping tones.Miniature violins and a salad bowl are included.Video The orchestras regular instruments also get in on the fun.Theres a lot of dissonance in some of the ensemble scenes but also some abstracted waltz pulses that are amusing for the would-be-elegant way they wander in from nowhere.What did you make of the music?Photo KENNY Even though theres little music in the film, The Exterminating Angel is about people attending a dinner party after an opera Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor and the film is steeped in music appreciation.One of the guests, Blanca, entertains everyone on the piano, and theres talk of pizzicato and sonatas.The most beautiful woman in the group, Leticia, is mockingly given the Wagnerian nickname Valkyrie.Its commendable that Mr. Ads doesnt take these specific classical-music allusions as a cue for lazy pastiche.When Leticias nickname is first mentioned, a Wagnerian motif does not follow.Thats not to say that Mr. Ads isnt referential.Like many of our best contemporary composers, hes got an exhaustive command of musical idioms.I heard percussion like that of Calanda, the town where Buuel was from; flamenco; Wagner by way of Bernard Herrmann.WALLS During intermission, you reminded me that Buuel used the Liebestod from Wagners Tristan und Isolde twice, in Un Chien Andalou and LAge dOr, right at the start of his career.KENNY The Liebestod was a piece of music Buuel was drawn to almost as much as he was to the drums of Calanda.He also uses it in a rarity, his 1953 Mexican adaptation of Wuthering Heights.For him the Liebestod is the ultimate musical expression of amour fou, the surrealist ideal of wild romantic love, an overwhelming destructive force against bourgeois values.WALLS Its clear that he enjoyed music and that he also detested the snobbish attitudes that can ruin our experience of it.In The Exterminating Angel, the characters seem to become enmeshed in their fateful trap right after the pianists performance, when a conductor in the group harshly corrects another guest who uses the wrong terminology.Its as if that casual elitist cruelty is spurring Buuel on.Photo KENNY Thats an interesting read on it.Almost invariably, Buuels films, when they depict the bourgeoisie, depict forces at work to confuse or punish it.This theme, and its particular pertinence today, may be why artists are lately drawn to The Exterminating Angel.Theres Mr. Ads and Stephen Sondheim, whos at work on a musical that merges the story with The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, another film about an upper-class dinner party gone awry that Buuel made 10 years later.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But I have never looked at the outlandish situations in terms of cause and effect.I always see Buuel as a deadpan presenter of outsize existential quandaries with no rational explanation.WALLS When I glanced over some of Buuels writings, I found many references to music.In a short 1922 piece, Orchestration, he came up with character sketches for instruments.About the cello: Murmurs of sea and woods.Serenity.Deep eyes.They have the conviction and grandeur of Jesuss sermons in the desert.Regarding the timpani: Skins filled with olives.By the time he wrote his autobiography, My Last Sigh, he was suffering from deafness.Yet his musical memory was still crisp: He recalled trying to draft Andr Breton into opera fandom.It didnt take since the production, of Charpentiers Louise, was bad enough to drive everyone from the theater.KENNY That last chapter of My Last Sigh, in which he describes his preparation for death, is sad and funny at once and never more poignant than when he complains that his deafness has made it impossible for him to listen to music.
Review: In ‘1945,’ Hungarian Villagers Are Forced to Revisit Wartime Sins:::::Photo The men in hats arrive by train and slowly walk the dusty road toward the village, following the horse-drawn flatbed that carries their cargo.The stationmaster bicycles ahead of them to issue a warning at the watering hole; the residents begin to whisper.Its the wedding day of the son of the town clerk, who doesnt want any trouble with elections coming up.The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fianc is still hovering.Video Ferenc Toroks lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, 1945, shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon.The visiting men in black hats a father (Ivan Angelus) and his adult son (Marcell Nagy) arent villains out for revenge, but Orthodox Jews, who have come to the village at the end of the war.They are transporting trunks said to be filled with perfume or cosmetics.The purpose of their journey is obscure.The two barely speak over the course of the film; the guilty villagers talk among themselves.We have to give it all back, the town drunk (Jozsef Szarvas) tells the clerk, Istvan (Peter Rudolf), believing that the strangers have a connection to the towns deported Jews.Dismissing the concern, Istvan nevertheless understands that fear; he played a pivotal role in betraying the local Jews, a sin for which his opiate-addicted wife (Eszter Nagy-Kalozy) holds him in contempt.As the film slowly reveals how the villages veneer of civility is built over a foundation of treachery, the darkened foregrounds suggest conspirators hiding in plain sight.Absorbing and finely wrought, 1945 is not perfect.It oversimplifies Istvans motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend.The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric, especially when it riffs on Max Bruchs widely used composition for Kol Nidre, a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context.And by design, the movie is something of a tease, more interested in setup than in payoff.The guilt that eats at these characters resists easy closure or absolution.
Roman Polanski Retrospective in Paris Draws Protests:::::Photo French feminist groups staged demonstrations Monday night at the opening of a retrospective in Paris for the film director Roman Polanski.Photographs appeared on social media of protesters holding placards outside the Cinmathque Franaise film institute, where Mr. Polanski, 84, was attending the event honoring his work.One video showed demonstrators chanting Polanski, rapist and hammering on the Cinmathques window.The Associated Press reported that the demonstrators, some of whom were topless, included members of the feminist collective Femen.Mr. Polanski, who holds dual Polish and French citizenship, is wanted in the United States for sexual abuse of minors.In 1977, he pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer when she was 13, but fled before sentencing to France, which does not extradite its citizens.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Fresh allegations emerged this month, when the former actress Renate Langer accused him of raping her when she was 15.Ms. Langer is the fourth woman to publicly accuse Mr. Polanski of assaulting her when she was a teenager.
In the Time of Trump, a Horror-Movie Maker Rules Hollywood:::::Mr. Blum, a 48-year-old Hollywood producer, takes this stand even though he thinks that goose bumps about Donald J. Trump have buoyed Blumhouse, his hit factory that has made Get Out, Sinister, Insidious, The Purge, Paranormal Activity, Split, The Gift and The Visit.Blumhouse also produced the Oscar-winning Whiplash and won Emmys for The Normal Heart and The Jinx, the eerie six-part documentary about Robert Durst that ended with him caught on a hot microphone whispering to himself in a bathroom about his dead wife and dead best friend: What the hell did I do?Killed them all of course.Mr. Blum is now teaming with John Carpenter for the final Halloween with Ms. Curtis returning as Laurie Strode.In the time Mr. Blum and I were having dinner, his latest, Happy Death Day, a ghoulish twist on Groundhog Day, leapt to No.1 at the weekend box office.I think when people are scared, they like to see movies where the scares are not real, Mr. Blum says.The current administrations been terrific for the scary-movie business.Its been our best year ever.I think Get Out did four times the business it would have done if Hillary had been president.Mr. Blum frets about the White House swallowing his former communications chief, Josh Raffel, who left him to become Jared Kushners lieutenant, much like the hero of Get Out is swallowed by the sunken place.He jokes that he wants to rescue Mr. Raffel from the cult because Im scared Jared is drinking his blood.Christopher Landon, the director of Happy Death Day, agrees that President Trump has stirred up all these dark places and dark corners and old shadows of our culture, and horror is so well suited to address these things.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Hollywood is in atrophy, endlessly and tediously replicating comic-book franchises, Mr. Blum is able to be original and risky by staying fast and cheap.And once he got successful, he did not jump to blockbusters.He has created a business model that works, making films for $5 million or less with clear commerciality and marketability, says Donna Langley, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, who signed Mr. Blum to a 10-year, first-look film deal.Hes excitable and exciting to be around.Ethan Hawke, an old Blum friend who starred in Sinister, says that when you think of a horror impresario you think of a dour, terrifying person, but the big surprise about being Jasons friend is how much joy he has.In a fear-based business, Mr. Blum sprinkles pixie dust, making filmmakers dreams come true on a budget.Mr. Landon calls Mr. Blum a cross between Willy Wonka and Robert Evans.He has this sort of mad-professor vibe but an old-school charm as well, an energy fluttering about him that is hard to contain.Photo RELATED: Jason Blums favorite film genre Dressed in khaki pants and a blue vest from Zara and wearing a 1987 Rolex, Mr. Blum pulls out his phone to

opportunist.I ask him about the PC crackdown on costumes.Universities now issue guidelines and hold social justice workshops about how to avoid cultural appropriation.A list of instructions circulating on Twitter read: How to Not Be a Jerk This Halloween: No problematic historical figures; Dont glorify violence against women; Cultures are not costumes (absolutely no blackface, brownface, yellowface; absolutely no religious garb (i.e.hijabs, bindis, etc.); absolutely no native headdresses; absolutely no gypsy-related costumes); Gender identity is not a costume (dont dress trans if youre not trans); Sexual identity is not a costume (dont dress as a gay figure if youre not gay.)Mr. Blum observes simply: Halloween is woke, and theres nothing we can do about it.Over a mango lassi at the Bombay Club, he explains how he drove his customized van that doubles as an office down the road to inheriting the mantle of Val Lewton and Roger Corman as a master of shadows.My favorite thing about horror is that it attracts this great group of nuts, of which I include myself in, Mr. Blum says.I was always kind of an oddball.I collected my fingernails, for instance.Halloween was definitely

he shouldnt have done.Hes a bully.She left.She threatened to sue him and rather than go through litigation, he gave her 100,000 bucks.And the settlements were described as People are taking advantage of me because Im rich.Thats what we all thought, like, Yeah, hes gross, Harveys being a scumbag again not, He was a rapist.I was in his hotel room when he was in his robe.He was in his robe all the time when we were traveling at film festivals.He worked 24 hours a day and he was always in his robe.When Mr. Blum lost the distribution rights to Run Lola Run in a Toronto negotiation, after Mr. Weinstein changed the terms at the last minute, Mr. Weinstein ordered Mr. Blum to run over to the hotel of the rights holders and stay there until they changed their minds.Im 28 years old, Mr. Blum recalls.Im bawling.Its 3:30 a.m. Im knocking on the guys door, begging him to open the door.And crying.Im crying, Im crying.He wont open the door.Mr. Weinstein rushed up to Toronto and they went into one of the multiple hotel suites his boss always kept there were always endless hotel rooms, Mr. Blum says and Mr. Weinstein threw his lit cigarette.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And the lit cigarette hit me, Mr. Blum continues.It bounced off me and bounced on the floor and Harvey knew he shouldnt have done it and he said, I was going for the garbage can.And I was so upset at the other side, and attracted to being abused, that I was fully on Harveys side.I was like, Harvey, dont worry about it.Im so mad, too.I cant believe what they did to us.Oh my God, it was total Stockholm syndrome.He bullied me, he threw a lit cigarette at me.And I tried to hide that it happened, trying to protect him.I mean, it was very, very abusive.When he called, you would go into a sweat.Every time he called, I was terrified.And wherever I was, from the time I was under that contract, I was never free.I went into cognitive therapy after I was there 12 months, because I had depression.The therapist gave him a self-help book called The Assertive Option, which he began using in interactions with the Weinstein brothers, who were so brutal that everyone else banded together and protected each other against these guys.They werent Cain and Abel, because they were both awful.But they also hated each other.He said he is struggling to figure out why I chose to stay in a place for years where I was abused.He didnt force me to stay there.I could have quit at any time.Why didnt I quit?He agreed with a former colleague at the company who told him recently: I wish I could go to the hospital and get the part where Harvey existed in my brain taken out of my brain.He did learn a lot from Mr. Weinstein, he says, including the frenetic pace and the never-give-up attitude.But in other ways, he has modeled his company to be the reverse of that one.He never micromanages.Harvey would spend days arguing over a part that was three days long, Mr. Blum says.I dont know who plays those parts.Its such a waste of time.We give a ton of creative input, but I dont spend 700 years arguing over something like Nicole Kidmans nose in The Hours.Harvey would say Im the best editor in Hollywood.He didnt look at his job as supporting the artists.He looked at himself as an artist.And I look at myself as a curator, blowing a path through to let the artist do their thing.I would be terrible at directing a movie.I dont have that kind of brain.Because of his parents, Mr. Blum understands how to talk to artists, but he also gets the needs of the business side.Advertisement Continue

the actress will walk out of the door and say I did something wrong.So theres no way they can do that if theres someone else in the room.Hes the Mike Pence of Hollywood, I suggest.Its the power dynamic, he says.You get a 23-year-old actress sitting in your office, I think they feel like, do they flirt in the meeting, do they not flirt?Its just uncomfortable.It just lingers in the air.And I dont want it lingering in the air.And if my head of casting, who is a woman, is sitting there, its fine.And I can ask for an actresss email and its not weird.Then I send them a script directly, I dont go through their agent, and its fine.Before the Weinstein revelations, Mr. Blum had bought Gabriel Shermans book on Roger Ailes to turn into a eight-part series for Showtime, the saga of the guy who enabled the guy, the Fox News chief who rolled out the red carpet to the Trump White House.Mr. Blum says the movie he would most like to do now is a remake of the 1957 Andy Griffith classic, A Face in the Crowd, about a wealthy, megalomaniacal television personality who swans about as the voice of the people until hes exposed as a phony.Sounds vaguely familiar.Jason Blum faces more of his demons in

New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s:::::Ms. Matthau, the dancer who reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, said she was willing to break its confidentiality clause even if it meant that he might pursue legal damages.I want to do my part to help bring this to light so it doesnt happen with other people in Hollywood or anywhere else, she said in an interview.The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere.Photo Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her.The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinsteins, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006.The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein.Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the departments hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses.Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted.Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States.The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015.Mr. Weinsteins spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.Cynthia Burr For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein.Photo But she didnt forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City.How he tried to kiss her in the elevator.And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was just him and me alone, she said.I was fearful I didnt have the wherewithal to get away.It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s.Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a real up-and-comer, Ms. Burr remembers.Her manager said they should meet.After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed.The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself, she said.What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress?Nobody would have believed me.Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood.She appeared in Scarface and the first two Lethal Weapon films, and in soap operas and other television shows.Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened.Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago.Im really sad for everybody, but Im really glad its out in the open, Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein.I finally felt like I had a voice.Hope Exiner dAmore Ms. Exiner dAmore had worked for Mr. Weinstein for just a few weeks when he asked if shed like to take a trip to New York City.Both of them were in their 20s, living in Buffalo in the late 1970s.Photo She was working for Mr. Weinsteins concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs.She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner dAmore recalled.He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations;

Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron.The experience, she said, was chilling.She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein.Well drag you through the mud by your hair, she recalled the lawyer saying.Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment.Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle.Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again.Lacey Dorn Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries.Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party Advertisement Continue reading the main story A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email.He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said.Great meeting you, he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m. On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein.As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes.I was so nave, I didnt say anything.And he didnt say anything either, she said.I just got out of the party as fast as possible.Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again.Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a rite of passage, an acknowledgment of how awful the entertainment business could be.
Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood:::::She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinsteins alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers.After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other womens experiences with Mr. Weinstein.Photo Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over the assumption that money or threats could buy womens silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway.While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Ms. McGowans lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years.Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein and the public conversation about whats wrong with Hollywood seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.On Friday, at the inaugural Womens Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick.I have been silenced for 20 years, she told the gathering.I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed.I have been maligned.And you know what?Im just like you.A Crusade Gathers Strength As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.Photo When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinsteins history, she wrote in a tweet: GODDAMNIT!I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT you said that to my face, adding, The press conf I was made to go to after assault.You lie.(Mr. Affleck declined to comment.)She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies you are guilty of human trafficking, she wrote and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinsteins alleged misconduct.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Twitter suspended her account the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed.The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowans blistering attacks, a moody still of her from Grindhouse in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought.Get em, Rose, he wrote.On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge.I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay a lot of monster energy, said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean.I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past.Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan.Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing kind of like a witchs cackle, she clarified.But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation.The phone had come to feel too powerful: Its like a live wire that youre holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain, she said.The Meeting and the Aftermath Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter.Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, Going All the Way.She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film Scream, on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.Ms. McGowans manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment.On her arrival, the matre d directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinsteins suite, she said.Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in.They wouldnt look me in the eye, she recalled.She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting.But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub.And then what happened, happened, said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape.Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.She declined to share the details of the encounter.Thats my story to tell, she said emphatically.But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event.She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck.She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred.She held me, Ms. McGowan said.She put her arms around me.But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless.She was like, Youre an actress, youve done a sex scene, youre done, she recalled.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messicks office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messicks calls.I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle, Ms. Woodward said.She wanted to fight.No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct.It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated, Ms. Woodward said.Thats what stuck with me.Photo Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messicks request and confronted him with Ms. McGowans claim.I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior, Mr. Wechsler said.Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000.Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein.Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Roses aunt, almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Roses grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school.Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).Rose was never this sweet, simple soul there was always something ferocious about her, Ms. Corman said.After that assault, a light dimmed.I remember her souring on the powers that be.And she became very protective of us.It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.Ms. McGowans friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.(I ran away for three years and joined the circus, Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.)She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude.That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted, she said.And I thought you want to see a body?I did it with a giant middle finger.Photo Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired.I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with werent as great as the people she had before, said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another.But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on Phantoms, a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table.And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She continued to work, on Charmed until 2006, but also in independent films.Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as Grindhouse, directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino.It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harveys brother.As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.I was really lost at that point, she said.I was damaged.Shunning Celebrity It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowans career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred.She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit.I never considered myself a celebrity, she said at one point.I hate that word.Its tawdry.Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood.In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions.(Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)Photo In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Rene Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actresss plastic surgery.How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?she wrote, in a direct accusation of the pieces writer, Owen Glieberman.It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses, said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times.Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim.You are taking part of someones soul, she said.Its happened to me.Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona.She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach.She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half her book, Brave, which will be released by Harper One early next year.To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news.But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: I knew we are legion.We are legion.She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press).It feels, Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.Thats what the whole experience feels like to me.Its an intense process.Sometimes she feels fresh rage.But Ill tell you what I dont feel anymore, she said.Despair.
Walter Lassally, Cinematographer Who Won Oscar for ‘Zorba,’ Dies at 90:::::Mr. Lassally worked with the director James Ivory on the period dramas that were the signature of Merchant Ivory Productions, like The Wild Party (1975), set in Hollywood of the 1920s, and Heat and Dust (1983), set partly in India of the 1920s.He shot comedies like The Great Bank Hoax (1978).He did the occasional television movie, including The Man Upstairs, a 1992 comic drama on CBS that starred Katharine Hepburn and Ryan ONeal.He could make even a mundane setting interesting, as Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted in his review of the 1969 film 3 Into 2 Wont Go.Walter Lassally, Mr. Canby wrote, who photographed some of Tony Richardsons best films (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner), must, I assume, receive some of the credit for transforming a suburban house into a locale as fascinating and mysterious and necessary to this film as Monument Valley used to be to John Ford.Photo Mr. Lassally was born on Dec. 18, 1926, in Berlin.His father was an engineer who sometimes used film as an adjunct to his work as he studied mechanical processes.The family, Mr. Lassally said in an interview with the website Web of Stories, was not Jewish but had Jewish ancestors, making them unwelcome in their own country as the Nazis came to power.In 1939, just before the outbreak of war, they emigrated to England.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was no immediate word on his survivors.As a youngster Mr. Lassally worked at Riverside Studios in London as a clapper boy, holding the slate up before a scene.Riverside soon went bankrupt, but Mr. Lassally was on his way; in 1950 he was given the chance to shoot a fire-prevention documentary called Every Five Minutes.He also began writing about moviemaking, becoming identified with the British documentary film movement known as Free Cinema.His first features as cinematographer, Another Sky, set in North Africa, and Passing Stranger, a crime film set in a small British town, were both released in 1954.He started his career in documentaries and applied some of those techniques to his feature work in groundbreaking ways, Stephen Pizzello, editor in chief and publisher of American Cinematographer magazine, said by email.The mission of the Free Cinema movement was to produce realistic films about the working class, and its practitioners shot in authentic locations with relatively unknown actors and actresses; they were the guerrilla filmmakers of their day.Photo In 1961 Mr. Richardson, who died in 1991, asked Mr. Lassally to shoot A Taste of Honey, a drama about a pregnant teenager, which Mr. Pizzello said was the first major British feature shot entirely on location.The next year the two made The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, about a boy at an English reform school.In 1963 came Tom Jones, a romantic romp, based on the Henry Fielding novel, set in the 18th century.It had a particularly memorable scene involving a stag hunt, which included countless hounds running alongside riders on galloping horses.Mr. Lassally found a thrilling way to render the scene, mixing conventional images with shots taken from a helicopter and a camera mounted so low on a truck that it could look up at the riders faces.Its so cleverly intercut that sometimes you think youre running along the ground, and then suddenly youre jumping over the bushes and rising into the air, Mr. Lassally said.So that was a very effective technique, and its caused a lot of comment after.People always ask me, How did you do that?The cinematographer Tom Houghton worked as a gaffer with Mr. Lassally on later films, including the marital drama Too Far to Go (1979), and found it a vital learning experience.He took a great deal of care in the placement of lights, Mr. Houghton told American Cinematographer for a 2008 article on Mr. Lassally, and it was an amazing experience to watch him.The more I worked with him, the more I understood what he was going for.He knew how to create subtleties and nuances in the midst of simplicity, and he brought that sensibility from the smaller projects to the bigger films.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a 2015 interview with Radio Prague, Mr. Lassally summed up the importance of the look of a film.To me cinema is visual, he said.In a good film, you should be able to turn off the soundtrack and still get the story.Nowadays its the other way around.Most of the information tends to be in the dialogue and not in the pictures, and thats not cinema to me.
Motion Picture Academy Moves to Institute Code of Conduct:::::Photo Nodding to critics who contend that the movie industry hasnt done enough to fight sexual harassment, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday that it would be establishing a code of conduct for its members.According to an email sent to members by the Academys chief executive, Dawn Hudson, the new rules will include a policy for evaluating alleged violations and determining if action regarding membership is warranted.This comes on the heels of the Academy, which is the de facto governing body of the movie industry, expelling Harvey Weinstein two weeks ago, breaking with 90 years of precedent.At the time, the Academy said in a statement that it would, work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all academy members will be expected to exemplify.But still, it has faced criticism in recent weeks, given that Roman Polanski, who pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977, and Bill Cosby still remain members.Ms. Hudson said in the letter that the Academy would consult experts in law and ethics to gain a better understanding of what more we can and should be doing.She added, Although we have no intention of functioning as an investigative body or moral court, we do have a right and duty as a voluntary association to maintain clear standards of workplace behavior for those we accept as members.
It’s Always Fishnets Season Somewhere:::::That look is dated, for sure, bearing little resemblance to what many prostitutes actually wear, but those images have proliferated just the same, a common sight this fall at concerts, on theater screens and in a flurry of luxury ad campaigns.Seedily costumed streetwalkers are a magnet to fans of The Deuce, about 1970s-era Times Square and the rise of its infant pornography industry.A leather-clad vixen grinds her stilettos into a fleshy male torso in one of the Steven Klein videos on display this month in Fetish, an exhibition organized in partnership with Visionaire magazine at the venerable Sothebys auction house.And a manga-inspired old-school prostitute, resplendent in shrill fuchsia fur, is among the vivid attractions of Blade Runner 2049.The very prevalence of such images, overworked as they may be, is a testament to their durability.It is reason enough to look more closely at a position advanced by scholars and style arbiters alike: that the clothes we wear, or might like to wear, owe a very real debt to the worlds most ancient profession.Fashion right now is influenced by hookers, said Anna Terrazas, the costume designer of The Deuce.Its not the other way around.In a sea of eye-numbing conventionality, a maverick appearance is their signature.For someone employed on the busy streets, Ms. Terrazas said, the point is to be seen.Not a groundbreaking concept, exactly.There is an untold history of the relationship between sex workers and fashion, said Rebecca Arnold, a fashion historian and lecturer at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.As fashions early adopters, working women routinely took up what their respectable contemporaries shunned as too showy, tasteless or new.Photo The dubious woman could be more outlandish in her dress, and more experimental, Ms. Arnold said.She is allied with the idea of fashion as linked, not necessarily with the avant-garde, but with the beginning of new dress trends.Among the more fashionably progressive were the grandes horizontales of the 19th century, courtesans like Cora Pearl, a client of Charles Worth, the eras first celebrity designer; and Catherine Walters (Skittles to her public), riveting on horseback as she paraded through Hyde Park sewn into her riding ensembles.Her style was much copied by noblewomen of the day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story More recently, to hear it from the prostitutes themselves, down-market variations on that patrician theme have been reduced to a series of musty clichs.Fashion doesnt produce a vast range of ideas of what female sexuality looks like, said Annie Sprinkle, a writer, sex educator and former prostitute.Stereotypes abound, she noted, with the upper echelons of the profession embodied by the aspirational up-and-comer cloaked in cashmere and silk and the role-play specialist dressed in pinstripes or a schoolgirl smock.The more down-market variations flaunt fishnets, kinky boots, hot pants, fur chubbies and harnesses.Its a visual code dating at least from the 70s, tatty and archaic even then.Yet it is routinely resurrected by top-tier designers including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander Wang, each gussying up his offerings in sumptuous fabrics or in a mash-up of fetish, athletic and military gear, to tamp down the steamy aggression and make the look palatable to an affluent clientele.Photo The gambit works.In the disco era, fashion was inspired by drag queens and prostitutes, said Tom Fitzgerald, one half of Tom & Lorenzo, an opinionated fashion blog.Fashion in general is always borrowing from street wear, and it doesnt get more street wear than hooker.Those references, fixtures in the lexicon of style, are mainstream now.Is there a specific sex worker look anymore?Mr. Fitzgerald said.Or does it all get pulled from the sexy pile at Forever 21?Like hip-hop and grunge, the look has been normalized, he said.Its never been more respectable.Or apparently more covetable.In The Deuce, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the prostitute Candy, swivels her hips in a working-girl wardrobe of short shorts, skimpy tops and lightly soiled coats.The actress reminisced the other day about her fixation with its centerpiece, a boxy fur chubby, a down-market variation on a famously scandalizing look introduced in the 70s by Yves Saint Laurent, one inspired by the wartime prostitutes of the Rue Saint-Denis.Photo Seemingly unaware of its provenance, Ms. Gyllenhaal went on, I wanted to wear that jacket in every scene.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She wasnt alone.It became such an iconic piece on the set, Ms. Terrazas said.All of the girls were, like, I want a jacket like that.Pop performers like to tap the look as an assertion of power, often treading a fine line between owning their sexuality and trading on it.Cardi B, a retired stripper-ho, as she boasts, has been accused of glamorizing prostitution.She makes no apology.Nor does Nicki Minaj, who turned up at a fashion show this fall wearing lace-up hot pants, over-the-knee boots and an ermine stole, her image an echo of Julia Robertss pre-makeover turnout in Pretty Woman.
Weinstein Sues Weinstein Company, Demanding Access to Records:::::Photo LOS ANGELES Weinstein v. Weinstein has commenced.Harvey Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he had helped found after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him, sued the Weinstein Company on Thursday to demand access to records and emails.The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said Mr. Weinstein needed the materials to defend himself.More than 50 women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or rape.Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company will contain information exonerating him, the complaint said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Weinstein also wants access to his former email account and other company documents, including his personnel file, to pursue a claim of wrongful termination against the Weinstein Company, according to the complaint.He also wants to pursue legal action against the studio for mismanagement by leaking confidential company information saying that certain news reports about his behavior could have only come from his personnel file.

Review: ‘The Square’ Takes Aim at Art, Sex, Money and More:::::But its not so simple.While Christian is willing to admit fault, he also feels compelled to note that the problem isnt just a matter of his own thoughtlessness.(Im refraining from saying what he did, since, like everything else that happens in The Square, its too surprising to spoil and too weird to explain.)There are social forces and economic structures at work, he says, large historical tendencies that both extend and extenuate his guilt.Immigration.Inequality.Social alienation.Global capitalism.That kind of thing.Christian knows a billionaire a donor to the museum who might be able to throw enough money at the problem to solve it.But even then Is there a saying about fish that live in glass barrels shooting themselves in the foot?Mr. Ostlund, whose film before this one was the squirmy, incisive Force Majeure, takes aim at some pretty fat satirical targets art, taste, sex and money, for starters and sprays buckshot at the audience as well as in his own face.The bad conscience of the cultural elite is hardly a new concern in European cinema (or American journalism, if we want to go there), and The Square, which won the Palme dOr in May, uses some of the shock-the-bourgeoisie tactic refined, in recent years, by his fellow Cannes laureates Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier.If Mr. Ostlund lacks Mr. Hanekes rigor and Mr. von Triers sadism, he at least has a sense of humor.The Square, ragged and headlong, plays like a series of elaborately staged sketch-comedy routines.Or, closer to its own concerns, like an anthology of performance art pieces.Just about everything that happens to Christian has a conceptual dimension, an element of coy self-consciousness, that makes you wonder whether its just something that happened or a carefully planned and theorized happening.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers.The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit.His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality.Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel.Is the baby whom one of Christians colleagues brings into the room really his child?Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world?What about Christians own daughters?Can any human action or feeling be called natural or real?
Review: Glib Laughs and Race Hate in ‘Suburbicon’:::::Photo Suburbicon, a jaundiced, hard-sell comedy, wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock.This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact.Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution.The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing Suburbicon has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down.You know the place: Its as American as apple pie and quiet desperation.Its the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented.In Little Boxes, a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the boys go into business and marry and raise a family.That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that Suburbicon delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home.It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardners sack suits and yards that look as if theyd been landscaped using a compass and protractor.There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like Father Knows Best rather than a riposte like Mad Men.Video The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicons first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion.Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red.Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the familys home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage.And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack.The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin.Any resemblance to the audience watching Suburbicon is as intentional as it is obvious.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle.Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images.That there arent any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isnt quite as balanced as it seems.Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word.Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couples son, Andy.
Anatomy of a Scene | ‘The Square’:::::Film directors walk viewers through one scene of their movies, showing the magic, motives and the mistakes from behind the camera.
Review: Lena Olin Is Fierce as a Suicidal Poet in ‘Maya Dardel’:::::Photo The first time we hear Maya Dardel (Lena Olin, and her inimitable rasp), she is declaring her intention to commit suicide.Maya, a renowned poet living in isolation, believes her work has begun to decline.Her only concern now is with finding a worthy heir to manage her estate.Women need not apply Maya wants to play with power and toy with the young male poets who offer themselves as her potential successors.Video The passions that drive Maya Dardel, written and directed by Magdalena Zyzak and Zachary Cotler, are more literary than cinematic.Maya circles her legacy-minded suitors, dropping references to Sylvia Plath and discussing the merits of rhyme schemes and suicide.But for all the linguistic gymnastics, the film is hamstrung by its directors lack of visual imagination.Maya challenges her boyish applicants poetically, sexually and finally with offers of intimacy, but the editing all too often settles into a submissive back and forth.During Mayas tte--ttes, we get a glimpse of her home, but every room in her mountainside hideaway has the same sickly hues of blue and green.What little light makes it through appears weak and suffocated, and though the claustrophobia abates when she walks through the California brambles, even nature isnt immune to the enervating pallor of Ms. Zyzak and Mr. Cotlers compositions.The red-blooded vivacity of Ms. Olins performance, however, pierces through the muck.She chews feeble lines like meat, spitting out the masticated remains.For all of Mayas talk of finding the youthful Actaeon to her Artemis, the only time Ms. Olin appears matched is in her brief scenes with her neighbor, Leonora, played by the equally strong Rosanna Arquette.
New Trailer: ‘Mudbound’ From Dee Rees:::::Photo Netflix has yet to make a major impact on the Oscars (witness Idris Elbas snub for the acclaimed 2015 drama Beasts of No Nation), but that may change with Mudbound, based on the powerful trailer that has just been released.The film has earned raves on the festival circuit and from critics, who are quoted in the teaser.Directed by Dee Rees (Pariah), the sprawling drama follows two families one white and one black in rural Mississippi during World War II and its aftermath.Carey Mulligan, who earned an Oscar nomination for An Education (2009), stars as a farm wife caught between her husband (Jason Clarke) and his younger brother (Garrett Hedlund), a returning veteran.The R&B singer Mary J. Blige, in whats said to be a breakout performance, plays a mother whose son (Jason Mitchell) is also a returning veteran who comes back from Europe only to encounter intransigent racism.Ms. Rees, who along with Virgil Williams adapted Hillary Jordans novel, could become the first African-American woman nominated for best director at the Oscars.(Ava DuVernay was passed over for the 2014 drama Selma.)But Ms. Rees will have to overcome the perception that Mudbound is a made-for-TV movie, since it will be released simultaneously online and in theaters on Nov. 17.
Review: Two Unlikely Roommates Share Heartbreak in ‘Crash Pad’:::::Photo The sin of poor comedic timing is almost an unpardonable one.Kevin Tent, Alexander Paynes longtime editor, has worked on some of that directors funniest movies, including Sideways and the forthcoming Downsizing.Yet Mr. Tents directorial debut, Crash Pad, indicates this artist has more to learn about his new craft.Crash Pad follows a millennial slacker and self-professed romantic, Stensland (Domhnall Gleeson), in the depths of heartbreak after the end of his fling with a married woman, Morgan (Christina Applegate).After binge-watching episodes of Dawsons Creek and trying to blackmail his former flame, Stensland receives an unusual proposal from Morgans husband, Grady (Thomas Haden Church from Sideways).The two men become roommates in a bid to make Morgan jealous while they mend their bruised feelings with women and cheap tequila.The movies premise isnt as bad as the forced, unnatural dialogue.Even the reliable Ms. Applegate and Mr. Church cant salvage the screenwriter Jeremy Catalinos clumsy lines.Morgans faithlessness has emboldened me to take a vacation, Grady declares when moving into Stenslands apartment.Saddled with the wordiest scenes in the movie, Mr. Gleeson comes across like a college freshman fumbling through his first Shakespeare play.Stensland and Gradys romantic plight might have earned more sympathy if their characters werent so insufferable.While Mr. Tents direction is serviceable, its safe.His movie lacks any stylish risks that would make this trios bad romance memorable, leaving Crash Pad to feel like a warm-up act.
Review: ‘Novitiate’ Shares a Young Nun’s Emotional Story:::::Photo What do you seek?What do you desire?a young woman named Cathleen is asked as she prepares to take religious vows.Even though the questions are part of a centuries-old ritual, Novitiate, written and directed by Maggie Betts, takes their content seriously and understands that they are not synonymous.What Sister Cathleen (Margaret Qualley) and her fellow novices aspire to become does not always align with what they want in their hearts.Though they feel themselves called to a life of sacrifice, seclusion and austerity, that vocation often expresses itself with a passion that can be unsettling.It is not just about loving God, but about being in love with him.Eros and Agape, the worldly and spiritual manifestations of love, are not always easily separated.Cathleen Harris arrives at the Sisters of Blessed Rose monastery in 1964, when she is 17.Even though the Vatican II reforms initiated by Pope John XXIII are bringing radical changes to the Roman Catholic Church, they have yet to reach the quiet hillside where the sisters live, almost entirely cut off from the rest of the world.Cathleen, educated in a Catholic girls school in Tennessee, is leaving a family situation sketched in a few baldly over-dramatized scenes.Her tomcatting father (Chris Zylka) comes home drunk and angry and then leaves altogether.Cathleens mother, Nora (Julianne Nicholson), an occasional churchgoer, smokes and swears and sleeps around and is utterly mystified by the intensity of her daughters faith.Photo Novitiate veers between subtlety and its opposite, which is personified mainly by Melissa Leos abbess.An autocrat with a sadistic streak, the reverend mother enforces harsh discipline and seems to enjoy humiliating her young charges.She brooks no dissent and finds herself in conflict both with an independent-minded underling (Dianna Agron) and with the modernizing archbishop (Denis OHare).Another side of the reverend mothers personality an intense religious devotion entwined with a quasi-feminist, anti-authoritarian streak emerges late in the film, but rather than reveal the characters complexity it undermines the storys coherence.The movie is on surer, more interesting ground when it explores Cathleens inner life, her daily routines, and the camaraderie and rivalry that emerge among the novices.Discouraged from forming close friendships that might distract from their primary devotion, the young women, mostly still teenagers, behave in some of the usual ways for girls of their age.They gossip and share confidences and break rules carelessly or brazenly, all the while grappling, as most adolescents do, with deep and murky questions of identity.Video Their reasons for joining the order are as various as their temperaments.One cites Audrey Hepburn in The Nuns Story as a primary inspiration.Novitiate avoids both the laundered piety of that movie and the sensationalism that hovers around the subject of women and religion.At least since the 18th century, the depiction of nuns and convents in literature has often tended toward the Gothic or the pornographic, fed by anticlerical and anti-Catholic ideology as well as by fantasies about female sexuality.There is certainly cruelty in Novitiate, and lust as well.In her desk drawer, the reverend mother keeps a small whip made of knotted rope, called the discipline, that the sisters may borrow to use on themselves.Cathleens spiritual hunger her need to be loved and worthy of love, her longing for comfort as well as sacrifice brings its share of anguish, shame and confusion.Ms. Qualleys performance, and those of some of the supporting cast, notably Morgan Saylor and Rebecca Dayan, convey the difficulties these women face.Ms. Betts refrains from easy, uplifting answers and facile condemnations of organized religion.Aided by Kat Westergaards warm, restrained cinematography, she takes the viewer close to an understanding of Cathleens evolving sense of her relationship with God.
Review: In ‘All I See Is You,’ Sight Is Restored and a Marriage Rocked:::::Photo All I See Is You is halfway through before something resembling a plot kicks in, and even then this limp, shape-shifting psychodrama proves unable to sell it with anything approaching coherence.Yet the director, Marc Forster (who wrote the script with Sean Conway), fashions such a languid, tipsy aesthetic around the seemingly happy marriage of Gina and James (Blake Lively and Jason Clarke) that its easy to keep watching.Legally blind since childhood, Gina rarely leaves their home in Bangkok, relying almost entirely on the attentive James.But when a cornea transplant restores vision to one eye, Gina discovers that her life is not quite as she imagined.Nor is she.New erotic interests surface during a trip to Spain, where the hypersexualized marriage of her sister and brother-in-law nudges the film into seamier territory and prompts a change in Ginas appearance.As James becomes increasingly destabilized by his wifes transformation, the movie seems keen to linger over what can happen to a relationship when a previously dependent partner gains agency.Video Instead, were hastened toward a nonsensical, almost illegible ending that lays waste to all this careful mood-setting.Ms. Lively is well cast, gracefully patrolling the boundary of her limited range, with Mr. Clarke less steady in the more amorphous role of someone who seems a bit off from the outset.And though the milky visual disruptions that signal Ginas initially blurry view of the world are overdone, theres something seductive about her journey that cries out for a filmmaker like Nicolas Roeg.In his hands, the haze of sex and danger that surrounds these two might have been revealed as more than just a tease.
Review: ‘Mully’ Is a Man Dedicated to Saving Kenya’s Orphans:::::Photo Mully isnt much in the way of cinema.But its courageous subject makes this documentarys shortcomings easier to overlook.Charles Mully was born in Kenya and abandoned by his family at 6; he later stole and begged on the streets.Through the generosity of strangers, hard work and some prayer, he not only found a job but became wealthy by running several companies, including a bus service and oil and gas ventures.To the surprise of his wife and eight children, Mr. Mully one day decided to give up business and devote his resources to Nairobis orphans.He turned his residence into a shelter, moving in dozens of homeless Kenyans (while sending some of his own children away to boarding schools).Later he built an orphanage that has housed and fed thousands; a farm there is dedicated to environmentally friendly agriculture.Scott Haze, the director, is eager to inspire.Interviews show Mr. Mully to be resolute, and his family kindhearted.Yet the films tone sometimes turns repetitive.In one short section, a few orphans tell of their lives before meeting Mr. Mully.Their brutal recollections are essential to hear, but Mr. Haze hurriedly retreats from those and other harsh topics.Just as vexing, redundant voice-overs describe what is being shown; while Mr. Mully speaks of events, scripted scenes re-enact them.Mully nods toward its subjects religious faith but refrains from preachiness.Mr. Mullys actions speak for themselves, and his robust personality makes him a pleasure to listen to.If the film doesnt always dig deeply into this mans life, we still see the results of his efforts.Those are enough to admire.
Review: In ‘Thank You for Your Service,’ the War at Home:::::Photo The most relevant movie precursor to Thank You for Your Service, an earnest and powerful drama about Iraq veterans returning to Kansas, is not The Hurt Locker, or the well-meaning but toothless coming-home dramas released during the Bush years (Stop-Loss, The Lucky Ones), or even American Sniper, written by Jason Hall, who wrote the screenplay for this film, his feature directing debut.Its Of Men and War, a 2015 documentary shot at the Pathway Home in Yountville, Calif., a center designed to reacclimate veterans to civilian life and also where one of the characters in Thank You for Your Service winds up.Of Men and War demanded that viewers witness the psychic scars of fighting, measuring them as part of wars cost along with the dead and more visibly wounded.Mr. Hall, working in a more sentimental, multiplex-friendly mode, makes the same point here.The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Posts David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book.Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect.(One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiance has left him, has been added to the mix.)Video The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq.He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichs) and young children.He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wifes friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning.As with Adam, part of Tausolos trouble is admitting his problems to himself.The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than American Sniper (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones).Instead, Thank You for Your Service is a macho weepie, whose message that wars are permanent for those who fight in them has broad appeal.
Review: ‘Bill Nye: Science Guy,’ a Portrait of a Fighter for Facts:::::Photo In the film Bill Nye: Science Guy, Mr. Nye, the 1990s childrens-television personality with the signature bow tie, warns of an anti-science movement afoot in this country.And this delightful, revealing documentary, directed by David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg, offers evidence supporting that assessment.Mr. Nye, who left his Emmy-winning series after around 100 episodes, has embraced a new mission: educating an older generation as he champions space exploration and challenges creationists and climate-change deniers.In TV clips, Sarah Palin impugns Mr. Nyes credentials, and an Obama-era Donald J. Trump declares, Our president is worried about global warming what a ridiculous situation.Joe Bastardi, the former chief long-range forecaster at AccuWeather and a frequent Fox News guest, insists that extreme weather is merely meteorological variation, not the result of human-caused global warming.(Mr. Nye is polite but resolute as he argues with Mr. Bastardi during a visit to his home.)As we stand here, the Juno spacecraft just went into orbit around Jupiter, Mr. Nye says.Its an extraordinary accomplishment of engineering and rocket science.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here is anti-science, he adds, gesturing in the direction of the Kentucky tourist attractions the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, whose exhibits present such sights as prehistoric humans cohabiting, Flintstone-like, with dinosaurs, and a sauropod (a dinosaur species) dwelling on Noahs ark.Mr. Nye debates the museums chief executive, Ken Ham, on a stage, though his efforts only galvanize Mr. Hams supporters.The documentary also follows Mr. Nyes work as chief executive of the Planetary Society, as he collaborates with the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and spearheads the LightSail project (a small spacecraft powered by photons from the sun), a tribute to Mr. Nyes mentor Carl Sagan.And it accompanies Mr. Nye to Greenland, where he witnesses melting ice caps and ice-core studies revealing climate temperatures of centuries past and our fossil-fuel-poisoned present.
Review: In ‘Félicité,’ a Mother Scrambles to Save Her Son:::::Photo In Flicit, Vro Tshanda Beya Mputu plays the title character, a singer and single mother in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The movie opens in a lively bar, full of gyrating, intoxicated folk, whom Flicit and the band entertain all night with infectious songs filled with blue notes.(The music is provided by the well-regarded Kasai Allstars.)The next day, shes got troubles with her refrigerator and negotiations with a local handyman.Then, some bad news: Her teenage son has been grievously injured in a motorbike accident.He needs an immediate and immediately paid-for operation.In an ordinary movie this would set off a race-against-the-clock scenario.But Flicit, written and directed by the Franco-Senegalese filmmaker Alain Gomis, is an unconventional treatment of an emergency.At crucial junctures in Flicits desperate scramble to raise funds for her sons medical care, Mr. Gomis, who wrote the screenplay with Olivier Loustau and Delphine Zingg, expands time instead of compressing it.Flicit still has her job to do, after all.This movie aspires to depict real life, not life as cinema is often inclined to idealize it; by the same token, it is hardly a work of naturalism.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Gomiss cinematic style is spectacularly multifaceted.The camerawork and cutting often have the fleetness of a documentary, but theres nothing sloppy about them.(The cinematography is by Cline Bozon, the editing by Fabrice Rouaud and the director.)
Review: In Folsom State Prison, ‘The Work’ Sets You Free:::::Photo The main takeaway from the prison-therapy documentary The Work (besides the fact that watching grown men scream and grovel is not for the fainthearted), is that crime in this country could be drastically reduced if only more fathers were around to raise their sons.That may seem a simplistic, even flippant conclusion.But hearing inmate after inmate describe an absent or emotionally withholding father as the source of his mental anguish renders it also an inescapable one.Set mainly in a single, stone-walled room in Folsom State Prison in California, this fly-on-the-wall study by Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous follows three variously troubled non-inmates over four days of intense group therapy with a passel of maximum-security convicts.Video Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels unseemly to witness, The Work is enlightening yet also punishing.Even more disturbing than one of the crimes described and the near-constant background howls is the convicts willingness to bare their souls for the nosing-around camera.Some offenders have been attending these sessions (run by an admirable nonprofit dedicated to inmates personal growth) for years, and the brothers-in-arms lingo of the 12-step program flows easily.The mens wrenching revelations and raging breakdowns appear brave and genuine; but how far can we trust behavior that at some point could be factored into parole decisions?For one quiet outside visitor, warily watching these agonized displays, the pressure to follow suit is palpable.I didnt come here looking to cry, he says, and I dont want to feel like Im letting them down if I dont.His guardedness is the movies most relatable moment.
Review: ‘The Divine Order’ Recalls the Fight for Women’s Suffrage in Switzerland:::::Photo If its startling that the 19th Amendment, which enshrined womens voting rights across the United States, is less than 100 years old, The Divine Order is set in Switzerland, where the equivalent constitutional amendment establishing the right for women to vote at the federal level didnt pass until 1971.The Divine Order examines that fight for womens suffrage in a microcosm.Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging 60s.(To judge from the films grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decades tie-dyed palette.)The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the towns women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself.The more we push, the more the men do what they want, she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum.Noras days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony.If Noras name werent enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as my little bird.But soon Nora is moved to act.Noras rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison.Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law.A small act of defiance against the towns leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them.Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt.Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, The Divine Order doesnt exactly break new ground.It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy.The composer, Annette Focks, supplies an array of insistent Spielbergian music cues, and the film hinges on a pair of big-speech scenes.Still, The Divine Order effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process.Collective silence, whether its from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent.That message gives Ms. Volpes lark a timely edge.
2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History:::::Advertisement 2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History We tracked horrors rise at the box office over the decades.This year, led by It and Get Out, really has outpaced all others.Image Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) in "It," which has been a smash success at the box office.Credit Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.This year, scary clowns, scary dolls and scary suburbanites have drawn audiences to the movies in droves.Even with two months remaining, 2017 has already become the biggest box office year ever for horror.Scary movies have collected $733 million in ticket sales, according to the website Box Office Mojo .The runaway success of It (more than $300 million and counting) and Get Out ($175 million) led the way, but October is a golden month for horror and will surely add more to that tally.Happy Death Day was No.1 when it opened this month (on Friday the 13th), and a new entry in the hit Saw franchise, Jigsaw (due Oct. 27), should also raise the total.How has horror fared at the box office in previous decades?Going back to the 1970s, I used data from Box Office Mojo to track the genres rise as a moneymaking force, focusing on one key year from each decade.Box Office Mojo breaks horror down into 10 subcategories on its site and its editor, Brad Brevet, has struggled with the question of what constitutes a horror movie.He tried to bring some clarity with a new list.When It came out I created an R-rated horror list on Mojo, he wrote in an email.That, at least, felt representative of the horror genre.We used the R-rated list as a reference point, but the highest-grossing year for each decade is based on figures collected from all the films the site considers horror.Also, these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (which would turn The Exorcist into a $983 million earner).The 1970s Biggest Year: 1973, $232.9 million Image Linda Blair in "The Exorcist," with a box office take that dwarfed that of all other horror films in the '70s.Credit Warner Bros.In the early 1970s, horror broke into the mainstream in a big way, primarily with the astronomical success of The Exorcist in 1973, which alone topped the collective total of any box office year in the decade.(This figure includes box office receipts from the films later rereleases.We went with lifetime grosses in this analysis for consistencys sake.)That movie aside, horror didnt make much of an impression that year.And it was really films released later in the decade that would prove pivotal.The popularity of Halloween in 1978 ($47 million) showed that slasher films could be a force.And 1979 brought the blockbuster haunted house scares of The Amityville Horror ($86.4 million) and the influential space scares of Alien ($80.9 million).That film captured a mass audience with a return of sorts to the creature features of classic horror.The 1980s Biggest Year: 1987, $293.6 million Image Freddy (Robert Englund) was still going strong in "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3."Credit New Line Cinema The slasher genre came into its own in the 80s, with the introduction of Jason in Friday the 13th (1980) and Freddy in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).Those franchises produced buckets of blood and cash ($380.6 million total for Friday and $370.5 million for Elm Street).1987 was one of the decades most profitable.Elm Street was in its third installment ($44 million), The Lost Boys added young vampire thrills to the mix ($32 million) and the action horror of Predator (a movie that probably wouldnt have existed without the success of Alien) brought in strong numbers ($59 million).The 1990s Biggest Year: 1999, $574.6 million Image Heather Donahue in the found-footage hit "The Blair Witch Project."Credit Artisan Entertainment The early part of the 90s saw few major horror blockbusters.Daniel Loria, the editorial director of Boxoffice Media , cites the rise of home video in the late 80s as the reason for the dip.In a phone interview, he said that many horror films bypassed theaters for home video.A B-side horror film like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre might not have played in theaters had it been made in the late 80s or early 90s, he said.It might have just gone straight to video for a quick buck.Things looked up in the latter half of the decade, with the revival of the slasher genre through the Scream franchise ($331.7 million).And then, 1999 brought a new revolution via The Blair Witch Project, a lowest-of-budgets found-footage movie shot on video that scared up a phenomenal $140.5 million, along with many copycats.The Aughts Biggest Year: 2000, $617.7 million Image A scene from "Scream 3," released in 2000, a strong year for horror at the box office.Credit Dimension Films The 2000s began by coasting on a wave of Scream popularity.While that franchise added sequels, the 2000 parody Scary Movie pulled in $157 million.(It ranked No.9 for the year, followed by the high-end horror drama What Lies Beneath at No.10.)Later during this decade, found footage was replaced by slick yet gruesome torture horror like the Saw films, which have taken in $415.9 million so far.And reboots of earlier horror movies became a trend.2009 featured a number of these films, including a reboot of Friday the 13th, a sequel to a reboot of Halloween and the sixth entry in the Saw series.But the jaw-dropper that year wasParanormal Activity.A return to low-budget found footage, the film had a $15,000 production budget , according to Box Office Mojo, and made $107.9 million.The 2010s Biggest Year: 2017, $733.5 million Image Daniel Kaluuya in "Get Out," Jordan Peele's hit from earlier this year.Credit Universal Pictures 2017 has seen several strong performers from one of the most successful contemporary horror producers around, Jason Blum (Get Out, Split, Happy Death Day).But the biggest story is the tremendous run of It.That Stephen King adaptation perked up the domestic box office after a dismal August, and not even box office experts predicted just how well the movie would perform.Mr. Loria of Boxoffice Media said his team forecast an $81 million opening weekend.The real number was $123 million.He said they look at social media mentions to see how vocal audiences are being about a title.When it came to It, Mr. Loria said, it was just really difficult to track the word It across social media to get the snapshot we needed.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page AR 19 of the New York edition with the headline: Its

Weinstein Company Will Not Get Planned Cash Infusion:::::On Monday, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the studio, examining whether allegations against Mr. Weinstein reflect broad gender discrimination and other civil rights violations.On Tuesday, an aspiring actress, Dominique Huett, sued the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles Superior Court, accusing it of negligence.She became the first woman to take legal action against the studio since The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment and rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein.In her complaint, Ms. Huett said Mr. Weinstein had lured her to a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 with a promise to discuss acting roles and instead forced her to engage in sex acts.A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment on the suit on Wednesday.The suit contends that the Weinstein Company had a duty to control Weinstein in his interactions with women during meetings taking place within the course and scope of his employment.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio on Oct. 8, has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Part of Colonys calculus appears to involve the likelihood that other women will sue the studio.More than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Mr. Weinstein.In remarks to Bloomberg Television on Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Barrack was attending a business conference, he said that sorting through which potential liabilities are attributable to the company on an ongoing basis, and which arent, is a Rubiks Cube.Adding to the complexity, no one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey, Mr. Barrack said.In other words: Would it be possible to structure a sale so that Mr. Weinstein did not benefit financially?Mr. Weinstein owns roughly 20 percent of the studio.His brother, Bob, owns an identical share.The rest is owned by about 25 investors, who hold portions of varying sizes.Several major entertainment companies have looked at buying pieces of the Weinstein Company and come away with mixed to negative reactions, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Lionsgate had interest in only one of the studios coming films, Paddington 2, which is set for release in January.But even that family sequel has limited potential; the Weinstein Company mainly holds domestic rights.Endeavor, which owns the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the IMG sports and fashion business, took a look at the Weinstein Company to see if there was a way to protect clients who have projects in the works there.But it concluded that clients should instead use legal tactics to pry projects loose.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Endeavor-related projects include a film adaptation of the musical In the Heights, created by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegra Hudes; a documentary about President Trump by Michael Moore; and a planned adaptation of The Boys in the Boat, Daniel James Browns book about the American rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.Even before the sexual harassment crisis, the Weinsteins boutique studio was struggling.Film releases had become sporadic, and its library of old films had become less valuable because of the collapse of the DVD market and a 2010 deal to sell a substantial portion to prevent bankruptcy.The studio has made inroads in television, selling series to the likes of Amazon and Viacom and lining up potential shows with Showtime and Apple.But Amazon pulled the plug on its deal after the harassment scandal.Apple also walked away.Showtime said it would move forward with its project only if the Weinstein Company dropped out.Viacoms Paramount Network, formerly known as Spike, is moving forward with three series.In terms of existing shows, the Weinstein Companys primary asset is Project Runway, which airs on Lifetime.A scripted series, Scream, will return for a six-episode third season on MTV in the spring.
Streaming Halloween: Canon Classics and New Movies to Scream With:::::Photo In Halloween-season viewing prospects, theres good news and less-good news.The good news is that two stellar restorations of stone-cold horror classics were released recently.They are the amazing, amusing The Old Dark House, a 1932 horror comedy directed by James Whale, the maestro of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, and George A. Romeros seminal 1968 Night of the Living Dead, which had a long road to a beautiful new version.The less-good news is that these restorations are not yet available for streaming, but are likely to show up in time.The Living Dead restoration is distributed by Janus, whose stuff is regularly featured on the Criterion Channel of the service Filmstruck and Kanopy.(In the meantime, if they show up at a theater near you, I implore you to go.)Filmstruck is actually an excellent site for vintage horror this Halloween.Earlier this month the service featured premieres of six 1940s horror movies produced by Val Lewton for RKO Pictures.Lewton was a novelist-turned-producer of first-class taste, wide-ranging imagination and remarkable resourcefulness.In emphasizing that taste, critics have risked giving his nine RKO horror movies short shrift in terms of their potency in the fright department.While some Lewton pictures are more conventionally thrilling than others The Curse of the Cat People (1944) is an unusual kind of sequel and features a tone more poetic than spooky most of the movies still carry strong scares.In the original Cat People (1942), the European immigrant Irena (Simone Simon), bride of a Norman-Rockwell-type all-American (Kent Smith) fears that her sexual awakening will turn her into a deadly feline creature.The scenes of Irenas romantic rival Alice (Jane Randolph) seemingly stalked by a panther through Central Park and at an athletic club are still among the tensest ever executed in film.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Similarly, the director Jacques Tourneur, who was behind Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie (1943) gets an enormous amount of scare-mileage out of the sound of dripping water, a train going over a bridge and, finally, a bolted door and some terrifying sound effects in a stage-setting scene from The Leopard Man (1943).Cat People, Zombie, Curse and Leopard Man are all part of the Filmstruck package.The other two titles are The Body Snatcher (1945) and Bedlam (1946), both more horror-conventional in subject matter and star power.The Body Snatcher is derived from the Robert Louis Stevenson story and stars both Boris Karloff of Frankenstein and Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame its one of only six movies the horror heavyweights made together.A spectacularly ghoulish story of grave robbers and medical demonstrations in 19th-century Edinburgh, it builds to a dizzying pitch of delirium.So does Bedlam, also starring Karloff, another grim period piece set in an asylum.Because the Lewton productions were low-budget pictures meant to fill out double-features, theyre pretty concise, with not many reaching the 90-minute mark.As such, the lot can serve as terrific Halloween binge-watching.
Review: ‘The B-Side’ Is an Extraordinary Masterclass in Listening:::::Before he sets needle to vinyl, Mr. Berryman gives us a bit of matter-of-fact introduction to what we are about to hear and how this performance came into being.Several years ago, he had seen Early Shaker Spirituals.While working in a Chinese tea shop as a waiter, he met that shows director, the Wooster stalwart Kate Valk, and told her he had an idea for her.And so Ms. Valk wound up staging The B-Side.It is a task to which she and a design team overseen by Elizabeth LeCompte, the Wooster Groups artistic director, with lighting by Ryan Seelig and sound by Eric Sluyter have brought a rigorous elegance and clarity.Mr. Berrymans prefatory remarks are delivered with the smooth, Everyman diction you associate with actors doing voice-overs or pitching their rsums at auditions.It is not a tone that prepares you for the voice no, make that voices that subsequently emanate from Mr. Berryman and his two fellow performers, Philip Moore and Jasper McGruder.For what these men do is something you have probably done when alone at home.They sing along with the record, their voices layering and merging with, in this case, those of convicts doing hard labor a half-century ago.Perhaps unlike you, Mr. Berryman and company do so with a concentration, lucidity and visceral force that suggest profound and old acquaintance with the music.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I mean, really, really old as in centuries old.Not that any of these performers are geriatric.But they become conduits for the songs of prisoners who were themselves conduits for an oral tradition that stretches back to at least the early days of slavery in this country.This is music that feels viral not in the technological sense of current usage, but in the sense of residing in the bloodstream.Mr. Berryman occasionally annotates the separate numbers (there are 14 in total) with readings of passages from Mr. Jacksons book of oral history, Wake Up Dead Man: Hard Labor and Southern Blues.As in Mr. Berrymans introduction to the show, none of these descriptions is politically or emotionally shaded.Theyre neutral, so as not to block our view of the main event here.Thats the music, of course, and the recorded spoken-word toasts.Performed a cappella, the songs spin tales of mythologically mean prison guards, and loves and lives lost, and the backbreaking purgatory of unendingly repetitive physical tasks.The actors do not try to re-create the wood-hacking and hoeing that was the daily lot of the men they are channeling.Mostly, they are uncommonly still, conflating the acts of singing and listening.Gestures and movements are severely rationed, so that each one reads incisively.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Only once does Mr. Berryman fully cut loose, to deliver a parody of an evangelical spiel, which releases him from the aural backdrop of the record and has him sprinting into the audience as an animated cartoon of a money-collecting preacher.Entitled Daniel in the Lions Den, it is the penultimate piece in the show.For the final number, the work song Forty-Four Hammers, Mr. Berryman falls silent to become the quintessential listener again.He takes a chair and watches old grainy film showing an unbroken line of chain-gang members chopping wood in unison.(Robert Wuss is the video designer.)That found footage is projected against images, on a sleek monitor, of Mr. Berrymans apartment in Harlem, where his vinyl record collection fills shelves.His home could be said to have always been the setting for this show or rather any place where you feel safe developing an intense and intimate relationship with the art of others.
Review: ‘Red Roses, Green Gold’ Brings Back the Grateful Dead:::::Photo For an act to get the jukebox-musical treatment, hits are a minimum requirement.Abba, Frankie Valli and Carole King all had success on the charts before their music overtook Broadway with Mamma Mia!, Jersey Boys and Beautiful.The Grateful Dead had only one Top 10 song, Touch of Grey, and yet here is Red Roses, Green Gold, Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater.Not only that, but this is the third show the writer Michael Norman Mann has created using the Deads catalog, after Cumberland Blues in 1998 and Shakedown Street in 2005.Not too bad for a band whose reputation was built on intense touring and extended live jams.The good news is that the songs, which lean heavily on a classic Americana sound, are effective in a sit-down, smoke-free theatrical context.The show, which is billed as featuring the music of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter (Mr. Hunter was the Deads nonperforming lyricist), sometimes feels like a wacky relative of the Steve Martin and Edie Brickell Broadway bluegrass musical Bright Star.Photo Even better for non-Deadheads, Red Roses, Green Gold lasts just over two hours rather than four, with numbers that mostly clock in around three or four minutes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Unfortunately, Mr. Mann has shoehorned them into a cartoonishly corny story.Like Cumberland Blues, the show takes place in a theme-park version of a Maryland mining town in the 1920s, more specifically at the saloon and mining company owned by the debonair Jackson Jones (Scott Wakefield).Alas, a pair of scheming brothers (Brian Russell Carey and Michael McCoy Reilly) have their sights on taking over the Palace, which is that in name only.
Review: ‘Illyria’ Eavesdrops on a Young Joe Papp and Friends:::::Those uniquely topical dramas explored of-the-moment events through the eyes of two different families.They were vivid slice-of-life works in which meals were prepared and consumed, as the people onstage looked at a changing nation from their own beleaguered corner of it.Mr. Nelson takes a similarly sideways approach in Illyria, with more mixed results.If you dont know much about the real Joseph Papp (1921-1991), you may wonder what the hecks going on and why you should be interested.If you do know a lot about Papp and his associates, you may be a bit exasperated by the liberties Mr. Nelson has taken in bringing them to life.But Illyria also affords distinctive if fleeting pleasures that no one these days does better than Mr. Nelson.I mean the sense of experiencing life, in all its trivia and eventfulness, happening in a very specific moment, among people who know one another well.And once again, Mr. Nelson has assembled a fine cast that wears its alter egos with the ease of old cardigans.Photo Aside from Joe, only one of the characters is likely to be familiar to much of the audience.Thats the formidable actress Colleen Dewhurst (played by Rosie Benton), who is just beginning to forge a career in the late 1950s.In Illyria, she appears as the hostess of the last-minute birthday bash in the plays second scene, and she by no means dominates the proceedings.Though the scandalous professional behavior of her future husband, George C. Scott, is much discussed, Colleen is just one of many theatrical aspirants here, a band of almost equals still struggling to make a living.Shes part of Joes nascent New York Shakespeare Festival, which puts on plays from the canon for free in the citys parks.Others on the team include Joes actress wife, Peggy (Kristen Connolly), who has just had a baby; the press agent Merle Debuskey (Fran Kranz); the stage manager John Robertson (Max Woertendyke); and the composer David Amram (Blake DeLong).The resident director is Stuart Vaughan (John Sanders), whose wife, Gladys (Emma Duncan), is Joes assistant.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Local theater buffs may recognize the names of Mr. Debuskey and Mr. Vaughan, as well as that of another character, Bernie Gersten (Will Brill), a longtime friend of Papps who would become a producer at his Shakespeare Festival and later Lincoln Center.The dramatis personae is rounded out by Mary Bennett (Naian Gonzlez Norvind), a young actress new to this insular world.Mostly these people just talk and, this being a play by Mr. Nelson, eat (sandwiches, generally).The subjects of conversation melt and swirl and resurface in thick eddies.They include who to cast as Olivia in Twelfth Night, Peggys reluctant return to the stage and the consequences of Joes and Bernies being summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee for suspected Communist affiliations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The political taint of such presumed associations has put Joes fledging troupe in jeopardy, and we hear accounts of his run-ins with the citys parks department, then overseen by the mighty Robert Moses.Will the establishment put the kibosh on these maverick idealists?Will Twelfth Night in Central Park, the occasion for the plays third and final scene, be this troupes last production?These dramatic questions are not posed with histrionic flourish in Illyria.(The title comes from the fantastical setting for Twelfth Night.)Often they loom less large than romantic crosscurrents and nagging rivalries, particularly between Joe and the more successful Stuart, whom Mr. Sanders portrays with a canny subliminal smugness.Theatergoers expecting the explosions, resolutions and emotional payoffs of a conventionally well-made play are likely to leave Illyria frustrated.Though it verges on starry-eyed sentimentality in its final scene, most of this production designed with spot-on period detail by Susan Hilferty and Jason Ardizzone-West refrains from thematic signposting.Instead, it inhabits a landscape where the petty and the momentous are practically indistinguishable, and even the strongest feelings are muddied with ambivalence.The real Joe Papp, showman that he was, might have deemed Illyria too muted and inconclusive to be satisfying.Theatergoers with patience, though, will be rewarded by moments throughout when they will feel transformed into proverbial flies on the walls of a distant time and place.Real life is happening, as boring and confusing and riveting as it usually appears without the magnifying lens of hindsight.
Rock, Reminiscence and Sci-Fi Will Be Part of Under the Radar Festival:::::Photo The Public Theaters 2018 Under the Radar Festival will feature pieces inspired by the work of the pioneering science fiction writer Octavia Butler and the influential rock critic Lester Bangs, as well as an autobiographical show from the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik.The theater on Tuesday announced the lineup of the festival, which, in its 14th year, is dedicated to exposing audiences to works that fall outside of the mainstream.Among the troupes that gained recognition at the festival are Elevator Repair Service and the Belarus Free Theater.While Mark Russell, the festivals director, said he doesnt program according to a theme, he mentioned the show Parable of the Sower, based on the Butler novels Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents, as emblematic of the lineup.An operatic adaptation by the mother and daughter Toshi Reagon and Bernice Johnson Reagon, the dystopian story follows a young woman named Lauren as she moves through her life in a crumbling America.Photo Thats what we decided would be the heart of the festival and then I started moving from there, he said on Monday, pointing to Andrew Schneiders After and Dickie Beaus Hamlet-inspired Re-Member Me as other notable building blocks.
After Spacey Accusation, Netflix Announces End of ‘House of Cards’:::::Photo The day after Kevin Spacey apologized following an accusation that he made a sexual advance on a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s, Netflix announced that the next season of his show House of Cards would be its last.Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio behind the show, said in a statement Monday they were deeply troubled by last nights news concerning Kevin Spacey.Executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported, the statement said.As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.A Netflix spokeswoman said the decision to make the sixth season the shows last had been made months ago.Those episodes are scheduled to be released in 2018.Photo Mr. Spacey has played the lead character in House of Cards since it debuted in 2013, starring alongside Robin Wright and also serving as an executive producer.The political thriller was a breakthrough for Netflix, just as it was starting its efforts into producing original programming and offering subscribers an opportunity to watch an entire season of a new series in one fell swoop.Mr. Spaceys over-the-top performance as Frank Underwood has earned him five Emmy Award nominations.
Review: ‘Knives in Hens,’ a Wondrous Drama of the Lust for Language:::::For Knives is about the liberation that comes in creating language that matches perception.Or partly that.Those with a socio-economic bent might see it as a parable of the transition from rural to industrial society, while religious scholars could easily interpret it as a reimagining of the Garden of Eden myth.A feminist reading makes sense, too.And even fans of the fatal romantic triangles of film noir and James M. Cain novels will find substance to savor here.But for anyone whose first love is words, its the linguistic aspect of Knives in Hens that is so profoundly moving.And if that is your inclination, youll likely find your eyes welling whenever the plays central figure tries out new descriptions for everything around her, growing in confidence as she does so, but always still searching.Photo This character is identified only as Young Woman, and she is played here with a mesmerizing mix of rawness and delicacy by Robyn Kerr.Young Woman is the obedient and dependent wife of an older man (Shane Taylor), a farmer called Pony William for his affinity with horses.They would appear to inhabit an ancient world.(Mr. Harrower has written that he had 15th-century Scotland in mind.)Their needs are elemental food, shelter, sex and at first the Young Woman doesnt venture far beyond such perimeters.Yet a seed that will grow subversively is planted in her head in the first conversation we hear between this couple.He has evidently just likened her to a field, which she believes she definitely is not.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If Im like a field, I must be a field, she says with annoyance, as he tries to explain the comparison.But the metaphor or rather, the very idea of metaphor lodges in her imagination.And she finds herself increasingly hungry for words that would capture the ineluctable a puddle thats clear instead of muddy, the shaking of leaves on a tree in a landscape where things change every day.On an errand for her husband, she meets the plays third character, Gilbert Horn (Devin E. Haqq), the miller, who is both necessary to and despised by the crop-tending villagers.Gilbert owns books and, more important, a pen.And when the woman takes that pen in her hands, it seems to acquire a frenzied will of its own.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Takacs and his movement director, Yasmine Lee, who previously collaborated to haunting effect on Philip Ridleys Tender Napalm, give expressive life to the physical relationships among these characters.There are a few moments in which the staging is confusing in conveying plot twists, although a lyrical ambiguity often feels appropriate.The production is punctuated by a series of erotic pas de deux that suggest the satisfactions and limitations of sex.They are enacted, fittingly, within the claustrophobic confines of Steven C. Kemps rustic wooden set, lighted with hints of a mysterious world beyond by Dante Olivia Smith.Dressed in rough garments (by Sydney Gallas) that evoke the early days of the Western frontier, the cast speaks in largely uninflected American accents (though Ms. Kerr is identified as Jamaican Scottish in her program biography).The performances are precisely focused without being intensely emotional.Nonetheless, the sum effect of their talk and actions is deeply emotional.I have no name for the thing which is in my head, the Young Woman says at one point, with a wondering greed.At that moment, which follows her first experience with pen and paper, you know exactly what she means.And what a churning, fertile feeling it is.
Review: ‘M. Butterfly’ Returns to Broadway on Heavier Wings:::::Still reading?O.K.In M. Butterfly, our not-so-bright Gallimard a French embassy official stationed in Beijing in the 1960s falls head over heels for Song, who he thinks is a woman but is really a fetching young dude in Suzie Wong drag.That Gallimard (and his real-life prototype, Bernard Boursicot, whose case became an international scandal in the mid-1980s) failed to register the imposture has been the subject of much bewildered speculation and many jokes.(Check out the priceless Forbidden Broadway parody of the show.)Photo In the latest incarnation of the tale, Song is not merely a man pretending to be a woman.Hes a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be man who is pretending to be a woman.Got that?Never mind.Well get back to it later.This extra turn of the screw of pretense is also directly from the case history of Monsieur Boursicot (the subject of a fascinating book by The New York Times columnist Joyce Wadler).But for audiences who must digest an already complex story (did I mention that Song is a spy for the Chinese government?)within less than three hours of stage time, its a lot to assimilate.There is another, even more distracting problem.Once weve seen Mr. Ha who has a distinctly masculine cast of a jaw in boys clothes early on (thats when he says hes a man who works in drag as an actor in a Beijing opera house), its impossible to unsee him as that boy.Which makes Gallimard, our deluded protagonist, appear even more mentally challenged than usual.You could argue that such obtuseness is appropriate for a play that considers the blindness not only of love, but also of cultural and sexual imperialism.Yes, Gallimard, who has never had much luck with women before, is responding to the novelty of a beautiful actress improbably finding him attractive.But more important to the plays intriguing and ever timely central thesis is the fact that Song is Asian, perceived as a fragile lotus blossom waiting to be plucked by virile white hands, like the doomed heroine of Puccinis Madama Butterfly, Gallimards favorite opera.Such, it seems, is the Wests vision of the East.Mr. Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimards dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East.That includes the presumption that Vietnam would fall in a swoon before the manly forces of the United States.Song, whose mission as a spy is to elicit information from Gallimard about Frances involvement in Vietnam, speaks scornfully of a Western self-image involving big guns, big industry, big well, you know your own fantasies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But for M. Butterfly to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy.In this version, you always maintain the distance sometimes amused, sometimes appalled thats generated by your awareness of theatrical machinery churning away.Photo Dont blame Mr. Owen, who works skillfully and, well, manfully at becoming a wimp in a part memorably originated by John Lithgow (and played by Jeremy Irons in the 1993 film).Though he has established himself on screen as a thinking persons hunk (Children of Men, The Knick), Mr. Owen is surprisingly convincing here as someone who could never get a date in high school.The shows broken master of ceremonies, whom we meet in a French prison cell many years after the events recounted here, Gallimard does his best to frame the story of his relationship with Song as a love story worthy of tragic opera.As Mr. Owens Gallimard struggles to make facts succumb to romantic fiction, his discomfort in his own skin glistens like flop sweat.If only this production trusted more in its reliably unreliable narrator, and let us see a bit more through his bedazzled eyes.Instead, the show has a grinding Brechtian self-consciousness throughout, which calls harsh attention to its less than subtle ironies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Has arch Song seems to be all too demonstratively in on the cosmic joke being played on poor old Gallimard.Building up the role of Songs shrill Communist party liaison (Celeste Den) was a mistake.Though Enid Graham is fine in the thankless part of Gallimards wife, the character of his macho best friend (Murray Bartlett) remains an annoying device.Most disappointing for Ms. Taymors fans is the productions lack of the ravishing visuals she brought to The Lion King and her more recent A Midsummer Nights Dream.The tall, painted Chinese screens that frame each scene are alarmingly clunky and unsteady.(Paul Steinberg did the sets.)The two centerpiece dance sequences, choreographed by Ma Cong, feel scrappy, like numbers from a pared-down touring production of Miss Saigon.And Elliot Goldenthals original music and soundscapes are usually more intrusive than evocative.Such clumsiness sadly undermines a play that remains urgently relevant.Anyone doubting that Gallimards pipe dream of masculinity is still with us need only consult recent reports of the behavior of Hollywood moguls and American presidents or daily accounts of the United States military in quagmires on foreign soil.But even if the romance at the heart of M. Butterfly is toxic, we still need to be swept up by the tide of this crazy infatuation.In this incarnation, were not being seduced, but preached at.And Gallimards grand self-sacrifice seems more pathetic and unnecessary than it ever did before.
A New London Theater Aims to Stage a Revolution:::::Part of a glossy new development, the theater looks on to two of the citys most recognizable landmarks: Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.Photo Its two miles to the east of Londons Theaterland but it is a world away from the cramped facilities of the West Ends Victorian venues, with their restrictive proscenium arch layouts.The Bridges auditorium is fully flexible.The stage for Young Marx extends into the audience; the audience sits on three sides, with seats raked over four tiers.Yet the space feels remarkably intimate, and even the cheap seats costing under $20 have decent sightlines.Critics, lukewarm about the play but effusive about the venue, have been quick to point out the irony of opening Londons first wholly new, large-scale commercial theater in 80 years with a play about an critic of capitalism.Yet the theater is attempting to, well, bridge the usual approaches of the commercial and subsidized sectors in the UK.For starters, its largely dedicated to new writing a notoriously tricky sell at the box office.Few untested plays open in the West End.New writing can also suffer from a reputation for dry worthiness, a notion Mr. Hytner aims to dispel.New writing doesnt have to be a ghettoized, virtuous thing, he said.These are new shows that aim to communicate widely.And if were ever going to find a Curious Incident or The History Boys, theyre going to be new things.Mr. Hytner also insisted that there is a big audience out there.They flock to the shows they want to see, he said.A lot of them musicals, quite a lot of them not.Indeed, a raft of plays have transferred from subsidized theaters to the West End in recent years including new writing from venues such as the Almeida (Ink; King Charles III) and the Royal Court (The Ferryman; Hangmen) as well as the National.Advertisement Continue reading the main story New writing is always risky, but the work has been so good, audiences are more receptive now, said Nica Burns, a West End producer who credits the increasing collaboration between subsidized and commercial theaters.This is why we have such a healthy theater, with so many plays in the West End compared to Broadway.Photo The Bridges investors seem convinced that if an appetite for bold new plays has been nourished by thriving government-funded theaters and a culture of transfers, they can be originated in a commercial venue in the first place.The 12 million, or about $16 million, construction costs were raised upfront from venture capitalists.But the model is based on the two Nicks experience running a building, and theyre deliberately swerving away from the more usual path of renting a theater.A West End producer puts up all the money, takes all the risk, and because there are so many fighting for relatively few theaters, they have to take the terms youd expect, Mr. Hytner said.He added that they dont get the revenue from the bars, the programs, the ice creams.I know from the National that the profit margin on ice-cream is something you want to keep!Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Owning the Bridge means Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr have the opportunity to rake those retail profits in.But crucially, it also means theyll avoid the particular pressure of budgeting on a show-by-show basis.We dont have to show a return on every single play, Mr. Hytner said.Its a cash-flow business.That graph can go up and down quite considerably, but if we play at over 75 percent were doing brilliantly.Thats not even really a target because if, say, Julius Caesar plays to 95 percent it doesnt really matter what the plays either side of it do.Such long-view financial flexibility will allow Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr to program the work they like: theater which is ambitious, as Mr. Hytner defines it.And theres surely another lesson from the subsidized sector: To be ambitious, you have to be able to afford to fail sometimes.Mr. Hytner is evidently relieved to have shrugged off the burden of overseeing a national institution, however.Everybody knows what a National Theater should be, what the repertoire should be, he said.The fact is that everyone, of course, knows differently.Now, he is free to do as he pleases just so long as what pleases him pleases the audience.
The Rockettes Own Christmas. But Spring Is a Tough Nut to Crack.:::::Devising a new annual entertainment tradition in an era when people have so many options, however, has bedeviled producers across fields like theater, circus, art, and concert festivals.The Christmas Spectacular is spectacularly successful, but a strong part of its pull is nostalgia and tradition, said Drew Hodges, the founder of SpotCo Advertising who worked on Rockettes projects in the past, and is now an independent consultant for producers of live entertainment.Its difficult to build a new tradition it takes years and even harder to create a family-friendly entertainment that fills 6,000 seats a night, referring to the seating capacity at Radio City Music Hall.Time would seem to have run out for this coming spring.None of the behind-the-scenes work needed to mount a major new production is taking place, and this month the Tony Awards said it would return to Radio City on June 10, all but precluding a late-spring show as well.Rhonda Malkin, a dance coach who has trained dozens of Rockettes, noted that the company has tried and failed to create various shows for the group over the last 15 years.She admired the most recent iteration of the late-spring show, overseen by the choreographer Mia Michaels, and said that Rockettes were excited to perform it again.Photo Radio City tends to build a big show and then at the last minute either do away with it or change it or not put it up, Ms. Malkin said.For years now, Madison Square Garden Company has faltered in its artistic choices for a new Rockettes franchise a creative development process that started becoming bumpy in 2014 because of Mr. Weinstein, the film mogul who was fired as co-chairman of the Weinstein Company this month amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.That year, Mr. Weinstein played a key role in the decision to scrap a multimillion-dollar new springtime Rockettes show, Heart and Lights.He did not have an official role on the production, but attended a run-through with his friend Mr. Dolan, and was among those voicing doubts about the shows book and songs.The show was canceled, and its creative team was soon gone, including Linda Haberman, the respected artistic director of the Rockettes since 2006.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The following year Mr. Weinstein was brought onboard to overhaul the show and serve as its producer.He remade it and brought on a raft of stars, but it was not a success: Reviewing it in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood praised the Rockettes but little else, describing the show as a numbingly overblown 90-minute infomercial.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Another shake-up was ordered for 2016.Mr. Weinstein was no longer its producer, Ms. Michaels became its new director and choreographer, and the playwright Douglas Carter Beane wrote a new script.But that version was not a success either.A Madison Square Garden Company earnings report issued for the fourth quarter of 2016 said that it took in less revenue due to fewer scheduled performances, a result of a shift in the timing of the productions run from the spring to the summer, and, to a lesser extent, lower per-show revenue.Last winter there were indications that another overhaul was in the works.After a number of Rockettes expressed concerns about performing at the inauguration of President Trump, Marie Claire magazine published leaked remarks that Mr. Dolan made to a group of the dancers.I dont believe its going to hurt the brand, the magazine quoted him as saying.And nobody is more concerned about that than the guy sitting in this chair.Im about to spend $50 million remounting this summer show.Im going to spend a similar amount remounting next years Christmas show.I gotta sell tickets.But in February the Madison Square Garden Company announced that it would not be going forward with its 2017 show by Ms. Michaels after all.It said it would take a one-year hiatus, adding that we remain committed to the production and look forward to the shows return in 2018.Several Rockettes had been eager to return to Ms. Michaelss show, according to Ms. Malkin.The show was expected to include a mix of precision dancing and other choreography that was different from the Christmastime production.As a former Rockette and dancer, I thought it was refreshing to see the Rockettes do a different style and do it so incredibly well with the precision aspect in tact, Ms. Malkin said.But in terms of where the audience as a whole is coming from, I guess they were expecting more of what they see for Christmas.
Broadway’s Comic Chameleon Writes a Heartfelt New Tune:::::That, too, was wrong.Mr. Yazbek doesnt smoke.Photo Its a musical chameleons curse, and maybe his protection, that people dont have any idea, sonically or otherwise, who he really is.Those familiar with Mr. Yazbek as Broadways go-to songwriter for comedy film adaptations probably havent heard his solo work as frontman for a series of rock bands with names like Coke Machine, Moon Pudding, Barn and His Warmest Regards.And vice versa: Those who groove to his sulfurous, often cheerfully pessimistic albums, with songs like Monkey Baby Hanging on a Chicken Wire and Ultrasad, would probably be surprised by brassy show tunes like Here I Am and unironic ballads like Breeze Off the River.Which is why its understandable that the talk around Broadway about Mr. Yazbek and The Bands Visit, which opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 9 in a production directed by Mr. Cromer, is so wrong.This delicate, contemplative and thoroughly gorgeous musical, first seen last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not represent, as some say, Mr. Yazbeks unlikeliest disguise to date.Quite the opposite.The Bands Visit is the truest version of him Broadway has yet heard, or is ever likely to.All my life Ive written songs, right?he half-asks, half-demands, lying like an analysand on a couch in the studio he built a few yards from his house in Rockland County.Unlike most people in analysis, though, he noodles gently on a bass as he speaks.Ive made five albums that have nothing to do with musical theater, he continues.And, like most singer-songwriters, my motive for writing them was to tell people what I was thinking and feeling.That usually has to do with human connection and death, in a good way: How life is ennobled by the fact of death, and is deeper than what we run around frittering about all day.He pauses and plinks.But unlike my other shows, in which I had a real but superficial connection to the characters issues, almost every song in The Bands Visit gives me the feeling that Ive expressed something I feel deeply about.Photo Photo If thats a tall order for a musical, The Bands Visit is unusually ambitious, its many comic moments woven like countermelodies into a story of human beings crying from the heart in joy or pain, as Mr. Yazbek puts it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With a book by Itamar Moses, based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, it concerns a ragtag Egyptian police orchestra that gets stranded in the wrong Israeli town en route to a gig at an Arab cultural center.Instead of exciting Petah Tikvah, with a P, they wind up in a stultifying Negev outpost called Bet Hatkivah, with a B like in basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah, as one of Mr. Yazbeks dead-on lyrics puts it.The theme is miscommunication, including the romantic kind: the terrible gap between what we feel and what we say.In The Bands Visit, the only cure is music, and yet it isnt enough.The Egyptians and the Israelis reach out to one another on waves of melody, from ethereal Arab song to thumping klezmer.Two in particular the bands leader, Tewfiq (Tony Shalhoub), and Dina, who houses him (Katrina Lenk) nearly find a common language.But even they eventually have to acknowledge the emptiness, if perhaps a slightly less empty emptiness, that seeps back when melody passes.Video This theme and setting made The Bands Visit a natural playground for Mr. Yazbek, who grew up on Manhattans Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father and a half Jewish, half Italian mother.For a song about the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, he could call on his own memory of her voice on the radio in a cab while visiting his grandfather in Lebanon.To shape the scores swirling contours, he did not have to study Middle Eastern scales or Egyptian instrumentation; he was already handy on darbouka (a goblet-shaped drum) and oud (a short-necked lyre).He was also in a good position to translate what he calls the sound of Israeli sarcasm.But he had a surfeit of other sounds as well.Growing up surrounded by every kind of music Kiss Me, Kate and Miles Davis on the stereo, the polyrhythms of congas in Central Park he developed an early and eclectic ear.He started his first band, whose name cannot be published here, when he was 12; played gigs for a thousand students at college block parties; landed a solo recording contract at 28.Another lifetime later, at 57, though married (to Elizabeth Doberneck, a meditation teacher) and with a son, Omar, in college, Mr. Yazbek retains the slightly hassled aura of a man who has almost made peace with his work or, maybe more accurately, a man who remakes that peace every day.(He, too, meditates.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This is a vast improvement over the person who seemed to be jumping out of his skin when I first encountered him in the Full Monty era.Back then, he seemed embarrassed that, of all the roads open to him, hed found his biggest success on the one that led to Broadway, with its corny philosophies and unprovoked belting.Among the roads less taken was comedy.Directly out of Brown, he wrote for David Letterman, part of a Late Show team that won an Emmy Award in 1984.(His favorite bit was called The Most Dangerous Game, in which a pack of bloodhounds searched 30 Rock for the announcer Bill Wendell.)And his career as a solo musical artist never took off the way he had planned though that was, he says, his own fault.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I made my own bed when I decided not to tour all the time, he explains.There were guys like Ben Folds and Dave Matthews who started off at the same time, doing what I should have done: get in a van with a baby grand, go up and down the East Coast circuit and make a subsistence living while developing a fan base.But if I doomed myself by staying home, it turns out it was a great doom.Now all those guys are sick of touring and want to write musicals.Even so, for a long time the regret was easily read on his face.The man-dudes in his poker game, hoping to annoy him into making mistakes, insisted on calling him Broadways David Yazbek.That taunt would have been incomprehensible during the so-called Golden Age of musicals.Loesser, Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim, three of Mr. Yazbeks idols, could aspire to nothing higher than Broadway success though Mr. Sondheim, coming at the end of the line, eventually grew so disheartened that he threatened to give up musicals for murder mysteries or video games.Its worth noting that what toppled theater music from its position as the prime engine of popular culture was the same trend that Mr. Yazbek was hoping to ride: the rise of the rock singer-songwriter.Mr. Yazbek has played both sides of the fence, bringing to each discipline the skills and, well, the discipline of the other.Thanks to rock, he writes musical theater lyrics that arise from their stories at unexpected angles and with a looser diction than most of the classics.The rhymes in The Bands Visit are accurate enough to get laughs (awful/falafel; marrow/Pharaoh) but not obsessively mitered.Thanks to musical theater, his rock songs are tighter and better structured than almost anyones.And after decades in which critics openly prayed for a savior to resuscitate theater music with the primal energies of pop, perhaps we can now see that Mr. Yazbek has been doing it, insufficiently heralded, for years.(He received Tony Award nominations for all three of his previous Broadway scores, but has never won.)In the shadow of The Producers, The Full Monty was a marginal hit; Dirty Rotten Scoundrels recouped only on the road.Women on the Verge, through no fault of Mr. Yazbeks, was a major flop (though a revised version met with more success in London).Even The Bands Visit, despite its Off Broadway raves, is nobodys idea of a sure thing.Mr. Yazbek would, of course, love a hit, but his pleasure in the work itself acts as a kind of professional prophylaxis.He has nearly completed the score for a musical version of the 1982 hit film Tootsie as flat-out a musical comedy as you could imagine and is working on the lyrics to Henry Kriegers music for a show about the evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker.The luxury of writing only what he wants, while recording the occasional solo album, is enough, he says, to service my pretensions.Servicing his spiritual aspirations is a different matter.This used to require performing in public: The connection you make while sharing in the creation of music with other people in real time, he says, is the closest metaphor for the actual connection that every sentient being has, way beneath the surface, at the root of truth.Photo Now, he says, he can achieve that connection without so much performing.Still, after certain performances, when company members gather outside the Barrymore or beneath its stage for a jam session of Arabic music, Mr. Yazbek sometimes joins in.On a recent evening, after a two-show day, he grabbed a spare drum from the darbouka player Ossama Farouk, while George Abud, who plays Camal in the musical, improvised on his oud, with Ms. Lenk on violin.They fed one another melodies like canaps.A few rugs and lanterns could not disguise the grimness of what was actually the musicians locker room, with costume racks pressing in.But as the four worked through El Hayah Helwa (Life Is Beautiful) by Farid al-Atrash, and an Umm Kulthum song called Awedt Ainy, which Mr. Abud translated as Im Addicted to You, all the discomforts disappeared.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And so, after a while, with a huge smile, did Mr. Yazbek.He got what he wanted, and was gone.
5 Shows to See if You’re in New York in November:::::Photo New Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be.This citys theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places.Consider some of the new productions opening this month.Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America.And, oh yes, space as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.The Bands Visit Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel.But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies.A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.Tickets: thebandsvisitmusical.com Brigadoon Photo Perhaps the ultimate escape from New York fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress.City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location.Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of An American in Paris, and the cast includes Kelli OHara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too).Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of Brigadoon will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tickets: nycitycenter.org The Wolves Photo First seen in a Playwrights Realm production last year, Sarah DeLappes high-voltage drama of young women coming of age on AstroTurf is being remounted at the Mitzi E.

Netflix Suspends Production of ‘House of Cards’:::::Photo Production on the final season of House of Cards was suspended Tuesday, two days after its star, Kevin Spacey, was accused of having made an unwanted sexual advance toward a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s.In a statement, Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio behind the show, said production was being halted to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.On Monday, executives from both companies spoke to the cast and crew of House of Cards in Baltimore, where production of its sixth season had recently gotten underway.The streaming service announced on Monday that the season would be the shows last.A spokeswoman for Netflix said that decision had been reached months ago, long before the allegation against Mr. Spacey.On Sunday, BuzzFeed reported an allegation by the actor Anthony Rapp that Mr. Spacey had made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in the 1980s, when he was 14 and Mr. Spacey was in his mid-20s.Mr. Spacey released a statement shortly after the article was published in which he said that he did not recall the episode but attributed it to deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.The decision to stop production raises questions about whether it will resume, and, if it does, whether Mr. Spacey will return to the series.Also on Tuesday, Variety reported that the start-up MasterClass had pulled Mr. Spaceys $90 online acting lesson videos from its site.Over the summer, production for the ABC reality show Bachelor in Paradise was shut down after an allegation of sexual misconduct on the shows set.Production resumed after an investigation turned up no wrongdoing.
Kevin Spacey Issues Apology to Actor After Sexual Accusation:::::Photo Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, apologized Sunday night for what he said would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior after the actor Anthony Rapp made an accusation about his sexual conduct with him 31 years ago, when Mr. Rapp was 14 years old.Mr. Spacey, who has long been fiercely private about his personal life, said in a statement that he did not remember any such encounter, but added that Mr. Rapps accusation has encouraged me to address other things about my life.He then disclosed that he had loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man.The rapid cycle of accusation and apology began Sunday evening, when BuzzFeed published an article in which Mr. Rapp alleged that Mr. Spacey was trying to get with me sexually after a party at Mr. Spaceys apartment in 1986.After all the other guests had left, Mr. Rapp said that Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold.But I dont, like, squirm away initially, because Im like, Whats going on?And then he lays down on top of me.Mr. Rapp, who is best known for playing the character Mark Cohen in the original Broadway production of Rent, confirmed the contents of the article and said he had decided to speak out at a time when several women have accused the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.Photo I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me, Mr. Rapp said in an emailed statement.Everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article, and I have no further comment about it at this time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Spacey had not responded to requests for comment from BuzzFeed.But a few hours after the article was published, he posted a statement to Twitter, saying he was horrified but did not remember the encounter.Mr. Rapp said he met Mr. Spacey in 1986 when both were performing in Broadway shows.Mr. Rapp was a child actor in a new play called Precious Sons, while Mr. Spacey, then 26, was performing in a revival of Long Days Journey Into Night.Mr. Rapp told BuzzFeed that he met Mr. Spacey at a Broadway party that year, and that Mr. Spacey invited him to the party where the sexual advance occurred.
Donald Trump and Michael Moore Quarrel Over Broadway Show:::::Photo Well, Michael Moore succeeded in getting the presidents attention.On Saturday evening, six days after The Terms of My Surrender, Mr. Moores solo show decrying President Trump, closed on Broadway, the president took a gleeful jab at the liberal provocateur on Twitter.Mr. Trumps assertion that the show was forced to close is incorrect.The show had been announced in May as a 12-week limited run, and it ran the full 12 weeks.Michael Moores Broadway show was always meant to be a limited engagement, said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show.It closed, as planned, on Sunday, Oct. 22.It was not forced to close early.Mr. Trumps assertion that the show was a total bomb is a matter of opinion, and in a barrage of tweets late Saturday, Mr. Moore declared his show a smash hit before touting his production and taunting the president.Given the shows limited run and modest grosses, neither the phrase total bomb nor smash hit seems to be a precise description of its financial performance.The capitalization costs are not public for The Terms of My Surrender, which was produced by IMG Original Content and Carole Shorenstein Hays.But it played to houses that were often about three-quarters full, and its weekly grosses ranged from about $260,000 to $460,000.It took in $4.2 million over all and was seen by 74,484 people, according to the Broadway League.
Review: All Life’s a Swirling Proscenium in ‘The Red Shoes’:::::Smooth flow and swirling action are also the strengths of Mr. Bournes choreography and direction.This production moves.But besides the set, its chief cleverness lies in its choice of music, a collage clipped from various film scores by Bernard Herrmann.Its the sound of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Alfred Hitchcock, of high anxiety and romantic melodrama, with string sections desperately scaling musical cliffs and orchestral waves crashing.Photo The deftness with which Mr. Bourne (aided by the arranger Terry Davies) makes Herrmanns musical moods and cues serve his story gives sustained delight.The shoe keeps fitting.The productions achievements, though, are tangled up with its flaws.Crucial plot points can get lost in the bustle and detail.And Mr. Bournes push for efficiency making a dance number work both as period flavor and plot advancement, quickly slipping in a dramatic turning point in the middle of something else can shortchange or skirt character motivation and decision making.Mr. Bourne is a master of surface style, and the abundance and variety of pastiche dance from the stiff, hoppy ridiculousness of aristocrats to awful music hall numbers to an ample survey of between-the-wars ballet is another pleasure, especially for connoisseurs.Yet all this affectionate parody leaves him without much of a straight mode.The anguished danced monologues share the atmosphere of parody.Photo Meanwhile, the story has been streamlined and simplified, transformed into a standard love triangle.The tension in the film between Lermontovs personal involvement and his principled objection to a ballerinas marrying is absent.So is his religious devotion to ballet.Admittedly, these are difficult layers to convey without dialogue, but when Mr. Bourne has Lermontov moon over a statue of a shoe, the spiritual pursuit of beauty has been reduced to a foot fetish.The shows conception of Lermontov is characteristic of its swerving from the challenge of the films indelible performances.Anton Walbrooks flamboyant portrayal of the impresario is, along with the saturated colors, the movies greatest glory.Sam Archer, who plays Lermontov in every New York performance of Mr. Bournes show, is dashing but subdued, buttoned-up British instead of larger-than-life Russian.Despite Mr. Bournes tidying, he doesnt take the opportunity to flesh out the love story between Vicky and Julian.As in the movie, it basically comes out of nowhere, though the thinness is more of a problem without a complicated Lermontov.Mr. Gomes, imparting Julian with his usual warmth and charisma, helped, but couldnt redeem the roles histrionic conducting.Ms. Mearns, out of her usual element, fit in fine, her sense of drama proving equal to the roles acting demands, her performance only a tiny bit rougher than that of the first-cast Vicky, Ashley Shaw.(Ms. Mearns and Mr. Gomes, by the way, make an excellent couple: Company directors and casting agents take note.)Where Mr. Bournes show most successfully breaks free of the original is in the Red Shoes ballet, the allegorical work that Lermontov and Julian make for Vicky.In a reverse homage to the movies surreal colors, Mr. Brotherston sticks to black and white and gray, and Mr. Bournes choreography finds its own stylized nightmare.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for the rest, it can feel as conflicted as Vicky, not sure what movie it wants to be.Mr. Brotherstons rotating set adroitly mixes up performance and rehearsal, art and life.When it stops spinning, it leaves you impressed and a little dizzy and not very moved.

Credit Edwin Levick/Hulton Archive, via Getty Images Q.When did Broadway become shorthand for professional theater?A.Although Dutch settlers originally came up with the name for what would become a famous thoroughfare, the term, as it relates to theater, appears to have originated in the late 1860s, when productions like The Black Crook, a popular show that some consider the first modern musical , went on tour.After the Civil War, the phrase direct from Broadway emerged in advertising when shows traveled to other cities, said Jennifer Ashley Tepper , a theater historian and producer.Everyone knew Broadway was where the best theaters were.Such tours were suddenly possible because of significant expansion and improvements to the nations railroad network, made for military purposes during the Civil War.Before then, the touring production was rare.You would have a Broadway cast do a show in New York, and that would be it, said John Kenrick, a theater writer and historian who manages the website Musicals101.com .You couldnt bring the sets, the costumes, everything that made the show what it was, until the railroad system was developed.Professional theater in New York dates back to at least 1732 .The few theaters that opened before the Revolutionary War were small, holding at most a few hundred people.The Park Theater , which opened in 1798 just east of Broadway near City Hall, ushered in a new era, offering seating for 2,000.As the city grew to the north, the industry followed.While the burgeoning immigrant population would head to the Bowery for minstrel shows and revues, upper-class patrons preferred the more refined offerings focused around Broadway.Broadway, you could say, was the commercial spine of Manhattan as the settlement on Manhattan grew, Mr. Kenrick said.Your importance was determined by your proximity to Broadway.By 1850, theaters that strayed too far from Broadway failed, Ms. Tepper said.By the time Broadway became Broadway, the nexus of New York theater was Union Square, at the time a major transportation hub .It wasnt until the subway system opened in 1904 that productions began to gravitate to Times Square.Rather than continue marching northward, the theater industry settled thanks to a shift in mentality in the early 20th century, according to Ms. Tepper.Theater started being seen as an institution in a way, she said.As it became more and more integral with the city, it became something people thought of as permanent.Around the same time, Broadway was becoming known as The Great White Way, thanks to the blinding electric advertisements that had come to dominate the street.(White lights were preferred because they lasted longer than colored bulbs.)Some mystery still surrounds the nicknames exact origins, however; some accounts claim it stuck only after a theater critic used it to describe Broadway after a snowstorm.By 1904, the phrase had appeared in The Times, with the warning that the combined brightness would result in a headache next morning.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page MB 3 of the New York edition Sign up for the New York Today Newsletter Each morning, get the latest on New York businesses, arts, sports, dining, style and more.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Review: The Horror Show of Rehab in ‘People, Places & Things’:::::This is all very effective, which is saying a lot.The nostrums of 12-step recovery, even with Emma resisting them bitterly, are not inherently dramatic.Montages of Im an addict sharing sessions, peppered with role play and tearful confession by a strong ensemble of actors, are nothing we havent seen before.Photo Still, the staging gives the illusion that something dynamic and new is happening.In an odd way, Mr. Herrins hilarious work on the recent production of Noises Off at the Roundabout Theater was excellent preparation.People, Places & Things is a kind of inverted farce, with all the doors slamming in the other direction.But I kept waiting for something bigger than fine stagecraft and even Ms. Goughs extreme, ingenious performance to kick in.In his touching play Every Brilliant Thing and in the brutal adaptation of George Orwells 1984 he wrote with Robert Icke, Mr. Macmillan demonstrated an eagerness to keep the audience engaged in static stories at all costs, and to send it off with a big finish.These are usually admirable instincts, and they do, for the most part, keep us from wandering as Emma goes through her recovery laps.Even during the plays longueurs it feels a bit padded to achieve its length you sense that larger questions are being assembled to deliver a gut-punch reversal at the end.When it comes, you must re-evaluate what you thought you knew.But Ben Brantley was right to ask, in his New York Times review of the plays 2015 premiere at Londons National Theater, whether that effect is enough to make theatergoers feel that their own long, often tedious path to enlightenment has been worth it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His answer was no.Mine is yes, but.However valuable and accurate People, Places & Things is as a portrait of the addicts nightmare, in and out of rehab, the play really wants to weigh in on a more fundamental issue about addiction and responsibility.And on this note it seems to waffle as much as I do in responding to it.Perhaps this is the result of a contradiction built into recovery itself, at least as structured along the 12-step model: We play a large part in our own addictions yet we are powerless over them.Mr. Macmillan develops the argument between these two ideas in a series of confrontations with three women: the recovery centers doctor; its therapist; and, eventually, Emmas mother.(It is thematically useful that all are played by Barbara Marten, who is brisk as the doctor, warm as the therapist and jaw dropping as the mother.)The first two women, as advocates for a process that is fundamentally structured around acceptance of a higher power, locate the source of addiction in a breach of humility: Addiction, the doctor suggests, is caused by trauma we flatter ourselves to think we can ignore or control.Emma furiously rejects this interpretation, in ways that many an atheist and Foucaultian will recognize.If its vital to my recovery that I come to believe in a power greater than me, Emma fulminates, then we might all just be wasting our time.It is, she points out, the 21st century.And though the doctor explains that her clinic employs a religiously neutral modification of the 12-step template one in which addicts express powerlessness over the three nouns that make up the plays title she nevertheless (Emma notices witheringly) wears a crucifix.Further, the play is all too successful in replicating the sententiousness and sanctimony of recovery jargon, at least as overheard by an outsider.So which is it?Is recovery (as Emma first sees it) a cult of ego deflation or (as she later sees it) a spiritual and medical response to trauma?It may be reasonable to suggest that, as she recovers, her position gradually changes, her punctured actorly narcissism fizzling with a long hiss.She leaves rehab a convert to its philosophy of personal responsibility.But then, as the play closes I wont spoil how we are given devastating evidence that Emmas addiction is not her fault at all, but rather the mark of the worlds cruelty to sensitive souls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Are we not then all addicts?Or is the play simply addicted to its own effects?If I was troubled by Mr. Macmillans philosophical opportunism the story sometimes works like a toggle switch, flipped this way and that to maintain suspense perhaps its because I am leery of a mechanistic approach to issue drama.And to recovery.Yet it is not the playwrights job to provide answers to such questions.It is enough that he leaves you scraping the insides of your soul, looking for your own.
Putting Detroit’s Finest in Detroit Public Theater:::::But it is only in the last year that her works have made their way to the city that inspired them.With help from the Detroit Historical Society and the Knight Foundation, the theaters roving production of Detroit 67 has traveled to museums, high schools and community centers in the metropolitan region.Photo Detroit 67 is one of three plays inspired by the city; Paradise Blue, the second, about an arts-rich African-American neighborhood demolished at midcentury for freeway construction, will be produced at the Signature Theater Company in Manhattan in the spring.Skeleton Crew, the final work in the trilogy, centers on the closing of an automobile plant and its impact on four workers during the 2008 recession.It runs through Oct. 29 at the Detroit Public Theaters 150-seat space inside the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center; the Detroit Free Press described it as maybe the best play youll see this year.The theater was founded in 2015 by Courtney Burkett, a native of the city who had worked in theater here and in New York; Sarah Clare Corporandy, who also serves as managing director at Chautauqua Theater Company in upstate New York, but returned here for this challenge; and Sarah Winkler, a native New Yorker with more than two decades as an actress and producer Off Broadway, who moved here when her husband took a job in Michigan.All three share the title producing artistic director.We felt like there was not an anchor for theater serving the city, Ms. Burkett explained, noting the presence of major cultural institutions like the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and Detroit Institute of Arts.A theater like this could not have existed 10 years ago, she added.Now that the citys stabilizing and even thriving in so many ways, our artists are also thriving and getting the attention they always deserved.Among the challenges is ensuring that, as white women, they remain connected to a city that is more than 80 percent black.(Matrix Theater Company and the African-American focused Plowshares Theater Company both have long histories here.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an email, Ms. Corporandy said: Producing theater in a city that is predominantly African-American means we need to make sure that our stories speak to everyone, to the public we want to serve.Photo We are also very aware of the privilege we come to the table with, she added, and we want to be sure that we are leveraging that privilege to give back to this city that we all love, not take from it.The Detroit Public Theater annual budget is a relatively modest $1 million; its costs include renting space inside the symphonys hall.The leaders hope to raise enough money to have a permanent home eventually; in the meantime, they believe that showing work like Ms. Morisseaus is vital to the theaters becoming better known to Detroiters, suburbanites, and visitors intrigued by the citys much-touted comeback.This playwright was a natural choice for the inaugural 2015-16 season, according to Ms. Burkett.(It presented Detroit 67 in a coproduction with Baltimore Center Stage.)And the leaders intend to bring other Michigan artists into the fold, including the playwright Noah Haidle, whose Birthday Candles will have its world premiere as the final show this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Debbie Erb, the chairwoman of the theaters board, said leaders want to keep the shows really accessible.Ticket prices top out at $45, with group and student discounts and pay as you go options during previews.Another goal is to keep actors who are from the Detroit area in Detroit, Ms. Erb said.Because why should they have to go to Chicago or New York to earn a decent living?Ms. Morisseau admits that until recently she was better known outside her hometown than inside.Even starting from Detroit, she said, local theaters didnt know who I was until really, really huge things happened for me.Clearly that is changing.Ella Joyce, a Detroit native now living in Los Angeles, plays Faye, the lead character in Skeleton Crew.She was excited to return for the role.I dont think Dominique is just Detroits greatest playwright, she said on opening night.I think she is one of Americas greatest playwrights.Photo Ms. Joyce said friends from grade school turned up at performances of the play and came up to speak with her afterward, even bringing childhood photos to remind her who they were.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Writing about the people of Detroit, particularly African-Americans, is crucial to Ms. Morisseaus work.And while she now lives in Los Angeles, serving on the writing staff of Showtimes Shameless, she believes her work brings Detroiters alive, especially when it is performed by local actors.Something kind of magic and organic comes out of the mouth of a native Detroiter when theyre saying my words, she said.Its like we speak the same language.Earlier this month Ms. Morisseau came to see Skeleton Crew with her husband and an entourage of dozens, including her mother, who still lives in Detroit.When you are sitting around with half your family that inspired your work, its profound and exciting, but it is also overwhelming because these are the people that know it best and that live it, she said.Its for this reason that Ms. Morisseau is not only glad to see her work produced inside the theater, but brought to the public as well.Asking communities from all over to not just go to midtown or downtown Detroit to see shows, but come out to the neighborhood where what happened in these neighborhoods happened to someone you know, she said.That to me has power, in the best way, to affirm, to vindicate, to humanize and to heal.
Ex-Theater Agent Sentenced to Six Months for Fake Play:::::Photo A former theater agent has been sentenced to six months in jail after admitting that he bilked investors of hundreds of thousands of dollars to back a nonexistent Broadway play.Roland Scahill, 42, confessed to a scheme that took place between October 2014 and August 2015, in which Mr. Scahill told associates that he had secured the rights to the life story of Kathleen Battle, the opera singer, and was going to produce a one-woman play called The Kathleen Battle Project with Lupita Nyongo as its star.Ms. Nyongo had no knowledge of this, nor did the Shubert Organization, which Mr. Scahill said was offering up the Booth Theater to house the show.Mr. Scahill also said he had told investors that he had struck a deal with Netflix to stream a performance of the show.In total, Mr. Scahill confessed to defrauding 10 investors of $205,000, according to court papers.In the plea agreement, Mr. Scahill said, I never purchased life rights from Kathleen Battle, I never contracted with Lupita Nyongo to star, I never procured the Booth Theater as a venue for the show, and I never had a contract with Netflix.As part of the deal, Mr. Scahill paid back the remaining amount of about $90,000 that he owed the investors in restitution.In a statement, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said, Through his elaborate overtures to investors, Roland Scahill scammed patrons of the arts to the tune of more than $200,000.We are pleased to have brought his larcenous scheme to a grand finale.
Review: A Timely Take on ‘Oedipus’ by Way of South Central Los Angeles:::::Photo In America, there are stories we like to tell.Stories about meritocracy and opportunity, about talent, hope and help.We tell them, in part, so that we dont have to voice less comfortable truths that the circumstances of a persons birth often prophesy the life that follows.Thats uniquely true of Oedipus, the limping princeling fated to kill his father and marry his mother.Hes crossed seas and centuries to appear in Luis Alfaros vigorous and pointed Oedipus El Rey, at the Public Theater, which resets the tale in modern-day South Central Los Angeles.Directed by Chay Yew with energy and flair, its the most successful offering yet from the Sol Project, an initiative dedicated to producing the work of Latinx playwrights.The play opens in a prison complex, as a convict chorus rushes around the stage in orange scrubs and tries to decide what story to tell.Stories are boring, some prisoners say; theyre depressing, they dont change anything.But one chorus member says, Stories are all we got.So they shed the scrubs and take on the roles in this Oedipus update.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As written by Sophocles, the original Oedipus Rex is an oldie but a goody, provided your definition of a goody is heavy on the incest and the self-mutilation.And so it goes here.When Laius (Juan Francisco Villa), a Los Angeles gangster, learns that his unborn son will kill him, he arranges to have the baby killed, slashing the bottoms of his feet for good measure.I dont want him chasing me in the afterlife, Laius says.

Rare, hidden portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots revealed:::::EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A rare, unfinished portrait believed to be of Mary, Queen of Scots has been found underneath another 16th-century painting after an X-ray revealed a ghostly likeness of the executed queen.An unfinished portrait of a woman, thought to be Mary Queen of Scots, and a portrait of John Maitland, are displayed at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery during a media view, in Edinburgh, Scotland October 27, 2017.Conservator Caroline Rae discovered the unfinished portrait hidden beneath the painting of Maitland, using X-rays during a research project conducted at the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) and the Courtauld Institute of Art.REUTERS/Russell Cheyne A woman with distinct similarities to near-contemporary depictions of Mary was revealed during an examination of a portrait of Sir John Maitland, attributed to Adrian Vanson, a Dutchman who was court painter to Marys son King James VI of Scotland (James I of England).The X-ray showed the shape of a womans face and the outline of her dress and hat beneath the upper layers of paint in a pose and a likeness similar to those of the queen at the time.Mary was forced to abdicate in 1567 after she was implicated in her husbands murder and was then imprisoned in England by her cousin Elizabeth I from 1568 and executed in 1587.The painting usually hangs in the National Trusts Ham House southwest of London.Vansons portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it, said David Taylor, Curator of Pictures and Sculpture at the National Trust.It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing, he added.The portrait and X-ray images will be on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery from Saturday.
'East German' art show another step in still-rocky unification:::::POTSDAM, Germany (Reuters) - A display of artworks created during 40 years of East German history could help Germans from east and west bridge the divide that still separates them 27 years after unification.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Saturday opened an exhibition at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam near Berlin that seeks to illuminate how artists saw and represented themselves in a state that kept tight controls on all creative pursuits.Behind the Mask: Artists in the GDR includes 100 paintings, sculptures, photographs and other artworks created by more than 80 artists from the states creation in 1949 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.Germanys Sept. 24 national election highlighted the difference in mood and politics between east and west.It swept the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into parliament for the first time in what experts largely describe as a protest vote against Chancellor Angela Merkels 2015 decision to allow in over a million mostly Muslim migrants.The election was seen as a wake-up call about lingering divisions between the former Communist east and the capitalist west since support for the AfD was particularly strong in eastern states like Saxony, where it bested Merkels conservatives to become the biggest party.Steinmeier last month said the election had exposed large and small cracks in society and called on democratic lawmakers to join forces against any return to nationalism.On Saturday, he said he hoped the wide-ranging exhibit would enable a deeper understanding of how East German artists dealt with the challenges of creative expression in a country where art was often censored, restricted or instrumentalized.This exhibition ... will open our eyes anew, Steinmeier said in the text of a speech at the exhibits official opening.That is why it is a very important milestone on the path toward one another that we embarked on a quarter century ago - and that is taking longer than we all imagined back then.The display offers insights into how people lived, thought and work, and how the world was seen, and what was so important and valuable that it was artistically rendered, he said.Ortrud Westheider, director of the museum, said the concept of mask was useful for organizing the show because it showed how artists were at once forced into a certain role, but also makes clear that they were aware of that fact.Curator Michael Philipp said the exhibit aimed to show the leeway that artists had, and the leeway that they fought for, chose and used despite governmental constraints.Many of the paintings and sculptures used irony to respond to the conditions under which they lived and worked, he said.

Art of the deal: Trump's Empire State Building doodle fetches $16,000:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - George W.

Sierra Leone to auction multi-million dollar diamond to benefit poor:::::(This version of the story corrects para 2 to say first auction was held in Freetown, not New York.)A 709-carat diamond, found in Sierra Leone and known as the "Peace Diamond", is displayed during a tour ahead of its auction, at Israel's Diamond Exchange, in Ramat Gan, Israel October 19, 2017.Picture taken October 19, 2017.REUTERS/Nir Elias Ramat Gan, ISRAEL (Reuters) - Sierra Leone hopes to raise millions of dollars for development projects by auctioning a huge uncut diamond, believed to be one of the worlds largest, in New York in December.It will be the governments second attempt to sell the 709-carat gem, known as the Peace Diamond, after it rejected the highest bid of $7.8 million at an initial auction in Sierra Leones capital Freetown in May.Over half of the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund clean water, electricity, education and health projects in Sierra Leone, and particularly in the village of Koryardu, in the Kono region in eastern Sierra Leone, where the diamond was discovered.Theres a reason God gave these diamonds to the poorest people in the world and made the richest people want them.This is Tikun Olam (Hebrew for correcting the world), this is making the world a better place, Martin Rapaport, chairman of Rapaport Group, a network of diamond companies which will manage the auction, told Reuters.The diamond, which the auctioneers described as the 14th largest in the world, was unearthed in Koryardu in March by a Christian pastor who gave it to the government.Diamonds fueled a decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone, ending in 2002, in which rebels forced civilians to mine the stones and bought weapons with the proceeds, leading to the term blood diamonds.
In Beirut, play about Syria's war gets as close to home as it can:::::(This version of the October 22 story corrects ages of director and writer) Actors perform during a rehearsal of the play called "While I Was Waiting", at Dawar al-Shams theatre in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Jamal Saidi By Ayat Basma BEIRUT (Reuters) - A play about Syrias war, told through one familys tragedy, made its Lebanon debut on Friday, the closest it will ever get to being staged on home soil, its Syrian director said.It would be impossible to perform it in Syria.There are red lines, and the censorship that was there before 2011 is still there today, said Omar Abu Saada, one of the countrys best-known theater directors.The play - called While I Was Waiting - is based on the real-life story of a young man found beaten unconscious near a hospital in Damascus in 2013, but the circumstances of his beating and subsequent death remained unclear.Abu Saada knew the man and his family.When I thought about working on a new project, this was the story that came to my mind.It pretty much imposed itself, he said.In the play, the man oscillates between life and death and the lack of answers unnerves his family.His suspended state is a metaphor for the state of waiting that all Syrians share, whether inside the country or abroad and regardless of their political views, the director said.Another thing all Syrians share is loss, he added.The Syrian conflict, which began with a popular uprising against the state, has raged on into its seventh year.The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half of Syrians homeless, and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.Syrians today are not in a single place, they are suspended.Waiting is something that we all have in common, Abu Saada, 40, said.Most people lost someone close, either by death, emigration or imprisonment.Everyone lost something.This has changed the way Syrians think, their social fabric and even they way they make art, he said.Actors perform during a rehearsal of the play called "While I Was Waiting", at Dawar al-Shams theatre in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Jamal Saidi The play charts the disenchantment of young Taym, the comatose patient, from his hope for change at the start of the 2011 uprising to his despair as it spiraled into a war.Syrias young generation, active in organizing and documenting the mass protests, lost the most in the violent turn of events, he said.The state of coma is more of a metaphor for the lack of power to change things, Abu Saada said.The play made its debut in Brussels in 2016 and has since been staged in France, the United States and Japan among other places.The six cast members said they could not meet anywhere in the Arab world for rehearsals because of visa restrictions.Slideshow (2 Images) So in the end, we rehearsed in France which under normal circumstances would have been the harder place to go to, said Nanda Mohamed, a Syrian actress.The writer, who has previously lived in Lebanon, had to leave Beirut in 2015 when the Lebanese government imposed stricter conditions on Syrians in the country.But he said being forced to leave Lebanon helped him view the war differently.Sometimes the geographical distance helps create the gap for critical thinking and I tried to take advantage of that, said Mohamed al-Attar, 37.What happened to us was tragic but what would be more tragic is if we couldnt review things.It would be disastrous if after the heavy price we paid and we continue to pay that we also do not have the courage to think about what we lost and boldly criticize it, Attar said.Attar previously worked in Beirut with director Abu Saada on an adaptation of the Greek myth Antigone performed by an all-female cast of Syrian refugees.Both agree the play is about fuelling debate about a war that is not yet over.The idea of creating a play about something that you are living in the middle of and still being affected by and probably have not yet processed is difficult, Abu Saada said.But I know that there is no running away from it.
Graffiti set design adds punch to Cuba theater festival:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - A play parodying the lengths some Cubans will go to in order to earn a few tourist dollars set against the backdrop of socially critical graffiti is adding punch to Havanas annual theater festival.Public wait for the beginning of the spectacle "Guan meln!, tu meln!"beside a paint of Cuban street artist Yulier Rodriguez in a theatre in Havana, Cuba, October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The first-time collaboration between veteran theater director Nelda Castillo, 64, and street artist Yulier Rodriguez, 27, underscores unease among some Cubans with the recent influx of tourists on the cash-strapped, Communist-run island.The interdisciplinary spectacle, Guan meln!, tu meln!, is also an example of the innovative ways Cubans are pushing the boundaries of critical expression.Rodriguezs eerie murals of creatures that look malnourished and malformed had become ubiquitous throughout Havana over the last three years, reflecting his view of the dark path upon which society was.But the artist said authorities detained him for two days in August and ordered him to stop painting in public spaces.Graffiti is seen as vandalism in many countries, although Rodriguez suspects authorities stopped him more because they did not like the content of his work.Now I am limited in what I can do in the streets, any space where I can exhibit my work becomes a space of resistance for me, said Rodriguez.Castillo, who often collaborates with visual artists, said she invited Rodriguez to paint the walls of the renowned El Ciervo Encantado theater because she knew his graffiti would enrich her play.Theatre director Nelda Castillo speaks to actors (not pictured) after the play "Guan meln!, tu meln!"beside a paint of Cuban street artist Yulier Rodriguez in a theatre in Havana, Cuba, October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The piece is about the Cubans struggle in the street in the context of the new relations with the United States and the influx of American visitors, she said.His work is also about that struggle in the street.In the play that was first staged last year, a skinny and squat comic duo attempt frantically to entertain tourists arriving on cruise ships with Cuban tunes and to sell them outsized cigars and paper cones of peanuts.Slideshow (5 Images) A student with a manic fake smile, rudimentary English and a hypersexualised walk sells chocolate and offers salsa lessons, city tours and cabaret acts as way to make ends meet.In a beleaguered economy which shrank last year and where the average state salary is $30 a month, the tourist sector is a relative gold mine.Castillo said Rodriguezs graffiti - eerie, scared and hungry-looking creatures with four eyes, two gaping mouths or a crown of skulls - was like another protagonist in the play.Dialogue is always enriching as long as it is coherent, said Castillo.The two kept quiet about their collaboration until the day it opened to the public, at the start of the theater festival that runs from Oct. 20-29.Fingers crossed no one from up top orders the graffiti to be erased, said Rodriguez.

Italy gets back looted mosaic from Emperor Caligula's ship:::::ROME (Reuters) - A floor mosaic from one of Roman Emperor Caligulas opulent private ships, which was stolen after World War Two, is on its way back to Italy from the United States where it has been recovered from a private collection.The first century AD marble, serpentine and porphyry mosaic came from one of Caligulas ceremonial vessels, which was found at the bottom of Lake Nemi, near Rome, in the 1930s.The artifact, stolen from Italys Roman Ship Museum after the war, was seized by the New York district attorneys office from the collection of an Italian woman living in New York following an Italian police investigation.The United States have today given back to Italy several archaeological treasures that came from clandestine digs or thefts in our country, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini told a news conference in New York on Friday.They will all be returned to the places from where the criminals took them, he said.Among other Roman-era items recovered was a vase from the Puglia region dating to around 350 BC, which found its way to the New York Metropolitan Museum, and two amphorae from the 4th or 5th century BC.The vase was taken from an illegal dig in the 1980s.The artifacts presented at the news conference also included Roman coins, books and manuscripts.Caligula, whose real name was Gaius Julius Caesar, was emperor between AD 37 and AD 41.Historical accounts describe him as an insane, violent and sadistic man who ordered killings at a whim.Legend has it that he planned to make his horse Incitatus a consul.
Netflix suspends 'House of Cards' production after Spacey allegation:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) indefinitely halted production of political drama House of Cards on Tuesday following an allegation of sexual misconduct against series star Kevin Spacey.FILE PHOTO: Cast member Kevin Spacey poses at the premiere for the second season of the television series "House of Cards" at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles, California February 13, 2014.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo Producer Media Rights Capital and Netflix have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew, a statement said.A day earlier, Netflix had said the groundbreaking show about a ruthless political power couple would conclude with season six.Representatives for Spacey did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.On Sunday, Star Trek: Discovery actor Anthony Rapp told Buzzfeed that Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in 1986 when he was just 14 and Spacey was 26.Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner who is now 58, said he did not recall the incident.But in a tweet he said that if he did behave as Rapp described then he apologized and it would have been due to inappropriate drunken behavior.Rapp told BuzzFeed he felt compelled to come forward after dozens of women recently accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and several other Hollywood figures of sexual assault and sexual harassment.Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Spaceys apology sparked a backlash because he also used the statement to come out as a gay man.Many social media users saw it as a damaging conflation of sexual misconduct and being gay.On Monday, Netflix and MRC called the allegation against Spacey deeply troubling.House of Cards became Netflixs defining show when it launched in 2013, upending traditional television viewership by making all episodes of each season available online at the same time.Earlier on Tuesday, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said it was revoking a planned award for Spacey that he had been due to receive in New York on Nov. 20.Spacey was to have received the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award, but the Academy said in a statement that in light of recent events it will not honor Kevin Spacey as planned.In a separate statement, Londons Old Vic theater, where Spacey was artistic director from 2004 to 2015, said on Tuesday it was deeply dismayed by the allegations of sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Kevin Spacey embroiled in Hollywood's latest sexual misconduct scandal:::::(Reuters) - Actor Kevin Spacey has apologized for an alleged attempt to seduce a 14-year-old boy more than 30 years ago, an encounter the two-time Oscar winner denied recalling but attributed to drunkenness as he also came out as a gay man on Twitter.But rather than tempering an uproar over the allegation, Spaceys combination of an apology with a statement going public about his sexual orientation stirred a backlash against the actor as Hollywood found itself embroiled in yet another sex scandal.Adding fuel to the latest controversy was news on Monday that Netflix will soon end the landmark political drama House of Cards, which stars Spacey as a corrupt and closeted bisexual U.S. president.Netflix Inc did not give an explicit reason for deciding to air just one more season of House of Cards before pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning, critically acclaimed show, its first original hit series.Netflix spokeswoman Karen Barragan said the determination was made months ago, long before the allegation surfaced against Spacey, 58, who is also a Tony-winning actor and former creative director of Londons famed Old Vic theater.But the internet streaming service and the shows producers issued a joint statement saying they were deeply troubled by the accusation leveled against Spacey by actor Anthony Rapp, 46, a member of CBSs new Star Trek: Discovery series.According to Rapp, in an interview published late on Sunday by BuzzFeed, Spacey in 1986 made an unwanted sexual advance toward him when he was just 14 at the time.Rapp said the encounter occurred after a party Spacey hosted at his New York apartment, where he said Spacey, then 26, found him watching TV alone at the end of the night when other guests had left, then carried him to a bed and lay down on top of him.Rapp said he had the impression that Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.He was trying to seduce me, Rapp told BuzzFeed.I dont know if I would have used that language.But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.Rapp was just starting his career on Broadway in a production of Precious Sons at the time and went on to star in the hit musical Rent.Spacey was then appearing in a Broadway revival of Eugene ONeills Long Days Journey Into Night.LATEST HOLLYWOOD SEX SCANDAL FILE PHOTO - Cast member Kevin Spacey poses at the premiere for the second season of the television series "House of Cards" at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles, California February 13, 2014.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo Rapp told BuzzFeed he remained unnerved by the experience decades later and felt compelled to come forward after dozens of women recently accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and several other Hollywood figures of sexual assault and sexual harassment.Weinstein, who has since been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild of America, has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was beyond horrified by Rapps account, which he said he did not recall.But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years, Spacey tweeted.Spacey went on to say that Rapps story had encouraged me to address other things in my life.As those closest to me know, in my life I have had relationships with both men and women.I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, I now choose to live life as a gay man, wrote Spacey, who had not previously addressed his sexuality publicly.Spacey immediately came under fire on social media for what many saw as a disingenuous conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct with a public acknowledgement of being gay.Coming-out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault, said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).This is not a coming-out story about Kevin Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advances.A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.An Oscar winner for The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, Spacey is best known lately for his role as the ruthless fictional president Frank Underwood in House of Cards.The series became Netflixs defining show when it launched in 2013, upending traditional television viewership by making all episodes of each season available for internet streaming at once.Spacey will next be seen on the big screen playing Jean Paul Getty in Ridley Scotts drama All The Money in the World, scheduled for release by Sony Pictures in December for possible awards consideration.

'Stranger Things 2' gets darker in aftermath of death and Demogorgon:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A year has passed since a supernatural demon terrorized the town of Hawkins, Indiana, but as Netflixs hit 1980s science fiction series Stranger Things returns for a second season on Friday, life has not returned to normal for the unlikely heroes.The adults and teenagers of Stranger Things 2 wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boys disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so its about these characters confronting the horrors, said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.All nine episodes of Stranger Things 2 will be released on Friday.At the center of the show are its young teenage breakout stars.Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the towns police chief, Jim Hopper.Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.Cast members (L-R) Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp and Gaten Matarazzo pose at the premiere for the second season of the television series "Stranger Things" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasnt tied to the boys, Matt Duffer said.We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.Stranger Things has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc, landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.Slideshow (14 Images) The second season ramps up the quest to bring closure to her death while introducing new characters and expanding the story geographically.The Duffers said they anticipate five seasons to bring Stranger Things to a conclusion.It was important to us this season to start to move out of Hawkins and to introduce this world, said Ross Duffer.Its such a fine line and its difficult and obviously sequels always feel this way because people want some of the same - thats why they liked it in the first place - but you dont want to just go in circles, he added.

'House of Cards' production halted:::::(CNN) Production on the sixth and final season of "House of Cards" has been halted after star Kevin Spacey was accused of sexual assault by an actor who claims he was a minor at the time of the alleged incident.Netflix and Media Rights Capital, which produces the series, confirmed the move in a joint statement issued Tuesday."MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on 'House of Cards' season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew," the statement read.On Sunday, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed about an alleged encounter with Spacey at a party in 1986.At the time, Rapp was 14 years old and Spacey, according to Rapp, made a sexual advance toward him.Spacey issued a statement late Sunday, claiming he did not recall the incident but apologized for what he said would have been "inappropriate drunken behavior.""But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years," Spacey said.Netflix announced on Monday that Season 6 of "House of Cards" would be the show's last.The decision to end the series, according to multiple sources close to production, was made months prior to the allegation against Spacey.Production on Season 6 had been taking place in the Baltimore area for about two weeks, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Commerce told CNN.On Monday, Netflix and MRC said they were "deeply troubled " by the allegation against Spacey, and said representatives from both companies had been sent to set to ensure the cast and crew "feel safe and supported."Spacey had not previously been scheduled to work on set on Monday, according to a statement from the companies.How will Hollywood react?The allegation against Spacey comes as the entertainment industry is reeling from a series of sexual misconduct accusations made against powerful players in the business.The allegations made against movie executive Harvey Weinstein in stories by The New York Times and The New Yorker are seen as a turning point.Many long-silent victims of sexual assault and harassment have shared their accounts since.To date, more than 60 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment A spokeswoman for Weinstein has repeatedly denied allegations "of non-consensual sex."Weinstein has also apologized for "the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past."Nearly one month since allegations against Weinstein first surfaced, the fallout continues.On Monday, the Producers Guild of America announced Weinstein would be banned for life from the organization.This follows a series of similar moves by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and BAFTA, who have sought to distance themselves from the disgraced film mogul.The TV Academy is also reviewing his membership.Exactly how Hollywood organizations will react to the allegations against Spacey remains unclear.When reached by CNN, a spokesperson for the SAG-AFTRA, a labor union which represents actors and performers, would not comment on Spacey, an 11-time SAG Award nominee and four-time recipient."For general guidance, we take our members' privacy very seriously and our policies don't permit any disclosure of information regarding who is or is not a member, or information about an individual's activity with the organization," the spokesperson said."We don't comment on the internal and confidential member disciplinary process."Other organizations were swifter to distance themselves from the actor.On Monday, the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences reversed its earlier decision to honor Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award, citing "recent events."London'd Old Vic Theatre, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years, also took a strong stance in a statement issued Tuesday "If you have been connected with The Old Vic or in our employment and feel you have a complaint that you were unable to raise, please contact us," the statement said.The theater has appointed external advisers "to help us deal with any information received."CNN's Megan Thomas and Judith Vonberg contributed to this report.

Twitter.Spacey has not responded to CNN's request for comment.The "House of Cards" star has spent much of his acting career in the theater, and was artistic director at The Old Vic until 2015."We are deeply dismayed to hear the allegations levied against Kevin Spacey," the theater's statement said."Inappropriate behaviour by anyone working at The Old Vic is completely unacceptable."Sexual harassment is 'systemic' Speaking to the Today program on BBC Radio 4 on Monday, Victoria Featherstone, artistic director at London's Royal Court Theatre , welcomed the discussions that are now happening within the theater industry -- and more broadly -- regarding abuses of power."It's an opening of the floodgates and it's a very important moment for all of us," she said."We have a culture across society which has accepted this ... it's deep in our DNA to accept these behaviors.And it's only now that we're finding the vocabularies and the confidence and the means to have these conversations," she added.Featherstone has been instrumental in drafting a "code of behavior" that will apply to all staff working at the Royal Court Theatre, which will be published later this week."Following last week's revelations concerning Harvey Weinstein, it is time to confront the abuses of power that have been occurring in our own industry for years," she said in a statement."Sexual harassment, predominantly carried out by those in power to people in positions junior to them, is systemic," the statement reads.Spacey gave a speech at The Old Vic during a gala celebration in 2015."It is across every part of our society.If it is not dealt with in an open way we have no hope of change, and change must happen."In a statement released by his publicist, Anthony Rapp acknowledged the dialogue begun by the accusations against the powerful movie producer Harvey Weinstein."I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me," he said.'Deeply troubled' The statement from The Old Vic came just a few hours after the International Emmy Awards announced that "in light of recent events, it will not honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 Emmy Founders Award."The actor was due to receive the prestigious award on November 20.CNN also learned Monday night that US political drama "House of Cards" will conclude after its sixth season, which is currently in production.The decision to end the show was made two months before production began on the season and was not related to the allegation against Spacey, according to two sources.The company did, however, address the allegation in a joint statement with Media Rights Capital, which produces the series."Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night's news concerning Kevin Spacey," the statement said."In response to last night's revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported.As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time."During his long career, Spacey has won numerous prizes including two Academy Awards, one Golden Globe and several Screen Actors Guild Awards.He was also presented with an honorary knighthood in the UK by Prince Charles in 2016 for his services to British theater and international culture.Asked whether Spacey could be stripped of his honor, Siobhan Bruce, interim head of news at the Cabinet Office, told CNN on Tuesday that she could not comment on the allegation.
Kevin Spacey criticized for how he came out:::::Story highlights Spacey came out as part of an apology He's being criticized for connecting sexuality and alleged sexual misconduct (CNN) Actors are usually hailed for coming out but Kevin Spacey is being criticized.That's because many are taking exception with the "House of Cards" star revealing his sexuality as part of an apology in the wake of an accusation of sexual misconduct.On Sunday, Buzzfeed published a story in which "Star Trek: Discovery" actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making a sexual advance towards him in 1986 when Rapp was a 14-year-old child actor and Spacey was 26.In response to the allegations, Spacey tweeted that he was "beyond horrified to hear [Rapp's] story."
'House of Cards' ending after Season 6:::::"House of Cards" will conclude after its sixth season, which is currently filming, a source close to production tells CNN.The announcement comes less than one day after star Kevin Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct by an actor who says he was a minor at the time of the alleged incident.The decision to end the show and the allegations facing Spacey were "two separate things," according to the source.Two sources close to the show told CNN that the production team was told months prior to filming that the sixth season would be its last.Netflix did not offer an official statement on the show's cancellation when contacted by CNN.The company did, however, address the allegations in a joint statement with Media Rights Capital, which produces the series."Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night's news concerning Kevin Spacey," the statement said."In response to last night's revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported.As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.""House of Cards" is a five-time Emmy nominee for outstanding drama.Spacey's work on the series has also earned him five Emmy nominations for outstanding actor in a drama.On the show, Spacey plays an amoral politician who ascends to the White House through troubling means.Filming on Season 6 of "House of Cards" started about two weeks ago in the Baltimore area, according to a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Commerce.On Sunday, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed about an alleged encounter with Spacey at a party in 1986, during which Spacey made a sexual advance toward the then 14-year-old Rapp.Spacey issued a statement late Sunday, claiming he did not recall the incident but apologized for what he said would have been "inappropriate drunken behavior.""But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years," Spacey said.Prior to news of the show's end, "House of Cards" creator Beau Willimon issued a statement calling Rapp's accusations "deeply troubling.""During the time I worked with Kevin Spacey on 'House of Cards,' I neither witnessed nor was aware of any inappropriate behavior on set or off," he said."That said, I take reports of such behavior seriously and this is no exception.I feel for Mr. Rapp and I support his courage."Spacey is the latest figure in entertainment to face allegations of sexual misconduct in what some are calling a new era in the industry -- one where long-silent victims of sexual assault and harassment feel emboldened to share their accounts.The allegations made against movie executive Harvey Weinstein, detailed in stories by The New York Times and The New Yorker, are seen as a turning point.To date, Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than 60 women.He has denied the allegations of sexual assault.Following the initial report by the New York Times, he apologized for the way he "behaved with colleagues in the past."The accusation against Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, comes as entertainment organizations seek ways to address sexual misconduct in the industry.Weinstein was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences earlier this month, and the organization said it intends to "establish a new code of conduct" for its members, according to a memo Academy CEO Dawn Hudson sent to members."We believe our Academy has a role to play in fostering a safe and respectful atmosphere for the professionals who make motion pictures," the memo read in part.Spacey is next set to appear in Ridley Scott's "All the Money in the World."The film is set to be the closing night film for AFI Fest, taking place November 9-16 in Los Angeles.A spokesperson for the festival tells CNN that plan remains in place."Our programming is locked and there will not be any changes to our film schedule," the spokesperson said in a statement.The film is based on the 1973 abduction of John Paul Getty III.Spacey plays Getty's billionaire grandfather.Charlie Plummer, Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg also star.
Seth MacFarlane joked about Kevin Spacey on 'Family Guy' episode:::::Story highlights MacFarlane's "Family Guy" from years ago featured a Spacey joke He had also made a joke about Harvey Weinstein years before (CNN) Seth MacFarlane drew both laughs and groans in 2013 with a bit about Harvey Weinstein during a nominations announcement at the Academy Awards.Now MacFarlane is making headlines again for a joke about Kevin Spacey that appeared in a "Family Guy" episode from more than 10 years ago.On Monday, a Twitter user posted a clip from an episode of MacFarlane's animated series in which Stewie, the baby of the show's family, running through a room yelling, "Help!I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!Help me!"The "Family Guy" clip aired in 2005, long before Rapp's allegations against Spacey.Family Guy with the Kevin Spacey reference twelve years ago... creepy.pic.twitter.com/bVbEOLlAwz Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 30, 2017 "Family Guy with the Kevin Spacey reference twelve years ago... creepy," Twitter user Josh Jordan wrote on Monday.CNN does not know what the episode was referring to.MacFarlane has not responded to CNN's request for a comment.On Sunday, Spacey tweeted a statement of apology after actor Anthony Rapp accused the "House of Cards" star of making a sexual advance at him more than 30 years ago when Rapp was 14 years old."I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago," Spacey tweeted."But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."Read More

Rachel McAdams, Selma Blair accuse James Toback of sexual harassment:::::(CNN) Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams are the latest women to accuse director James Toback of sexual harassment.In separate interviews with Vanity Fair , Blair and McAdams recounted their alleged experiences with Toback, whom they'd met in business meetings years ago.Toback is best known as the screenwriter and director behind films such as "The Pick-up Artist," "The Gambler," and "Bugsy."Blair alleges that in their meeting, Toback asked her to audition for him naked and then requested that she let him rub himself against her."I felt disgust and shame, and like nobody would ever think of me as being clean again after being this close to the devil," Blair told Vanity Fair."His energy was so sinister."Actress Selma Blair She also claims he threatened her with violence if she told anyone about her experience.McAdams, too, met with Toback under the guise that they'd be talking about work, in particular, a role in 2001's "Harvard Man," which Toback wrote.Instead, McAdams said their meeting was filled with inappropriate comments from Toback that left her feeling uncomfortable."This has been such a source of shame for me -- that I didn't have the wherewithal to get up and leave," she said."I was very lucky that I left and he didn't actually physically assault me in any way."The Los Angeles Times was the first to bring allegations against Toback to light in a story published Sunday.To date, more than 200 women have accused Toback of inappropriate conduct, according to LA Times writer Glenn Whipp.Toback's agent, Jeff Berg, said Sunday he would pass a request for a comment on to his client.Berg has since ceased representing Toback.The director, 72, denied the allegations when contacted by the Times, the newspaper said.Toback told the paper he had never met any of the women -- or if he did meet them, it "was for five minutes and (he had) no recollection."He said that for the last 22 years, it was "biologically impossible" for him to take part in the behavior the women described in the article, saying he had diabetes and a heart condition requiring medication, the Los Angeles Times reported.He declined to elaborate.CNN has contacted representatives for McAdams and Blair for comment on this story.After the LA Times first wrote of multiple women sharing similar stories about Toback, "Guardians of the Galaxy" director James Gunn posted on his official Facebook page that when he was living in New York City in the 1990s, Toback "was EVERYWHERE.""I have personally met at least FIFTEEN WOMEN, probably more, who say that he's accosted them in NYC," Gunn wrote."He essentially goes up to women and says, 'Hey, I'm James Toback, and I'm a famous director, and I feel like there's a connection between us.'Then he shows them some article on himself or some other artifact to prove he is who he is, and tries to get them to go somewhere else with him."And Gunn wasn't alone in speaking out.Oscar-winning actress Julianne Moore shared on Twitter her story of Toback allegedly propositioning her in the 1980s."James Toback approached me in the 80's on Columbus Ave with the same language -- wanted me to audition, come to his apt," she tweeted."I refused.One month later he did it again with the EXACT same language.I said don't u remember u did this before?"@GlennWhipp 1 - #JamesToback approached me in the 80's on Columbus Ave with the same language - wanted me to audition, come to his apt.Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) October 24, 2017 @GlennWhipp 2.I refused.One month later he did it again with the EXACT same language.I said don't u remember u did this before?Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) October 24, 2017 "Today" cohost Natalie Morales wrote in a tweet that she, too, could be added to the list of women who allege run-ins with Toback."Glenn add one more," she wrote, referring to Whipp."Exact same playbook by James Toback when I encountered him near Central Park."CNN's Darran Simon and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this story.
Anna Wintour names who she would axe from Met Gala:::::Story highlights Wintour appeared on Corden's show She shut down a rumor that she dated Bob Marley (CNN) There are two things Anna Wintour apparently is not a fan of: fast food and the President of the United States.The legendary Vogue editor appeared Wednesday on "The Late Late Show with James Corden" and played "Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts," in which guests either have to answer an uncomfortable question or eat food they find disgusting.It turns out fast food is what turns Wintour off, so while there were weird options like bull penis, pickled pigs feet and a thousand-year-old egg, there were also items like a bacon cheeseburger in a donut, a chilli smoothie and bacon-wrapped pizza.Wintour opted to take a bite of the bacon-wrapped pizza rather than rank designers Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren from best to worst."It's covered in grease," Wintour exclaimed after eating.Read More
Rocking Pyongyang: Film recalls Laibach's North Korea gig:::::Story highlights "Liberation Day" is a documentary about one of the first Western rock bands to play North Korea.Laibach is a Slovenian industrial rock band known for inciting controversy.(CNN) Growling "Sound of Music" covers while decked out in military uniforms, Laibach was one of the first Western bands to perform in North Korea.It was an ironic juxtaposition, a politically provocative band performing to an audience of 1,500 in a closed communist society."One goal was simply to see if it could be done," said Morten Traavik, the director of a new documentary about the 2015 concert.The Slovenian industrial rock band is well known for inciting controversy, with rally-like concerts, even projecting porn clips over old propaganda video.Their name is taken from the German name of the Slovenian capital under Nazi occupation.It was Laibach's first and only trip to North Korea.They toured around the country and band member Ivan Novak said he saw "poverty and elegance," but none of the "cynicism, negativism" and "pornography" he sees in the West.Read More
'Thor: Ragnarok' flexes its comedy muscles:::::(CNN) Marking an ambitious detour into comedy, "Thor: Ragnarok" conjures sparks but doesn't quite catch lightning in a bottle.Sporadically fun and visually impressive, this third film works a bit too hard at flexing its laugh muscles, while bogging down in a midsection built around the enticing prospect of Thor versus the Hulk.Part of the problem, frankly, is that Marvel has done perhaps too good a job marketing the movie, to the extent most of the best lines and moments (like Thor seeing the Hulk and enthusiastically shouting, "He's a friend from work!")have played repeatedly in the trailer.Even Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song" makes a slightly incongruous appearance.To its credit, the movie makes the most out of an inordinately strong ensemble, surrounding Chris Hemsworth with reliable scene-stealer Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki, Cate Blanchett as the villainous Hela and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, a fearsome warrior.Throw in a cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr.Strange and a meatier role for Idris Elba as the stoic sentry Heimdall, and there's a lot of power on screen even before the CGI pyrotechnics kick in.It all starts promisingly enough, with Thor -- after what amounts to a James Bond-like pre-title sequence -- returning home to Asgard, where a newly freed Hela, the Goddess of Death, is on her way to lay siege. "allowfullscreen> Failing to stop her, Thor is inadvertently cast onto a dystopian planet Sakaar, presided over by Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, in fully manic mode), who forces his prisoners to engage in gladiatorial combat.Determined to win his freedom and face Hela, Thor is pleasantly surprised to discover that the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) has landed there as well -- at least, until the first punch lands.Read More
'Ray Donovan' takes leap into uncertain future:::::(CNN) The following contains spoilers about the "Ray Donovan" season finale."Ray Donovan" is taking a figurative plunge into the unknown in its next season, after having depicted a literal one in its fifth-season finale.The Showtime series about the Hollywood fixer will be relocating to New York, following an emotionally wrenching season that saw the title character (Liev Schreiber) lose his wife, Abby (Paula Malcomson), and descend further down the moral ladder he has often unsteadily occupied.In the finale, that included Ray committing a cold-blooded murder of a movie studio chief in order to secure a favor from the executive's corporate rival (Susan Sarandon).Moreover, the killing happened after Ray sees a teary-eyed actress leave the victim's room, in what felt like an echo of the alleged real-life scandal involving entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein.Following a spectral vision of his wife, Ray then took his own leap into the river, in a gauzily shot sequence that implied a desire to be cleansed of his sins and felt like a suicide attempt -- as it was intended to be perceived, according to showrunner David Hollander.Read More

Eight questions Congress could ask Facebook:::::This week, almost a full year after the election of Donald Trump, Facebook, Twitter, and Google are testifying before House and Senate committees examining the role that social media -- and Russian manipulation of it -- played in the 2016 elections.Much of the focus around Russian meddling and social media has centered on Facebook, which was the first to announce that it had found evidence of the campaign on its network.The Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg with ties to the Kremlin, ran hundreds of pages designed to look like activist groups in the U.S., and bought thousands of Facebook ads on divisive issues like race, religion, LGBT rights, and gun rights.Related: Facebook estimates 126 million people were served content from Russia-linked pages Though members of Congress will no doubt have questions for representatives of Twitter and Google as well, the majority of the focus could well end up being on Facebook, both because of the company's dominance and because of the scale of the Russian operations on its site.Facebook itself estimates that 126 million people may have been exposed to content created by the Russian pages.Representatives from the three companies appeared before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Tuesday.On Wednesday, they will appear before the House and Senate Intelligence committees, each of which have been investigating Russian meddling for months.Here are some of the questions that Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch may be asked Wednesday -- many of which could also be asked of Twitter and Google.1.Did Facebook take Russian meddling seriously enough in 2016?"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook ... influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said shortly after last year's election.So, with that quote in mind, members of Congress will likely want to know: Did Facebook take the threat seriously enough?Could the reach of Russian operations have been curtailed or even stopped if Facebook had taken the threat more seriously?Facebook's answer may be, at least in part, that it didn't know about the threat because the government never said anything about it.But Facebook was informed after the election.The Washington Post has reported that soon after Zuckerberg dismissed the "fake news" factor as "crazy," President Obama pulled him aside at a conference in Peru to warn that unless Facebook addressed the problem, it would be even worse in 2020 election.2.How hard has Facebook been looking for evidence of meddling?In September, Facebook handed over to Congress records related to the thousands of ads and hundreds of Facebook accounts it has found that were designed to meddle in U.S. affairs.Since then, CNN and other news organizations have reported that many of these accounts were operated well after the presidential election was over, with some even remaining active until they were shuttered by Facebook in August.All of these pages, Facebook says, were from one Russian troll farm, the Internet Research Agency.Members of Congress will likely want to know how Facebook found these pages, and how difficult it was to find them.They'll also want to know how sure Facebook is that there are not other Russian troll farms running similar pages, and how confident it is in its own ability to find such content.3.How were the ads targeted?Did the targeting match that of official campaigns?Facebook's ad-targeting technology allows advertisers to tell Facebook what kinds of people it wants to advertise to -- that is, target -- based on things like their age; where they live; their political interests; and, up until after the election, their race.Facebook will know where in the U.S. the Russians targeted their ads and when they did that targeting -- for instance, whether people in swing states were targeted the week before Election Day, or whether the targeting wasn't that specific or sophisticated.There's also a more complex but potentially more important issue here.Facebook should be able to show if any of Russia's ad targeting matched targeting by official campaigns in the U.S.If the troll army were targeting the same people in the same location that a candidate or PAC was, this could warrant further examination.4.Does Facebook plan on telling the Americans who were targeted by the Russians, or who engaged with content produced by them, about what happened to them?In testimony prepared for a subcommittee to which Stretch will testify Tuesday, Stretch discloses that 126 million Americans may have been exposed to content generated on its platform by the Russian government-linked troll farm, and that 11.4 million saw ads from the group.Congress is due to release the Russian ads Facebook provided to them.But there are millions of people out there who may have seen or interacted with or even been influenced in some way by what the Russians did, and the vast majority of them are probably in the dark about that.Is anyone ever going to tell them what happened?5.What lessons did Facebook learn from Russian operations like this in other countries?After the extensive scrutiny it got regarding elections over the past two years, Facebook has said it is doing better on this front.It has, for instance, said that it removed thousands of fake accounts in advance of this year's German and French elections -- though it didn't say if these accounts were Russian.But Facebook has not provided all the answers on the question of foreign elections that members of Congress might want.Just last week British lawmakers asked Facebook to provide details of any Russian-linked ad buys around the Brexit referendum in June, 2016, and last year's UK general election.(Facebook said it would respond "once we have had the opportunity to review the request.")The committees could ask how effective Facebook's efforts in Germany and France truly were, and how its experience fighting fake accounts in Europe could help stop the spread of the same in the U.S. 6.How will Facebook determine what is a "political ad," and what isn't?In September, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would begin requiring disclaimers on political ads -- a policy that it went to the Federal Election Commission to seek an exception from in 2011.But determining what qualifies as a "political ad" can be tough.Sure, if an ad comes directly from a campaign, it's pretty clear cut.But the Russian ads at issue here would not for the most part have fit under the common definition of a political ad -- they didn't call for anyone to vote for or against a specific candidate.It's not just the Russian ads that are a potential can of worms either.What if your friend, who isn't involved in a campaign, decides to spend $100 promoting a New York Times article that reflect positively reflects a candidate and target voters in her neighborhood.Is that a political ad?And how will Facebook detect it?7.How many people at Facebook will be working on monitoring political ads?Facebook said last week that pages running federal election-related advertising in the U.S. may be required to provide documentation to verify what organization or campaign they are part of and their location.Facebook says it is developing automated tools to help with this process, but verifying the identities of ad buyers and determining the nuances of political ads will likely require some human moderation.Lawmakers would be justified in asking how much money Facebook might put behind that effort, and whether it will be enough to really do the job.8.Will Facebook continue to embed with political campaigns?Facebook, Google, and Twitter have in the past provided staff to embed with major political campaigns to advise those campaigns on how to effectively utilize their ad platforms and target voters.Embeds from the tech giants act as "quasi-digital consultants to campaigns," researchers from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the University of Utah, found.Nu Wexler, then Twitter's Policy Communications Manager (he's now with Facebook), said of Twitter embedding with the Trump digital campaign, "One; they [the Trump campaign] found that they were getting solid advice and it worked, and two; it's cheaper.It's free labor."Some members of Congress may well ask whether Facebook and its competitors plan on continuing this quasi-political consulting role.
'Kill them all' -- Russian-linked Facebook accounts called for violence:::::Facebook accounts run by Russian trolls repeatedly called for violence against different social and political groups in the U.S., including police officers, Black Lives Matter activists and undocumented immigrants.Posts from three now-removed Facebook groups created by the Russian Internet Research Agency suggest Russia sought not only to meddle in U.S. politics but to encourage ideologically opposed groups to act out violently against one another.The posts are part of a database compiled by Jonathan Albright, the research director at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, who tracks and analyzes Russian propaganda.For example, "Being Patriotic," a group that regularly posted content praising Donald Trump's candidacy, stated in an April 2016 post that Black Lives Matter activists who disrespected the American flag should be "be immediately shot."The account accrued about 200,000 followers before it was shut down.Another Russia-linked group, "Blacktivist," described police brutality in a November 2016 post weeks after the election, and stated, "Black people have to do something.An eye for an eye.The law enforcement officers keep harassing and killing us without consequences."The group "Secured Borders" had the most violent rhetoric, some of it well after the presidential election.A post in March 2017 described the threat of "dangerous illegal aliens" and said, "The only way to deal with them is to kill them all."Another post about immigrants called for a draconian new law, saying, "if you get deported that's your only warning.You come back you get shot and rolled into a ditch... BANG, problem solved."And a post about refugees said, "the state department needs to be burned to the ground and the rubble reduced to ashes."Related: Facebook estimates 126 million people were served content from Russia-linked pages More than two dozen messages encouraging violence are among thousands of controversial posts from Russia-linked Facebook accounts that analysts say sought to increase hostility -- both ideological and physical -- in the U.S. in an effort to further divide American society along political, religious or racial lines.Mark R. Jacobson, a Georgetown University professor and expert on Russian influence operations, said Russia strategically seeks to undermine U.S. political cohesion by promoting extremist views within opposing political or social groups, and hoping chaosand violence -- ensues."The Russians don't want groups like Black Lives Matter [and] the Alt-Right to sit there and have discussions and debates about the future of America.They want violent clashes," Jacobson said.Jacobson noted that, during the Cold War, Russia sought to enhance extremist ideas within the civil rights movement in hopes of sparking race-based warfare in the U.S. "If we start to see violent rallies... we should start to look for the hidden hand of Russian influence behind it," he said.Columbia University's Albright said even if only a fraction of the accounts' posts called for physical violence, the overall messaging sought to push audiences toward more radical viewpoints that they would act on."These posts contained psychological calls to action toward both online and physical behavior," he said.Some of the violent posts received tens of thousands of likes, comments, shares, or reactions, according to a database of messages Albright compiled from six now-deleted Russia-linked accounts, which included the accounts that posted the violent messages reviewed by CNN.One post by Secured Borders shared in October 2016, which was interacted with more than 100,000 times, stated, "if Killary wins there will be riots nationwide, not seen since the times of Revolutionary war!!"Albright said this post was likely amplified through paid advertising because the overwhelming majority of Secured Borders' messages received only a few thousand interactions.Facebook has said it identified 3,000 ads tied to the Russian troll farm that ran between June 2015 and May 2017, though it's unclear if those ads included any of the messages calling for violence.Facebook shared those ads with Congress, but they have not yet been publicly released.Related: Even Pokmon Go used by extensive Russian-linked meddling effort Susan Benesch, director of the Dangerous Speech Project and a faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, said violent messages like this could increase the possibility of audiences condoning or participating in violence against members of targeted groups."People can be heavily influenced by content online even when they don't know where it comes from," Benesch said."In these cases, we can't know if anyone was actually influenced toward violence, but this type of speech could increase that risk."Facebook's terms of service prohibit content that is "hate speech, threatening, or... incites violence."Asked for comment, a Facebook spokesperson told CNN, "We don't allow the promotion of violence on Facebook but know we need to do better.We are hiring thousands of new people to our review teams, building better tools to keep our community safe, and investing in new technologies to help locate more banned content and bad actors."Facebook's Vice President of Policy and Communications, Elliot Schrage, has said the company is working to develop greater safeguards against election interference and other forms of abuse.In a blog post earlier this month, Schrage said Facebook is "still looking for abuse and bad actors on our platform our internal investigation continues."The Internet Research Agency, a secretive company based in St. Petersburg, which the US intelligence community has linked to the Kremlin, appears to be the source of 470 inauthentic Facebook accounts that shared a wide range of controversial messages.Documents obtained by CNN show the IRA included a "Department of Provocations" that sought to spread fake news and social divisions in the West.-- CNN's Drew Griffin contributed reporting.
Top NPR editor on leave amid reports of harassment:::::NPR has placed its top editor, Michael Oreskes, on "administrative leave" amid accusations that he sexually harassed two women decades ago while he was working at The New York Times.Oreskes, the senior vice president for news at NPR, has not responded to requests for comment from CNNMoney.In a Wednesday morning memo to staff, NPR CEO Jarl Mohn stressed that the company is taking the allegations seriously."I'm writing to share that I've asked Vice President of News Programming and Operations Chris Turpin to take on interim leadership of the newsroom," Mohn said."Starting today, Chris will serve in the capacity of the Senior Vice President of News for NPR and oversee both strategic direction and day to day operations related to our journalism."Mohn's memo is an indication that Oreskes will not be returning to work anytime soon.Mohn also urged staff to contact human resources, the legal department, or his office directly "if you believe you have experienced or are aware of any incidence of harassment or other inappropriate behavior."Oreskes allegedly made unwanted sexual advances toward two journalists who were seeking jobs at The New York Times two decades ago.Both accusers say that Oreskes unexpectedly kissed them during career-oriented business meetings while he was working as the Times' Washington bureau chief, according to The Washington Post, which broke the story on Tuesday.A third accuser, who currently works at NPR, said she filed a complaint about him to NPR's human resources department in October 2015, according to NPR's own reporting on Oreskes.Her complaint said Oreskes "hijacked a career counseling session into a three-hour-long dinner that delved into deeply personal territory" and included mentions of sex with a former girlfriend.The network, at the time, rebuked Oreskes and informed other executives at the company after the complaint was filed, according to NPR's own reporting.After the story broke Tuesday about his alleged prior behavior, NPR officials placed him on leave.Related: Workplace touching: When it's OK, and when it's harassment A spokeswoman for NPR told CNNMoney, "We take these kinds of allegations very seriously.If a concern is raised, we review the matter promptly and take appropriate steps as warranted to assure a safe, comfortable and productive work environment."
Stelter: Trump has a fog machine. Journalists have to see through it:::::When you say "Russia," they say "Hillary."The right-wing response to Robert Mueller's investigation is to change the subject, preferably to an alleged "scandal" involving Hillary Clinton.Cynical?Perhaps.But millions of viewers and readers embrace the counter-narrative presented by President Trump and his allies in the media.This creates a thick layer of fog, making it hard to see what really matters.Maybe this is the goal.Regardless, it poses a challenge for journalists who are trying to convey the truth.Diversionary techniques have to be covered and called out for what they are.This fact-check of White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is a model.But there's another school of thought that says the fog should be ignored, lest responsible news organizations inadvertently lend credibility to irresponsible stories.Trump and his fervent supporters in right-wing media clearly want the focus to be on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Witness Monday's briefing.When Sanders was asked about the guilty plea by one Trump associate and the indictments of two others, she falsely said the charges have "nothing to do with the President's campaign," and then she changed the subject."The real collusion scandal has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia," she said.Fusion GPS is the political research firm that produced an anti-Trump dossier.The Clinton campaign's partial financing of the research, first reported by the Washington Post, was a huge story in conservative media circles last week.The other huge right-wing story was about alleged Clinton connections to Russian efforts to gain influence in the American uranium industry during the Obama administration.Fox became fixated on this story -- dubbed the "Uranium One scandal" -- and demanded answers.Pro-Trump hosts recast the ongoing Russian investigations as a scandal for Clinton and the Democrats.In the wake of Monday's indictments, when Trump tweeted "why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????," he was conveying what he had heard from right-wing media.Trump did it again on Tuesday, tweeting, "Check the DEMS!"It's a feedback loop between Trump and his cheerleaders on TV and online -- and the end result is confusion.A campaign of confusion can have ill effects on the audience.As Trump supporter Scott Adams, the creator of the "Dilbert" cartoon, observed on Fox Monday night: "There's so much Russian 'stuff' that people are overwhelmed.I've lost track.Are there six scandals?Seven scandals?"As @brianstelter says: "Remember, Trump wants this to be foggy."Mueller's job is to make it not, to turn gray into black-and-white facts.https://t.co/NzZ4bBJCTa Garrett M. Graff (@vermontgmg) October 31, 2017 Some Democrats have urged the public to try to see through the fog.People inside the Trump campaign "sought the help of the Russians.They then lied about it," Congressman Jim Himes said on "The Situation Room" Monday night.Himes said part of Trump's "pattern is 'Please don't look over here.Look at Hillary Clinton.Look at Uranium One,' where anybody who looks at five facts related to any of those things will see that that is nothing other than a distraction away from some very serious developments here."But on Fox, various Clinton-related storylines are portrayed as "very serious developments."Next to graphics that said "NUCLEAR BRIBERY?"and "MAJOR CRISIS IN AMERICA," Sean Hannity asked why Hillary Clinton hasn't been charged with any crimes.Hannity talked about Clinton all throughout his hour-long show on Monday."We do need a special prosecutor," he said at one point.He even called her "President Clinton" by accident.At recent public events, Clinton has been joking about Fox's fixation.At a Human Rights Campaign gala on Saturday, Clinton said she wished she lived in the White House, and quipped, "Fox News seems to think that's where I live, in the White House.Because they spend a disproportionate amount of their time talking about impeaching me," Clinton said.A version of this column first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter.Sign up here!

Off-Broadway Production of 'Too Heavy For Your Pocket' Spotlights 1960s Black Resistance Movement That Still Strikes Chords Today:::::Tucked away in the sub-basement of the Roundabout Underground in Times Square, just a few blocks away from where some are paying otherworldly ticket prices for "Hamilton" or Bruce Springsteen's one man show, may be one of Off-Broadway's best kept secrets."Too Heavy For Your Pocket," a new play written by Jirh Breon Holder starring Brandon Gill, Hampton Fluker, Eboni Flowers and Nneka Okafor, was just extended one week and will now conclude its run at Roundabout's Black Box Theatre on Nov. 26.The play chronicles the lives of two African American couples in the early 1960's during the heat of the civil rights movement.Their futures are thrown into turmoil after one of their group decides to forsake a life-altering college scholarship to join the Freedom Riders.The original Freedom Riders consisted of 13 African American and white civil rights activists who launched the Freedom Rides on May 4, 1961 -- a movement that consisted of a series of bus trips through the American South to protest segregation in interstate bus terminals.The Freedom Riders attempted to integrate facilities at bus terminals along the way into the Deep South.African American Freedom Riders tried to use whites-only restrooms and lunch counters, encountering violence from white protesters along the route while drawing international attention to their cause.Gill, who the plays the character of Bowzie Brandon, was introduced to the project when the playwright said the part was written specifically with him in mind."The writer was a friend first and he writes to your strengths.So there are a lot of characteristics between Bowzie and myself that we definitely share," Brandon says."There are similarities in terms of being a dreamer and wanting to reach outside the little space that you grew up in."Flowers, who plays Gill's bold and sassy wife Evelyn, says the material spoke to her in a deeply instinctual way."As a southerner, especially being from Montgomery, I feel like these conversations and dialogue were always prevalent in my family," she says."So I was familiar with Dr. King's journey and that of the Freedom Riders and the four little girls [murdered on Sept. 15, 1963 after a bomb detonated beneath the steps of the 16th Street Baptist Church].These have always been active conversations in my family.So this is just a deeper dive into the narrative."Both performers believe that while the play focuses on the events of the 1960s, it has never been more relevant than it is today, in 2017, as professional athletes take a knee in the face of social injustices and women across the country speak out against sexual harassment and abuse in the form of the #MeToo movement."There's never an opportune time for people of color to speak out against adversity," says Gill.

Mario Gets Help in 'Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle' Video Game:::::In video games, Mario, the intrepid princess-saving plumber, does not usually pair up with anyone outside of the Mushroom Kingdom.There are exceptions for special events, like Mario teaming up with Sonic the Hedgehog for the Olympics, but generally, the most iconic video game character doesnt use backup.Until now.The Mushroom Kingdom is in danger from an outside force in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, a new video game for the Nintendo Switch gaming console.Mario and friends are getting help from the Rabbids, crazy rabbit-like creatures who speak in gibberish, yelling "BWAAAH!"very often, from another gaming company, Ubisoft.Creative director Davide Soliani said he and his team wanted to bring something to the Mario universe of games that no one had seen before, and using the Rabbids and their penchant for chaos and slapstick violence provided the perfect injection of new ideas for a bold take on Mario.He said there is a familiarity in the overall look and feel of the game, but surprises are waiting around every corner.We used these contrasts as a focus to bring new ideas, new game mechanics, new environments, and thats why you are in the Mushroom Kingdom, but it is twisted, Soliani said.Mario is very well known as a hero, a brave guy.And the Rabbids are quite the opposite, quite different.How cool it could be if Mario, throughout the game, teaches to the Rabbids how to become heroes?And Mario learns from the Rabbids how to crack a joke, to take it easy.Mario is joined by his friends Princess Peach (no rescuing needed this time), Yoshi, and Luigi.They team up with four Rabbid heroes who mimic their Nintendo idols, taking costumes to look like the original gang.In the campaign, these characters will form teams of three to find a way to fix the Mushroom Kingdom by visiting different worlds and battling enemies.We wanted make something that Mario players would recognize, like jumping and stomping, Soliani said.But at the same time, we were using the Rabbids to inject in those mechanics new ways to spice up the combat, new ways to spice up the Nintendo characters as well.The development team at Ubisoft specialized in tactical and strategic games.Making a new game with such beloved characters presented challenges, but Soliani said a turn-based strategy shooter made the most sense to maximize the divergent ideas of gameplay and abilities in the game.We should try to stay true to the Mario universe and mix tactical phase, combat phase, which is more in line with the Mario world, he said.Finding treasure chests, collect coins to buy new weapons, meet new heroes and be challenged by new enemies.When he came up with the idea for the mashup, Soliani knew he would have to not only convince his own company, Ubisoft, he would have to sway Nintendo to allow him to use their characters.He met with Shigeru Miyamoto, the man who created the Mario character, originally called Jumpman, in the classic video game Donkey Kong in 1981.Solaini said presenting his idea to the most legendary game designer in the world was intimidating.When we first presented the game to Miyamoto-san, we had only three weeks in-house to come up with a prototype.When we presented the prototype to Miyamoto-san, he was surprised that we had, in our prototype, Mario and Luigi.Miyamoto asked how Solaini got the character designs for Mario and Luigi in the prototype.Solani told him his team made them from scratch for the presentation, impressing the Nintendo game designer.Early reviews of the game have been very good, mentioning the different elements of gameplay and the creativity used to bring Mario and the Rabbids together.The style of combat is reminiscent of another turn-based shooter, X-COM, with a variety of weapons and the use of cover for defense.However, Solaini said their inspiration came from another popular game.Im a big fan of X-COM, the original one from Julian Gollop and the new one from (Jake) Solomon, he said.But our reference was not X-COM but Mario Kart.We wanted to bring the dynamics, the surprise that you have in go-cart racing to our combat system in a strategy game.With delightful and recognizable characters, whimsical environments and dialog, and a battle system that combines movement and shooting into strategic combat, Solaini and his team were proud of what they accomplished.Those were the basic foundations that we built up for the rest of the game.When we did that, we said, OK, I think we have something very strong, something that we should explore even more.He invited all fans, including diehard Nintendo fans, to experience something different.Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle is available now for the Nintendo Switch.It is rated E+10 for everyone 10 years of age or older due to cartoon violence, comic mischief, and mild language.

recall but which would have stemmed from "drunken behavior."He also spoke publicly for the first time about being gay, which drew backlash from some observers as an attempt at deflection.A release

gala on Nov. 20 in New York City.Past recipients include Steven Spielberg, Shonda Rhimes and J.J. Abrams.The move comes after actor Anthony Rapp came forward with claims Spacey made inappropriate sexual advances toward him in 1986, when he was 14.Netflix announced Monday that it was pulling the plug on "House of Cards," which stars Spacey.8:55 a.m. British media are reporting that police have widened their investigation into sexual assault claims against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.Citing unidentified sources, the Independent newspaper, Press Association and Sky News say London's Metropolitan Police are now investigating allegations by seven women over incidents that reportedly took place from the 1980s to 2015.Police declined to comment, only saying Tuesday that officers from its child abuse and sexual offenses command are probing sexual assault allegations made by seven victims.British police do not identify people under investigation until charges are laid.The news comes just days after the British Film Institute stripped Weinstein of its highest honor, saying his alleged "appalling conduct" stands in opposition to the organization's values.Weinstein denies having any non-consensual sexual activity.

Big K.R.I.T., Gord Downie, Julien Baker and more music reviews:::::In this batch of reviews we explore the latest from rapper Big K.R.I.T, late Tragically Hip-frontman Gord Downie, singer-songwriter Julien Baker, a tribute to Nat King Cole from singer Gregory Porter and the latest (surprise) album from Fever Ray.Decca Records Big K.R.I.T.s 4eva is a Mighty Long Time **** On his third full-length collection, Mississippi rapper Big K.R.I.T.hands in a double-disc, 85-minute opus.This is an often stunning, adventurous set.One of the two discs is emblazoned with the name Big K.R.I.T.The other is labeled with K.R.I.T.s real name, Justin Scott.That second disc does indeed have a slightly earthier feeling.The jazzy vibes of The Light which features Robert Glasper Jr., Bilal, Kenneth Whalum and Burniss Earl Travis II has a mature vibe, while the Jill Scott-assisted Higher Calling is inward-looking and contemplative.K.R.I.T.finds balance here.He crafts rhymes in a modern, more emo-driven style on tracks like Mixed Messages and Price of Fame, making him an excellent contemporary of people like Kendrick Lamar and Earl Sweatshirt, while on tracks like Layup and Get Up 2 Come Down he recalls the greatness of Outkast and the Pharcyde.Hes able to get some strangely funky gospel edges on Keep the Devil off and rap beside UGK on Ride Wit Me.Sometimes this record can be a bit of a grab-bag, but it doesnt need focus.If K.R.I.T.can give us something as hard as nails as Confetti one moment, extol the benefits of a having a booming system a couple tracks later (continuing his series of the subject) on Subenstein (My Sub IV), then later give us something that drifts as beautifully as Aux Cord a little while later, hes doing something right.Big K.R.I.T.is packed with ambition and shows immense versatility here.If you are a hip-hop fan with eclectic tastes, this is the record for you.With his flows and his production, K.R.I.T.proves to be a malleable, dynamic force.Focus Tracks: Aux Cord This beat flows so easily and K.R.I.T.drops his verses so effortlessly.It blends together perfectly.Price of Fame K.R.I.T.debates whether living his dream is worth what he loses in the process, and along the way he drops some real insight.Get up 2 Come Down (Featuring CeeLo Green and Sleepy Brown) This has a classic retro vibe, but perhaps the high-point of this song is CeeLos verse, as he often sings more than he raps these days.Arts & Crafts Gord Downies Introduce Yourself ***1/2 When Gord Downie, the famed lead-singer of the Tragically Hip died a couple weeks ago after a battle with brain cancer, he got a teary tribute from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The Tragically Hip made a few notable blips down here, but in Canada, they are considered musical gods.Last years excellent Man Machine Poem served as the final Tragically Hip album, but at the beginning of this year Downie managed to squeeze out this sprawling 73-minute set with Broken Social Scenes Kevin Drew handling production.As youd expect, this is often a difficult listen.Downie sounds like a man taking stock of his life and these often sparse pieces frequently feature just Downie and a piano.Take First Person, which has some moving depth to it, but isnt designed for passive listening.Downies work has always been ripe with subtlety.Many might find passages of this record to be on the repetitive side, but a closer listen results in something more nuanced and rewarding.My First Girlfriend, seems to be the result of Downies life flashing before his eyes, and Far Away and Blurred is a striking reflection on personal experiences.Theres a wistful but winking sadness to this record.Downies voice is also an ever-changing instrument.On Wolfs Home, he sounds a bit like David Byrne, whereas the reflection on putting a child to bed, Bedtime, has a Lou Reed-like sensibility.Introduce Yourself is full of pain and anguish.Theres serenity in Downies voice, but there is an undercurrent of sadness at what is about to happen.This in some ways is less of a traditional record and more of a goodbye to everything that Downie has loved.The result is an album that wont leave you humming its tunes but will leave you treasuring what you hold dear.This isnt the catchiest of records, but if you internalize Downies sentiments, this collection may tug at your soul.Focus Tracks: Wolfs Home This is a tuneful song.In the long-run, Downie faces his fears headfirst.The operatic yelp he adopts occasionally here is an unusual yet effective choice.Faith Faith A touching tribute that seems to be aimed at Downies dog.It is delivered with the sweetest and most sincere emotion.Safe is Dead A harsh title gives way to a song with a catchy bass, piano and drum backdrop.Again, there is a mixture of dread and resignation in Downies delivery.That combination is hard to achieve.Matador Records Julien Bakers Turn out the Lights **** Julien Baker follows up her excellent 2015 album Sprained Ankle with Turn out the Lights.If you loved Sprained Ankle, youll enjoy this record, too, as it showcases many of the same hallmarks.Baker still sings sparse numbers packed with a uniquely powerful sense of emotional heft.The singer, who has dealt with addiction in the past, is deeply religious and openly gay, giving her narratives a great deal of subject matter to approach.Often she sounds like she is coming from a similarly quiet, angst-driven place as Elliott Smith.On Televangelist, she says, All my prayers are just apologies.Theres a palpable sense of hushed torment here as Baker is eloquently trying to spell it all out.She finds beauty in Hurt Less, which discusses perhaps the same car accident as the Sprained Ankle-opener Blacktop.On Appointments, she has some real emo-fueled momentum.It is no wonder why she opened for Death Cab for Cutie.When she raises her voice momentarily on both the title track and on Sour Breath, it adds a layer to her normally subdued sound.This is a bolder record sonically than Sprained Ankle," but it may not be quite as immediate in its appeal.Still, Turn out the Lights shows Baker continuing to grow and continuing to find her own unique niche.At 22, she has already firmly planted herself as an honest, detail-oriented singer-songwriter who wears her heart on her sleeve.Focus Tracks: Appointments Anyone who listened to Sprained Ankle will immediately be sucked into the guitar riff of this track.In a way, only two albums in, Baker already has her own compositional framework cemented in place.Turn out the Lights So much quiet angst bubbles up and explodes before the end of this track, hitting a new sonic apex.Baker is from the punk world originally and as this track builds, that begins to show more clearly.Shadowboxing Fighting her demons or the devil, Bakers internal struggle is spilled out eloquently.BMG Rights Management Gregory Porters Nat King Cole & Me ***1/2 Jazz singer Gregory Porters latest album is a tribute to the output and career of Nat King Cole.Fittingly, it is titled Nat King Cole & Me.Porters often delicate and smooth approach is winning and hes able to deliver softly sweeping versions of Mona Lisa, Nature Boy and The Christmas Song.The orchestral arrangements handled by different musicians in both Los Angeles and London give this collection some real depth.When Porter picks up the pace a little bit on L-O-V-E, the band really gets some opportunity to swing.Much of this material has been widely covered in the past, perhaps most notably by Coles own daughter, Natalie Cole, on her much-celebrated 1991 album, Unforgettable: With Love.While Porter definitely isnt reinventing the wheel here, his enveloping delivery shows how much he cares about the material.He tackles his version of Quizas Quizas Quizas with real gusto and brings emotion to the sad and upsetting narrative of the Cole Porter-penned Miss Otis Regrets.To Porters credit, not all of his choices are the most obvious and that benefits this set a great deal.In the end, you get a record that pays tribute to Nat King Cole with a great deal of affection.Hopefully it will introduce the music Cole helped make famous to a whole new generation.Focus Tracks: L-O-V-E You may find yourself wishing the rest of this album had more of the swinging energy demonstrated here.Miss Otis Regrets A harsh but moving song which is delivered with skill and nuance.Mona Lisa Sure, this is a timeless standard that Cole made his own, but Porters interpretation does it justice.Rabid Records Fever Rays Plunge ****1/2 Last Thursday it was announced that Karin Dreijer Andersson, who spent years as one half of the experimental Swedish dance outfit The Knife, would be releasing her first album in eight years under her solo-project moniker, Fever Ray.A day later, we got Plunge, a rich, weird bouncy record that may very well be her most upbeat work since The Knifes classic Deep Cuts.This is a sometimes raw, sometimes sexually graphic, record that also sounds like it is at the forefront of pop.Mustnt Hurry and Wanna Sip are definitely groundbreaking pieces, but they could also work in a left-field pop context, while on the frank and overtly sexual This Country, Dreijer Andersson sounds like the lost Swedish artistic love child of Bjork and Trent Reznor.The beginning of To the Moon and Back even slightly recalls the beginning of Nine Inch Nails Head Like a Hole.The synth-line that begins A Part of Us sounds like it should be scoring episodes of Stranger Things, while closer Mamas Hands has a subtle house-music undercurrent.Andersson continues to be a groundbreaker.If anything, Plunge is a much more accessible, brighter, almost celebratory record when compared to her 2009 self-titled offering.If you are looking for inventive electronic music full of oddball surprises while still maintaining a pop core, Plunge is most definitely the album for you.Focus Tracks: This Country A powerfully charged piece, this track is full of so many sonic details that it should grab just about anyone who likes experimental electronic music with slightly industrial edges.Mustnt Hurry This is among the most accessible music she has ever made.Its a slow-burning experimental pop ballad with a strong score-music-esque backbone.It has a quiet build, but it holds on tightly.Plunge This title track has a vaguely Asian vibe and some really inventive beat-work.Coming up: New music from Sam Smith and more.Plus, get reviews of albums from Kelly Clarkson, Rachel Platten and Weezer.

Kevin Spacey will not receive international Emmy after allegation of sexual advance on 14-year-old:::::Kevin Spacey will no longer be honored by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences at its upcoming awards gala following actor Anthony Rapp's allegation that, when he was just 14, the "House of Cards" star made a sexual advance on him.The International Academy made the announcement Monday night on its website."The International Academy has announced today that in light of recent events it will not honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award," a statement read.The International Academy has announced that in light of recent events it will not honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 Intl Emmy Founders Award Intl Emmy Awards (@iemmys) October 30, 2017 Calling the two-time Oscar winner "one of the great multi-dimensional talents in our industry," the International Academy first announced in June that Spacey was set to accept its Founders Award, which recognizes individuals who cross cultural boundaries.On Sunday, Rapp, now 46, accused Spacey of trying to seduce him while attending a party back in 1986."He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold.But I don't, like, squirm away initially, because I'm like, 'What's going on?'And then he lays down on top of me," Rapp said in a BuzzFeed article published Sunday.Spacey, who said he doesn't remember the incident, nonetheless apologized for his "deeply inappropriate drunken behavior" in a post on Twitter later that night.In his tweet, he also revealed that he has "loved and had romantic encounters with men" and that he chooses "now to live as a gay man."Despite his apology, which was widely criticized for his coming out under these circumstances, the producers of his Netflix show "House of Cards" announced today that they were suspending production on the show."MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on HOUSE OF CARDS season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew," Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio that created "House of Cards" with the streaming service, said in a joint statement.On Monday, the producers said they were meeting with the cast and crew to "ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported," adding that "Spacey is not working on the set at this time."Netflix also confirmed to ABC News that the upcoming season 6 would be the series' last.A Netflix representative confirmed to ABC News that the decision to end the show after season six was made before the scandal broke.
Hollywood players Kevin Spacey, Roy Price, James Toback and more face harassment allegations after Weinstein scandal:::::The reach and fallout of the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues to grow, as more than just the disgraced producer have been accused of sexual harassment and assault over the past month.After The New York Times published its first report regarding Weinstein and his alleged misconduct on Oct. 5, the paper and other outlets like The New Yorker printed dozens of alleged victim accounts, and not just Weinstein has lost his job or his standing.Earlier this month, Roy Price resigned from his position as head of Amazon Studios after allegations against him, and now Kevin Spacey has been accused of making a sexual advance toward fellow actor Anthony Rapp when he was just 14 years old.In both those cases, the alleged victims said the Weinstein snowball was the inspiration they needed to step forward and tell their story.Weinstein denied "any allegations of nonconsensual sex" via his spokesman, and Spacey took to Twitter last night to apologize to Rapp, while saying he does not remember the episode.Price has yet to speak out after stepping down.Here's a summary of how the Weinstein's sexual assault scandal has begun to reverberate through the industry.Harvey Weinstein The first story on Weinstein was published on Oct. 5, in which the Times reported that the producer had allegedly paid off several accusers over the past decades.What came next was a slew of reports and personal accounts from former actresses, media personalities and other women who stepped forward to cite sexual misconduct by Weinstein.Gwyneth Paltrow, Annabella Sciorra, Lupita Nyong'o and more have spoken to the media or published on social media to describe their allegations of abuse.Alexander Koerner/Getty Images Weinstein was terminated by the board of the Weinstein Company in light of the allegations and later resigned from the board of directors.He was also expelled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.The full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson said that he denied "any allegations of nonconsensual sex" and that "Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.Amazon's Roy Price On Oct. 12, Producer Isa Hackett said she felt compelled to speak out about what she says was her harassment experience with Amazon Studios President Roy Price.Price resigned days after Hackett told The Hollywood Reporter that Price allegedly propositioned her in a cab on the way to a party in 2015, although she told him she was married.She said that Price continued pressing her and she later reported the incident to Amazon executives.Paul Zimmerman/WireImage via Getty Images "We take seriously any questions about the conduct of our employees," an Amazon spokesperson told THR."We expect people to set high standards for themselves;

Chris Brown's 45-song album not the skip-fest you'd expect:::::Chris Brown, "Heartbreak on a Full Moon" (RCA) Chris Brown sure has some nerve, releasing a 45-song album when audience attention spans are notoriously short, while most artists agonize over trimming their set into a carefully curated bundle that precisely captures the latest evolution of their sound.But, alas, Brown doesn't seem concerned about attention spans or careful curation.And, to be fair, his sound has always been the sum of varying genres, each one sending him to the top of one chart or another.That said, with "Heartbreak on a Full Moon," Brown performs like a one-man streaming service, and he's got hits on every channel.POP HIT BROWN There's "You Like," with Brown sending radio friendly messages over an up-tempo, electronic beat."I want you to dance because you feel beautiful inside, baby," he sings.Add to that the similarly groove-inducing "If You're Down," ''Bite My Tongue," ''Frustrated" and "This Way."(That last one is, perhaps, the happiest sounding breakup song of the season.)R&B BANGER BROWN Not to be confused with the Rapper Persona Brown channel (more on that later), this set of tracks features the singer in his slinky R&B mode.Like the pop station, this, too, is good stuff.Please note: takeoff-your-clothes jam "Pull Up," and the sonically tasty, but lyrically debatable "Covered In You."''A leak in your lovin, it's on the verge of caving in.," Brown croons, before adding, "go 'head and drench me with your body."RAPPER PERSONA BROWN This is Brown at his least romantic.Like a rapper would, he brags about "a hundred on my wrist" on the Usher and Gucci Mane-assisted single "Party," with its uber catchy hook.Brown weaves between rapping and singing, holding his own alongside Young Thug and Future on the down-tempo "High End."And he goes heavier with his rap skills on "Sensei" and "Pills & Automobiles"; the result is respectable in both instances.VERY VULNERABLE BROWN Brown's brashness melts away on songs like "Grass Ain't Greener," and his version of vulnerability is believable on the enchanting title track, the achy "Paradise," the Donell Jones-inspired "Hope You Do" and the regret-laden "Enemy."''She was just one night/baby, you were my whole life," he sings on the latter track.And Brown gets introspective about fame on "Yellow Tape."''Meeting with the devil," he sings."'Here take this contract.Signature please.You can have it all, but your soul I'mma keep.'"Brown is man of many vibes, and though elements of his personality and style are more pronounced on one track versus another, it all sounds like him.And in the case of "Heartbreak on a Full Moon," perhaps Brown's greatest feat is that he makes it all come together, and sound pretty good.Follow Melanie Sims at Twitter.com/MelanieJoySims
NYPD has 2 open sexual assault cases against Harvey Weinstein:::::The New York Police Department has two active cases involving embattled movie producer Harvey Weinstein, a law enforcement official briefed on the situation told ABC News.Interested in null?Add null as an interest to stay up to date on the latest null news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The alleged victims are Lucia Evans, the actress who previously told the New Yorker Weinstein exposed himself and physically forced her to perform oral sex on him, and another woman whose name is being withheld.Neither case is subject to the statute of limitations.A source told ABC News the allegations of Annabella Sciorra, the actress who went public to the New Yorker saying Weinstein raped her in her apartment in the 1990s, are not currently being investigated by the NYPD, but could not confirm the reasons.Through his spokeswoman, Weinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex.As part of the ongoing investigation, NYPD detectives traveled in the last two weeks to Montreal to interview a witness, the department said.Detectives have also considered, but have not yet traveled elsewhere, including to Los Angeles.The department's travels and assistance to departments in other jurisdictions must be connected to the New York City cases.The source described the NYPD probe as a real active look at the accusations against Weinstein, who has been known to spend significant time in New York City.Since the stories including accusations against Weinstein broke, the NYPD and Manhattan DAs office have received multiple calls to their sex crimes hotlines concerning the disgraced producer.The vast majority of accusations have involved alleged groping or forcible sexual conduct, which are subject to strict statute of limitations and cannot be prosecuted today.The Los Angeles Police Department has also interviewed a potential victim of a 2013 sexual assault that allegedly involved Weinstein and, earlier this month, ABC News confirmed that police in London were investigating an alleged incident of sexual assault involving Weinstein from the 1980s.Joe Simonetti contributed to this report.

Great British Bake Off: Final watched by 7.3 million viewers:::::Image copyright Channel 4 Image caption Prue Leith joined Paul Hollywood as a judge this season Warning: This story contains spoilers The Great British Bake Off finale was seen by a live audience of 7.3 million, overnight viewing figures show.That rose to 7.7 million when including those watching on Channel 4 +1.The viewing figures come in spite of Prue Leith accidentally tweeting the name of the winner 10 hours early.It's Channel 4's highest overnight ratings since the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in 2012.That saw an average 7.7 million tune in to see the events from the London Games.But the Bake Off ratings are lower than the 14 million who tuned in to BBC One in 2016 to see Candice Brown crowned champion.That figure rose to 15.9 million when those watching on catch up services were included.Image copyright Channel 4 Image caption Former Army officer Sophie Faldo was crowned the 2017 winner The final saw Sophie Faldo crowned the winner and handed that all-important glass cakestand.She beat Kate Lyon and Steven Carter-Bailey to the title, with her multilayered honey-bee cake showstopper proving too sweet for the judges to resist.(Incidentally, if Sophie wants a taste of what could lie in store as a Bake Off winner, it's just been announced that Candice is going to be taking part in this year's Dancing on Ice on ITV.)This was the first series of Bake Off on Channel 4, after it moved there from BBC One.Alex Mahon, chief executive at Channel 4, said Prue, fellow judge Paul Hollywood and presenters Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig had "served up a showstopper of a series"."I'm delighted that they'll all be back in the tent on Channel 4 next year," she added.Image copyright Channel 4 Image caption Sophie Faldo said it was "surreal" to be crowned the winner There was a peak audience of 8.3 million just before 2100 on Tuesday - when the final three had finished their showstopper bakes, but before the judges had tried them.Channel 4 said the final was seen by an average of 2 million in the 16-34 age group, with a 57.5% share of that audience - adding that it was the biggest series for young audiences on any UK channel this year.They added that the overnight series average of 6.2 million is the largest Channel 4 has seen since Big Fat Gypsy Weddings in 2011.The viewing figures rise to about 8.9 million when counting everyone who saw an episode of Bake Off over a seven-day period.Applications for the next series of Bake Off are already open.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Kevin Spacey: More allegations of sexual harassment surface:::::Image copyright EPA New allegations have emerged from a number of men accusing Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct.US filmmaker Tony Montana claims he was groped by the actor in a Los Angeles bar in 2003.Montana says he was left with PTSD for six months after he claims Spacey "forcefully" grabbed his crotch.It follows an allegation made by Anthony Rapp that the House of Cards actor tried to "seduce" him when he was 14 years old.Kevin Spacey says he has no recollection of that encounter, and was "beyond horrified".Image caption It's claimed Kevin Spacey "routinely preyed" on young male actors while he was artistic director at the Old Vic Film director Montana told Radar Online that he was in his thirties when the incident took place at the Coronet Bar in LA.He says he removed Spacey's hand from his crotch and walked away, but claims the actor later followed him into the men's toilets.'Routinely preyed' Incidents regarding Spacey are also alleged to have taken place in the UK while the two-time Oscar winner was the artistic director at the Old Vic in London between 2004 and 2015.Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, claims Spacey "routinely preyed" on young male actors."It seems the only requirement was to be a male under the age of 30 for Mr Spacey to feel free to touch us," he wrote in a Facebook post.He said he fended off two "unpleasant" advances from Spacey that "bordered on harassment," but that others were afraid to do so.Image copyright European Photopress Agency "There are a lot of us who have a 'Kevin Spacey story'," says Cavazos.The Old Vic has set up a confidential complaints process for anyone connected to the 200-year-old theatre to come forward.It said in a statement: "We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level."'Seedy and a bit weird' Separately, a British man claims Kevin Spacey exposed himself to him in 2010, when he was working at a hotel in West Sussex.Speaking to the Sun, Daniel Beal alleges the Usual Suspects star flashed his private parts, saying: "It's big, isn't it?"and tried to get the then 19-year-old to touch him.The former bartender claims Spacey also invited him up to his room, but he rejected the star's advances.Beal says Spacey gave him his 5,000 watch later that same evening, and a few weeks later called him asking to meet up.He told the Sun: "In hindsight, that must have been grooming.He was just like his character in House Of Cards - seedy and a bit weird."'Either stupid or predatory' The BBC has also uncovered allegations of sexual misconduct against Spacey by a man who claims he was harassed by the star in the mid-1980s.The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, says he met the star at theatre school before being invited to New York by him, when he was 17 years old.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kevin Spacey holds his Oscar for Best Actor for his role in American Beauty in 2000.Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme, the man (who they've called John), says despite sleeping on the star's sofa he woke up fully clothed with Spacey lying on him, in his underwear.John, who still works in the entertainment industry, said Spacey again became "affectionate" the second night he was in the city."I burst into tears because I couldn't articulate any more what was happening to me.I was scared... To his credit, he backed off and we went to sleep."Reflecting on his experience, John says: "It seems he was grooming me.For me, I never let on that that's what I was interested in.I never discussed it, nor did I want it.John points out neither of them drank any alcohol that weekend."He was either very stupid or he was predatory - or maybe a little of both.I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst, emotionally.John says he didn't tell the authorities or his parents at the time, although he has since told friends.Image copyright MRC II Distribution Company L.P/Netflix Image caption Robin Wright and Kevin Spacey in Netflix drama House of Cards The BBC has contacted representatives of Kevin Spacey for his response to these allegations.Meanwhile, production of the sixth season of Netflix series House of Cards has been suspended following the sexual assault allegations against the actor.The show was already due to end after this season, but production is now suspended "until further notice".Spacey has also been dropped as the recipient of a special Emmy award he was due to receive next month.The International TV Academy said in a statement that it was withdrawing the International Emmy Founders Award "in light of recent events".Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Sainsbury's is setting up a record label:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sales of vinyl topped three million last year, the highest total since 1992 It's a case of Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls: Sainsbury's is setting up its own record label.The supermarket giant is releasing a series of vinyl albums in 168 of its stores, starting this week.The first two releases are 20-track compilations curated by Saint Etienne star and pop scholar Bob Stanley.The musician, whose own hits include You're In A Bad Way and He's On The Phone, said he wanted to put music back on the high street."Growing up, one thing I loved was the number of high street shops where you could buy new releases," he told the BBC."I remember buying Dusty Springfield's Greatest Hits, the one with a striking high contrast black and white cover, at Woolworths in Croydon."I knew a few of the hits, but that was the first place I came across songs like Goin' Back and The Look Of Love, life-changing songs."Those kind of compilations - where some of the songs are familiar, and the rest of the album is a revelation which can shape your tastes - I think are just as important as classic standalone albums like Pet Sounds or Parallel Lines."Image copyright Sainbury's Image caption Bob Stanley says vinyl has a "heft" that CDs and cassettes can't compete with Stanley's first two compilations are titled Coming Into Los Angeles - A Taste Of West Coast; and Hi-Fidelity - A Taste of Stereo Sound.They combine familiar tracks like Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and Al Stewart's Year Of The Cat with deeper cuts - such as The Flying Burrito Brothers' cover of The Rolling Stones' Wild Horses.The records come with essays by Stanley and striking, modernist artwork inspired by Sainsbury's in-house design studio of the 60s and 70s - whose minimalist packaging designs became classics.Image copyright Sainsbury's The resurgence of vinyl is an unexpected success story for the music industry.Fans bought more than three million vinyl records in 2016 - the highest number in 25 years - and sales in 2017 are up 30.6% year-on-year.Sainsbury's began selling vinyl in March 2016 and, with 120,000 sales so far this year, claim to represent 5% of the total UK vinyl market.Its label - called Own Label in reference to the supermarket's own-brand line in the 1970s - is a standalone imprint, released via Universal and Warner Music.Image caption St Etienne (L-R: Sarah Cracknell, Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs) received rave reviews for their recent album Home Counties Stanley says the format holds a certain romance for music-lovers."The heft of a vinyl album, the weight of it in your hands, and the impact of the artwork are all something that CDs and cassettes can't compete with."His future Sainsbury's compilations will hopefully include tracks by The Scone Roses, Bread Zeppelin, Ryvita Ora, Korn Flakes, Martha And The Blueberry Muffins and Pick and Little Mix.At the time of writing, St Etienne have no plans to re-record their 1992 hit single, Join Our Club (Biscuit).Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Hastings Pier wins 2017 Riba Stirling Prize:::::Image copyright James Robertshaw Image caption The restored structure was named Pier of the Year in April A historic pier in East Sussex that was devastated by fire in 2010 has won a prestigious architecture award after a multi-million pound redevelopment.Hastings Pier, which reopened in April 2016, beat five other buildings to the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) Stirling Prize.Now in its 22nd year, it is presented annually to the UK's best new building.Riba president Ben Derbyshire described the "stunning, flexible new pier" as "a masterpiece of regeneration".He also praised Hastings' locals for finding 3,000 shareholders to buy 100 stakes in "the people's pier".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Stirling Prize over the years However it was revealed last month that Hastings Pier made insufficient money over summer to cover costs and that it had to make some staff redundant.The chair of trustees said they were working on a new business plan.Image copyright PA Image caption It cost 14.2m to restore the pier Other buildings shortlisted for this year's Stirling Prize included the new City Campus at the City of Glasgow College and the Barrett's Grove housing scheme in north London.Originally built in 1872, Hastings Pier was judged Pier of the Year in April following its 14.2m restoration.The redevelopment took more than two years and saw the pier's former pavilion turned into a restaurant and bar.Image copyright RIBA Image caption The original pier closed in 2008 and was ravaged by fire in 2010 The rebuilt pier was designed by dRMM Architects, a London-based firm named after founders Alex de Rijke, Philip Marsh and Sadie Morgan.Accepting the prize, de Rijke praised the other nominees, saying: "You've all done fine buildings, but it seems that this year what really captured the imaginations was not doing one - in favour of making public space."The Stirling Prize judges praised the company for going "above and beyond" in its "campaigning, galvanising and organising [of] local support".They also praised the timber-clad structure "for its remarkable use of sustainable materials" and said that councils "should take inspiration" from the project.This year's judges included BBC journalist Evan Davis and Peter St John of Caruso St John Architects.The latter designed Damien Hirst's Newport Street Gallery, winner of last year's Riba Stirling Prize.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
'I woke up with Kevin Spacey lying on me':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The man, who did not want to be identified, says he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach A man has said he was left traumatised after waking up to find Hollywood star Kevin Spacey lying on him when he was a teenager in the 1980s.The man told Victoria Derbyshire Spacey invited him to spend the weekend in New York but it became clear he was interested in "a way I wasn't".He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him.The BBC has contacted Spacey for a comment.John, not his real name, added he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but said: "I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst."Image copyright AFP Image caption Kevin Spacey is a double Oscar winner and was artistic director at London's Old Vic for 11 years The latest allegation follows Spacey's apology after US actor Anthony Rapp accused him of making a sexual advance towards him when he was 14.Rapp told how Spacey laid down on top of him in a bedroom during a party at the older man's flat in 1986.The Double Oscar-winner said he was "beyond horrified" to hear the story and did not remember the encounter.Other men have now come forward, accusing Spacey of sexual harassment.US filmmaker Tony Montana claimed he suffered from PTSD for six months after Spacey allegedly grabbed his crotch in a Los Angeles bar in 2003.And Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the Old Vic, claims Spacey "routinely preyed" on young male actors.'Hand on thigh' Speaking to the programme, John said he first met the Broadway actor in 1984 at a summer theatre when he was 16.The pair exchanged letters and, a year later, when John was 17, Spacey invited him to spend a weekend at his home in New York City.John told how a "charming and brotherly" Spacey showed him around the city, took him out for dinner and introduced him to famous friends on their weekend together.On the first evening, Spacey talked a lot about his work and became affectionate "in a way I certainly wasn't interested in", he said.He put his hand on John's thigh, an arm around his shoulder and rubbed his arm.'Icy goodnight' At bedtime, John said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but John insisted on sleeping on the sofa."It was an icy 'goodnight' with the lights off.I thought I was going to be kicked out in the morning," he said."As we went to sleep, he was sobbing from his bed," said John.He said he felt it was attention-seeking behaviour in an attempt to get him to respond.The following morning, John said he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach and his arms wrapped around him."He was in his underwear, I was fully clothed.I supposed it was some sort of New York theatre actor 'good morning,'" he said.'Stupid or predatory' After a second day enjoying New York, John said once back at the flat, Spacey became affectionate again and told him he felt "misunderstood"."I burst into tears because I couldn't articulate any more what was happening to me.I was scared," said John."To his credit, he backed off and we went to sleep."John said he is telling his story now after reading about Rapp's similar experience and he wants young people to know they should be vigilant and speak out."It seems he was grooming me," John said."For me, I never let on that that's what I was interested in.I never discussed it, nor did I want it."I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst."He was either very stupid or predatory - or maybe a little of both."John points out that neither of them drank any alcohol that weekend.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anthony Rapp, now 46, appeared in Star Trek: Discovery He said he didn't tell his parents or the authorities at the time because he thought Spacey's behaviour might have been "permissible" and worried he might have "given off a vibe" that he was interested in Spacey.The BBC is seeking a response from Spacey.In light of Rapp's allegations, Netflix has suspended production of political drama, House of Cards, in which Spacey stars.Meanwhile, the Old Vic, a London theatre where Spacey worked for 11 years, has set up a confidential complaints process for people involved with the theatre.

Harvey Weinstein: UK woman 'shaken' after hotel encounter:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption British woman Sophie Morris says Harvey Weinstein harassed her when she was 19 years old A British woman who worked for Harvey Weinstein for a day says the movie mogul "intimidated" her after being sexually inappropriate in a hotel room.Sophie Morris, who was 19 at the time of the alleged incident, says a naked Weinstein beckoned her into a bedroom in the Savoy Hotel in London in 1991."He asked me to give him a massage," she told the BBC and Guardian, saying she was left "shaken" by the encounter.Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him.Ms Morris, now 44 and an exhibition organiser, is one of a number of women to accuse Weinstein of harassment.She told the BBC she did not remember all the details, but recalls her top coming off in the bedroom.Separately, UK police are investigating allegations about Weinstein from seven women - concerning incidents alleged to have taken place between the 1980s and 2015.Naked in the bath Ms Morris alleged that the harassment took place in 1991, on her first day working at Weinstein's company as an admin assistant.She said she was told to go to the Savoy Hotel - the location named by several women, including actress Kate Beckinsale, for where assaults allegedly took place."I remember sitting in the lounge area," said Ms Morris, who has waived her right to anonymity under sexual offences laws to speak to the BBC."I must have answered the phone a couple of times, shuffled some papers."She said Weinstein called her into the bathroom where he was naked in the bath, later asking her to give him a massage in the bedroom."He was basically lying naked on the bed," she said."And then I don't actually remember if I did touch him.But I was sitting sideways on the bed and I remember my top coming off."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption (L-R) Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Lea Seydoux, Rosanna Arquette, Mira Sorvino More than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Weinstein - ranging from rape to sexual harassment - including celebrities Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow.Ms Morris said she was in a "state of disbelief" after the alleged incident - she later reported it to a friend's boyfriend, a policeman, and was given a case number.A few weeks later, she said she received a call from a person requesting that Weinstein speak to her - which left her "panicked".Police inquiries She said: "The person I was speaking to - I sort of think they said to me - do I want to drop the case and I said yes."The Metropolitan Police has said it was making inquiries into the alleged incident, but that it relied on paper records in 1991 - which are generally destroyed after seven years.Ms Morris said she assumes that the police looked into her report, but added: "I suppose the fact I dropped the case all that time ago.I might never know."Ms Morris said she intends to speak to police again about her claims.She now thinks the UK police should "do something" about allegations being made against the Hollywood producer, saying: "Nothing will change and he will get away with it."The Met said no arrests have been made over any of the allegations at this stage.

The Great British Bake Off 2017: Meet the finalists:::::Image copyright Channel 4 Image caption Kate, Steven and Sophie will do battle in the Bake Off final This year's Great British Bake Off reaches its climax later, with three bakers left to do battle for the prize.Whoever wins, perhaps the biggest winners will be Channel 4 and the new line-up of presenters and judges, who have won over doubters after the show's move from BBC One.So far, around nine million people have tuned in to each episode - down on BBC One's figures, but great by Channel 4 standards.If the final attracts more than 10 million, it will be the most-watched show on Channel 4 since 1995.Here's a closer look at the last bakers standing: Steven Carter-Bailey Image copyright Channel 4 The marketing professional looked like he would run away with the contest in the early weeks, but his spectacular creations have been peppered with some conspicuous slip-ups.Which side of Steven will we see in the final?Highlight: His intricate biscuit chessboard in week two helped earn him the star baker title for the second week out of two.He also went on to gain the accolade once more during the series.It was almost too good - leading some people to suspect he had secret professional baking experience.Biggest disaster: His meringue hot-air balloon failed to hit the heights in the semi-final - the layers of coloured meringue cracked under the weight and the chocolate basket melted."Just looking at that, I would think it was a tree," Prue said."A psychedelic tree," Noel chipped in.Sophie Faldo Image copyright Channel 4 An ever-calm former Royal Artillery officer and trainee stuntwoman, Sophie's been the most consistent performer - star baker twice and never really in danger of being booted out of the tent.Probably the favourite to win.Highlight: The flawless raspberry, yuzu and white chocolate buche trifle terrine in pudding week earned rave reviews and a star baker title.Paul remarked: "If you walked into a Michelin-starred restaurant and had that, you wouldn't argue."Biggest disaster: The closest she's come to disaster was probably with her Jaffa millionaire shortbreads in caramel week, when she ran out of time and some of her creations collapsed."They look hideous," Paul chided, before offering consolation: "But they taste amazing."Kate Lyon Image copyright Channel 4 The health and safety inspector from Merseyside - a blacksmith, furniture restorer and yoga enthusiast in her spare time - has had a rollercoaster ride, narrowly surviving on a few occasions while pulling off some triumphs on others.She must be the outsider to win.Highlight: Her sticky toffee apple caramel cake in week four, topped with its explosion of coloured spun sugar fireworks, was a work of art.And it tasted good - Prue even asked her for the recipe, saying: "I have got to know how to make that cake."Biggest disaster: "I've just chopped the end of my finger off... on the fan" the 29-year-old exclaimed in Italian week.After being treated by medics, she was able to continue but things didn't get much better - her pizza dough fell apart as she put it in the oven.She wanted to put it in the bin instead of on the table to be judged - and probably should have done, given how unimpressed Paul was by the still-raw dough.The Great British Bake Off final is at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Burberry's Christopher Bailey to leave at end of 2018:::::Image copyright Getty Images Burberry's chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, is leaving the FTSE 100 fashion firm after 17 years.It gave no explanation for the departure but said he will leave next year.Mr Bailey, 46, was chief executive of Burberry from 2014 until July, when he moved to his current role.Although his decision to leave "was not an easy one", he said he was "excited to pursue new creative projects".After joining from Gucci in 2001, Mr Bailey worked with former chief executives Rose Marie Bravo and Angela Ahrendts to make Burberry's camel, red and black check designs into must-haves items for fashionistas around the world.However, his tenure as chief executive following Ms Ahrents' decision to join Apple, was less successful and was unpopular with shareholders.On the day when Burberry announced Ms Bailey was stepping aside, shares jumped 8%.Cost-saving drive His pay, as well as those of other Burberry directors, was a controversial issue with investors.Image copyright Getty Images In leaving, he is giving up his right to shares worth 16m, some of which he was granted when he became chief executive in 2014 - an award which more than half of shareholders voted against - which have not yet been fully taken.This summer, shareholders were again unhappy with the rewards proposed by the company.A third of shareholders voted against proposed remuneration that included a 5.4m award for Mr Bailey.He was granted 3.5m instead.This financial year he stands to make 7.6m, including share awards which will vest this year.The company is in the middle of a cost-saving drive and wants to save at least 100m by 2019.Mr Bailey's exit will allow chief executive Marco Gobbetti, who joined from upmarket label Celine last year, to revamp Burberry's creative direction as well as its operations, analysts said."Burberry ... has become somewhat predictable and deja vu," Exane BNP Paribas said.For the three months to June, Burberry's retail sales rose 4% to 478m, with double-digit growth in China.The jump came after Burberry reported a fall in annual profits for 2016-17.Shares fell 1% to 19.02, but have risen almost 30% in the past 12 months.

Why are people angry about Kevin Spacey coming out?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kevin Spacey at the European premiere of Baby Driver in London earlier this year If Kevin Spacey had come out as gay a year ago, the reactions would've been very different to those seen on Monday.For starters, he almost certainly would have been congratulated - a Hollywood A-lister publicly coming out in a world where being gay is considered by many to damage ticket sales.But the House of Cards actor only came out in the wake of accusations that he made a sexual advance towards a male child actor in 1986.Anthony Rapp, who was 14 at the time, told BuzzFeed that Spacey invited him to a party and seemed drunk when the alleged incident happened.The actor apologised in a statement posted on Twitter, writing: "This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life...I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose to now live as a gay man."But he's since been criticised for choosing this moment to come out - and some have accused him of using his sexuality as a shield to deflect the negative publicity the allegations have sparked."He doesn't get a pass just because he's gay," says Josh Rivers, the newly-appointed editor of Gay Times.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anthony Rapp says the alleged encounter with Kevin Spacey happened in the 1980s "Alleged predatory behaviour is bad behaviour regardless of your sexuality."Kevin Spacey has chosen the incorrect moment to assert his sexuality, particularly in this situation where he's being accused of something quite egregious."Linda Riley, publisher of Diva magazine and co-founder of the British LGBT Awards, says it was "disappointing" that the actor chose this moment to come out, adding: "I felt it was deflecting from the allegations."There's been so many times he could've come out in the past and he hasn't.That's his choice but he should've used this time to own the apology, and so to make it about himself instead was disgusting, basically."She adds: "I find this whole statement quite manipulative if I'm honest, he's tried to acknowledge what he's done, but used the fact he's gay as subterfuge."But Benjamin Cohen, CEO of PinkNews, points out: "I don't think Kevin Spacey could've done anything but come out [after the allegation was made].Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Filmmaker and author Carol Gould: Kevin Spacey has "upset" a lot of people "But it's unfortunate he ended up having to come out at the same time as responding to quite serious allegations of inappropriate conduct towards someone who was just 14 at the time.""Clearly there's two stories now," Cohen continues."One is 'Big star Kevin Spacey comes out', and the other one is 'Kevin Spacey accused of sexual misconduct in the 1980s"."And I think it's unfortunate that the way he's responded to that means the two issues are kind of conflated."Spacey's statement, which was published late on Sunday evening, sparked a similar reaction on social media - and not just from the LGBT community.Skip Twitter post by @AshleeMPreston I'm not interested in Kevin Spacey being gay.I'm curious as to why we're conflating sexuality w/ the molestation of a minor.Stay on topic Ashlee Marie Preston (@AshleeMPreston) October 30, 2017 Report Skip Twitter post by @sueperkins Well done Kev.You stay silent on your sexuality until the time comes when you can conflate it with an alleged sexual assault on a minor.Sue Perkins (@sueperkins) October 30, 2017 Report Skip Twitter post by @rilaws Coming out as a gay man is not the same thing as coming out as someone who preyed on a 14-year-old.Conflating those things is disgusting Richard Lawson (@rilaws) October 30, 2017 Report Rivers says: "I think the [LGBT] community is understandably upset that he's managed to conflate these two things, it does seem like a deflection technique."There are already people who suggest that homosexuality and paedophilia are linked, and we know they're not, but this statement doesn't do anything to rubbish that.""Homophobes will use any excuse they're given, so no it's not helpful that he's made it so easy for them to use this against us as a community to kind of reinforce these bigoted views that they have."Many have expressed their disappointment that the actor decided against coming out earlier in his career.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Spacey and Robin Wright star in Netflix's House of Cards "I think it would've been a brilliant story," Cohen says, "particularly because of his current big role in House of Cards.""It would've been an interesting opportunity to have someone in a big mainstream US TV show coming out, it would've been a very positive thing to do, but obviously that wasn't what happened."Riley thinks if Spacey had come out sooner "he would've been lauded"."It's great for LGBT actors to be able to say they're gay and have it be no big deal.More and more they're coming out, every day.So I don't think there would've been a huge backlash to his career, there are plenty of successful LGBT actors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Spacey received a special Olivier award in 2015 for his contribution to British theatre Instead, Rivers says, he's now facing a wave of criticism."We as a community have become acutely attuned to these types of manipulations and deflections, and we can't stand for it," he says.Riley adds: "So many of us who are LGBT have sacrificed so much in our lives to come out, and it's been quite a courageous thing to do, so coming out should be associated with an act of courage, not deflection."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Play it again: The firm saving vinyl:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How a small company in the Czech Republic became the world's largest maker of vinyl records Whether gathering dust in your loft or currently spinning on your turntable, it's a fair bet that at least some of your vinyl records came from a small factory in the Czech Republic.The facility in question is the headquarters of GZ Media, based in the small town of Lodenice, 25km (16 miles) west of the Czech capital, Prague.GZ is today the world's largest producer of vinyl records, of which it expects to press 30 million this year, for everyone from the Rolling Stones and U2, to Lady Gaga and Madonna.The success of the company is a far cry from the early 1990s, when vinyl records appeared to be on the way out, with music fans having switched en masse to compact discs.Back in the early 1970s more than three-quarters of album sales were on vinyl, but by the 1990s that had plunged to just 1.5%.Image caption Producing vinyl records is a multi-step process "In 1993 our output was at its lowest, vinyl was almost dead," says GZ's chief executive Michal Sterba."If we'd have stayed as a vinyl-only producer in the 90s, GZ would be no more."The operation had only become a private company two years earlier after the fall of communism.Prior to that it had been a state-run enterprise called Gramofonove Zavody (Gramophone Record Factory) which had started in 1951, and had pressed records for the world's largest music companies.With demand for vinyl having dwindled, GZ realised that it had to diversify to survive, so it branched out into printing and making packaging for consumer goods.Image caption Michal Sterba is now expanding GZ, with new sister factories in the US and Canada Crucially though, it kept pressing vinyl to satisfy what little demand there was.At the lowest point in 1993 it made just 350,000 discs."We wanted to be the last company standing in the field of vinyl record production," says Mr Sterba.So when the resurgence of vinyl began around 2010, GZ was in a position to take advantage of it.Unlike most rivals, GZ still had the vinyl-making equipment and the expertise.Its successful diversification also gave it the cash to invest.Image caption The company has also seen a rising demand for picture discs Mr Sterba says: "Our competitors could buy machinery and materials, but the know-how is very hard to acquire."The firm's printing and packing capabilities give it another advantage over its rivals, he adds: "As well as producing the actual vinyl discs, GZ also makes the packaging, prints the artwork and any extras such as posters or booklet."One particularly tough job, he recalls, was producing a real metal zip on the cover of the reissued Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album.How vinyl records are made The original music, on tape or a digital file, is transferred to a diamond-tipped cutter This cuts a groove of the music into a steel disc coated in a layer of copper just 100 microns thick This master disc is then placed into a solution of nickel salt though which an electric current flows.This forms a layer of nickel on top of the copper The nickel layer is then peeled off, and has ridges that are a mirror image of the grooves on the master disk.This nickel plate forms the "stamper" that will imprint the vinyl Next the vinyl compound (a type of plastic) is heated to 160C, and the stamper is pressed into it with the weight of more than 100 tonnes, to produce one side of a vinyl record To keep up with demand, GZ Media's Czech factory now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and employs 1,600 permanent workers.It's a fast-paced operation at every stage of the production process; from the initial stamping to the high-speed ballet of forklifts loading trucks for delivery.The company has invested $20m in equipment, building 12 new presses, but the old still runs alongside the new.Image caption GZ's Czech factory has a permanent workforce of 1,600 plus 400 seasonal workers Bright white, computer-controlled stations sit next to their huge, pale-green iron counterparts, still dripping oil into trays and buckets.GZ's revenues this year are expected to total $110m (83m), and are growing by 9-10% per year.Meanwhile, its vinyl output has tripled since 2010.For the industry as a whole, global sales of vinyl records are expected to reach $1bn in value this year.This may be just 6% of total music industry revenues but vinyl sales are now at a 25-year high.With most of its customers in North America, GZ recently bought a vinyl plant in Memphis, Tennessee, to supplement its Czech production.It has also opened a production facility in Ontario, Canada.Image caption Staff at the factory listen to the records to test them GZ still makes albums for small indie bands - the punk and metal bands that kept the company going in the 1990s, but now it also works with massive global stars."We'll still press 100 records for a small metal band," says Mr Sterba, "but we're also pressing 100,000 for U2.""As for the future," he says, "we're concentrating on making a success of our plants in North America.But in the longer term, we think manufacturing in Asia and preferably Japan [as well], is the right thing to do."This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Yet, while vinyl sales are growing, some who buy the records don't actually play them.Last year a BBC/ICM poll found 48% of those questioned said they'd never played the vinyl they'd bought and 7% said they didn't even own a turntable.These fans buy a vinyl album for the "feel" of owning a physical object and for the artwork that often comes with it - but they never actually play it.Image caption Staff at GZ had to add a real metal zip to the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers While vinyl sales are growing, they remain tiny compared with their 1980s heyday, says Paul Lee, a music industry expert at accountancy group Deloitte."Vinyl's first and biggest peak was back in the 80s when a billion records, just albums were sold per year.This year we're expecting about 40 million, so it's about one 25th... so it is nothing like that we had back in the 80s."Image caption The company can make vinyl records in any colour Mr Lee adds: "The reality is vinyl is a lovely product, it's also very difficult to consume compared to just tapping in the name of a song on a smart phone... so we would expect the market to be approaching a peak."Yet with music giant Sony announcing earlier this year that it was to re-open its vinyl manufacturing plant in Japan for the first time since 1989, it doesn't look like the vinyl revival is coming to an end any time soon.
We went to watch BBC's new pop show, Sounds Like Friday Night, and this is what happened:::::Image caption Jason Derulo, Greg James, Jessie Ware, Charlie Puth, Dotty and guitarist wrap up the first episode of SLFN "I cannot stress it enough: this is a gig."Warm-up man Stuart Holdham is laying the ground rules for the studio audience at Sounds Like Friday Night, a brand new pop show on BBC One."Don't clap along to the music because you should be dancing," he continues."And if I see any dad dancing, you'll be removed from the studio, driven to Manchester and forced to watch six hours of Jeremy Kyle."For all of his humour, there's no mistaking it: this is a big deal for the BBC.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jessie Ware performs Alone on Sounds Like Friday Night Since Top of the Pops and CD:UK died in 2006, there hasn't been a dedicated pop programme on mainstream TV.It has become industry consensus that audiences don't want to see live music in their living room.That's why, X Factor aside, pop bands have had to fight for slots at the end of The One Show or the end of Graham Norton.Always at the end.Always as the credits roll.So Sounds Like Friday Night is something of a gamble.(A gamble which bizarrely, and perhaps unintentionally, borrows its title from a short-lived Leo Sayer show in 1978.)Image caption Greg James and Dotty: "It felt like this was a confident start" "It's a truly remarkable thing," says host Greg James, a couple of days before the programme launches."The BBC have gone, 'Do you know what?Let's do a live music show and put it on BBC One!'"He says he's "obviously very nervous" at launching a new programme, but "I don't feel it's something I can't do"."It's not rocket science.It's a half-hour show with some great music and some fun bits that people can hopefully sit down at the end of the week and enjoy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jason Derulo performs If I'm Lucky on Sounds Like Friday Night Ah yes, the "fun bits".This is what stops #SLFN (as it's known on social media) being a mere reboot of Top of the Pops.The chart countdown has been consigned to the dustbin, and the show is peppered with sketches and interviews, which are instantly available to share on YouTube and social media."It's a lot more than music performances," says James's co-host Dotty."We're hoping we can create moments that live outside of the show."How did it do in the ratings?Sounds Like Friday Night had an average audience of 2.2 million viewers for its first show - lower than average for that timeslot, but respectable for a new show.It has been given a challenging slot, pitting it against ITV's Coronation Street - which attracts an average audience of 6.8 million viewers.A Question of Sport, which regularly takes the same slot on BBC One, averages three million viewers per episode.Top of the Pops, which was also scheduled against Friday night's episode of Coronation Street towards the end of its 42-year run, attracted an average of 2.4 million viewers to its last four episodes on BBC One.However, the BBC has avoided setting a public target for Sounds Like Friday Night's viewing figures.Instead, it hopes the show will have a "second life" on social media, with clips and sketches being shared on YouTube and the BBC iPlayer for weeks after the initial broadcast.The template is Adele's successful "At The BBC" show, which mixed chat and performances with a sketch in which the star auditioned as an Adele impersonator.That clip has been watched more than 82 million times on YouTube.Record labels will be watching sales and streaming figures on Saturday to see whether SLFN's first guests - Jason Derulo, Charlie Puth and Jessie Ware - receive a similar boost from their appearance on the programme.But whatever happens, music fans are eager for a new pop show.The studio audience for the first episode came not just from the UK but from Sweden, Germany, and even the US.Image caption Music fans Dan, from Devon, and Brooke, from Rhode Island, were amongst the studio audience "I watched Top of the Pops growing up," said Dan Law, who travelled from Devon to be first in the queue."It was a shame when it ended, but this seems like a class show.I think it's a modern way of looking at music.""Everyone likes music," said Brooke, originally from Rhode Island, "so it's fun to add the comedy and things to it"."It's a different kind of entertainment," agreed Ozlem Halibryam and Khadijah Ahmed, two Charlie Puth fans who were "too young" to remember the original Top Of The Pops."I think it's a nice way to chill on a Friday night," added Ahmed."I think it would be good to have more shows like this, more often."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlie Puth performs How Long on Sounds Like Friday Night Inside Television Centre's Studio One, the audience were greeted by a vast, multi-storey coliseum that appeared to have been borrowed from a steampunk production of West Side Story.The fans screamed when Derulo swivelled his hips and swooned when Jessie Ware sang her lush ballad Alone.But the sketches were more divisive.A clip in which Foo Fighters star Dave Grohl impersonated a BBC One continuity announcer was met with befuddled silence.Better received was a sketch featuring Jason Derulo's attempts to play basketball while being pelted with tennis balls - but even that dragged on too long.In the end, the audience just wanted music (this was a gig, after all) and enthusiastically joined in with Derulo's acoustic rendition of Want To Want Me at the end of the show.Reaction to the first show: After the credits rolled, James turned his back to the camera and let out a huge sigh of relief as he hugged Jessie Ware."We'll watch it back and I'm sure there'll be loads of things we'll change," he said backstage, "but in the studio it felt great."Dotty was similarly relieved - despite realising 10 minutes into the show that she hadn't taken the label off her brand new jeans."You can walk through these things and get your bearings in the studio, but there is nothing like when you're live and there's an audience there.So it was insane.""The thing I'm really proud of is it felt like it was a confident start," added James."We did not want to apologise for doing a show like this.There's no reason why these enormous artists shouldn't have a home on TV."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One Direction star Liam Payne hosts next week's episode Future episodes will feature Liam Gallagher, Demi Lovato, Plan B, London Grammar Loyle Carner and Liam Payne (who tells the BBC he'll "do a song on there that I've not done before") .But who would be the host's ideal musical guest?"Obviously Swifty, if we can get her out of that kebab shop," laughs James, referring to Taylor Swift, who filmed a music video in a London cafe earlier this week."And Liam Gallagher will be incredible next week," says Dotty."But nothing's off limits."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Ghostwatch: The BBC spoof that duped a nation:::::Image caption Ghostwatch's creators wanted to break television boundaries - but they did not predict its impact on viewers It was billed as a drama, but many of Ghostwatch's 11 million viewers were taken in by the BBC's fake investigation, which in one tragic case led to a teenager taking his own life.On its 25th anniversary, his parents and the creator of the show talk about its impact.It's Halloween night in 1992, and families across the UK are excitedly huddled around the television.Saturday night TV is at its peak - Gladiators has just premiered on ITV, Casualty is enjoying its seventh series and Noel's House Party is pulling in 15 million viewers a week.But tonight's big draw is the BBC's heavily-promoted Ghostwatch, a supposedly "live" investigation into paranormal activity being recorded at a family home in Northolt, north-west London.The programme was the brainchild of horror writer Stephen Volk, who had originally conceived it as a spooky six-part drama, but who was instead asked by producer Ruth Baumgarten to create a 90-minute ghost story for the broadcaster's Screen One series."I said to her, 'why don't we do it instead as an investigation, a mystery story - pretending it's a live transmission from a haunted house?'," Volk recalls."I remember that moment very clearly, when she was really excited by that."Image copyright Denham family Image caption Martin Denham, pictured on his 18th birthday, "became entranced with talk of ghosts" Volk's idea was arguably visionary, years ahead of today's scripted reality TV shows, where the likes of The Only Way Is Essex routinely blur fact and fiction.The script went through numerous rewrites as TV executives continued to be confused by the concept."There was a lot of head-scratching and puzzlement when Baumgarten had meetings with people trying to explain what we were trying to do," he remembers."They didn't get it when they read it, why it was written in this peculiar way.They didn't understand how it was going to work."Image caption Michael Parkinson was among a host of familiar, trusted faces on the programme The team wanted to push the boundaries of reality even further.They didn't want it fronted by conventional actors - they wanted familiar and friendly TV personalities to bring the story to life.Michael Parkinson, one of the BBC's most trusted faces, was asked to present it.Alongside him was popular children's television presenter Sarah Greene, together with her husband, TV and radio host Mike Smith - a fact Volk calls a "happy accident"."It was offered to Sarah [initially] and Mike - I think - happened to read it over her shoulder and said "can I be in it [too]?'"I quickly thought, 'this is a real bonus'," says Volk.It was groundbreaking television in many ways - from the infra-red, heat-seeking camera used to "spot" ghostly activity to the pixellation of an interviewee's face.They also used videotape, instead of the typical 16mm film, to make it look more homemade.Though the production team wanted it to look realistic, shortly before its transmission the programme featured on the cover of the Radio Times, inside which it was explained it was a drama.But not everyone read the Radio Times.And when Ghostwatch aired at 21:25 GMT, there were consequences the corporation had not foreseen.Image caption The show centred on the fictional Early family, of Northolt, Greater London In Nottingham, April and Percy Denham were sitting down to watch the programme together with their sons, Martin 18, and Gavin, 14.The pair recalled how their elder son became more and more agitated throughout the broadcast."He sort of curled up while watching it.We asked if he was alright, but he seemed hypnotised by it," says Mrs Denham.Ghostwatch's viewers were invited into "the most haunted house in Britain", where Pamela Early and her two daughters were being spooked by a poltergeist.The nation was told a team of researchers had spent the last 10 months investigating the mysterious movements of a ghost named Pipes - so-called because it kept banging on the water pipes.In the studio, Parkinson urged viewers to phone in with their own ghost stories on 081 811 8181 - the standard number for BBC phone-ins at the time, used on shows including Crimewatch and Going Live!As Greene followed the paranormal activity around the house, the tension mounted and the Early family were subjected to increasingly terrifying experiences as the spirit of a dead man apparently entered the children.Image caption "Pipes" the ghost was filmed causing havoc in the suburban family home By the end of the show the ghost had "seized control" of the TV cameras.At the Early's house, paramedics and police were seen arriving, and Greene, who was trying to locate one of the possessed girls, disappeared into the blackness.Back in the studio, the floor was deserted apart from a dumbfounded Parkinson.But behind the scenes, the Ghostwatch production team were enjoying celebratory drinks as the programme aired."Ruth [Baumgarten] arrived with a white face and said the switchboard had been jammed at the BBC," Volk says."I kind of laughed lightly and she said very seriously, 'no, they really are jammed with people very irate'."That was a bit of a 'gulp' moment."Image caption Viewers were used to seeing Sarah Greene fronting children's television shows More than 20,000 people had tried to get through to Parkinson at one point during the programme.Many of the viewers were children, who had been left traumatised by what they thought they had witnessed."I think three women who were pregnant went into labour that evening," says Volk."A vicar phoned in to complain that even though he realised it wasn't real he thought the BBC had raised demonic forces."It was partly that it scared people, but the complaints were actually more that the BBC had made them feel like mugs."People felt the BBC was something they could trust, and the programme had destroyed that trust."In its wake, a tide of anger rose against the BBC, which received thousands of complaints.Image copyright Lesley Manning Image caption The Ghostwatch team were together as the programme aired, unaware of the reaction building around the country Meanwhile, in the days that followed the broadcast, the Denhams noticed a change in Martin.The radiators in their house had a habit of being noisy when warming up and Martin suddenly asked to move bedrooms, though he never explained why."He seemed entranced with the talk of ghosts," Mrs Denham remembers."He seemed a bit upset because things were happening at that time in the house that had been happening [on Ghostwatch].The pipes were banging," his stepfather adds.Five days after the broadcast, Martin killed himself.A note in his pocket, addressed to his mother, read: "If there is ghosts I will now be one and I will always be with you as one".The Denhams learned of his death when police came to their places of work."I went crackers," Mr Denham says."I started swearing.When I heard about the [contents of] the note, I knew it was that programme."Image caption Martin Denham had everything to live for, his parents say A judicial review the Denhams fought for led to an investigation by the Broadcasting Standards Commission, which concluded the corporation had "a duty to do more than simply hint at the deception it was practising on the audience".There had been a "deliberate attempt to cultivate a sense of menace", it added, and the BBC issued an apology.The passage of time has seen the Denhams's anger cool a little, although they do not watch BBC channels, or anything that features Michael Parkinson."There's nothing you can do.I've just let it go now, but it's still there," Martin's stepfather adds."It's still just one big mystery and he isn't here so I'm not able to ask him," Mrs Denham says."Martin was happy.He had never had any problems - he had got a girlfriend and a job and had got everything to live for."Even though he was a slow learner he had done well for himself.He had everything going for him and then it changed just like that."Image copyright Radio Times Image caption Ghostwatch was heavily promoted in the run-up to its broadcast Volk declined to comment on Martin's death out of respect for the family.But he says he had expected a very different reaction from viewers."I think it was 11 million that saw it and you can't think of all those people as individuals," he says."I was, I guess, writing for myself - aged between 12 and 14 - and I thought of myself watching and thinking, 'well this is interesting, I don't believe it, but I get that this is a drama done in a certain way'."That's the basis on which I thought most people would [see] it."There was a vast span of different reactions to it, from people who didn't believe it for a second and people who believed it all the way through, and everything in between."Image copyright Tom Parker Image caption Stephen Volk was awarded a BAFTA for his work in horror The aftermath meant the BBC distanced itself from Ghostwatch.Volk says he would have liked to have explained his intentions as a writer with the broadcaster far sooner than the anniversary DVD a decade later allowed."I think if the BBC had maybe not shut it down so completely, there might have been an attempt to have a conversation about it," he says.However, when 12-year-old viewers who saw it the first time revisited it 10 years later - in conjunction with the emergence of the internet - people openly started to discuss the programme."Suddenly we found a whole pile of people who did like it, they enjoyed it, thought it was challenging and all the things we wanted it to be," Volk says.He remains proud of Ghostwatch, the first project he did for television.Volk went on to write an episode of Ghosts for the BBC in 1995, created ITV series Afterlife starring Andrew Lincoln and Lesley Sharp, and was also behind the 2011 film The Awakening."The best result [was] people coming up and saying 'I had to sleep with the light on for three weeks but it got me into film-making' and some have said 'it got me into horror'," he says.However, he tends to agree with acclaimed author Ramsay Campbell on pushing the genre's boundaries."I'm a great believer in what he said about horror, and that is that horror is sometimes the business that goes too far."Additional reporting by Lisa Wright
Blue Planet II: 22 things to know about the new series:::::A year after the epic Planet Earth II, Sir David Attenborough is returning to our screens with a follow-up to 2001's Blue Planet.No spoilers, but we've seen the first episode and as sequels go we can confirm it's better than Sex And The City 2.We've also been to the press conference and spoken to some of the team behind the new series.Here are 22 things you need to know about Blue Planet II - complete with behind-the-boat info and what you can expect from the first episode.1.Five babies were born to crew members in the time it took to film.Blue Planet II involved "125 shoots, 6,000 hours filming underwater and 1,000 hours filming in submersibles", explains production manager Katie Hall.But away from the shoots, she adds, it was also a busy time for the crew: "We had three weddings.Four houses were bought.Five babies.Two babies on the way."That's what happens when you're filming for four years."2."Oceans cover 70% of the surface of our planet, and yet they are still the least explored," says Sir David Attenborough in the opening sequence."Hidden beneath the waves, there are creatures beyond our imagination," he continues.Roughly translated, we think he's saying: "Look, I know you might have seen Finding Dory multiple times but this is the real deal."3.Hans Zimmer is doing the music again.It's bad news for Fifth Harmony fans as the soundtrack has already been sorted by composer and general legend Hans Zimmer."We actually put the music out to tender, we weren't sure who we wanted to do it," explains executive producer James Honeyborne."And although we loved Planet Earth II [which Zimmer also did the soundtrack for] we wanted to keep this feeling fresh."But Hans came to us with such an impassioned pitch as to why he wanted to do it, which was incredible."4.There will be seven episodes in the series.And they're split into different habitats - like deep ocean, the coral reefs, the open ocean and the coastlines."Once you start dividing those up, you start to see where some of the stories would naturally fit," says James.5.We wouldn't fancy filling out the risk assessment form for this show."When we green light each shoot, we're constantly mitigating risk," says Katie."But bar a couple of earaches, a little bit of water at the bottom of a submersible, and one cameraman stubbed his finger, we were extraordinarily lucky."But the planning that goes into every single shoot, and managing the risk - whether that's financial risk or health and safety - you don't see any of that."Shame.6.There's some serious drama in the opening episode.Spoiler alert etc, etc.In the opening episode, we meet some birds.Who sometimes like to fly down to the ocean and chill out a bit on the surface.Unfortunately for them, there's some rather hungry giant trevallies (ie big scary fish) lurking under the water.And they have a particular taste for birds.We won't give much more away, but it's safe to say you're about to see some snakes and iguanas-level drama go down.7.Fish are Facebook-friendly.The trailer for the new series has already built up 43 million views on social media.Which is all part of a new digital strategy this year, according to Tom McDonald, who is (deep breath) head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History and Specialist Factual unit."One of the interesting things about Planet Earth II was that more people watched it than the X Factor results show when they were up against each other last year," he says."So if there is a younger audience out there that is going to consume natural history content, we should focus our digital strategy on them, which is what we've done this year."8.New technology was built to film the series."We built a huge piece of housing which we called the megadome which allowed us to slice the sea in half so you can see above and below at the same time," James says."We also built a tow-cam which can be pulled behind a boat which allowed us to travel with really fast-moving animals like dolphins and tuna."9.They've brought back those 'making of' segments at the end of the episodes.Remember on Planet Earth II, you'd get 50 minutes worth of TV show, and then 10 minutes of how the episode you've just seen was shot?Half the time, the "making of" bit was even more interesting and eventful than the show itself.Well, they've brought that bit back - and this series will have a segment called Into The Blue at the end of each instalment.10.There's some stuff in the series that even Sir David Actual Attenborough didn't know about."When we first showed him some clips, he was like, 'Oh I didn't know this' and 'I didn't know that'," James says."Genuinely he was surprised.It's always good if you can surprise David, it doesn't happen often."11.One Walrus has clearly been watching Titanic.At one point in the first episode, a walrus tries to seek refuge from a preying polar bear on a floating iceberg.Problem is, there are already some walruses (walri?)on said berg.Clearly, this walrus watched Titanic, and, like the rest of us, thought there was plenty of room for Kate Winslet to shift over and make room for Leonardo DiCaprio on that piece of wood.Unfortunately, the extra weight of this particular walrus on this particular iceberg causes it to collapse, ruining the party for everybody (there's always one).12.Bottle-nosed dolphins are super-cute They just look so friendly don't they, you'd definitely go for a drink with one.13.Dolphins surf, Sir David explains, "to strengthen friendships, develop social skills, and for the sheer exhilaration of it".Coincidentally, this is also why humans do karaoke.14.The show doesn't shy away from the impact of pollution."You can't go out there and make a series like this without seeing some really big issues unfolding in front of you," says James."You can go to the middle of the ocean and find plastics from many different continents coming together."The impact that has on the wildlife can be devastating."In the show, we hear Sir David comment: "There are worrying signs that conditions in the oceans that have remained relatively stable for millennia, are changing radically."15.Warning: The first episode includes "mating".In case you're planning to watch with your parents.Fortunately, the mating involves this handsome chap.16.Some shots weren't filmed on location.Earlier this week, The Guardian said some footage had been captured in "controlled laboratory conditions".After the report was published, James explained the series was overwhelmingly shot on location, but in a few select instances, such as rock pools in the Coasts episode, labs were used."Filming in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife," he said."It would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab."17.It wasn't originally going to be called Blue Planet II."The series was commissioned as Oceans," explains Tom."It was a very easy commission, instinctively the channel understood it was a brilliant thing to do and it felt like it was the right time to go back to this habitat."It was never designed so that we'd have Planet Earth II last year and Blue Planet II this year, so now it looks like it was a brilliant strategy, but it wasn't exactly conceived that way."18.Tusk fish are determined little creatures.There is one tusk fish who travels to the edge of the coral reef every morning, Sir David explains, looking for some breakfast.While most of us would grab some Special K from the cupboard, this guy travels quite some distance in search of a small clam.Using his mouth, he takes it back to his "kitchen" - which is essentially a massive rock, against which he starts bashing the clam repeatedly in order to crack it open."It's not easy when you have no hands," Sir David observes.19.Not all of the plans for the series came off."There were lots of shoots that failed, to put it bluntly," says Tom."The team set out to capture particular species, and when you watch this, I think James and his team make it look really easy."And when I think about the number of variables when it comes to filming in the ocean, I think it's remarkable what they were able to capture."20.In true W1A style, the show has led to more collaborative BBC working."Some of the new technologies that were invented specifically for this series are already being deployed by the Natural History Unit on future projects," says Tom.James adds: "There was a sequence on The One Show last week about sturgeon [not Nicola], and they borrowed our probe lens, which is great - we built it, they were able to use it."21.There's going to be a podcast to accompany the series.So make sure you're all caught-up on Serial.22.So...Planet Earth II.Blue Planet II.What's next?"We have a big landmark series for next year which is very different to Blue Planet II," says Tom."It's been announced already, it's called Dynasty, not to be confused with Carringtons and Colbys, so who knows if it will stay that title."But the premise of each film is we take one animal family and follow them for a number of years to see the ups and downs of their family lines."I'm already viewing episodes of it, and it's incredibly visceral.It feels so different to this."There's more."One other thing I'm really excited about is a series the NHU have made which is on in January called Animals With Cameras, a really simple proposition."We've built bespoke cameras for different species, that the animals wear, so we can see the world from an animal's point of view."There's meerkats in it," he adds."That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats."Blue Planet II begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Sunday.The series has been sold to more than 30 countries around the world.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
How Lee Child is breaking cover on Jack Reacher secrets:::::Image copyright Axel Dupeux Image caption Lee Child is writing his 23rd Jack Reacher thriller In a New York apartment offering spectacular views of Central Park, Lee Child, author of the Jack Reacher novels, stares out at a brick wall.The positioning of his writing room is a typically disciplined move from the Birmingham-raised author, who in the 1990s faced up to redundancy from Granada TV by writing a novel.Twenty-three years on from Killing Floor - the first Jack Reacher story - his thrillers are a publishing phenomenon, dominating the fiction charts, sparking film adaptations starring Tom Cruise, and enthralling millions of fans.For the BBC World Service In the Studio series, Child allowed access to his writing room to record the first three days' work on his next novel - which he revealed will be titled Yesterday and will fill in some of the intriguing gaps surrounding Reacher's father.Image copyright Transworld Image caption Tom Cruise starred in the 2016 movie version of Never Go Back while No Middle Name was a collection of mainly Reacher novellas Child's latest novel will begin differently from his previous releases.The all-important first paragraphs, he says, will depart from his famously clipped style.He says he will let the words breathe with a longer than usual introductory sentence marking the end of summer, the migration of birds and a list of States charting Reacher's planned diagonal journey across America.Then a five-word hook - "He didn't get very far" - drags the reader back into his dangerous world.The novel will be the 23rd Reacher adventure, after the release of The Midnight Line in November 2017."Someone like me is never going to win the Nobel prize this is not admired literature, this is entertainment," says Child."A novel has a huge number of competitors now - the internet, video games, streaming movies."I'm trying to visualise a 25-year-old person somewhere in the world."They have a lot of choices and the book has to earn its place.You've got to suck them into that story."Image caption Lee Child keeps some crucial reference books to hand Child's willingness to expose a work in progress is rare among authors.When asked why he's prepared to take questions from a radio journalist while he's concentrating on writing, his answer suggests that, as one of the world's best-selling authors, he feels a little like an ambassador for the popular."People who do literary fiction well, I know some of them.They are delightful, smart people with absolutely no issues at all about what I'm doing," he says."It tends to be the kind of third-rate people or some of the second-rate critics that get all sniffy about it.This is a way of saying: 'Yeah - shut up.'"Paternal theme By day two, Child has reworked his opening paragraph enough to provide a launch pad for the rest of the novel.There will be a contemplative tone, he says.But despite the paternal theme he resists the suggestion he's been influenced by the death of his own father in 2016.Image caption Child aims to write around 1,500 words every day during a writing phase With his opening paragraph locked, he now begins a free-wheeling descent into the plot, which could seem a terrifying way to work for novelists who are used to story charts and planned character arcs.With little idea where his story is heading, Child says he feels like a movie stuntman on the ledge of a tall building."What I have to do is fall off, and I'm hoping that the movie crew is going to manoeuvre the safety airbag into position at the side of the landing just in time."I hope to land softly, but I cannot guarantee that right now."Fittingly for the creator of no-nonsense ex-military cop Reacher, Child is keen to suggest that while he wants to defend his genre, he does not want to sound pretentious.He has an audience, and he wants to give them as fun a ride as possible.As a writer of thrillers, he may never be embraced by some literary critics.But he believes well-crafted popular fiction serves a profound purpose, rooted in our earliest history."At some point we began telling stories about things that had not happened," he explains."This made people feel emboldened or empowered and just a little bit more self-confident, which would help them survive."You are shown the edge of the cliff, but you're told you don't have to fall off."In the Studio with Lee Child can be heard on the BBC World Service at 11:30 GMT on 31 October.Yesterday is due for publication at the end of 2018.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
